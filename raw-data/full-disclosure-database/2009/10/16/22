   the international security industry will get together share        
   best practices and technology - will be held in downtown           
   Vancouver at the the Sheraton Wall Centre on March 22-26,          
   2010. The most significant new discoveries about computer

   The CanSecWest meeting provides international researchers a        
   relaxed, comfortable environment to learn from informative         
   tutorials on key developments in security technology, and

   world's most scenic cities - a short drive away from one of        
   North America's top skiing areas.

   application excercises to maximize information transfer.           
                                                                      
   We would like to announce the opportunity to submit papers,        
   and/or lightning talk proposals for selection by the               
   CanSecWest technical review committee. This year we will be        
   doing one hour talks, and some shorter talk sessions.              
                                                                      
   Please make your paper proposal submissions before November        
   30th, 2009.                                                        
                                                                      
   Some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited number      
   of speaking slots are still available. The conference is           
   responsible for travel and accomodations for the speakers. If      
   you have a proposal for a tutorial session then please make        
   your submission using our new online form, available at            
   https://cansecwest.com/submissions/. If the on-line form is        
   not available you can alternatively email a synopsis of the        
   material and your biography, papers and, speaking background       
   to secwest09 [at] cansecwest.com . Only slides will be needed      
   for the March paper deadline, full text does not have to be        
   submitted - but will be accepted if available. This year we        
   will be opening up the presentation guidelines to include          
   talks not in English which we will offer to translate for
   the speaker if they are not a native English speaker.                                                   
                                                                      
   The CanSecWest 2010 conference consists of tutorials on            
   technical details about current issues, innovative techniques      
   and best practices in the information security realm. The          
   audiences are a multi-national mix of professionals involved       
   on a daily basis with security work: security product              
   vendors, programmers, security officers, and network               
   administrators. We give preference to technical details and        
   new education for a technical audience.                            
                                                                      
   The conference itself is a single track series of                  
   presentations in a lecture theater environment. The                
   presentations offer speakers the opportunity to showcase           
   on-going research and collaborate with peers while educating       
   and highlighting advancements in security products and             
   techniques. The focus is on innovation, tutorials, and             
   education instead of product pitches. Some commercial content      
   is tolerated, but it needs to be backed up by a technical          
   presenter - either giving a valuable tutorial and best             
   practices instruction or detailing significant new technology      
   in the products.

       origin/passport) and contact info (e-mail, postal
