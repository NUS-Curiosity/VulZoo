I'd also like to go ahead here and publish information regards
Michael Faulkner.

He is the warez downloading guy from Dallas, Texas. Crydon, CygonX.
He has a pretty big melt down. And we at n3td3v are laughing,
because we hate criminals.

You know this guy is guilty as hell and he's squirming...
The FBI "played dirty" with him so he would go into verbal
vomit mode. Now the US Attorney get his juicy statements. :)
