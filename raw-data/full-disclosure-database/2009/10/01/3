Subject: Microsuck delaying patch for SMB2 on purpose?

A new exploit for the _Smb2ValidateProviderCallback() function has been
released by the same person who created the Denial of Service exploit,
except this one is able to execute code remotely. It seems that ms is sort
of delaying the quick fix for this exploit. Whats even sadder is that they
knew about it when they developed windows 7 but didn't care to patch windows
vista.  If they dont release a patch soon, viruses will be all over the
internet...
