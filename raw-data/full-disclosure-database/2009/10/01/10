Subject: Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities on
	Internet Explorer 8

Microsoft has released Internet Explorer 8 on March 19, 2009 and up to now
there's no reliable method to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on
it?

I mean, on IE6 and IE7 we had SkyLined heap spray technique, first seen in
the IFRAME overflow exploit [1] which have been used by almost every IE
memory corruption exploit so far. Internet Explorer 8 was enhanced with DEP
and ASLR protections, making heap spray useless. Then Mark Dowd and
Alexander Sotirov published their great paper - Bypassing Browser Memory
Protections [2] providing some excellent techniques, mainly the .NET binary
technique which bypasses DEP and ASLR which was used by Nils on the latest
Pwn2Own to own Internet Explorer 8 RC (Release Candidate) [3] and was used
to mass-exploit other vulnerabilities [4]. One day after Nils owned IE8RC,
Microsoft released Internet Explorer 8 RTM and blocked the option to load
.NET DLL’s from Internet zone and Restricted sites zone. Due to the fact
that most of IE exploitation doesn’t occur in Intranet/Trusted sites/Local
machine zone, this makes the .NET DLL technique irrelevant most of the
times.
So my question is - Is there no reliable method to exploit memory corruption
vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer 8?
