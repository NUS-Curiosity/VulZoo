*** ABOUT ******************************
THOTCON (pronounced \ˈthȯt\ and taken from THree - One - Two) is a new 
small venue hacking conference based in Chicago IL, USA. This is a 
non-profit, non-commercial event looking to provide the best conference 
possible on a very limited budget.

*** WHEN / WHERE ***********************
The conference will be held in Chicago, IL USA on April 23, 2010.

It will be held at a location only to be disclosed to attendees and 
speakers during the week before the event. It WILL be in the City of 
Chicago and close to a CTA train stop, accessible by bus, and cab.

*** FORMAT *****************************
The event will be a single track.

There will be eight (8) 45 minute talks selected. We will also fill 
spots between talk with MICROBLOX (quick 12.5 minute talks on a very 
focused topic) or INFOBLOX (5 minute infomercials on a project you are 
working on).

Topics we are interested in: retro computing, forensics, robotics, 
physical security, 0-days, application hacking, wireless, malware 
development/research, hacker spaces, The Muppets, zombies, attack 
detection, the number 7, online game hacking, consumer device hacking, 
beer, hacking Olympic bids [using Oprahsploit], and bananas [foster].

*** SPEAKER PERKS **********************
Speakers will be given free admission to the conference as well as one 
(1) free attendee badge (to bring a guest). In addition, speakers who 
give their presentation as planned, will be given a THOTCON life-time 
attendance badge. This means you will be given free entry to every 
future THOTCON event for life.

You will also have access to the THOTCON VIP Lounge. This means you will 
have access to free stuff and other highly discounted stuff all day. We 
don't have anything else to give, except you can tell your mom and your 
friend you spoke at the first THOTCON.

*** HOW TO SUBMIT **********************
If you are interested in speaking at this event, please send your 
completed speaker application <http://www.thotcon.org/cfp.html> to

talks. We anticipate having all speakers selected by Feb 1, 2010.
