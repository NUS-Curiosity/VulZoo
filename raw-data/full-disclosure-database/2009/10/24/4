Subject: [US-1984-1] JTTF (Joint Terrorism Task Force) and
	Fusion Center. Common Sense.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The PATRIOT act is a bill that has been rushed through congress. 
Our impulse reactions to a single attack caused up to jump and hug 
the leg of an explosively intrusive government who feels they have 
the right to judge, sift through and develop conspiracy theories on 
people. Because of the lack of oversight, it's difficult to uncover 
the abuses done. And who do you hold accountable when the 
government harasses you?

How on Earth can a local cop possibly understand the rigid 
complexities of being a domestic intelligence officer? How can we 
hold them accountable when they're mistakes, inefficiencies and 
malice is secret?

66 JTTF's in the US proactively harassing and profiling innocent 
people. We know full well  this is an unnecessary force that 
undermines democracy and free though. This isn't about thwarting 
terrorism to them, because that's rarely the affect, it's about 
concentration of power and diluting the constituion and having 
hitlists on innocent people.

I have a colleague of mine who works in the California Highway 
Patrol intelligence division and he says when they find child porn, 
they keep it in there as "evidence". And since the police are 
fraternal and protect each other (code of silence) they make no 
effort to log each other's views or accessing documents. It quite 
literally is cryptoanarchy mixed with pedophilia in the government.

They use fusion centers to store child pornography and rape videos 
without protecting the children or catching real criminals. Since 
their is no oversight, pedophiles with security clearances damage 
innocent children unfettered under the pretext of national 
security. Pretty amazing.

It's all too familiar. Department of Justice political playbook for 
increasing their political power share. On CNN they tout it as 
heroism in JTTF, but this is a veneer of settings up schizos and 
radicals. Oh no, we're under attack. Hello? We have criminals! Very 
bad people! But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

To the FBI/JTTF: Stop using fusion centers to horde child 
pornography. Please.

They use fusion centers to store child pornography and rape videos 
without protecting the children or catching real criminals. Since 
their is no oversight, pedophiles with security clearances damage 
innocent children unfettered under the pretext of national 
security. Pretty amazing.

A little bit of common sense could go a long way.
