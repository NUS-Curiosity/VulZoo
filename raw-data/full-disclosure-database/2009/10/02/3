Subject: Re: So weev...

I posted on here earlier as netdev.doctor questioning weev on how 
he feels psychologically.

*spins weev around*
*grins*

You came from the net, You planted your seeds of hatred and now 
with nature you fall here.

I feel such invigorating justice seeing your real identity 
mirrored. Redundancy. Freedom of information.

I hypothesize weev may possibly kill himself, unfortunately. I'm 
unsure how to approach it because I hear he may have left the 
United States. If not, he'll cling on like a Michael Crook kinda 
guy (which he is closely emulating nowadays).

These kids are like mean infants.

If I were in your shoes, I would intellectually be considering 
ending my life. However that's just me.

I don't think you should. However, if it were me, it would stop the 
pain, and my life path that I really couldn't ever fix now.
