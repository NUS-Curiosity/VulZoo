She's gorgeous and looks like a great mother.

I'm totally surprised, he sounds like he has the nicest family in the world.

That's a popular image of weev.

The only psychological explanation I have for it is weev felt jealous of the connection between his dad on his mom because dad loved mom so much... And Andrew perceived himself as being neglected. Hell, can you blame him? His mom is so beautiful.
