All - the first bug is self-explanatory,

The vmx86 kext ioctl handler contains several integer overflows which
lead to kernel heap corruptions. These are probably not exploitable, and
I didn't try given the second bug,

The vmx86 kext ioctl handler permits an unprivileged userland program to
initialize several function pointers via the 0x802E564A ioctl code.
These function pointers are later used from several reachable locations
within the driver, one of which is called immediately after initialization.
