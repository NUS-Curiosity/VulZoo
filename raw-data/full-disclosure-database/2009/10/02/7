They do sound nice, bless their hearts. We should have mentioned it
earlier, but pops's name is Mark, and Mommy Weev is Catherine,
although she has taken to going by Alyse as of late.

Contact was initiated with them after our original post, and they
claim they have not talked to or seen Andrew in over two years. It
appears, sadly, that weev's destructive tendencies have affected
even his immediate family.
