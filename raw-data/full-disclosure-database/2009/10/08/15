If the answer isn't "customer network admin selects it", the products are
broken and brain damaged.  Different sites have different security stances,
and different opinions regarding the trade-off between the added security
benefit and the throughput and latency hits you take.

Even within a site, the trade-offs may vary.  I have some machines that
are actually air-gapped, some that are heavily firewalled, and some that
are lightly firewalled - and there's probably some Snort sensors and honeypots
too.. ;)

If you're asking for "what pre-canned detection rules they come with", it's
probably "all the known vulns that we can figure out how to write a Snort
rule that doesn't suck resources". :)

OK, maybe they don't use Snort - but the same problems of filter
expressiveness, whether/how to do a regexp, and so on, are faced by all IDS/IPS
systems.  If you need to do a regexp backref, it's going to either not be part
of the available toolset, or it's going to suck at line rate on high speed
interfaces.  Matching '\((134|934){3,5})\(foo|bar)(more ugly)(\1|\2)' is going
to suck whether it's Snort or silicon.
