	write-protect?



While    probably    not   interesting  for  Forensic  usage  and  OS
dependant:
Windows  offers  a  simple  registry  key  to  block write requests to
removable storage such as USB keys,

Wrote  a small app that does exactly this, it's a nice gimmick to have
for various test cases.
