Subject: Attack pattern selection criteria for IPS products

Hi,

What is the vulnerability selection criteria of Tipping Point, Juniper IPS
products.

Is it covering each and every CVE ID or is it selecting particular kind of
attacks. If so what is selection criteria (cvss score or severity level or
most publicly exploited)


Thanks & Regards
Srujan
