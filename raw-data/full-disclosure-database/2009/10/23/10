Hi All,

this is a message to all the non-israeli community....

It's that time of year again! Please report to the help desk for your
oven building supplies, however, you will need to trap your own jews
this year. Cheese WILL be provided for you to lure them out of there
holes, but be very careful of there horns... and do not look a jew
directly in the eye as they have been known to turn people into money
grubbing slaves. It also goes without saying that you should never
ever ever ever ever trust a jew. It's a known fact the more you help
them, the more they spy on you.

Hope to see you at this coming get together, i'll bring the milk toast
you bring the tater salad.

Thanks,
Petey
