I don't really see this as a bad thing.  Metasploit's new hybrid license
seems to force contributions to be open-sourced so Rapid7's contributions
should flow back to the community.

I¹ve dealt with Rapid7...there were pushy and condescending on the phone
since we weren¹t interested in their (amazingly expensive) product.  It took
months to get them to stop calling even after we told them several times we
weren¹t interested.  If they act like that with Metaslpoit...well...good
luck.
