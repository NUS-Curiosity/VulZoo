Subject: Source for USB stick with hardware write-protect?

Can anybody suggest a source for a vendor of USB memory sticks with
actual *hardware* write-protect?

I have an ancient (USB1) 32MB "thumb drive" with a switch on the side
which reliably write protects the flash.  Unlike the SD card "write
notch" which is implemented in the driver, this switch 100% disables
writing to the drive.  I've had this for a decade, and it's starting
to show bad sectors and the USB contacts are wearing out.

Can anybody suggest a flash drive, currently available at retail or
wholesale, which you have had good experience with and can verify
comes with a hardware write protect?

Form factor, capacity, price and speed are not critical.  If you can
point me at a vendor offering custom printing (branding) who will take
an order of 50 or 100 units, I will make sure to throw a free drive in
your direction, preloaded with 'interesting' contents.


Thanks in advance,

Kevin
