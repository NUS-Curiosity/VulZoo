My guess is that there are many places with security desks that will let
a cell phone pass because they don't realize that attack is doable with
the phone.

If the USB memory device is a stick, maybe just pocketing it is a better bet.
And if it's a full-size rotating-media disk, it's probably a lot higher
capacity than the cell phone, which probably doesn't have *that* much storage,
so you need to be picking and choosing what to take - and the small screen on
the phone makes browsing difficult.

So guys - what would be the ideal corporate-espionage device, and what's
the best approximation currently on the market?
