Hi Dan,

Maybe I misunderstand what you are saying but - Isn't the point in this
case is that  running  binary  files  mapped  as executables  is  not
exploiting  a  vulnerability  in  a  third party application ?

I understood that Jonathan  was  asking  whether the exploitation of a file format
vulnerability    in   Product   X   can  be  categorized  as  remotely
exploitable - even  though  it  is not exposed to the outside and one can only reach
arbitrary control by indirect means.

I  think we can agree that yes, it is remotely exploitable and as such
should be categorized as "remote" in Risk/Impactt scoring systems ?

Does anybody disagree ? I'd be interested to hear your point of view.

If   you   could dive into this a bit more as I can't follow you here. I
frankly don't know any Access control logic where running  a  format leads
to the escalation of a privilege, per se.
