Objet : [Full-disclosure] Nikto 2.1.0 released

It's final time to stop procrastinating: Nikto 2.1.0 is here!
(Available from http://cirt.net/nikto2)

This version has gone through significant rewrites under the hood to
how Nikto works, to make it more expandable and usable.
Changes include:

* Rewrite to the plugin engine allowing more control of the plugin
structure and making it easier to add plugins
* Rewrite to the reporting engine allowing reporting plugins to cover
more and also ensuring that output is written if Nikto is quit before
finishing
* Large overhaul of documentation to document built-in methods and
variables (available in the tarball or on cirt.net
* Addition of caching to reduce amount of calls made to the web
servers, as well as a facility to disable smart 404 guessing.
* Addition of simple guessing for whether a system is an embedded
device and to report what it is
* Plugin to use OWASPs dictionary lists to attempt to brute force
directories on the remote web server (as mutate 6)
* Plugin to attempt to brute force domains (as mutate 5)
* Allow username guessing (mutate 3 and 4) to use a dictionary file as
well as brute forcing
* Support for NTLM authentication
* Lots of bug fixes and new security checks

Please, try out, break and report bugs and suggestions...

Thanks

dave
