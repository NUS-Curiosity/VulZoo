Subject: Re: insecure elements in https protected pages

Any request on that page that is in http is an insecure element.  
Mixing HTTP and HTTPS on the same page is insecure as the credentials,  
cookies or other identifying data would be sent in the clear to the  
HTTP server.

Install FireBug and watch what pages are loaded, or manually go  
through the HTML and move all page elements over to SSL.
