Bonjour Fionnbharr Davies!,

I'm glad to make your life easier with the shasum full path, really.

Regarding the "Grossly misdiagnosed bug";
That's some funny words to describe one of the most difficult bug to exploit
in 2009 (http://seclists.org/dailydave/2009/q4/2)

Is this going to be another grossly misdiagnosed bug?

Also I'm glad you put that /usr/bin at the start, it would have been
confusing otherwise.
