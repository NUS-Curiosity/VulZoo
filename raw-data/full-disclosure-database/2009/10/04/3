Have you never had a parking ticket or a telling off by the school 
mistress for smoking pot behind the bike shed?

There are criminals everywhere, who do *bad* things, you trying to 
appeal to the FBI on an international mailing list, where the main 
concern is *cyber terrorism* isn't the way to go.

If you have a complaint about this stuff contact your local law 
enforcement office.

Nobody gives a fuck here, we're all counter-terrorism folks.
