Subject: Re: Weev,
	AKA Andrew Auernheimer [Fullinfo Doc(TM) 	revision #1]

Mr. Learner,

You really are hilarious. I can infer one thing from your posts: you aren't
a hacker, and you find this really awkward and aren't sure how this whole
ruin thing works.

You have no access to data that I have not made public. Once again, the only
thing you found out was my name, which I put on my livejournal. Big deal.
The rest was google-able. You really don't have anything. You also don't
understand how to make this whole doxdrop deal effective and dramatic. You
save up everything you can until you find a piece of data which is
psychologically damaging to the target. You have to essentially find them
guilty of wrongdoing, like using a nonprofit to defraud people, or sucking
dicks for money. This whole thing where you post somebody's parents address,
big deal. Everybody's got parents unless they're orphaned. Those parents
inevitably live somewhere. If I were a basement dwelling loser, this tactic
might be effective. Unfortunately I live on 60 acres in the sticks and have
hungry dogs and guns. Not much you can do to me.

Since you are so fucking inept that you can't even find my birthday:
September 1st, 1985
My former school: James Madison University

Protip: Nobody in the FBI takes internet submitted tips seriously. If you
want to go submit leads to the FBI, you can do it directly to the FBI agent
out to get me.

Earlier you called for my "methods of alluding law enforcement." (sic; You
make so many errors in your English that it becomes hilariously obvious that
all your sockpuppets are the same person.) I've got some funny logs to give
you when you've exhausted your effort. You're going to LOL.
