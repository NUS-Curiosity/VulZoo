Mr. Lyon, Paul

There is a thread on your website referencing my son Andrew Auernheimer. I am totally sympathetic with those posting as my son is guilty of horrible behavior. We are ashamed of him and wish we could find him ourselves. Sadly, your contributors felt the need to "Out" our family, Andrew's parents and siblings. There are links to our younger children, one of whom is only 14, our address  and phone numbers are available, photos of the children and one reference by one poster as to a desire to rape me. The truth is everyone we know already knows we have a mentally ill child. We have made no secret of Andrew.

We too are victims of Andrew. The hardest part for all of us is that he used to be normal. He loved us and was sweet and kind to his siblings. Several years ago he developed a relationship with a girl with a serious drug problem. He began by using xtc regularly and eventually graduated to LSD and heroin. About three years ago he had a mental breakdown and began hearing voices and talking to himself. He vanished from our lives. My children would log into AIM to see if he was still alive; if he was logged on too long  or not recently they would worry something had happened to him. There are references to his lavish lifestyle on this thread but the sad truth is he is paranoid schizophrenic and has been homeless a number of times. I am not excusing his pathetic behavior. My husband and I contacted law enforcement in Southern California almost a year ago as we wanted to try to "catch him" and have him forcibly committed; he needs help. Unfortunately we were told that the likely outcome would be 72 hours in a mental facility and they would let him go and since we are in no financial position to pay for mental health care for him we should just pray and forget it. I cried every night for a year but I am done crying. I can only worry about things that I can change and I really have NO information about Andrew. He never once gave us a phone number or address where we could reach him. When he left here he did not have a car or a license. I don't even know what state he might be in and frankly, I don't know if I want to anymore. 

I don't know if any of you have ever had a mentally ill family member. It is torture. For it to be your child is indescribably painful.  I sometimes wonder if  because our lives as a family have been dedicated to diversity and inclusion, that he may have chosen his weapons to purposely hurt us. We are tough though and committed to each other and making the most positive contributions to our world as we are able. 

I hope you all can find it in your hearts to please take down our personal information. If your goal is to hurt US then you have succeeded. Other than that I am not sure what the purpose of all this was. I don't cry over Andrew anymore but I found this thread when I googled my daughter looking for a school picture for her dorm room and I sobbed. She has never said an unkind word to anyone and I knew she would be devastated. We are not responsible for Andrew's totally screwed up life, he is. I was contacted erroneously on my Facebook page by someone named Anton Garcia posing as a Dreamworks Animation Employee trying to find Andrew because he was hacking Dreamworks. I suspected it was fake but I answered anyway, truthfully. I too want him to own up to his stupid behavior and take the consequences like a man. I'm sure I will be disappointed. The worst part about this is you ONLY hurt us. Andrew probably thought it was hilarious. He doesn't care what you say or do to us, he only cares about himself. He, in the past, has even made up a variety of ugly lies about us, but he is always found out.

Many of the postings referred to our family as nice. This is accurate. Our other children are everything Andrew rejected, kind, smart, hard-working, dedicated to making a difference through public service, and we have left Andrew behind. There is so much need in this world and so little time that spending it on tears and regret is a colossal waste. Don't get me wrong we will always love Andrew and our hearts will forever be broken where he is concerned but what else can we do but move on. It's like the Andrew we knew died long ago. Hope does spring eternal and sometimes I dream the real Andrew is home and we are all together, but my hopes are waning.  Who knows, the future is never certain. I have been referred to an FBI agent who is involved with the cyber crimes division. I will forward this email to her tomorrow.

Again, please don't make my younger children suffer any more. Do what you will with Andrew, he's earned it, but please let our family try to move on. We have been dealing with this for years.

Sincerely,
Alyse Auernheimer
