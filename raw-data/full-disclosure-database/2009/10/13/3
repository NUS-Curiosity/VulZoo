this is the NW corner of the square... if you stand facing the Empire
Cinema/Casino, it's two doors to the left...

confusion/faq:

     yes, it's a nightclub by name.
     no, there is no clubbing / loud music / scantily clad women / poles.
     no, there is no charge at the door - tell the bouncer you are there
for dc4420 and they will let you in.

      Leicester Square on the Piccadilly and Northern Lines.
      Piccadilly Circus on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo Lines.

oh, and we beat them up about the beer prices (again) so hopefully we'll 
be able to afford more than 1/2 pint each this month... :P

see you there!

cheers,
