Hehe...who knows?  Maybe you needed to do @internal.mckesson.com ;-P

Bringing this back to the issue at hand, a security POC at any vendor
is, I suggest, a good thing (tm).

As an fyi, and specifically pertaining to medical device security,
some efforts are underway; and I humbly suggest that this community
could make further recommendations.

Please see the following:

"Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security" by the
Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)

"In light of increased focus on medical device security, the HIMSS
Medical Device Security Work Group created the Manufacturer Disclosure
Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2)." --
