In fact it's very typical of the types of attacks we see every day now.  By far 
the most routinely successful attacks now are initiated through some sort of 
social engineering trick that requires user interaction to trigger the 
compromise.

If by remote you mean "live interaction by the hacker at the point of attack" 
(as in a "traditional" hack), then no, it's not a remote attack.  I think the 
more normal undertstanding of remote attack (although it's usually worded 
remote compromise) is that the result of a successful attack is the opening of 
a gateway that can lead to additional compromise or complete takeover of a 
machine.  Given the details you've offered,  think this qualifies as 
"potentially leading to a remote compromise" of a machine.

The attack begins when the unsuspecting user clicks on a link to either open an 
attachment or view a webpage or video.  In the background the compromise takes 
place, after which the malicious software "phones home", downloads additional 
tools, etc. until the host is completely and utterly compromised.
