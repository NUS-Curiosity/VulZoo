Stealing from the old Mafia wasn't so bad.  If you got caught, it was
usually "just business" and they dispatched you in the most economical
way feasible.

These days, the field is dominated by crazy and rutheless South American drug
cartels, ruthless and crazy Asian Yakuza-like gangs, and *really* crazy,
ruthless, psycopathic gangs from the Ukraine.

Low risk? Hardly.
