Sorry about leaving sealpac in there, we're working on correcting 
that. I'll put a notice in the next one.

For the record, the post made in an earlier version of Andrew 
Auernheimer's infodoc states weev has an affiliation with sealpac. 
This is incorrect because weev just took the domain name and failed 
to give it back.

Since you find is necessary to forward this correspondence to the 
FBI, I'll make it public here for you.

It's almost like you're fishing to be a victim or something. It's 
pathetic.

If it means anything: No one has made any threats to you. No one is 
going to harm you. No one has any ill-sentiment towards your family.

You've been done a favor by having your relationship with weev 
clarified on here.

You got your correction, you got your post down, quit being 
melodramatic.

Lisa,
Please do not link Andrew Auernheimer with our business, Sealpac 
USA, he has
nothing to do with it except he is holding our domain name hostage. 
We are
planning on pursuing a court order to have it released. All of our 
emails
concerning this subject will now be forwarded to the FBI as it may
potentially impact our business. The individuals who say they are 
trying to
help us are now causing more harm to us than Andrew himself. We are 
advised
to have our home watched by law enforcement and our daughter's 
dorm. This is
just wrong.

Thank You for you consideration.
Alyse
