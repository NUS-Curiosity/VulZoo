	AKA Andrew Auernheimer [Fullinfo Doc(TM) revision #1]

Hello.

Attached is the header and full context of my correspondence with Alyse. (Formatting removed for readability purposes)

Remember what n3td3v said, we're counter-terrorism folk here. We're not setting up activists, hoodrats, felons and schizos here. This is the real deal.

If you care about National Security I hope you visit the blog at http://twitter.com/n3td3v.

We'll be at defcon 2010.

Please don't forward the email. Please. You have your information. You will
be putting our family at risk if you do and it is purely self indulgent to
do so. You have already forwarded it and we have already been threatened.
Please stop.

She also, if I am to believe your emails, did not disagree with you on any point. You then kindly stripped the email formatting and rather than forwarding the email to the list, pasted it into your own email so that it would seem almost as though you wrote these emails!

You really don't have anything. You also don't understand how to make this whole doxdrop deal effective and dramatic. You save up everything you can until you find a piece of data which is psychologically damaging to the target. You have to essentially find them guilty of wrongdoing, like using a nonprofit to defraud people, or sucking dicks for money. This whole thing where you post somebody's parents address, big deal. Everybody's got parents unless they're orphaned. Those parents inevitably live somewhere. If I were a basement dwelling loser, this tactic might be effective. Unfortunately I live on 60 acres in the sticks and have hungry dogs and guns. Not much you can do to me.
