I don't see how mirroring information about weev -- that was 
already posted by someone else -- signifies I don't care about 
crime.

I believe you're being a relativist. I feel your miffed I care too 
much about justice and not enough about your sociopathic troll 
persona. Have a warm cup of soothing tea (cognitive dissonance is a 
bitch), and listen, because I'm going to help you:

Now if you really wish, we can get you two on a date. However, you 
have to shape up that attitude, she looks like a real wholesome 
woman who wouldn't be impressed by latest emails. They are lurid!

She is a woman who no doubt wants a smart man who works hard. I'm 
sure she loves her husband! TheiProphet said that her mom wanted an 
"intellectual friend, not a kid". And that his dead was "totally 
absent"

You have a chance of getting with Andrew Auernheimer's (AKA Weev's) 
mom, Cathy, however you need to lighten up that nihilistic troll 
rhetoric. I need you to rent a tuxedo, get on SILC, and we'll start 
greasing the wheels. We got success ahead!

And remember, n3td3v is True Intelligence in an Open world.
