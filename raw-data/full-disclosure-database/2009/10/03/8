My emails are not to be read hypercritically. Rather, you should 
get the point as whole. 

http://tips.fbi.gov <= Are you an 'alleged' victim of weev (Now 
disclosed to be known as Andrew Auernheimer)? Help want to change 
this, and to do that, we need you to report your experiences to the 
federal bureau of investigation.

Thank you.
