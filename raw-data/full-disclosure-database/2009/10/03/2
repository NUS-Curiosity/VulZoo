Hello,

I think there is a good chance we can get Andrew into prison for his criminal activity.

Weev's affect hasn't just harassed innocents, but also came to the dismay of his former associates, who casted suspicion on due to his poor choices.

If you have been victimized by Weev and no legal efforts or requests have worked, please submit any evidence you have to http://tips.fbi.gov.

Also, if you have any personal information that is of any value including:

- his secrets
- personality
- pictures
- locations
- methods of alluding law enforcement
- et cetera

please mail them to me personally (or on this list).
