Hint: your e-mail client *can't* timestamp this message, because it has
no *clue* when I hit send on this message.  Consider that you can't even
trust the timestamp on the first Received: header, because I could very
well have composed the mail and hit send while offline, and it got posted
to a server once I had network connectivity again.

The  sending MUA is responsible for this, but often an end-user MUA will fail
to add a Date: header and the fixup is done at the first mail server,
