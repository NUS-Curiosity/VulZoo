Hi James,

Well, that  would explain why client side exploits are so fruity these
days. Probably  nobody  invests  into  protection  against  them , as the
risk assessment team tells them it is a local issue only ? Pun intended ;)

A  PDF/DOC exploit should be classified as remotely exploitable or else your
assessment suffers from lack of reality - sorry.

We  have  the following denominations in this thread, which
all mean different things, doesn't really help us here :
* "a remote bug"
* "a remote attack"
* "remotely exploitable"

"A remote attack"
= An action

"Remotely   exploitable"
= possibility that vulnerability is exploited  remotely

"A  remote  bug"=
a bug that is remotely triggerable (??) doesn't even imply it is exploitable.

I  only  perceive  one of these denominations to be worth being used in
risk assessment -that being "remotely exploitable"

Yes,  you actually  should  consider  you  can  use  these  types  of attacks
remotely,   but   "normally"   not   without   a  "first  degree  remote
vulnerability" (add that to the list of denominations).
