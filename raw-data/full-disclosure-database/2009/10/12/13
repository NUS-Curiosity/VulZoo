Package        : clamav

Security support for clamav, an anti-virus utility for Unix, has been
discontinued for the stable distribution (lenny) and the oldstable
distribution (etch). Clamav Upstream has stopped supporting the
releases in etch and lenny. Also, it is not easily possible to receive
signature updates for the virus scanner with our released versions
anymore. We recommend that all clamav users consider switching to the
version in debian-volatile, which receives regular updates and security
support on a best effort basis.
