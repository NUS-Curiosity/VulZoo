Subject: Re: When is it valid to claim that
	a	vulnerability leads to a remote attack?

I think the classification system as a whole is ultimately based on agenda.  Vendors (I presume) don't want things to sound as bad as they may be.  Researchers want things to sound as bad as they CAN be.  And the rest of the people would like a means by which to measure "urgency" to patch as it relates to cost/benefit, risk/threat, and potential consequences of inaction.  

So I think it ultimately comes down to a sliding scale of what the person responsible for incident response is comfortable with.  To me, I draw the line of a "remote" exploit to "no user or system interaction required" as I've previously stated.  You have to make SOME sort of qualification, or else calculated responses become unmanageable. 

Analysis beyond that (to me) enters you into a model of diminishing returns.  By way of example:  If you can send an email exploit to an Outlook client that can execute by a preview only, is that remote?  I would say no, as a user would have to preview it.  If one could exploit the same vulnerability just by it arriving into one's Outlook inbox without preview would it THEN be remote?  Again, I would say no, as Outlook would have to be running.  And, of course, one would have to be running Outlook in the first place.  

As a group, I don't think we need to define what "remote" is.  That's up to the response team.  What you need to do is decide on what you do when YOU classify something as remote, and then take action according to a predefined plan.

That is really the advice I have for the OP.  Don't look to what other people consider remote; decide for yourself, and plan a course of action accordingly.
