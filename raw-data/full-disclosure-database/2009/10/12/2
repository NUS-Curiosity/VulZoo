	vulnerability leads to a remote attack?

If you classify a remote bug (anything that can be exploited remotely) then
you are classifying all bugs (you can use a privilege escalation exploit
remotely) I agree with Thor, anything that exploits a remote service
(HTTP,FTP Etc..) without any user interaction.
