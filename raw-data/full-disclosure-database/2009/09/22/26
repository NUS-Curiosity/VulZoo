No.

Why not?  Is he incapable of clicking on an OK button?  With Automatic 
Updates, there is absolutely no excuse to NOT be fully updated.  Don't 
give me the "old application" excuse either.  You've already said he 
surfs the web and pulls email.  Stop being lazy and tell him to update.
Period.  End of story.  Otherwise, he is being irresponsible and a risk
to himself and the Internet.

So, he/you knows how to use Windows Update.  Why haven't you? 

The firewall, router, RJ45 cable (cute) mean dick.  He is operating a computer.
Microsoft has made applying updates idiot-proof.  Get it done.

Doesn't matter.

Something you should probably check on, hrm?

Doesn't matter.  He is connected to the Internet and running an operating system
that is out of date.  He is in danger.

No.  Update the box.  Quit being a lazy SOB and get it done.  You and he are being
irresponsible by not doing so.  It's a few clicks and a reboot.  Why haven't you
updated?

You are wrong...horribly wrong.  Get that box patched.  Turn on Automatic Updates
if you can't be bothered to point and click.

Yes.  Patch the box.  Patch patch patch.
