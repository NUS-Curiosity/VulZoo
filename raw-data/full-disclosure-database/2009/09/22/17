In general, that's true.  Most of the current popular infection vectors are
connected with web browsers or e-mail.  It's pretty hard to whack a Windows
box that's just sitting there behind a firewall.  But all bets are off once
you start surfing websites...

And remember - although Firefox has a somewhat better security history
than IE, *NO SOFTWARE IS BUG FREE*.

Yes, if the user uses Firefox to hit a site that has malware that will use a
Firefox bug (see above), you can get a botnet on it.  Most firewalls/routers
are configured to automatically pass all outbound traffic, so the botnet
software can easily phone home to get further instructions/updates.
