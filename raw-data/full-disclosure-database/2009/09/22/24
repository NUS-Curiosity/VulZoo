Subject: Re: Dumb question: Is Windows box behind a router
 safe ?

No, I would not consider your father's box to be safe.  There are enough 
drive-by-download attacks and e-mail scams to make infection a very real 
possibility even if the automated worm route is blocked by a NAT 
router.  However, if you installed SP2 with default settings, it 
probably enabled the auto-update functionality in Windows.  Similarly, 
recent versions of Firefox have a similar auto-update feature.  So, even 
if you don't think the box is being updated, it might still be receiving 
security patches.
