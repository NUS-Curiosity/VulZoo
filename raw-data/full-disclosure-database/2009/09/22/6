Send  a hard copy authorisation code to access the online tool to the
registered physical address of the card holder.
Debit the card the moment the customer logs in/uses the tool with the
supplied auth code.
However this obviously removes any instant access to the tool, and
incurs extra overheads. As such may have an adverse effect on your
business model.
