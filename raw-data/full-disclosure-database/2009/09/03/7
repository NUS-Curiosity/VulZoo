INTRODUCTION

It may be that I'm going to say is not very popular for those who openly
disagree. Changes in people's minds who think that something has long agreed
to be right, I expect a negative response. It will, time and events will
show the truth in those words.
Abuse of authority extends over a period of time that corruption is accepted
or even expected from those who chose a position of strength. What a great
success, they were mainly to provide justification for his actions while
soothing and silencing his critics. This, as they say, the level of
oppression (and end) continued uninterrupted for a long time. People of the
Earth facing technocrats who have the right to influence even the most
secular aspects of their daily lives.
We will endeavor to refrain from this personal, as in the attack on the
defensive. If you agree, we agree and are usually happy with your own
actions. If you disagree, we intend to send power to convince you on a
personal level, the problems still to come.
This global technocracy is a threat to all mankind. Interception of
messages, blocking information and suppression of dissent, is a common
concern for all, regardless of demographic.
Skilled technologists in the operation to deceive the true enemy. Promoting
the use of technology to suppress the masses, to intercept the message and
personality of these people turning to power is the right way. Many things
are not as it seems. Many of those who call themselves "white hat" playing
on the black team. 'Cashing in on the exceptional skills without considering
the consequences of their actions. I do not blame them for that delusion of
propaganda and misinformation, then going problem to find people who worked
with a lot of electoral data sets.
