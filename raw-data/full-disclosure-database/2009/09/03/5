Subject: Re: PPStream PPSMediaList Activex 0day exploit

There isn't exactly a whole lot of detail here. All you've got posted on 
your blog are two screenshots of the PPStream call stack after a crash.  
There's no detail about what input causes the crash, nor any other 
details about how to make it exploitable.  At present, it's not even 
clear (beyond your word, of course) that vulnerability even *is* 
exploitable.  With more detail, it'd be easier to analyze this 
vulnerability and propose a fix to the developers of this application.

Thanks,
Rohit Patnaik
