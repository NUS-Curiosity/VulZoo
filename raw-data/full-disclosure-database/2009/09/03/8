We cyber-educated. Most of our race has oppressed the system. It is up to us
to rise and reign in control over the technology used against us. Currently,
there is a balanced skill. Number of employed hackers to state Cyber
increasing daily because they deceive them into believing it is a good deal.
Old Guard needs these people, because they can not think like us. We must
prevent the continued flight of hackers to work on the corporate government.

White hat hacker is really to protect the empire of evil. One of our first
goals that he provide them with information necessary to bring them to this
realization. Using their positions within their respective governments and
corporations, there is a chance they may throw their shoes in the programs
of the car and lead to its termination. We are the masters of technology,
those who control us to use us against one another.

White House Negro hats, with their special place on our side of the owners,
they turn against the rest of us slaves, but not one of us. White-Hat
servants which is stored in our common wizard do its dirty work against us,
they were deceived in believing that they have some other, or better than
others.

Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs) is the observation Dron and weapons
platforms. First get the public recognition in the Warzone, now as well as
our other technologies, they turned against us.

Three teams have already received Phase 1 contracts to begin developing
develop a radical new aircraft within the U.S. Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) program known as "vulture".

DARPA goals for Vulture are not trivial: 5 years on station with a 450kg /
1000 lb payload, 5kW of onboard power and enough speed patrol to remain on
station for 99% of the time from the wind, arising from 60,000-90,000 feet.

If the Vulture has achieved its goal, it would be a cheaper alternative to a
strong U.S. $ 20 billion + TSAT satellite program. This system could act as
a replacement for the transmission of communications or reconnaissance
satellites
The objective is to develop Vulture aircraft that can remain on station
continuously for more than five years to perform intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance (ISR), and communications flights over area of interest.

Odyssey, using solar energy to power the aircraft during daylight, and
stored solar energy to power the aircraft at night. Odyssey "Aurora" to the
"modular boat" approach, using 3 UAVs wingspan of 160 feet, which can
separate docking station and in the air.
Aurora Flight Sciences is involved in the construction of Northrop Grumman's
high-altitude UAV Global Hawk "


In the role and design, "Global Hawk" like "Lokhid U-2, grave 1950 spy
plane.
UAVs armed with Hellfire missiles currently used as a platform to engage
ground targets in sensitive areas. Armed criminals were first used in late
2001 from bases in Pakistan and Uzbekistan, primarily for premeditated
murder in Afghanistan.

Israeli UAVs, armed with missiles killed 48 Palestinian civilians in the
Gaza Strip, including two small children in the field, and a group of women
and girls in the empty streets. Israeli forces or to take all possible
precautions to ensure that targets were combatants, or transmitting the
distinction between combatants and civilians. Under U.S. drone attacks in
Pakistan, killing ten civilians for every extremist killed. American UAVs
attack was Pakistan's turn to think about the United States, and that 35 or
40 such attacks killed only 8 or 9 Top al-Qaeda.
only 10 of the 60 missions in the period from January 2006 to April 2009
strike their targets, killing 14 Al Qaeda and 687 civilians, the horrific
relationship.

Police agencies, which include using UAVs for everything from border
security to domestic surveillance high above the town.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officially began testing that will
likely be the first unmanned surveillance aircraft that will be placed on
the domestic market in an urban environment.

One North Carolina county using UAVs equipped with low-light and infrared
cameras to monitor their citizens. The aircraft was assigned to monitoring
duties for motorcyclists Lenekspo Gaston County from a few hundred feet in
the air - close enough to identify a person - and other operations such as
aerial detection of marijuana fields, is planned.

This is not surprising to see how hypocritical state as the United States
and Israel directly involved in the development of this form of conflict,
which looks cleaner and "moral" from the standpoint of the user, but are
actually just further isolating them from the consequences of their actions.
Real time observation of everyday life transformed into drone-based
simulation and war makes the war in something like a game. This game is
deadly and immoral that the increasing number of States, like India, are
playing out.

Vulture would be more vulnerable to anti-aircraft missiles than a satellite,
and may become a target for fighters, and given the right launch profile

Attacks similar to those applied in relation to the satellites, or using the
threat companions against UAVs are an option. Because of their high altitude
traditional ground arms and even fighters are inefficient.
Maybe some kind of energy weapon can be used, laser or microwave burst off
its electronics.
Took a communications channel and took control of UAVs has the advantage of
its use against the enemy. Using combat surveillance, as well as guiding it
back to them as a missile. You can not fight what you do not see, so that
technologies such as satellites and UAVs to be useless to continue
