pretending to be n3td3v and gobbles isn't going to bring them back 
to the mailing list by the way. 

you as a mailing list decided to ban n3td3v and gobbles, so why 
impersonate them?

ask for the mailing list to be uncensored if you want them back, 
don't impersonate.

n3td3v and gobbles had real skill, the troll attempts lately have 
just been lame.
