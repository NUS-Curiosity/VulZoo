Subject: CVE-2009-2958

Hi all,

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in dnsmasq when the TFTP
service is enabled. This flaw could allow a malicious TFTP client to crash
the dnsmasq service. (CVE-2009-2958)

Is this local exploit or remote exploit. By means is there any chance of
detecting this in network traffic.

If any POC is available to exploit this please provide me .

Thanks in advance
Srujan
