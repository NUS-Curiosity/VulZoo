You sound like a person who walked into the wrong room. David Kernell?

I think you meant to get off at the 4chan floor.

Zewbiechan. Very professional.

> Same here. I wanted to learn about security flaws  and instead it's just all these dumb fags pretending they've doxed  some big important person. What the fuck is this, 4chan or something? It's full  disclosure of security holes, not full disclosure of the full names of people  because they trolled the ux designer you have a crush on or  something.

> Stop trying to impress everyone by saying  you found some guy's dox. Even if you really did find them, I still don't  really care. Apparently you think this weev guy is some kind of celebrity or  something, but I've never heard of him and I don't care about the little  grudge you have against him, so stop filling my inbox with you're dumb autistic  retardery. Seriously, just get a fucking blogspot account or something and post  all the shit there so I can go to my fucking inbox and not have to sift through  all this shit.
