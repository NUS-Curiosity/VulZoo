Subject: On the subject of security researcher n3td3v,
	Gary McKinnon "Autistic rockstar felon"

I just go off the phone with intelligence


MI7 and the CIB (Upgraded from CIA++, super sexy savage secret) 
have relayed to me in code that n3td3v security is coming back 
stronger than ever.


Over in Langley we know that n3td3v has the finest security 
tactics. Super fortified servers.

Ultra mega ram.

He is truly one of the most experienced blackhats in all the land. 
He is a master criminal.


In other news, Gary McKinnon, elite pentagon hacker is an autistic 
rockstar:

He's milking the success of his crime, instead apologizing, he's 
gloating. I guess that teaches people hacking is OK.


My name is shadowdong007. Roger wilco.

- Gary McKinnon, CISSP, MD.

"autistic only when I commit crimes, but really me when I'm on TV"

this is not n3td3v - laywyer
