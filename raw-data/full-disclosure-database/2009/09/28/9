The most of Full Path Disclosure are triggered by a Warning, Fatal Error
or Notice message from PHP.
This problem is a problem into the developer side. Each developer must
validate incoming parameters (by GET or POST), function calls, file
opening, sql queries, etc.

If you see the rest of code (example in hello.php) each function call is
validated by "if (function_exists(...))" but "add_action()" not.

All plugins (wordpress, joomla, etc etc) must be validated and correctly
parsed, I can't call to "function()" if "function()" not exists (in the
api context).

What do you think about?
