Subject: R. RHEL, RHCS, and Selinux : hype,
	reality or dream?

So it seems that it is not necessary to be a clever hacker as spender to
disable SELinux on a system
(http://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploit.txt<http://grsecurity.net/%7Espender/exploit.txt>).
Just follow the directions of the vendor. This one require to disable
selinux for the proper function of one of its HA products, after years that
the same vendor was critical with commercial product, o badly compiled open
source for SELINUX execmem o textreloc issue,  because they require the
same.
