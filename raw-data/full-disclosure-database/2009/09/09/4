This is either (a) slipped into the EULA or (b) illegal.  If (a) then it's 
another case of people just not reading the EULA, and while I know these 
things are complicated when it comes to something as critical as your 
children... READ THE EULA.  If it's (b) then someone's going to jail, 
because there are enough child-protection statutes and laws on the books to 
make someone's life miserable in the federal pen.

Now I'm going to go read the EULA on them :)

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Web-monitoring software gathers data on kid chats

Parents who install a leading brand of software to monitor their kids'
online activities may be unwittingly allowing the company to read
their children's chat messages â€” and sell the marketing data gathered.

Software sold under the Sentry and FamilySafe brands can read private
chats conducted through Yahoo, MSN, AOL and other services, and send
back data on what kids are saying about such things as movies, music
or video games. The information is then offered to businesses seeking
ways to tailor their marketing messages to kids.
