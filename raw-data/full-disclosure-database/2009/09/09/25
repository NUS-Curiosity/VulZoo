Does anybody care?

In fact does anybody who contributes anything useful to this list use
Hushmail? (at this time I am too lazy to look). If not I can set my spam
filter. Amusing as it has been, it has grown tiresome.

btw mr lawyer/mr random guy etc. my dick is bigger than yours, at least
that's what your wife  and sister tell me ;-)

I am a noob with skills marginally better (debatable) than the average
spotty first line support analyst. Therefore constructive criticism is
welcomed, anything else is ignored unless I am bored or stupid enough to
read/repond these postings after a bottle of Shiraz.

regards
the learner aka
MrX

ps I wish I didn't have so much to learn.
