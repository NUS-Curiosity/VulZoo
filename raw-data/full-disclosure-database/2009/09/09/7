-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists when parsing the jscript keyword "arguments".
Because the arguments object is not available until a certain time,
invoking it can result in memory corruption. Successful exploitation of
this vulnerability can lead to a remote system compromise under the
credentials of the current user.
