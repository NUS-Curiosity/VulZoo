Synopsis
========

An insecure temporary file usage has been reported in GCC-XML allowing
for symlink attacks.

Background
==========

GCC-XML is an XML output extension to the C++ front-end of GCC.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /       Vulnerable       /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-cpp/gccxml      < 0.9.0_pre20090516      >= 0.9.0_pre20090516

Description
===========

Dmitry E. Oboukhov reported that find_flags in GCC-XML does not handle
"/tmp/*.cxx" temporary files securely.

Impact
======

A local attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary
files with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GCC-XML users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =dev-cpp/gccxml-0.9.0_pre20090516
