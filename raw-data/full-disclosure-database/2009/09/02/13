Hi,

I believe in Open Source - GPL or BSD - and the best way to make
a better place is to release code and allow as many skilled people
to work on it as possible. the internet would be dead without
such philosophy.

I can understand the authors private reasons for the change in Nipper
but the pros/cons of GPL were surely known from the early days?

not sure how making it 100% commercial will help - the old version 
is out there and is useful (with some niggles)..i expect some
person will fork it.. call it 'slipper' or somesuch. A better route
would be the 'make a commercial version' with more features,
support, etc. 

regarding OS - unlss i work on it privately and start from scratch
then my paymasters need to agree on IP/copyright :-|
