I wonder how Rich Stallman feels about the concept of 'GPLV3 plus exceptions'.

Oh, we already know.  Section 10 of the GPLV3 says:
"You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. "

And that would certainly qualify as a "further restriction". (In particular,
"as part of a commercial product" has some serious GPL issues if the person is
trying to use it as part of a commercial product that is itself under GPLV3).

Your second exception (regarding copyright info) can probably be rephrased
so it's aggreeable with clause 7(c).

You might want to run this past the good guys at the FSF and get their
reaction.
