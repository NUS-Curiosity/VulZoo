	condition

Hi Thomas,
my post is not to intend for malicious activities. In report I write that is
usually for rc stage, discovery condition of this kind.
Usually these ancient bugs, IMHO, may be used for support analysis based on
binary diff using the historical releases of an application for obtain a
delta
of "critical" zone. But, again, it's only my opinion.

Thank you for your answer.

Kind regards.
