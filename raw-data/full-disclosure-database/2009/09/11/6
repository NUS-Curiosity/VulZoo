Subject: Re: Plain Text Password Disclosure vulnerability
	in rediff mail

Beyond that, most web applications that do use SSL, still forget to set
their cookies to secure (see
http://fscked.org/blog/incomplete-list-alleged-vulnerable-sites ).  Not to
mention the hordes of sites that have SSL logins off HTTP pages.  Even the
oft-repeated "well, the attacker won't get the plaintext password" claim
falls to the attacker who inserts some screen or keyboard sniffing JS into
the login page.

That being said, there probably is some class of attacker that can only do
passive monitoring as opposed to active interception.  But it's not exactly
a quantization to hang one's hat on.
