Subject: 0xHACK - Oxford Info-Sec Group

A couple of us in Oxford have decided to start a small, special
interests group. Anyone interested is welcome to come along, no
charge.

September 15th, 2009
Lamb & Flag, Oxford. 8pm

Agenda

The first meeting will focus on organising following meetings and
setting an agenda. There will be a demonstration on the use of OllyDbg
as a _legal_ cracking tool and discussion regarding fuzzing
frameworks.
