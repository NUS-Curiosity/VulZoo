There is yet another kqueue related vulnerability. It affects 6.x, up to
6.4-STABLE. FreeBSD security team was notified on 29th Aug, but there is no
response until now, so I won't publish any details.

Sucessful exploitation yields local root and allows to exit from jail. For now,
you can see demo on:
