As for businesses, any business of even medium size is going to have a
backup and recovery plan these days. Businesses will be less affected than
individuals because they'll have backups, and can restore from them if an
infection hits.

In any case, this still doesn't address my contention - that the actual
number of threats doesn't matter, because the vast majority of them are not
viable, in the sense that they attack vulnerabilities that have been
patched.  As long as users keep up with vendor patches (whether they're on
Windows or Linux) the number of threats that will affect them will remain
fairly constant over time.
