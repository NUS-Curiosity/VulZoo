Hello.

My name is Gary McKinnon. I'm from the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

I create terrorism by tricking dumb people. Further, we fulfill our goal of self-perpetuation by proactively doing this. Ruining the lives of innocent people in the progress. We truly are God.

But I digress.

The JTTF here is running a Windows 7 Launch party and I wanted to ask the computer underworld what their opinions were on this.

Thank you, and remember,
http://tip.fbi.gov <= Report your friends. Help us set them up.

Renew the PATRIOT Act. Help us violate your rights and harass innocents. Help us make their ambiguious actions seem sordid, criminal and deviant. Help justify our payroll for another year.

Sincerely,
Jack Bauer
