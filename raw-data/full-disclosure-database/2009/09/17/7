	Same here. I wanted to learn about security flaws and instead
it's just all these dumb fags pretending they've doxed some big
important person. What the fuck is this, 4chan or something? It's full
disclosure of security holes, not full disclosure of the full names of
people because they trolled the ux designer you have a crush on or
something.
	 
	Stop trying to impress everyone by saying you found some guy's
dox. Even if you really did find them, I still don't really care.
Apparently you think this weev guy is some kind of celebrity or
something, but I've never heard of him and I don't care about the little
grudge you have against him, so stop filling my inbox with you're dumb
autistic retardery. Seriously, just get a fucking blogspot account or
something and post all the shit there so I can go to my fucking inbox
and not have to sift through all this shit.

		WTF is up with this mailing list? I signed up a few
weeks ago expecting "full disclosure" of security exploits or at least
good security discussion. Instead what I got was full disclosure of how
idiotic skr1p7 k1dd13z can be.
