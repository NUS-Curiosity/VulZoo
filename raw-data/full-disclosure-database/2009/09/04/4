*blatantly ignoring "do not feed the trolls" sign*

Based solely on evidence seen on this list, n3td3v is as much a hacker as a
tea-kettle is an opera singer.

If I were a list administrator, and I had some idiot posing as an intarnetz
lawlyer threatening suit every time his name was mentioned, I'd ban his ass
too.  That's just proper forum administration.  The places where that
doesn't get quickly devolve into back and forth name calling and mindless
trollery.

*looks for road signs*

Now, which way to 4chan again?

i think john was having a "blonde moment" when he banned n3td3v.

"a momentary lapse in concentration, resulting in an embarrassing 
situation."

we're supposed to be attracting hackers to the list not banning 
them.
