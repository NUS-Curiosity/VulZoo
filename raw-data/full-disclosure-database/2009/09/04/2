Subject: Re: <VIDEO> Global Technocracy - Part 1

The real problem is both sides in this "discussion". We've got one side 
presenting a "CIA did 9/11" style of conspiracy theory, and the other 
side presenting a flawed, ad-hominem response. 

I always find it ridiculous whenever someone says that there's a grand 
conspiracy of technocrats ruling the world. The world is waaay too 
irrational for that to be the case.
