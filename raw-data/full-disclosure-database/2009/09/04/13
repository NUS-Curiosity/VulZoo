And that's also ignoring the fact that you don't have to scan for things 
that you know you're not exposed/vulnerable to. For example, I don't 
take precautions against Feline Immunodeficiency Virus, because I know 
it can't infect humans. I also don't take precautions against Ebola or 
Smallpox because the chance I'd be exposed to them is vanishingly small.

In the same way, I don't worry about IIS threats - I'm not running an 
IIS server. I'm not worried about threats to Outlook - its not my mail 
client.  I don't worry about boot sector virii from the late 80s/early 
90s - they're far too rare to spend time on.  Likewise, I don't care 
about threats against which I've already applied vendor patches or 
service packs.  The total number of threats may be growing 
exponentially, but once you factor in the growing immunity of my 
computer system to said threats, the number of outstanding threats 
(things for which I don't have immunity, and are capable of infecting my 
machine) drops to a much more manageable level.
