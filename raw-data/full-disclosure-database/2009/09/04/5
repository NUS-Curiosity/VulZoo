Subject: Re: windows future

Hi All,

Sorry for the delay, I had some urgent migration planning to attend 
to ... ;)  Stats below.  Short version: evacuate.  Long version:

- stats are in, exponential curve is real, see it for yourself here:

http://eval.symantec.com/mktginfo/enterprise/white_papers/b-whitepaper_internet_security_threat_report_xiv_04-2009.en-us.pdf

(page 10)

- I also added up the numbers at 
http://www.virusbtn.com/resources/malwareDirectory/prevalence/index.xml?year=2009
... exponential curve also visible, though I think their stats are 
dodgy, their website is already suffering from math limits - it is 
reporting current yearly stats as NaN% (Not A Number).

- average rate of change per year (annual growth rate), calculated 
from Symantec's chart: 243%

- approximate date when number of NEW threats reached 1 Million: 2008

- approximate date when number of NEW threats will reach 1 Billion: 
2015

- approximate date when number of NEW threats will reach 2 Billion: 
2016

- charts showing this: 
http://www.cyberdelix.net/files/malware_mutation_projection.pdf

- will the AV companies be able to classify 1 billion new threats per 
year? that is 2.739 MILLION new threats per DAY (over 1900 new 
threats per minute).

- will your computer cope with scanning every EXE, DLL, PIF etc 1 
billion times, every time you use them?

- aside from the theoretical limits imposed by hardware and software, 
there is one extra limit, imposed by users.  Users will not tolerate 
machines operating slowly, and will seek alternative platforms well 
before 100% CPU utilisation (either as a direct result of the size of 
the blacklist, or indirectly caused by swapping due to low RAM).  
This user limit might be lower than 20% CPU utilisation.  If users 
figure out that 20% of their time is being wasted, and rising fast, 
they will run for the exit.

- will you tolerate your machine constantly processing a list a 
billion items long?

- do you plan to, and can you afford to, upgrade your compute power 
by 243%, every year?

- will you do this, even though you know viable alternative platforms 
exist, at less total cost to yourself?

- if you're already irritated that AV is slowing down your machine, 
consider that malware levels will be 500 times higher in approx 5 
years (assuming growth rates continue at 243%). That means your AV 
will be running 500 times slower.  Unless you upgrade your machine by 
500 x current (eg. to an effective speed of approx 1000 GHz), your 
machine is going to slow down even more.  Given that chipmakers don't 
seem to be able to get much past 5GHz, without melting the die, that 
means you'll need 200 of today's processors, just for malware 
filtering, by 2015.

- Moore's Law says compute power doubles (200%) every 24 months.  
However, malware is growing at 243% every 12 months.  Thus it is 
already exceeding Moore's Law, by a massive margin.  I suspect this 
means this race is unwinnable, and we should give up now, and devote 
our resources to something sustainable.

- how AV writers will generate 2.7 million new threats/day: 

"Evolvable Malware":
http://www.genetic-programming.org/hc2009/3-Noreen/Noreen-Presentation.ppt

"A Field Guide to Genetic Programming":
http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/

Wiki:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming

- the insecurity of Windows creates a public space, of sorts, an area 
of common ground, with shared ownership - and this is thus 
susceptible to the tragedy of the commons ... 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons ... so no, I 
don't think malware authors will slow down the mutation rate, so as 
to prolong the life of the platform, they do not work together.  As 
Messagelabs puts it, "there's no honour amongst thieves" ... 
http://www.messagelabs.com/mlireport/MLIReport_Annual_2008_FINAL.pdf

- the greenhouse emissions caused by billions of computers checking 
billions of items for billions of malware are likely to be 
measurable, and will increasingly erode the world's ability to meet 
environmental targets

- my own maths might be dodgy, please check it, spreadsheet:
