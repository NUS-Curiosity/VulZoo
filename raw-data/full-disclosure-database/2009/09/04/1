Look, not everyone is a native English speaker. Not everyone has 
ideas that you agree with, and to be honest I thought that this 
post was kind of a bunch of mumbo jumbo that no one really cares 
about.

However, before trying to get all "leeter-than-thou," why don't you 
try considering the concepts being presented to you and acting like 
a normal human being.

The annoying part of this thread isn't the barely-legible writing 
about security, it's the fool that thinks he knows everything 
posting lyrics to some stupid Chamillionaire song as a sig on EVERY 
POST.
