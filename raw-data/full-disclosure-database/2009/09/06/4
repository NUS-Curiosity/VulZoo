Note that there are some well-established limitations on the freedom of
speech.  The one that is of concern here is the freedom of others to not
support speech they don't approve of.  You're allowed to get on a soapbox
at the corner and talk away, you're allowed to print up leaflets at your
own expense and hand them out.  However, in general there is *no* requirement
that newspapers print your letters to the editor, nor is there one that
TV and radio stations have to give you a show. You're allowed to spend your
own money and resources to get your message out - you're in general not
allowed to insist that anybody else spend their money and resource on
your message.

There's no requirement that the people footing the bill for the list have to
give *everybody* access. Although the stated *goal* is to let as many different
opinions be heard as possible, the list admins are within their rights to do
some pruning to keep the signal/noise ratio within workable limits.

The few people who aren't allowed to post to the list are free to go find some
other forum.

The few people who are upset that some people are banned are eligible for
a full refund of all the money they paid to join this list.
