You and thousands of other bozos.  You're in good company though.  There's 
a whole pantheon of idiots worldwide who think they should be able to 
impose their ideas on others.

Freedom of speech refers to freedom from governmental repression of 
speech, especially in the political arena.  It has absolutely nothing to 
do with repression of speech on a privately owned mailing list, any bars 
or restaurants you might frequent or even your friend's house.

If you want freedom of speech on a mailing list, start your own.  Then you 
get to make the rules.

Go back to school, pay attention this time, and try to learn the 
difference between public and private ownership.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
