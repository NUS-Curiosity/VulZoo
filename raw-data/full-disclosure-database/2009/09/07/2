Synopsis
========

A processing error in libvorbis might result in the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

libvorbis is the reference implementation of the Xiph.org Ogg Vorbis
audio file format. It is used by many applications for playback of Ogg
Vorbis files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libvorbis       < 1.2.3                       >= 1.2.3

Description
===========

Lucas Adamski reported that libvorbis does not correctly process file
headers, related to static mode headers and encoding books.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to play a specially crafted OGG
Vorbis file using an application that uses libvorbis, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libvorbis users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =media-libs/libvorbis-1.2.3

References
==========
