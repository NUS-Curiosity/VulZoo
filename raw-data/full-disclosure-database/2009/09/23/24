Subject: Re: Chargebacks and credit card frauds

As others have mentioned, you have to assume the machines are
compromised. This means you should use another channel for
authorization of each transaction (depending on the use of your
website,  only authenticating the user through this channel could be
enough but this is more risky and vulnerable).

I would say the most cost effective one is probably to use SMS/cell
phones.  You would send an SMS with the transaction details and a
verification code to be entered on the website for finalizing the
transaction. If the state/country given by the phone number doesn't
match the billing address, you throw a red flag as you did before.

So if an adversary wanted to cheat, he would need to enter a cell
phone from the same region/country. Assuming he can find infested
machines in the same country, this is not really difficult, still it's
new and makes it harder. Of course, the main advantage is that in many
countries, it's not easy nowadays to get a prepaid cell phone without
giving any IDs for instance, so this might act as a deterrent. A
better (but more expensive and slower) solution though would be to
authenticate the cell phone number through postal mail at setup
time/when changing the cell number.
