Subject: Re: Dumb question: Is Windows box behind a router
 safe ?

That's sort of an old-school question :-)  It only prevents classic
infections (slammer, blaster, nachi, etc) or newer equivalents (SMB2 on
Vista).

The more appropriate question would be "Is a Windows box safe with a
user behind it?" since today's threats require that you browse to the
danger, or click an "OK" button first :-)
