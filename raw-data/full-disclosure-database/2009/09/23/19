Steven, your should send your questions to a more adequate mailing list like
security basics http://www.securityfocus.com/archive

"This list is intended for the discussion of various security issues, all
for the security beginner. It is a place to learn the ropes in a
non-intimidating environment, and even a place for people who may be experts
in one particular field but are looking to increase their knowledge in other
areas of information security.

The Security-Basics mailing list is meant to assist those responsible for
securing individual systems (including their own home computer) and small
LANs. This includes but is not limited to small companies, home-based
businesses, and home users. This list is designed for people who are not
necessarily security experts. As such, it is also an excellent resource for
the beginner who wants a non-threatening place to learn the ropes."
