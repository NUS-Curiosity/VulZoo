Subject: Re: Dumb question: Is Windows box behind a router
 safe ?

Steve really needs to ask himself, if all his pop does is run Firefox
and email, why he's running Windows on that machine at all? Not safer
per se, but a less meaty target. Still needs a nightly auto-update, though.

Also, (hi, John) filtering egress is pretty well moot on $home_router,
most connectbacks these days go out on 80 or 443. IRC control channels
are so last year.

Also, Steve, there's a list for this sort of thing, not that it matters:
