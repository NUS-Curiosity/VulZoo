Hello Tõnu!

I'm glad that you liked my article (and advisories) about Cross-Site
Scripting attacks via redirectors.

You can read my next article on English - Redirectors: the phantom menace
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3495/).

> And do not forget, this is feature, not bug :P

First, vulnerability it's not the same as bug, these are different things.
And so in security field words such as vulnerabilities, vulns and holes must
be used, but not "bugs" (to not decrease their level of criticality to
ordinary software errors which are bugs).

Second, you are right, it's feature (and it was well-known aphorism).
Especially it's feature in hacker's hands ;-).

Best wishes & regards,
MustLive
