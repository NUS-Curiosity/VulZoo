Prepaids can be had in the US and Canada sans ID. Fake IDs cheap, easy to get.

DIDs are cheap, usually free.

How many of those nett'd households have VoIP phone service? Hijack
inbounds for re-routing to your own (free) SIP server provider?

Implementing some sort of automated call verification service is expensive, CBA?

Credit cards are insecure, you're playing cat and mouse games until
your checks become too invasive for end consumers. Perhaps you insist
on a verifying payment gateway and flag all other transactions for
manual processing in addition to adding new lists for IP checks.

Glorious,
