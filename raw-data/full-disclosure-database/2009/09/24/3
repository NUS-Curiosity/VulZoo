      Computer forensics is the collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer related evidence. Far more information is retained on a computer than most people realize. Computer forensics is one of the fastest growing segments of the industry. A sophisticated computer forensics strategy can literally save a company millions in litigations costs and, in some instances, their hard-earned reputation.



      The special two-day event will include exhibits of the latest developments in the IT security marketplace, as well as a full conference schedule of top-flight guest speakers, discussion groups and training sessions to provide attendees with important information about the latest technological advancement, ideas and practical information available today.



      Every day brings changes to the IT security marketplace, and the Computer Forensics Show is specifically geared to showcasing the latest technological advances and trends. The show will feature exhibits as well as a comprehensive and engaging conference program with the involvement of leading edge companies: Kroll Ontrack Inc., McAfee Corporation, Symantec Corporation, Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP, Clearwell Systems Inc., HB Gary Inc., Guidance Software Inc. and EMC Corporation.
