Subject: Attacks via redirectors

Hello participants of Full-Disclosure!

In case if you don't read WASC Mailing List, where I often make 
announcements of my articles (or even post articles directly to the list), 
then I want to inform you about my two last articles on English, which I 
already wrote about in WASC Mailing List. These articles about attacks with 
using of redirectors.

Redirectors: the phantom menace
http://websecurity.com.ua/3495/

Attacks via closed redirectors
http://websecurity.com.ua/3531/

First article is anthology of attacks with using of open redirectors. Second 
article is anthology of attacks with using of closed redirectors. They are 
designed to draw attention of people to dangers of redirectors.

Best wishes & regards,
