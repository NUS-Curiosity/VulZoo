Revision: 1.0
=========

For Public Release 2009 September 25 1500 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Cisco Response
==============

This is the Cisco PSIRT response to the statements made by Alejandro
Hernandez H. in his advisory: "Cisco ACE XML Gateway <= 6.0 Internal
IP disclosure".

The original email/advisory is available at 
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Sep/0369.html 

Cisco would like to thank Alejandro Hernandez H. for discovering and
reporting this vulnerability to Cisco.

This response is posted at the following link:

Additional Information
======================

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID: CSCtb82159.

For customers without access to Cisco's Bug Toolkit, the full Release
Note for Cisco Bug ID CSCtb82159 has been made available here, as
follows:

Symptom
+------

When generating a "Message-handling Errors" message, if an
appropriate error handler is not found, the response discloses the
Cisco ACE XML Gateway (AXG) and the Cisco ACE Web Application
Firewall (WAF) client internal IP address.

Conditions
+---------

All versions prior to system software version 6.1 are vulnerable.

This vulnerability affects the Cisco ACE XML Gateway and the Cisco
ACE Web Application Firewall.

Though the response by itself does not provide any way to compromise
the device, this behavior discloses potentially valuable information
about the internal network structure.

The disclosed address is not the address of the AXG or WAF, it is an
address of its client, which in many cases is a load balancer.

The Internal IP address is included in the message-handling errors
response if AXG or WAF was not able to find a matching handler for
the request.

Workaround
+---------

There is currently no workaround for this vulnerability.

Further Problem Description
+--------------------------

System software version 6.1 is expected to be available in November
2009.
