I'd have expected that PSIRT knew about it before...

Well, in the greater scheme of things, it's not "thrown into chaos" level of
bug.  It's just information leakage.  How serious it *reallu* is depends on
what the attacker can do with the info - it tells them an IP and a guess at
a subnet that probably has *other* high-value targets on it.

Now where it gets *fun* is if you already have a box on the *inside*, but
need more recon info on the network layout.  At that point, it could become
"Well, I pwned a desktop in 192.168.117/24 - but it looks like the *good*
stuff may be over in 10.95.12/22."
