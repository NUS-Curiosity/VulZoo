Isn't nipper that little application to parse through your cisco configs
and look for errors?  Looks like the dev wanted to make some money:

Nipper  Up to 5 devices  	1 Year  £100
Nipper 	Up to 10 devices 	1 Year 	£180
Nipper 	Up to 50 devices 	1 Year 	£600
Nipper 	Up to 100 devices 	1 Year 	£1000
Nipper 	Up to 500 devices 	1 Year 	£3000
Nipper 	Up to 1000 devices 	1 Year 	£5000
Nipper 	Unlimited devices 	1 Year 	£7000

>>From $161 bucks a year for 5 devices up to $11312 for unlimited per
year...looks like the dev wanted to make a lot of money :D  Good luck dev.

James
