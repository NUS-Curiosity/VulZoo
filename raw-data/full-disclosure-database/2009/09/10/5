I'm not sure what _I_ would do facing such a crisis, but I think the 
best thing for _you_ to do is hire n3td3v and Gary McKinnon's lawyer 
(s/he has been posting to this list lately, so should be easy to track 
down), and then get those two uber hackers to help as well -- they'll 
be much more help _to you_ than any private eye ever will...
