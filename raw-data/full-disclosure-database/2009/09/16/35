What do you mean Sherrod *was* a fed?

Obviously the point wasn't to ruin. The point was to salt the earth by filling google with your real name.

I can now officially say the (Google) Earth has been salted for you. You'll never be able to live a real life again. You'll always be hiding in the shadows for the rest of your life now.

In may not hit you now, but eventually you'll feeling suffering and despair.

I'm the one who helped in the process of clipping your wings to keep your grounded. To leave you in the world where mediocrity will never come.

You are a monster for what you did to Kathy... She's a great UX designer and a beautiful woman...

Sincerely,

Tim O'Reilly

Btw all dogs go to heaven was awesome you fucking faggot
