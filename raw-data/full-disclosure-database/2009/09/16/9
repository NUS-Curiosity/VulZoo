To be precise, Chrome does *not* have a built-in feed reader, and
instead, attempts to render the payload as a generic XML/HTML document
- which causes the behavior observed. The behavior of Chrome, MSIE6,
and Opera is actually covered for a longer while in Browser Security
Handbook:

http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part1#Other_built-in_document_formats

More specifically, this is outlined in the "Is generic XML document
support present?", "Is RSS feed support present?", "Is ATOM feed
support present?", "Does JavaScript execute within feeds?", and "Are
javascript: or data: URLs permitted in feeds?" tests.

There are also some interesting details related to SVG and other XML
formats along these same lines.
