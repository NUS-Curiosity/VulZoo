	ATOM/RSS reader with Script Execution and more

Hi Michal,

Thanks for clarifying the feed reader functionality in Chrome and link to
the browser security handbook. The browser security handbook is a great
resource, sorry, I missed reading that section on RSS.

A question I had was it mentions Opera browser does not render javascript
inside feeds, whereas I found that it does. Also, for Chrome, now since it
has removed script rendering part completely, I think the handbook might
need a slight update for both Opera and Chrome in next version revision.

Thanks for your efforts in developing such a useful resource for the
community. 

Thanks and Regards,

To be precise, Chrome does *not* have a built-in feed reader, and
instead, attempts to render the payload as a generic XML/HTML document
- which causes the behavior observed. The behavior of Chrome, MSIE6,
and Opera is actually covered for a longer while in Browser Security
Handbook:

http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part1#Other_built-in_document_forma
ts

More specifically, this is outlined in the "Is generic XML document
support present?", "Is RSS feed support present?", "Is ATOM feed
support present?", "Does JavaScript execute within feeds?", and "Are
javascript: or data: URLs permitted in feeds?" tests.

There are also some interesting details related to SVG and other XML
formats along these same lines.

Cheers,
