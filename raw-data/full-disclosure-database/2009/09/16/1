[First, sorry for spawning a new thread -- I just joined the list to  
post this]

About 2 weeks ago, I decided to have them "hack" my account.  I just  
got a not-too-poorly-done spoof email for an email login portal/ 
greeting card mashup.  Granted, GMail would never actually do  
something like this, but it's enough to fool the layperson.

Tried msn.html and yahoo.html -- no go.
