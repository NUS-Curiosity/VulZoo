Apparently MS either:

a)  believes that people/employees on a LAN would NEVER EVER do anything
naughty or;
b)  that hostbased firewalls should be enabled on ALL workstations
regardless if they are behind corporate firewall/nat/etc...

Either way....remote code or DoS, it's still a timebomb.  PCI DSS requires
these types of things to be patched or mitigated (compensating control) if
placed in the cardholder data environment.  Looks like no patch means a
lot of extra work for companies taking debit/credit and running XP.
