You know all those rich rock stars?  They don't get that way selling records
and CDs - they usually *lose* money to the record companies.  They get rich
touring (often with corporate sponsorship) and selling the t-shirts at the
concert.

So yes, you *can* make quite a good living off ads and tshirts.
