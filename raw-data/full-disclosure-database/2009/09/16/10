What? I'll admit that I know very little about this, but I do know that
Osama Bin Laden is the founder of al-Qaeda, and al-Qaeda is definitely
responsible for the 9/11 attacks. He's also still on the FBI's top ten
most wanted list
(http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/fugitives/fugitives.htm), which I
think means that they are interested in catching him.
