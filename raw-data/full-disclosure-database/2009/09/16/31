Subject: Re: 3rd party patch for XP for MS09-048?

It's only "default" for people running XP standalone/consumer that are 
not even in a home network settings.

That kinda slices and dices that default down to a VERY narrow sub sub 
sub set of customer base.

(Bottom line, yes, the marketing team definitely got a hold of that 
bulletin)

Say "THERE WILL BE NO PATCH, EVER.  HERE'S EVERYTHING WE KNOW SO YOU CAN DETERMINE YOUR OWN RISK."  Also, don't say 'you can deploy firewall settings via group policy to mitigate exposure' when the firewall obviously must be accepting network connections to get the settings in the first place. If all it takes is any listening service, then you have issues.  It's like telling me that "the solution is to take the letter 'f' out of the word "solution."

If you are going to try to boot sales of Win7 to corporate customers by providing free XP VM technology and thus play up how important XP is and how many companies still depend upon it for business critical application compatibility, don't deploy that technology in an other-than-default configuration that is subject to a DoS exploit while downplaying the extent that the exploit may be leveraged by saying that a "typical" default configuration mitigates it while choosing not to ever patch it.    Seems like simple logic points to me.
