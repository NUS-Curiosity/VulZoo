the site you pastes the *reason* they are looking for Osama are bombings in
1998! It has nothing to to with 9/11, which was an inside job.

Also, Al-Qaeda was NOT founded by Osama bin laden. The term describes a list
of people who where  trained by the US-Government (nsa or whatnot) after the
russian left afghanistan. This was years before 2000. The name a-qaeda
actually has the meaning of "database".

You can look that up on the net as well.

You have been misinformed by the people with responibility.
