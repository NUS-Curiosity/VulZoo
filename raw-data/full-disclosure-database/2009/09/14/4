I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
My criminal justice training is my cause

I will travel across the lands
searching far and wide
with pokemon to understand
THE POWER THAT'S INSIDE

POKEMON gotta catch em all (it's you and me)
YOU KNOW ITS MY TEST IN ME
Ohh I have no friends
In a world I must defend
