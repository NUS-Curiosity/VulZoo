Subject: Re: Windows Vista/7 : SMB2.0 NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL
 REQUEST Remote B.S.O.D.

Scratch that - the version of 2008 I had wasn't an official R2 release. So
original reports still hold. It didn't crash my R2 build 7600.

Laurent, et al, has this been tried against an Itanium machine? Just
curious. Nobody at work will let me test the exploit against their Itanium
servers.
