Subject: Presentation of Message-ID Fingerprinting Tool

Hello,

Within penetration tests client-oriented attacks become more and more
important.

I have created a script which is able to determine the mail client from
the message-id which is included in an email. Midfp (Message-ID
Fingerprinter) is going to analyze the structure of the message-id and
compare it with regular expressions against a data base. Thus, no
further analysis of the email (e.g. the header structures as like in my
browserrecon project; http://www.computec.ch/projekte/browserrecon/) is
required.
