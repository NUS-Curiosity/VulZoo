Subject: Distribution of passwords between man and women

Hi all kind of bad people in this list.

Want to share weird thing I discovered today: Men have MUCH worse
passwords than females. There is a user database where men to woman
ratio is 5.2:1 but men but use last name more often as password. Ratio
is 6.2:1. When it somes to bad password like "123456", men used it on
9.3:1 ratio. More details I put on page:

If you want me run more queries on this DB, mail me in private back and
publish them too on same page.

  Tõnu
