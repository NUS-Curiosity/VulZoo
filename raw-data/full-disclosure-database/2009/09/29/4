Hey

at first excuse my bad english. Thats a nice fix. But you need to change
the code for other plugins or files. This code works for all files which
should not be loaded directly:

if (basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']) == basename(__FILE__))
	exit('Please do not load this page directly');

If your webhoster don't have a configuration panel you can try to
disable errors with this in your index.php:

ini_set('display_errors', 0);

I'am no sure if it works if save mode is activated. Try it or look at
the PHP manual.

Regards

Loaden
