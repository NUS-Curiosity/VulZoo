4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft 
PowerPoint, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise 
a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by an array-indexing error in the 
Microsoft PowerPoint Freelance Windows 2.1 Translator (FL21WIN.DLL) 
when parsing layout information and can be exploited to cause a 
heap-based buffer overflow.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

NOTE: On systems with MS09-017 applied, support for Freelance files 
is disabled by default, but can be re-enabled via a key in the
registry.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Microsoft states that no fix will be issued. However, installations 
with MS09-017 applied block opening of Freelance files by default.

Users having enabled Freelance file support should not open Freelance
files from untrusted sources.

====================================================================== 
6) Time Table 

22/05/2009 - Vendor notified.
23/05/2009 - Vendor response.
03/06/2009 - Vendor informs that no security bulletin will be issued
             as Freelance files are blocked by default after applying
             MS09-017.
04/06/2009 - Vendor informed that Secunia agrees that a new security
             bulletin is not required. It is, however, recommended to
             update MS09-017 to inform users that Freelance support 
             has been disabled by default and should not be re-enabled
             as the translator is affected by a critical 
             vulnerability.
10/06/2009 - Public disclosure.
