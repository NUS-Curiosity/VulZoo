Subject: [SA-GOOGLE-420] Leslie Hawthorn - Geek herder,
	druggy, pervert. Not so cool.

Some of you may know who I am. I've contributed code various FLOSS projects and have headed teams at various fortune 500 companies. You could imagine I am quite partial of Google for their extraordinary help to open initiatives. I also am a "cyber sleuth", here's my story:

This author was about to read the reviews on shamwow (www.shamwow.com) on a complaint site when I saw a Google complaint. *Click*  Leslie Hawthorn, self-described "Geek herder", allegedly is engaging in immoral and possibly illegal activity, while caring to minors in the open source community. I didn't believe it, but then again...

It seems that just *anyone* today can just call themselves "FLOSS advocate". This Berkeley english major "pothead" wanted to get a busy, but nonetheless, easy job. However I'm not here to discuss why she's not a FLOSS person, because noone gives a shit.

So instead of complaining to HR and getting fired (or harassed by her chatroom friends), I may as well use this as evidence to corroborate my claims:

Leslie hawthorn is an Employee at Google Inc. in Mountain View, CA. Through the internet openly admits to:
	1.) Being a "Fuck master"
	2.) "Sometimes" doing drugs
	3.) Being a "weekend warrior"  (Doing recreational drugs on the weekends)
	4.) Her job, which includes working around minors
	5.) Her picture shows she is definitely a 10/10 in looks (www.twitter.com/lhawthorn)
	6.) A lot of idle brown-nosing

I wanted to inquire with California authorities, Google, and Leslie Hawthorn on drug policy in the United States.  Also federal law regarding minors (GHOP has had students as young as 13), admitting drug normal use of recreational drugs ("Weekend warrior") and sex ("Fuck master") by group organizers over interstate communicae.

Explain this to the mothers and fathers. Explain this to the children who get to grow up fast. They probably didn't expect buying into that. Heh. *blacks out*

How many crimes can you do, or openly admit you engage in, until Google puts their foot down?

Because right now I'm 99% sure you can get a job at Google if you fly around the world free, present powerpoints, garble 5-pound bags of fun-size snickers and twitter all day, even if you openly admit to criminal behavior. Leslie's job specifically entails flying around the world, staying at hotels and eating room service. God knows if she does drugs there. She just got back from The Netherlands. Her recent "charm" was a statement about a tabby cat.

She's respected because she's a brown noser (she constantly reminds the world "life is good" via twitter. Please.) But that doesn't mean jack. These are children. Innocent families have lost their lives to drug cartels (So much for empathy, peace and love). I'm not getting fooled by this trash. This is egregious. This is gross.

Does the criminal statute in California allow drugs?

I'm confused. Baffled. Can you just brown nose your way out of laws and immorality? Guess so.

Since the complaints have been posted, Leslie has began nervously twittering away on the information super highway (hereinafter "ISH"). Obviously this is troubling her. Some... shall we say, guilt?

Just saying...

I am concerned because a mom found that her 14 year old - a google highly open participation student - was googling "Fuck master". The mother found Leslie's OKCupid profile in there.

Nice.
