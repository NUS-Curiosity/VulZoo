ZDI-09-042: Adobe Reader U3D RHAdobeMeta Stack Overflow Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-042
June 10, 2009

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-1855

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Acrobat

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious web address or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists when parsing malformed U3D model files
contained in a PDF. When a specially crafted extension block of a model
is processed, insufficient bounds checking is done before a call to
wcsncpy(). Because of this a stack overflow can occur resulting in
reliable code execution. Proper exploitation of this vulnerability will
result in system compromise under the credentials of the currently
logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
