Subject: PAPER: Evading network-level emulation

ABSTRACT

Recently more and more attention has been paid to the intrusion detection 
systems (IDS) which don't rely on signature based detection approach. Such 
solutions try to increase their defense level by using heuristics detection 
methods like network-level emulation. This technique allows the intrusion 
detection systems to stop unknown threats, which normally couldn't be 
stopped by standard signature detection techniques.

In this article author will describe general concepts of network-level 
emulation technique including its advantages and disadvantages (weak sides) 
together with providing potential countermeasures against this type of 
detection method.
