	Double Angel Quotation Mark bypass?

Has %uff1c %uff1e become very common? I have found a few places where these
are still exploitable. Sometime in the coming week I will post my
observation from one particular encounter of this vulnerability to get some
responses on what, why and how it is happening.

This email gave a good head start.....

Cheers,
Prasad Shenoy
