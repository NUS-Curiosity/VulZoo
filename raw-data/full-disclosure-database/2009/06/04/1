Subject: CYBSEC-Labs: New sapyto release - Windows support
	and more!

Dear colleague,

We are pleased to announce that a new sapyto version (v0.99-Public_Edition) is ready.
sapyto is the first and unique SAP Penetration Testing Framework, which assists security professionals in assessing the security level of these
business-critical systems.

There have been many changes in this version, being some of the most important ones:

	. Windows support! Now sapyto runs on Windows 2000/2003/XP/Vista.
	. Automatic connector discovery and target configuration.
	. The so-far-missing sapyto's User Guide.
	. Vulnerability reporting and analysis.
	. Improved CLI with autocompletion, better help and presentation.
	. Architecture changed quite a bit, in order to support for upcoming releases (GUI).
	. New plugins for discovering SAP Application Servers, assess SAP/Oracle implementations and more ...

You can download sapyto directly from http://www.cybsec.com/sapyto

We hope you enjoy this new release.
As always, comments, bug reports, feature requests and new ideas are more than welcome and will be seriously considered.

sapyto v1.00 (with a nice GUI and many more features) is just around the corner... Stay tuned!

Best Regards,


Mariano Nu√±ez Di Croce
