Brief Technical Details:

  The Nokia 6212 Classic mobile phone is a mobile phone featuring the
  Near Field Communication (NFC) technology (http://www.nfc-forum.org).
  The phone has multiple security vulnerabilities in the code that parses
  and displays the content of a NDEF tags and plain URI tags.

  1) URI Spoofing (using plain URI tags)

   Long URLs are short end by removing the end of the URL replacing it
   with "..." (3 dots). This behavior can be abused for spoofing the
   URL that is displayed to the user. This way an attacker can trick
   a user into loading a malicious website. Also the phone does not
   display the URL of the website (URL can be looked up through a menu
   option).

   Spoofing works using the classic @ method. Certain characters are
   not allowed before the @ such as: /

   Example:
    http://www.example.com......@...liner.org:6666

    Will be displayed as: http://www.example.com....


  2) NDEF Record Parser Crash

   The NDEF Record parser crashes if the record payload length field
   contains either 0xFFFFFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFE

   The crash will reboot the GUI of the phone. After 4 reboots in a row
   the phone will switch off completely (e.g. user constantly trying to
   read the tag containing this value).
