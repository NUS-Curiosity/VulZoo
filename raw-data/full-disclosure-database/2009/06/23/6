Overview:

Quoting http://www.apple.com/safari/:
"What is Safari ?
It's a browser. It's a platform. It's an open invitation to innovate. 
Whether on a Mac, PC, iPhone, or iPod touch, Safari continuously 
redefines the browser, providing the most enjoyable way to experience 
the Internet."



Description:

A Null Class Pointer Dereference in CoreFoundation.dll has been found
while parsing a URL fragment with a high-bit character in a common 
protocol handler.

In detail, the following flaw was determined:

- Safari crashes in method CFCharacterSetInitInlineBuffer because the 
  first passed pointer argument (stored in ecx) was not sanized. 
  Hence dereferencing a null pointer Sarafi will crash.

  Excerpt from stack trace:
    CoreFoundation!CFCharacterSetInitInlineBuffer+0x357
    CoreFoundation!CFURLCopyFileSystemPath+0xf3
    CoreFoundation!CFURLGetWideFileSystemRepresentation+0x23
    CFNetwork!CFHTTPMessageSendRequest+0x6e4
    CFNetwork!CFHTTPMessageSendRequest+0x96e
    CFNetwork!CFHTTPMessageSendRequest+0xad2
    CFNetwork!CFURLConnectionSendSynchronousRequest+0x8d7
    CFNetwork!CFStreamErrorFromCFError+0x9a0
    ntdll!RtlpAllocateFromHeapLookaside+0x42
    ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap+0x1c2


Impact

An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by constructing a specially
prepared website. When a user views the web page an unexpected 
application termination occurs. 
Kindly note: Whether this circumstance leads to an exploitable condition 
             was not closer investigated.
