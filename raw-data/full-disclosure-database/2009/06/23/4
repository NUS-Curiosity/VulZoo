SNOsoft - Blosoft - GLOsoft - Awesome!

Normally we wouldn't give an iota of attention to trolls, but there's  
always the exception to the rule. The past two advisories that we  
(Netragard/SNOsoft) released have been followed up by a troll  
publishing hilarious spoofs of those advisories. So far the spoofs  
they've released can be found here and are called "BloSoft" and  
"GloSoft". We're actually proud (and flattered) that these trolls  
think that we're important enough to spoof because that's a testament  
to our success as a security company. To us, its sort of like being  
the target subject for a Saturday Night Live skit. So for the first  
time ever, thank you to the troll whoever you are!
