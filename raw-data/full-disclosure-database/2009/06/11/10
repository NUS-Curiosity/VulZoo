Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.11.09: Microsoft
 Excel SST Record Integer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.09.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 09, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Excel is the spreadsheet application included with Microsoft Corp.'s
Office productivity software suite. More information is available at
the following website:

http://office.microsoft.com/excel/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Excel could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing a Shared String Table (SST) record
inside of an Excel file. This record is used to hold a table of strings
that are used inside of the document. One of the fields in this record
is a 32-bit integer that represents the number of unique strings in the
table. This value is used to allocate an array of pointers to the
strings contained inside of the table. When allocating this array, an
integer overflow occurs in the calculation of its size. This leads to a
heap based buffer overflow when the array is filled with pointers to
strings from the file.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious
file. This is typically accomplished by emailing a user the file, or
embedding it inside of a web page.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in all
currently supported versions of Excel, this includes:

  Excel 2000 SP3 (Excel.exe version 9.0.0.8974)

  Excel 2003 SP3 (Excel.exe version 11.0.8237.0
  Excel 2007 SP1 (Excel.exe version 12.0.6331.5000)

All patches as of February 2009 were applied.

V. WORKAROUND

MOICE tool and/or disabling legacy binary file support. More
information about these workarounds can be found within their security
bulletin.
