Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.11.09: Microsoft
 Active Directory Hexdecimal DN AttributeValue Invalid Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.11.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 11, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Active Directory, created by Microsoft Corp., provides a number of
network services, one of which is a Light-weight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) compatible directory service.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an invalid free vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Active Directory Server allows attackers to exhaust all virtual
memory.

According to section 2.4 of the IETF Request For Comments (rfc) 4514,
LDAP requests can contain strings that have been encoded using
hexadecimal encoding. When Active Directory on Windows 2000 encounters
such a request, it fails to release the memory associated with the
hexadecimal encoded portion of the request. By continually making such
requests, an attacker can exhaust virtual memory on the targeted
system.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to consume all available virtual memory
on the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must
be able to establish a TCP session with the vulnerable machine. LDAP
uses port 389 or, when encrypted, port 636. Additionally, LDAP requests
are processed when connecting to the Global Catalog Server on ports 3268
or 3269.

Although exhausting virtual memory does not compromise the integrity of
the system, it can allow some otherwise non-exploitable vulnerabilities
to be exploited. As long as virtual memory is exhausted, the computer
will not be able to start new programs, or do other tasks that require
allocating virtual memory.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability using a Windows
2000 SP4 domain controller with all patches available as of January
2008 applied. All versions of Active Directory installed on Windows
2000 are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected services will
mitigate exposure to this vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has released a patch which addresses this issue. For more
information, consult their advisory at the following URL:

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2009-1138 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
