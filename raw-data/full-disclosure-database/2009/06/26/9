pcapr.net has about 1500 pcaps all nice and categorized for your
downloading pleasure.   You probably could create an interesting
traffic mix with some of them.

Tcpreplay generally can do higher throughput then tomahawk, but
depending on what you mean by "stress" may or may not be appropriate.

Honestly, running either tool inside of a VM is likely to hurt performance.
