Product Name : Windows

Impact : Extremely Critical, like wtf critical
Vendor Notified : 200900622

[Product Description]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft Windows is the mostest used operating system in this universe.
Whilst some may take humour in this statement the odds of you not using
Windows are almost the equivalent of Kevin Finnestere complaining that
you haven't acknowledged his blackness.


[Technical Summary]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows (all versions) are vulnerable to the following attacks:

Administrator logins

While performing our advanced superwowzer hackerfying analysis it was
noticed that if we booted using NT Recovery disks, we were able to reset
the administrator passwords giving us soopayewser access. LOMFG!


[Impact]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Impact varies from installation to installation]

- r00t

[Proof Of Concept]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not offer proofs of concept. We solely do this using aliases after
we have tried to blackmail companies into paying us to not disclose their
vulnerabilities.

Based on information provided by Gil Novak to HP concerning aliases
utilized by SnoSoft, we understand that this action was taken by an
agent of SnoSoft despite SnoSoft's representations that it intended to
comply with the industry standard practice of reporting its findings to
CERT and despite the ongoing discussions between Gil Novak and Rich Boren
on this issue.
