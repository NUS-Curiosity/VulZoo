To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that
of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others,
who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is
to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, ‘the
guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, & the
fruits acquired by it.'
