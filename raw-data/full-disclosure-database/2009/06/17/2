3APA3A,

I was actually *agreeing* with you! lols. I think something got lost
in translation! Sorry if I confused anyone really.

Good luck.

>>>>>
>>>>> TN> I. DESCRIPTION
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> The Netgear DG632 router has a web interface which runs on port 80.
>>>>>  This
>>>>> TN> allows an admin to login and administer the device's settings.
>>>>>  However,
>>>>> TN> a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists that causes the web
>>>>> interface
>>>>> TN> to crash and stop responding to further requests.
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> II. DETAILS
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> Within the "/cgi-bin/" directory of the administrative web interface
>>>>> exists
>>>>> TN> a
>>>>> TN> file called "firmwarecfg".  This file is used for firmware upgrades.  A
>>>>> HTTP
>>>>> TN> POST
>>>>> TN> request for this file causes the web server to hang.  The web server
>>>>> will
>>>>> TN> stop
>>>>> TN> responding to requests and the administrative interface will become
>>>>> TN> inaccessible
>>>>> TN> until the router is physically restarted.
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> While the router will still continue to function at the network level,
>>>>> i.e.
>>>>> TN> it will
>>>>> TN> still respond to ICMP echo requests and issue leases via DHCP, an
>>>>> TN> administrator will
>>>>> TN> no longer be able to interact with the administrative web interface.
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> This attack can be carried out internally within the network, or over
>>>>> the
>>>>> TN> Internet
>>>>> TN> if the administrator has enabled the "Remote Management" feature on the
>>>>> TN> router.
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> Affected Versions: Firmware V3.4.0_ap (others unknown)
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> III. VENDOR RESPONSE
>>>>>
>>>>> TN> 12 June, 2009 - Contacted vendor.
>>>>> TN> 15 June, 2009 - Vendor responded.  Stated the DG632 is an end of life
>>>>> TN> product and is no
>>>>> TN> longer supported in a production and development sense, as such, there
>>>>> will
>>>>> TN> be no further
>>>>> TN> firmware releases to resolve this issue.
