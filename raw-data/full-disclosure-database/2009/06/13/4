I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ikarus Software GMBH is an Anti-virus company based in Austria.

II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parsing engine can be bypassed by a specially crafted and formated
RAR (Headflags and Packsize),ZIP (Filelenght) and CAB (Filesize) archive.

III. Impact

The bug results in denying the engine the possibility to inspect
code within the CAb,RAR,ZIP archives. There is no inspection of content
