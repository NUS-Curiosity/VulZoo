Subject: Blog Security Research - Taking almost 2k blogs
	to a security test

We just finished a research to determine if bloggers are taking the
security of their sites seriously.

We randomly selected 1747 blogs from the blog catalog and scanned them
to see how secure they are. The results are interesting...
