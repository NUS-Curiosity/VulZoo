ZDI-09-031: Multiple Vendor libpurple MSN Protocol SLP Message Heap Overflow
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-031
June 8, 2009

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-1376

-- Affected Vendors:
Adium
Pidgin

-- Affected Products:
Adium Adiumx
Pidgin Pidgin

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of messaging applications that
make use of the libpurple library. User interaction is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the implementation of the MSN protocol,
specifically the handling of SLP messages. The function
msn_slplink_process_msg() fails to properly validate an offset value
specified in the SLP packet. By providing a specific value, an attacker
can overflow a heap buffer resulting in arbitrary code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Pidgin has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
