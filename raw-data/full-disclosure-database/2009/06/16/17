Subject: WinAppDbg version 1.2 is out!

What is WinAppDbg?
==================

The WinAppDbg python module allows developers to quickly code
instrumentation
scripts in Python under a Windows environment.

It uses ctypes to wrap many Win32 API calls related to debugging, and
provides
an object-oriented abstraction layer to manipulate threads, libraries and
processes, attach your script as a debugger, trace execution, hook API
calls,
handle events in your debugee and set breakpoints of different kinds (code,
hardware and memory). Additionally it has no native code at all, making it
easier to maintain or modify than other debuggers on Windows.

The intended audience are QA engineers and software security auditors
wishing to
test / fuzz Windows applications with quickly coded Python scripts. Several
ready to use utilities are shipped and can be used for this purposes.

Current features also include disassembling x86 native code (using the open
source diStorm project, see http://ragestorm.net/distorm/), debugging
multiple
processes simultaneously and produce a detailed log of application crashes,
useful for fuzzing and automated testing.


Where can I find WinAppDbg?
===========================

The WinAppDbg project is currently hosted at Sourceforge, and can be found
at:

    http://winappdbg.sourceforge.net/

It's also hosted at the Python Package Index (PyPi):
