Subject: Re: WinAppDbg version 1.2 is out!

Basically it's got some different features than PyDbg and a more
complete documentation. If you have an *existing* project built upon
PyDbg it's probably not worth switching (unless you've hit some very
bad problem with it) but I believe it's better for newer projects, as
this new library is more flexible and scalable.

It doesn't have a fuzzing platform like Sulley. It does however have
some tools that can be useful when fuzzing, particularly one that
attaches to a program as a debugger and logs the crashes it finds,
using some simple heuristics to avoid logging the same crash twice.

Let me know if you decide to give it a try, I'll help in anything I can :)

Cheers,
-Mario
