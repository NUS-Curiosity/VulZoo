Subject: Re: Netgear DG632 Router Remote DoS Vulnerability

I know and I understand. What I wanted to mean is that we can not eventually
acces to the web interface of a netgear router remotely if we cannot localy.
As for the DoS, it is simple to solve  such attack from outside. We just
disable receiving pings (There is actually an option in even the lowest
series) and thus, we would be able to have a remote management without ICMP
requests.

>> Product Name: Netgear DG632 Router
>> Vendor: http://www.netgear.com

>>
>> I. DESCRIPTION
>>
>> The Netgear DG632 router has a web interface which runs on port 80.  This
>> allows an admin to login and administer the device's settings.  However,
>> a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists that causes the web
>> interface
>> to crash and stop responding to further requests.
>>
>> II. DETAILS
>>
>> Within the "/cgi-bin/" directory of the administrative web interface
>> exists a
>> file called "firmwarecfg".  This file is used for firmware upgrades.  A
>> HTTP POST
>> request for this file causes the web server to hang.  The web server will
>> stop
>> responding to requests and the administrative interface will become
>> inaccessible
>> until the router is physically restarted.
>>
>> While the router will still continue to function at the network level,
>> i.e. it will
>> still respond to ICMP echo requests and issue leases via DHCP, an
>> administrator will
>> no longer be able to interact with the administrative web interface.
>>
>> This attack can be carried out internally within the network, or over the
>> Internet
>> if the administrator has enabled the "Remote Management" feature on the
>> router.
>>
>> Affected Versions: Firmware V3.4.0_ap (others unknown)
>>
>> III. VENDOR RESPONSE
>>
>> 12 June, 2009 - Contacted vendor.
>> 15 June, 2009 - Vendor responded.  Stated the DG632 is an end of life
>> product and is no
>> longer supported in a production and development sense, as such, there
>> will be no further
>> firmware releases to resolve this issue.
