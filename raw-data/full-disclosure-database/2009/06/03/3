-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Terminal. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page. 

The specific flaw exists in the handling of 'CSI[4' xterm window
resizing escape code. When a very low negative value for (x, y) size is
set, an integer overflow occurs resulting in a memory corruption. This
can be further leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of
the logged in user.

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
