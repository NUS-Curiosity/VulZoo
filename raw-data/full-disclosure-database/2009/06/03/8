You must be wrong!

It's a well-known fact -- just ask any Apple fanboi -- that Macs are 
invulnerable to security exploits of any kind because they are based on 
Unix-ish and/or open source code and/or are developed by far cooler 
_and_ cleverer dudes than anyone who ever worked at MS (or anywhere 
else for that matter, except NeXT) and/or because Steve (the sun shines 
out my orifices) Jobs said so...

So, now we've established that you are wrong, HTF can anyone at Apple 
seriously claim their shit is worth bottling given they keep getting 
caught with such egregiously crappy bugs in their code?

And how is it that folk who really should know better keep feeding this 
line of BS?

Oh, that's right, they need to justify the grossly excessive cost of 
those non-Windows x86 machines they've been buying the last few 
years...
