4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Firefox, which can
be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a user's 
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a race condition when accessing the
private data of an NPObject JS wrapper class object if navigating away
from a web page while loading a Java applet. This can be exploited via
a specially crafted web page to use already freed memory.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
