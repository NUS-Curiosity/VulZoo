Subject: Alphanumeric ASCII SEH GetPC for XP up to sp3

Hi all,

I have released an updated version of my alphanumeric ASCII SEH GetPC code
which works on Windows XP up to and including sp3:
http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php/Hacking/Shellcode/Alphanumeric/ALPHA3/x86/ASCII/Mixedcase/SEH_GetPC_(XP_sp3)
It bypasses the mitigations that stopped my previous SEH GetPC by generating
the SEH handler on the heap rather than the stack.
NB. It still requires that the process is running with hardware DEP disabled
or that you find a way to make the heap memory executable.

This is the compiled code (100 bytes):
