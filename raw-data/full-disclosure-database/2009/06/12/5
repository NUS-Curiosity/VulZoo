Subject: Backdooring Windows Media Files (once again...)

Hi everybody, I released a whitepaper concerning some new vulnerabilities
I've found in Windows Media Player.
These vulns could be exploited basicly in two scenarios:

   - local file enumeration on the victim's local pc
   - information gathering and network scanning in an Intranet environment

All the details are available at:
