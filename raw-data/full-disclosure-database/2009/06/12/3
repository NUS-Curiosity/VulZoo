Subject: Backdooring windows media files (once again)

Hi everybody, I've just published over my blog a whitepaper concerning some
new vulnerabilities I've found in Windows Media Player.These vulns could be
exploited basicly in two scenarios:

   - local file enumeration on the victim's local pc
   - information gathering and network scanning in an Intranet environment

All the details are available at:
