Yes, that is exactly what I am saying.

It is much easier to inject a CAST or a SELECT past a blacklist if
there are multiple characters canonicalized to As and Es in the
application.

And the same goes for things like double-quotes. Many (most?) language
character sets have confusables and false-familiars with U000/001
Unicode, and Latin/ASCII, and sometimes they are canonicalized as
such.

I have nothing that tells me, when I see a character conversion, if it
is a "best fit" mapping or an attempt to canonicalize confusables or
avoid name collision. So I put them all in the same bucket in terms of
security measurement/classification.

A developer using unicode would probably not put them in the same bucket.
