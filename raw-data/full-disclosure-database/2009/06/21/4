Subject: preimage attack on step reduced md5 - reduced to
	16 of 64 steps -	<=19.43mins

due to math disabilities, i tried algebraic attack on step reduced md5
to 16 steps (authentic md5 is 64 steps in the same input).

basically i got 8.5K multivariate polynomial system exactly determined
(#vars == #eqs) over $GF(2)$ - roughly half of it is linear and it is
*quite* sparse (max 11 monomials per $eq$).

the not reduced system is about 33K (\times 4) with *exactly the same structure*.

i tried a groebner basis attack, fighting the bugs of the _coderz_
(sometimes you are the windshield, sometimes you are the bug --
straits).

to cut a sad story short, in this scenario a preimage attack is less
than 19.434343...  minutes on a lame pc:
(note that all of the input is 16 bytes == 128 bits)
