Subject: BitDefender | World Wide Pay - SQL Injection /
	LFI / XSS

Hi
The bit defender sql injection is re stated again. A severe sql injection
has been noticed in the bitdefender [ir] website. It
is possible to extract all records from the system.

The world wide pay website suffers from local file inclusion and cross site
scripting.

For proof of concept:

There vulnerabilities are reported but no generic response from vendor.

Kind Regards
