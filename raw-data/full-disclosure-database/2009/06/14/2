Subject: Fwd: Iphone

Curious, any one on the list familiar with iPhone processes used for
email hypertxt and picture view through email? What processes are used
and called? Is it the basic same as IE and windows? Are there any
documents written (going to google in a bit).
There are a lot of "fun" features of the IPhone called and uses by
apps that I was curious if could be reached through email not for
havoc but fun. Of course that would also open a can of worms I
suppose.

It's an iPhone thing
