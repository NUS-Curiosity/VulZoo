Randal,
I'm going to assume you're thinking of the mayhem-prone ActiveX
object/embed tags... No this is not how they work. It's fairly obvious
why it doesn't work that way.

They are standard e-mail attachments, the iphone mail proggy (though
an unknown mechanism) recognizes it has a reader enabled for them, and
offers that as an option.

It's very doubtful, when you take into account the surround, that this
is an exploitable vector.

Think I'm taking a logical leap?

You are, for example, hopeful that some file type has a registered
viewer that allows you to change settings... Nothing on the iPhone
works this way, this would not be the case, the programmers would
basically have to be arsed to write insecure code (a backdoor) rather
than necessity & ignorance breeding insecure code.

You will have much more luck working against Safari and the PDF Viewer
and providing links and malicious attachments.
