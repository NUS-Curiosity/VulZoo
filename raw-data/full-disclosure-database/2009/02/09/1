Subject: Netgear SSL312 Router - remote DoS

Attached to this e-Mail is an advisory related to the Netgear SSL312 VPN
router (propably other devices of Netgear are affected as well but this
has not been tested).

http://www.helith.net/txt/netgear_ssl312_remote_dos.txt

Dear netgear Team:
Please consider working together with the OSVDB team to take care
of all known issues related to Netgear products or to even just have
working contact data avaiable.


Kind regards,
Rembrandt
