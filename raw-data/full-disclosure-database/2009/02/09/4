Subject: Aditya K Sood Lame Ass Secjacking.

Phenomenal, Mr. Sood has yet again managed to laugh and fill us with
joy. Perfect example at what level the media and security industry
has become a bit (well quite a bit) of bull-fucken-shit.

i). Click jacking: The new phenomenon of browser security nicely covered
    here http://hackademix.net/2009/01/31/all-that-clickjazz.

ii). More enjoyable are the bug discussions.

    If you look carefully can you see the impatience ? Especially
    the comment "Your response awaited asap."

    Don't worry AKS a.k.a 0kn0ck we are pretty sure your bogusness
    is fueled by media and it like everything crapy will continue.

    Browser DoS is the new way to go.

WARNING! Adityka K Sood will Secjack everyone ph34r!!!!.
