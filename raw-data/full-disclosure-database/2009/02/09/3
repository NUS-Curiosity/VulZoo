Subject: London DEFCON DC4420 - February 2009 Meet -
	Thursday 12th

Following our supah successful January meet, where we actually ran out 
of time because of the volume and quality of talks (or was it volume of 
alcohol the speakers had imbibed?), this month we are going to limit the 
talks to 30 minutes and the number of speaking slots to 3 so we have 
more time for drinking/socialising in between...

The lineup this month is:

   The Current State of Wifi - Arhont

   The Life of a Security Manager - Chris Sumner

   Java Stack Smashing - Subere

There will also be a couple of workshops running in-between/after speakers:

   Data extraction via Firewire/demo - Guillaume

   Sneak preview of a $100 man-in-the-middle RFID protocol analyser - 
Major Malfunction (bring RFID tags!!!)

And, of course... if this is your first meet... YOU will be talking!

Where will all this take place?

Upstairs @ The Glassblower 
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=W1B+5DL&ie=UTF8&ll=51.510625,-0.136878&spn=0.00629,0.021415&z=16&iwloc=addr
42 Glasshouse St, Piccadilly, W1B 5JY

Doors open from 7:00, speaking starts at 7:30 - please try to be prompt 
as some people need to go early to get trains back out of London.

We have private use of the whole of the upstairs until 11:30.

Real ale on draught : Adnams Broadside + Spitfire, 'Buccomb' and 
'Doombar'. Other stuff on draught : Guinness, Staropramen, Hoegaarden, 
Leffe. Even more stuff on draught : Becks, Fosters, 1664

Food menu is extensive and most importantly : they do Pie - but they 
stop serving at 9pm!

I hope to see you all there!
