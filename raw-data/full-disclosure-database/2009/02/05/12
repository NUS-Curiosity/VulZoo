Both...every corporation revolves exclusively around profit...and yes, they
did intentionally miss the point, I would imagine MS is well-aware of the
history of UNIX privilege management...

Isn't this the same thing?  Irritating consumers who know only one operating
system?  Consumers are upset with UAC because it is irritating, they have no
concept of a control.

I would agree...on the assumption that the majority of consumers are Vista

In the future I will keep my blank stares to myself...but the crux of the
argument to me is not whether MS sux or not (I don't care)...the argument is
whether or not the concept of UAC (not who came up with) as implemented by
Microsoft in Windows 7 is a good one...c'est tout
