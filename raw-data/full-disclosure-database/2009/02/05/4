Drupal Link Module XSS Vulnerability

Security Risk: Moderately Critical
Exploitable: Remotely
Vulnerabilities: Cross Site Scripting
Discovered by: Andrew Rosborough, Justin C. Klein Keane
Tested: Link 5.x-2.5 on Drupal 5.10

Description

Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS)
that provides extensibility through hundreds of third party modules.
While the security of Drupal core modules is vetted by a central
security team(http://drupal.org/security), third party modules are not
reviewed for security.

The Link module (http://drupal.org/project/link) is a module
that extends the Drupal CCK (Content Creation Kit) module
(http://www.drupal.org/project/cck) by allowing users to add links
to their content types.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

The Link module contains a XSS vulnerability in the 'Help'
field. Any user with rights to administer content types can edit a
content type that contains a link field or create a content type that
contains an link field. In the 'Widget settings' fieldset presented
during configuration of the specific image field a textarea labeled
'Help text:' is presented. Arbitrary script can be entered into this
text area and it is not escaped. This vulnerability is especially
dangerous because the script executes whenever a user creates new
content of the type with the XSS infected help text. This potentially
exposes site administrators to the XSS attack.
