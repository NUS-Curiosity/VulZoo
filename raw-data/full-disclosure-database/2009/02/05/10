Subject: Re: Windows 7 UAC compromised

No, it doesn't make sense...I don't think Redmond missed the point at all,
they're trying to introduce a concept totally new to the everyday user who,
like Valdis said, only "...wants his dancing hamster screensaver.", and will
blindly click any OK button that pops up.  Ultimately, Valdis is right,
Redmond cares about profit, and creating an OS that is irritating to the
everyday jackass does not help their profits.
