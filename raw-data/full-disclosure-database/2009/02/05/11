Wait, so is he right when he said all they care about is profit, was
he right when he said they intentionally missed it or both?

Microsoft market share has absolutely nothing to do with how
irritating the computing experience is and has everything to do with
product availability and familiarity; basically, it's carried along by
inertia. Kind of like the whole, "no one was ever fired for buying
[IBM|Cisco|<flavour of the decade>]" deal. Most products that most
companies have are MS-centric; if the products are there, and it's
what people are used to, no one really gives a flying penny about how
irritating the OS is to the average person unless it's completely
intolerable. On a level playing field I would say yes, the quality of
the computing experience would help dictate the winner in the OS game
but this is *not* a level playing field and it's quite easy to just
roll along simply because you already have 90%+ of the market with no
serious contenders in sight.

My previous post was made because rather than attempt to refute
anything stated by M.B., you just replied with a "blank-stare" style
"what?". I neither support nor refute his statements, I was simply
rewording them.
