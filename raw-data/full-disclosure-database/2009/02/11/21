Subject: Re: Fuzzing for Fun and Profit

release something that fuzzes web services given a WSDL. OR * Grammer file.

state awareness given history, state munging, branch on prior states.
Like:
A->B->C->D

Transaction 1
A1->B1->C1

Transaction 2 REPLAY from B1
B1->C2->D2

Transaction 1
C1->D1

OR
A3->D3

D3->A3 (Send init packet with mundgery permute over *States if it permits.)

Run all permutations and branches from all steps, with all possible delays.
Learn if it "supports" your test then drop your test if it doesn't work.

You won't worry about running out of shit to test, and you'll finally
justify the cost of some sweet new hardware to run this on.

-or-

Learn how to audit code?

This might be too much CS for you, but if you plug away you might learn
something :.)

I'm sure you'll get a talking spot and mad whitehat dollars if you do.
