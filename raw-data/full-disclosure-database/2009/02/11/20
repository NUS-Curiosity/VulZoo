The incoming connection rate has exceeded 15Mbps of just SYN packets, so
we decided to point www.metasploit.com and metasploit.com back to
127.0.0.1 for a little while. This is more to keep our ISP happy than
any fear of bandwidth charges. We ran a packet capture of the incoming
SYN traffic for about 8 hours; it takes up approximately 60Gb of disk
space. In the meantime, if you want to access the Metasploit web site,
please use: http://metasploit.org
