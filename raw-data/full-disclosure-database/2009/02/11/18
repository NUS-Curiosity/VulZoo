Dear tal0n.

when will you do something that hasn't been done and is even
relevant or practical in 2009? fuzzing sftp and command line
arguments/env variables... nice and 2000AD "oh but its setuid(0)"
yeah on your box and the 5 other people who download it to write
useless papers/exploits to feel like they are smart/doing something
(hi prdelka). When is the last time a sftpd exploit was useful?
