Given the starting point, do you *really* think the original poster would
have understood an in-depth explanation of all the technical details, rather
than some hints as to the next thing he needs to learn about?  He's not going
to get anywhere until he learns at least that there's that canary on the
stack, and where it is in relation to the various variables and things like
the return address.

After that, yes, he faces *other* challenges.  But he'll learn more by thinking
through each issue on his own than if somebody hands him the whole enchilada.
