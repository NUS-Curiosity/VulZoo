Mr. Krymson,

1. Valdis' replies fall under other commonly used Latin phrases,
such as "ad nauseam" that the slightly educated use in conversation
to attempt emulation of both higher levels of education and
intelligence than they actually possess.  Nice try, you fucking
tard.

2. Who the fuck are you and why should we, the security community,
care about your feelings toward Mr. Kletnieks?  He has never once
offered a technical response to anything, and if anything has only
demonstrated an inability to grasp simple technical concepts.
Valdis says very little, but I suppose we must give him credit for
the frequency and length of how often he says that.

Perhaps one day you'll have joined him in his esteemed rank of
moustached village idiot.

et cetera, et cetera.
