1- We could do this ad infinitum, but "this list's lack of usual moderation
does not mean your opinion is
either respected, welcomed, or desired by anyone," Mr. Mugabe. But hey, at
least Valdis was on topic, right? Circular arguments get us everywhere!

2- Further, I for one welcome Valdis' opinions. He is well-spoken/written,
makes excellent points, and regularly demonstrates a high degree of
intelligence and understanding. Quite frankly, that earns much more respect
than whiney immature posts like the below. So, that makes one person on this
list who welcomes it, and not the "no one" you were implying when you seemed
to speak for an entire list...
