Dear gov-boi,

Please follow the established etiquette of this list by linking to
content on archive.org to establish credibility for alleged
historic content.  Linking to obscure post-dated content on your
own Internet site, that easily can be faked, isn't the best way to
attempt legitimizing your darknet archival endeavours.  Many on
this list are sceptical about your claim regarding the previous
discovery of this important computer security issue, and to be
quite frank find your attempts to discredit the king of gods'
effort to secure this critical piece of Internet infrastructure
known as the joomla joomradio something-or-other.

Mr. Zeus - on behalf of my country I would like to express our
sincere thanks for reporting this severe issue, whether or not it
was previously and independently discovered and reported, and hope
you continue to contribute your research to this list of full
disclosure and helping to make the Internet a safer place for
everyone.

I would like to remind everyone that this list is for disclosure of
information security materials and that the fascist tactics used by
the packetstorm/#darknet crowd as they attempt to once again
monopolize the dissemination of information security materials is
not appreciated here.

All the best to you and yours,
- -bm
