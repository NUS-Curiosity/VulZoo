This would be the second time I ask you publicly, is that all you have to offer?
Surely you or Simon can come together and offer a meaningful response to
my previous post. For those in the United States, you have the show Ghost
Hunters, the guys who "debunk", play information security expert you pretend
to be and debunk any of my previously written statements, surely you can do
so. After all; you spend so much time rambling on this and other lists about
security. You did so last week and were called out on a plagiaristic post in
regards to "vulnerability assessment". Surely you can come back with a
little bit more than two words. You guys (Snosoft, Simon, Kevin) have done
nothing for the industry via means of productivity. What you have done is
harm the industry for many a security professional in lowering the bar of
what a professional security expert really is. That sirs are not you guys. You
guys come into the old school Kwantaam Pozetron like "poser" of the
days of old with the exception that, even posers back then had some form
of skills.
