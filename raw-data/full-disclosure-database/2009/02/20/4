If you're the botnet owner, you need to have some way to know what domain
name your botnet will be looking for, so you can register it.

If you look at 11:06AM, see the top news story is something about Obama
flipping the Republican party the bird, and computes the domain name to
register based on that, but then at 11:07AM some editor at CNN pulls that
headline and replaces it with "Obama sends obscene gesture to Republicans"
before your bots wake up at 11:08AM and check what domain to use, you're
screwed.
