Subject: Oh Yeah, botnet communications

You know how the current amateur botnet offerings are basing domain lists
off the current time to allow the 'good guys' to prepare?

Why not base the seed off something like a news RSS feed? I asked some
whitehats when I was ruined in Washington DC and they couldn't tell me.

News isn't predictable but is globally shared on a given day.
