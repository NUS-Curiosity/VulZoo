Yeah man you get the point.

Even if they do reverse it, you can digitally sign each of the commands, so
if a bot hunter even got the balls to 'break the law' and send the rm
command they'd fail.

It's about eliminating their lead time, right now they can just put controls
in with registrars to disallow these lists of domains.
Of course one could adopt such a framework to take the output of a script...
Hence the choosing a range of IPs which makes the whole process of searching
through to your bots a lot less complicated.

Or one good way to do this is have each of the bots maintain a list of
-other- bots it 'encounters' then share this list with the other bots.
This, however, leads to too easy enumeration.
