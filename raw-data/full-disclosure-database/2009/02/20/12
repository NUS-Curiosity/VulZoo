Valdis.
No.
There's nothing complicated about it - it's dead simple.
Who needs a botnet available 24/7?
The registrars are all down at the same time?
Why does it have to be domains?
Perhaps the bots pick a range of IPs to scan based on the news... any bots
with IPs falling into this range become C&C points the rest scan the range
to look for control nodes. Owners do the same.

What makes you think you need the extra nodes that (because of your
mentioned examples or a risk of quantum events) pulled a different article?

Maybe it's time to rethink using CPUs because there's sometimes extremely
hot weather that causes them to shut off.
