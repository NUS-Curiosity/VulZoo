Ironically, your own quote"company"quote offered penetration testing
services at the insane pricing scheme of "we'll pentest0r joo for free
and if we find something you can pay us to find other holes!".

Gullibility is nothing new nor is FUD. See my prior response in the

Quality vendors in the security industry are a dime a dozen. It's usually
the uninformed "security monkeys" damaging the reputations of these
companies. When I think of "quality vendors", I think of those who do
have a real world comprehension of security outside of ramblings on a
mailing list. Real security professionals rarely have the time to shoot
off dozens of email ramblings on a daily basis - you know the kind like
your protege Kevin (don't call him black) Finestere writes. So let's have
a manager's view of your purported "quality services" as only you seem
to think you can offer it.

On your page it states: "Statistics show that companies who do not
invest in good I.T. security will fall victim to at least one serious
compromise." Can you show us where this statement was derived from;
anyone can have fun with numbers, statistics mean little; how have you
come to this conclusion, how many clients do you supposedly have or
have studied, to draw this conclusion since you make no reference to
your source of information.

Netragard: "Most of these companies feel that they can not justify the
cost of maintaining strong I.T. security for their business." Woe is me in
my  understanding of how a company's feeling. Do they feel (companies)?
How do you know, how many companies have you talked to? An individual
in a company is no indicator of the overall posture of a company.

Netragard: "The reality is that the cost of good I.T. security is equal to a
fraction of the cost of a single successful compromise." The harsher
reality is, you can never judge the reasoning behind a company's staff
to not implement the appropriate controls. How many large company's
have you worked for in your lifetime - and by large I mean in the 1,000's.
There are plenty of obstacles in a company which are preventative to
a strong security posture. There are facts like "implementing this new
technology will cost us in the millions via way of training, it will disaffect
legacy systems, clients may jump ship out of frustration therefore for
this one technology, we may have to scrap it and put in place for it
a compensatory control" Perhaps you should learn about complexity
management

Your comments and those of your fellow "security bandits" humor
me. The mechanisms in which you correlate mom and pop like
businesses with large corporations is amazing. You should be in
sales.

Well pitched snake oil sounding paragraph.

There ARE actually people who are that stupid and the blind leading
the blind is a sad yet funny sight. So as I asked your friend Kevin,
you know the "don't call me black - I don't even work in the security
industry but sure answer a ton of questions in the field I don't even
work in" Kevin, how much experience do you *really* have outside
of being legends in your own mind.

As I sift through years of mailing list threads, I've seen nothing to
lead me to believe you're any more of an expert than a script kiddie
pitching tools on a flash based website and calling yourself a
quote"security expert"quote". The irony of Kevin's prior statement
speaks for itself "Just so you know I do have a day job, 9-6 that has
nothing to do with security." Stop the press right there, isn't that
akin to me giving out medical advice on say a medical mailing lists
without even working in the medical industry? How, better yet why
should I take him, you or your company serious. For starters, it's
sounding more like you have an IRC based company, your workers
(who don't work in the security field as Kevin stated) work a 9-6
elsewhere and have personal issues of race when questioned about
the validity of their status in the industry.

On prior matters of your stated "coward" comment, it has little
to do with being a coward and more of dealing with due diligence.
I won't post my identity not to protect myself, but the company
I work for. I don't need ping -f like DoS attacks coming into my
infrastructure because you and your protege Kevin feel slighted
about me questioning your competence in the industry. For me,
I know those who need to be known, the security has always
been a small industry, and you sir, you're not even on my level
technologically, let alone on the level you're portraying yourself
to be on these mailing lists. Anyone can go back re-read the
numerous posts you clowns (Kevin, you, Adriel *Netragard*)
make and ascertain this to be factual - you have little real
world skills in this industry, proceed with caution.

There is a snippet of a song perhaps Kevin can relate to, this
I will throw out there since he has an internal racial inferiority
complex: "We aint no haters like you... Bow Down to some
nigga's that's greater than you" (Westside Connection) Ending
on that note, thank you for playing the game with me and
enforcing the facts we already know, you guys are all talk
nothing more and nothing less. Definitely not to be taken
serious.

PS, say hello to Loki for me will ya.
