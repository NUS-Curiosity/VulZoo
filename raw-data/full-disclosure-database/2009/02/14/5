Subject: Re: Exploiting buffer overflows via protected GCC

I would recommend doing the following things.

1. Ask on the Ubuntu GCC list what protection is implemented. (Or just look
at the source)
2. Use GCC to see where the execution is being redirected and so you can
have a better visual of whats going on.
3. Are you sure the stack is executable?
