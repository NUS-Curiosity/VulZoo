Hi,

It could be quite possible, although, I can't confirm it. But, after
analysis of recent ICQ6 vulnerability, I'm under impression that there are
more similar vulnerabilities in it.

ICQ6 vulnerability:

Subject: [Full-disclosure] ICQ 6 protocol bug?

For some time now I've seen ICQ receive messages, from unknown people,
occassionally make the client "core dump'. The messages are often
gibberish - more like the ASCII characters from someone trying to make
it execute something it shouldn't.

My interpretation of this is unknown parties are trying to exploit a bug
in ICQ6 (it may work on Win2k or Win98...) but I might be wrong. I need
to fire up wireshark to see what actually get sent.

Has anyone else seen this?
Or have details on what the hack is?

Google found some hits for "old bugs", older than ICQ6....

Darren
