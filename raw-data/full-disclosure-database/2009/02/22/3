Mr. Kletnieks,

This list's lack of usual moderation does not mean your opinion is
either respected, welcomed, or desired by anyone.  Like my father
always says, "Give a nigger a podium and he'll rap for anyone.
Give a white man a podium and he'll beat his chest like a primate
and spew mindless propaganda to anyone that will listen with the
hope that the senseless banter will impress those less intelligent
than he."

And you, my friend, are not black.
