Not necessarily as insanely complicated as you might think - an RSS
feed can include some interesting numbers, such as stock quotes, etc.,
where the non-integer portion of the number(s) are pretty random, and
reporting on them is pretty standardized.

And, I don't think, for the purposes of discussion, it *has* to be an
RSS feed. It could be any publicly available, regularly updated text,
including www.wsj.com.
