And how, exactly, is that an "insane" pricing scheme?  If you think about
it for a bit, it actually makes quite a bit of sense - Snosoft needs to prove
they're in fact good enough to be able to find the holes you're paying them
to find, or it doesn't cost anything.

That *sure* as hell beats paying $100K for a pen test, and then finding out
that you hired a bunch of asswipes who can't find holes.
