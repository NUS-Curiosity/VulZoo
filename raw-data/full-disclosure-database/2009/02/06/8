Subject: Security contacts at Netgear and/or D-Link? (DoS,
 pos. default PWs and other issues)

Is somebody aware of security contacts at Netgear or D-Link?

Products of those vendors do suffer from possible DoS, propably default
hardcoded root accounts (D-Link) and other issues.

Contacting mitre.org and NetGear asking for CVE and contact:

pressrelations@...gear.com (OSVDB entry in the contact field)
coley@...us.mitre.org (cc, found by googling)


No replies so far.
Maybe NetGear and D-Link could consider to work together with the OSVDB
to enter at least some valid contact data.

Somebody interested into Router issues (and no it's no xss...)?
The vendor itself seam to not to care about their customers or security...


Kind regards,
Rembrandt
