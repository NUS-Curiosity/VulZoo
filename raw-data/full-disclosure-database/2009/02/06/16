Windows is different in this respect.  The number of Windows users who don't
know/care (or *want* to know) what goes on under the hood is *huge*.  As
long as their current setup allows them to *do their job* then they're not
going to buy into any upgrade that risks breaking that.  That's what's
important to them.

The biggest driver behind upgrading a Windows OS isn't a new release, or
security improvements or a fancy GUI.  It's hardware replacement.  Even this
was/is stretched with XP with the extended shipment dates and various
downgrade options you can *still* get on new boxes.

The only people that can really force app developers to change overnight*
and code for a new, secure Windows OS mostly don't care about it.  That
leaves Microsoft to try and drip feed gradual change that improves the
situation without rocking the boat.

*relatively.
