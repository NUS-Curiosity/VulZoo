I'm quite frankly not convinced that there is in fact any economically feasible
way for MS to ship a "proper" UAC.  Both Vista and the upcoming Windows 7 were
at first seen by outsiders as a good chance for MS to do the needed disruptive
house cleaning, and they didn't do it for either of those releases.  They still
took a major beating on their cash flow with the Vista failure, and it would
have been worse if it had been the amount of changes that were needed to
actually fix things.

And since there's a good chance that the world economy will remain in the
toilet until after the follow-on for Windows 7 arrives, I'm not holding my
breath for MS to do the major clean-up there either.  There's good reason to
suspect that they will *never* actually do so.

Bottom line: MS can do only one of the following:

1) Ship something that fixes UAC (and all the other related issues)
2) Ship something that fixes their profit/loss sheets.
