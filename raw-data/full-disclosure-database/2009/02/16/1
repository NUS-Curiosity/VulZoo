Pwn2Own Contests:
================

There will be TWO Pwn2Own contests this year.
Generous cash prize(s) for exploits will be sponsored by Tipping Point,
and  a Sony VAIO P fresh from Japan and a new loaded Apple Macbook
will be amongst the prizes.

The targets this year will be mobile smart-phones, and browsers.

Mobile targets:
        iPhone
        Android
        Symbian
        RIM/BlackBerry
        Windows Mobile

Browser Targets:
        IE8
        FF3
        Safari
        Opera

The contest will like in previous years feature a progressively  
expanding attack surface over the three day duration of the 
conference. Final prizes and rules will be announced shortly.

Post-Conference Whistler Expedition:
=============================

We have secured some rooms at good rates at the Westin in Whistler 
and reserved a cluster of four, 3-5 bedroom, cabins for the weekend 
after the conference. Contact dr@....net if you wish to be included 
in the planning, final accommodation rates will be announced shortly.

Conference Hotel Block:
===================

The room rates at the Sheraton Wall Center hotel where the conference
is being held have been reduced from $183 to $169, and still includes
a waived $15/day free internet access in the rate.


Tenth Anniversary Gala Event:
========================

Since this is our tenth anniversary for the conference, we will 
be having a party on Thursday night. Venue TBD. We're pretty 
sure there will be a cake. No word yet on whether there will 
be dancers inside it. ;-)


Day-Care Facilities will be available:
=============================

As a nod to the shifting demographic of early gen. security
researchers we will be trying a new experiment this year 
and we will be providing day-care facilities for those 
traveling with kids. We will try to arrange some group
discounts with our provider once we know how many 
kids and what ages and times will have to be 
accommodated. If you are interested in this service
please send a note to yuriko@...west.com and let 
her know ages and times.

We will try to get them started on exploit writing 
courses for pre-schoolers :-). Does this mean 
we are all grown up now?


It promises to be another fun conference again this 
year. See you all there.

cheers,
