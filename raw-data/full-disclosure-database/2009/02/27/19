sorry to interrupt your self-aggrandizing tirade, however you're the only
one who took the implication that *all* null ptr related bugs are
exploitable-- i never implied or said that, just said in some instances
they can be. Furthermore, I think you're taking the word 'dereference' a
little too serious and you should perhaps take up a hobby such as baseball
cards or miniature collectibles to quench you're apparent need to
sub-categorize into nothing. If you want to insist that null+x/etc bugs be
in an entirely separate category than dereferences, that's cool, just don't
go all ape-shit on people who dont share your same narrow view at
some feeble attempt at elitism via syntactic pedantry.
