POP Peeper 3.4.0.0 UIDL Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

======================
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
======================

"POP Peeper is an email notifier that runs in your Windows task bar and 
alerts you when you have new email on your
POP3, IMAP (with IDLE support), Hotmail\MSN\LiveMail, Yahoo, GMail, 
Mail.com, MyWay, Excite, iWon, Lycos.com, RediffMail,
Juno and NetZero accounts. IMAP supports allows you to access AOL, AIM, 
Netscape and other services. Send mail directly
from POP Peeper and use the address book to email your frequently used 
contacts. POP Peeper allows you to view messages
using HTML or you can choose to safely view all messages in rich or 
plain text. Several options are available that will
decrease or eliminate the risks of reading your email (viruses, 
javascript, webbugs, etc). POP Peeper can be run from a
portable device and can be password protected. Many notification options 
are availble to indicate when new mail has
arrived, such as sound alerts (configurable for each account), flashing 
scroll lock, skinnable popup notifier, customized
screensaver and more."

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
=========================

POP Peeper is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability. This 
vulnerability is exploitable on the client side.
A vulnerable POP Peeper user must connect to an exploitation server and 
attempt use retrieve mail to affected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

To trigger this vulnerability, POP Peeper has to connect to an 
exploitation server acting as a POP3 daemon. POP Peeper
then uses the UIDL command to get unique IDs for each email it later 
plans on retrieving. The exploitation server can
send an oversized ID (1040 bytes), overflowing a buffer on the stack, 
giving the attacker complete control over the
process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=================

POP Peeper 3.4.0.0 was confirmed vulnerable. All versions of below 
3.4.0.0 and are suspected vulnerable as well.
