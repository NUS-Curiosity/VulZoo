Subject: Re: PDP Architect and your great book

Hi Bob,

Thank you for your concerns. The truth is that I've been incredibly
busy lately both in my personal and professional life and therefore I
am not so active at the moment. I am also taking the time to think
about new ideas and wrap up some old projects.

In fact, the Agile Hacking project is one of them. I still believe in
the idea and I am very excited about it.

This project gathered quite a lot of interest but we do not have any
deadlines to meet. Just because I am not talking about it, it does not
mean that I am not silently working on it. The quality of the final
product is very important to me. The way I see it right now, the book
should take no more than year and half to be fully completed.

I just want to remind you that this is entirely a community project
and it depends on the contributions of everyone and I do not
financially benefit from it.

All the best,
pdp
