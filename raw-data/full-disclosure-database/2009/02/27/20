This exploitation relies on the ability to have the top-level UEF point to
an arbitrary address which hopefully you have the ability to control. The
NULL pointer is only used as a mechanism to trigger the exception necessary
to execute code where the handler now points. This doesn't need to be a NULL
deref, it can be any unhandled exception. I guess you could compare the NULL
pointer in this situation to a memory leak necesary to exploit another
condition. The memory leak itself wouldn't be called a vulnerability, it's
just used instrumentally to assist in exploitation. In this paper the NULL
pointer is used to assist in the exploitation of a hijacked UEF by
triggering the unhandled exception.

My original point stands, the NULL pointer dereference can be used to assist
in another explotiation, but in itself is not a vulnerability.

Do you disagree?
