I'll clarify for everyone since you seem lost.
EVERYONE, THE NULL POINTER DOES NOT GET DEREFERENCED. It only 
gets referenced. And Jubei isn't even sure a null pointer is involved 
at all =)

With that out of the way, I'd just like to say that I only meant to 
encourage people to check out an excellent paper. I didn't mean to say 
anything related to your argument other than to say that that 
paper is a must-read. If you can't appreciate that, why the fuck are you 
on F-D? Think about it.
