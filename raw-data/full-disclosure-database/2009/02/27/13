I'm didn't even comment on Mark's paper, it is definitely a great piece of
research, there is no doubt. It's just that some people have read this paper
and thought, wow, all those NULL bugs are now exploitable. It's important to
separate these bug classes.

I'd even go to say that while this paper is a must-read, please also spend
some time understanding it, otherwise don't bother.
