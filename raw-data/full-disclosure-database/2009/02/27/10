OK, and what about this vulnerability makes use of a NULL pointer? This goes
to show the shallow exploitation knowledge of this community. If you
actually understood the paper it's (NULL + offset). This is NOT the same as
a plain NULL deref bug. Also, you need to be able to map the NULL address,
so I ask again, in examples such as this, in users-space apps name one
exploitable condition.
