Details
=======

Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs), Cisco Catalyst 6500 Wireless
Services Modules (WiSMs), and Cisco Catalyst 3750 Integrated Wireless
LAN Controllers are responsible for system-wide wireless LAN functions,
such as security policies, intrusion prevention, RF management, quality
of service (QoS), and mobility.

These devices communicate with Controller-based Access Points over any
Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the Lightweight
Access Point Protocol (LWAPP).

This Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities in
the WLCs, WiSMs, and the Cisco Catalyst 3750 Integrated WLCs. These
vulnerabilities are independent of each other.

Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
+--------------------------------

These vulnerabilities are documented in the following Cisco Bug ID and
have been assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) identifiers:

  * CSCsq44516 - CVE-2009-0058

    Web authentication is a Layer 3 security feature that causes the
    controller to drop IP traffic (except DHCP and DNS related packets)
    from a particular client until that client has correctly supplied
    a valid username and password. An attacker may use a vulnerability
    scanner to cause the device to stop servicing web authentication
    or cause a reload of the device. The following error messages may
    appear on the console during an active attack:

        SshPmStMain/pm_st_main.c:1954/
           ssh_pm_st_main_batch_addition_result:
           Failed to add rule to the engine:
           restoring old state
        SshEnginePmApiPm/engine_pm_api_pm.c:1896/
           ssh_pme_enable_policy_lookup:
           Could not allocate message

  * CSCsm82364 - CVE-2009-0059

    An attacker may cause a device reload when sending a malformed post
    to the web authentication "login.html" page. The following error
    messages may appear on the WLC console during this attack:

        Cisco Crash Handler
        Signal generated during a signal 11,
           count 193
        Memory 0x14ef1e44 has been freed!

    Note: A crash file is not generated during this attack.

  * CSCso60979 - CVE-2009-0061

    Affected Cisco WLC, WiSM and Catalyst 3750 Wireless LAN Controller
    models are vulnerable to a DoS condition that is triggered by the
    receipt of certain IP packets. Upon receiving these IP packets, the
    affected device may become unresponsive and require a reboot to
    recover.

    Note: This vulnerability affects software versions 4.1 and later in
    the Cisco 4400 series WLCs, Cisco Catalyst 6500 WiSM, and the Cisco
    Catalyst 3750 Integrated Wireless LAN Controllers. Cisco 4100, 2100,
    and 2000 series WLCs are not affected by this vulnerability.

Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
+---------------------------------

A privilege escalation vulnerability exists only in WLC software version
4.2.173.0, and could allow a restricted user (i.e., Lobby Admin) to gain
full administrative rights on the affected system.

Note: Wireless network users are not affected by this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsv62283 and has
been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2009-0062.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------
