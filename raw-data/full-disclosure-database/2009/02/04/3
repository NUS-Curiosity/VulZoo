Vulnerability Description

-------------------------

The HP-ChaiSOE/1.0 embedded web server on certain HP JetDirect printers
allows a potential attacker to gain read only access to directories and
files outside of the web root.  An attacker can leverage this flaw to
read arbitrary system configuration files, cached documents, etc.
Information obtained from an affected host may facilitate further
attacks against the host.  Exploitation of this flaw is trivial using
common web server directory traversal techniques.

 

Solution Description

--------------------

The vendor has released an update.  See
http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c
01623905 for more details.

Digital Defense, Inc. recommends restricting access to the HP JetDirect
web administration interface to authorized hosts only.
