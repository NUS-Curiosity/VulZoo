The biggest issue here is that although it's technically easy to fix this
problem (just have UAC issue an alert when somebody's messing with the
system settings), it involves doing more of what end users dislike most
about UAC (it issuing alerts to Joe Sixpack all the time when he does
something bone-headed security-wise).

Fixing this one in a way that users will put up with will be a bitch.
