Subject: Re: Windows 7 UAC compromised

Not at all Valdis.
Keep UAC exceptions for Desktop Settings, Keyboard Settings, Mundane /
Trivial.
Prompt from UAC on regedit32, reg, secedit, gpedit, the proggy that modifies
uac settings.
Most "Joe Sixpacks" will never touch any of that, and power users that do
will understand why they're being prompted.

Wow that -was- a bitch.

This reminds me of when sp2 came out and you could just pop registry keys in
allowing your naughty program to execute before it attempted to access the
net.
