Having read your paper, I'm a bit confused about what you think the "new 
SQL injection technique" is that you've discovered.  I understand you have 
determined a way to *extract* data in a more compact and efficient format, 
but I didn't see any new *injection* technique.  IOW, the FOR XML 
construct isn't going to assist you in obtaining the data - only in 
obtaining it more efficiently.

Did I miss something?

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
