This research misses some information.

It compares "vanilla PHP" to "patched PHP" but that is not exactly true.

PHP + Suhosin replaces the system's realpath() with an own 
implementation based on FreeBSD (+ some hardening).

This means everything presented that works against PHP + Suhosin should 
work against vanilla PHP when used on FreeBSD, OS X, OpenBSD, ...

Additionally the research should be repeated with PHP 5.3-beta, because 
it now does something very similar to Suhosin.
