OMG Me to. When all the other experts finish talking about this, I will wait
until you finish plagiarize everyone elses ideas, concepts notions, then
re-use the stuff you re-used. I think I'll make ppl a dealio they can't
isn't refuse: Perform a half-baked pentest using Malteego to show how
leeterized my skills are at a low cost of $1,000.00, write a long and
rambling thread to make real security professionals puke: "wtf is this
rootard talking about" then cash in on the newbie sux0rs who'll think I'm
Neo and zer0c00l combined!.
