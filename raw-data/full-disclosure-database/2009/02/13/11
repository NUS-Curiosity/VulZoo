Perhaps he's experienced in transgendered psychology maybe even a
transgender himself. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Why are you
coming down on him for plagiarizing? Everyone in the security industry with
more posts to mailing lists than actual experience conducting real world
security work (momand-pop.com's don't count!) is concretely an expert at
talking the talk. So why get on his case for using sed? 's:that work:is
mines now:g'. Don't be such a troll
