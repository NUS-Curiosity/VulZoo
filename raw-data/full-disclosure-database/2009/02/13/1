Subject: Re: Fuzzing for Fun and Profit

i kinda skim read the original posting. to the op - nice try, but this
is 2009. (el8 put it better than i)

the idea is not to break buffers but to take program control. breaking
buffers is one method of doing this, but the sea is big.

kinda, i like this idea, but i dont think it is profitiable unless you
are a software company.

if you are good enough you can prove that there is no shit left to
test. (reread what alan wrote = rehimahn hyp at approx 1024....)

this kinda works, but the idea behind fuzzing is that you test the
implementation not the spec. doing that (testing the imp. could go on
forever unless you start to look at what is happening when you are
testing - the halting problem only applies to _every_ program, not
this one program.) see one of my millions of previous posts.
