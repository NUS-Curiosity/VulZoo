Now that one thinks about it, makes perfect sense to post the question to
you. Surely in your infinite security wisdom you can answer the question
truthfully. After all, if you expect to be trusted by potential clients -
how would they know you're an honest guy and not some plagiaristic scum
sucking troll who solely knows how to copy others' work and not think for
himself. Valid question, someone is claiming your work is based off of
someone else's sweat, is that the least you can say: "OMG No don't make fun
of me get off his nuts". Why should I take you serious if I were a potential
client, after all, you have zero clue as to whether I'm a bored student or
CxO at a Fortune X company. If I Googled your company - after all your
emails emanate from snosoft - why would I even pay attention to your
business if this (your response) would be the level of information being
conveyed from "professionals" like yourself. Or am I simply deluded into
thinking that Snosoft really isn't another "Geocities / TheGlobe / Xoom"
like page filled with irrelevance properly worded and packaged.
