Vulnerability Description

-------------------------

NetMRI contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue whereby portions of
the GET request are echoed back in an error page. This allows scripting
tags to be executed by the browser to perform XSS attacks. Such an
attack would require convincing a user to click on a specially crafted
link.

 

Solution Description

--------------------

On February 18, 2009, Netcordia released a patch named
"CrossScriptPatch.gpg" to address this vulnerability in all currently
supported versions of NetMRI through v3.0.1.  Customers can acquire the
patch through the normal mechanisms or contact Netcordia Technical
Support (support@...cordia.com) for assistance.  Additionally, the
necessary changes will be incorporated in future versions beginning with
NetMRI v3.0.2.
