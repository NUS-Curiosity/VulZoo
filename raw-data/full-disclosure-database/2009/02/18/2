Pidgin seems to spontaneously self combust without it being attacked.
Which is just a little bit more disruptive.

So there's the trade off: do i worry about attacks or worry about my
conversation being randomly disrupted?

But in summary, nobody seems to know of anything new, so I need
to watch the icq traffic with wireshark to see what's what.

At the very least, messages from unknown parties can be ignored
and it seems to be the rendering(again!) that has caused problems.
