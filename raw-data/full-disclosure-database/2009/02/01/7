Subject: Re: Browser Fuzzer 2

Im not a dick to people, and that's not the purpose of my comments.
But he's releasing a fuzzer a day:

- RSH Fuzzer
- CVS Fuzzer
- PDF Fuzzer
- SSH Fuzzer
- JPEG Fuzzer
- TFTP Fuzzer
- MySQL Fuzzer
- Browser Fuzzer (1 & 2)
- MP3-TAGS Fuzzer

They're all the sames kinds of fuzzing, on totally different kinds of
protocols, he ask for comments, and I m saying kindly to this man, that he
can release BETTER stuff if he waits and study a bit more a protocol.
