Mr Pete Licoln,

Excuse me for being rude but you said you made constructive comments.
You must be tottaly ignorant to believe that.
I haven't tested the fuzzer yet, but if I don't like it I will say thank you
and never use it again If I see potential I will give some comments.
I think that you insulted yourself doing such comments, even though you seem
not to care.
But, on the other side what do I know?
I am just a fellow Greek...

Have a nice day!
