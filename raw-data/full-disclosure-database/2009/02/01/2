It's *long* been understood within the security community that the best way
to deal with a DoS attack is to disable the source of the attack.

A case can be made that if the free venue is clogged with inane chatter to
the point of uselessness, that is *also* manipulation, and that *removing*
said source results in a *less* manipulated venue.

Which is more manipulated - one noise source that renders the venue unusable,
or one noise source that finds itself self-filtered?  In the first, everybody
feels the effects, in the second only the noise source itself feels the effect.
