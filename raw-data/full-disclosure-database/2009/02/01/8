I have five Full Disclosure filtering lists, three of which are affected by 
John's decision. I went back and read this thread at one of the sites that 
archives Full Disclosure, because some of the users trigger the filters if 
they appear anywhere in the message; that's how bad it has gotten.  So let me 
add my thanks to Vulcanius', and ask if you have a list of the banned names, 
so I can adjust my filters.
