	Dereference Denial of, Service Vulnerability

Why does the industry incessantly call any bug a "DoS Vulnerability". Why
are these bugs even published to a security mailing list and not privately
dealt with by the vendor? Just because a bug class can crash an application
doesn't make it a security issue.

Does this frustrate anyone else?
