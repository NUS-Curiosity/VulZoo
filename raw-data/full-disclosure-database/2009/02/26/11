4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some buffer overflows ksquirrel-libs,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an
application using the library.

The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within the
"mt_codec::getHdrHead()" function in kernel/kls_hdr/fmt_codec_hdr.cpp,
which can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows by e.g.
tricking a user into opening a specially crafted Radiance RGBE 
(*.hdr) file.
