Subject: Deputy Dan - follow up to your ida book

I was wondering when the follow up to your powerful book about debugging,
disassembling, and all around reverse engineering will come out. After
reading the entire first book, I learned what a software breakpoint is and
that ELF files start with \x7fELF, and because of this, I feel that the
knowledge obtained from a sequel could be endless. Hopefully the next
version will cover such advanced topics as running a program in a debugger
and demystifying the eax register. Such a book is sure to be a classic right
next to gray hat hacking and gnu citizens 700 page volume on javascript
alert boxes.
