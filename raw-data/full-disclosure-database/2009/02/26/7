Subject: PDP Architect and your great book

I was wondering when your book about how to become a become a real hacker
and write programs through alt codes will be coming out. I read on your blog
long ago about this book you envisioned but I have not seen announcments or
preordering on Amazon. I also have not seen you posting much on the mailing
lists. Did some event in your life that made you less talkative? I hope this
is not true and look forward to your great book. maybe it will rival the
great hacker kevin mitnick's books about hacking stories he could never
accomplish in real life since they did not revolve around social
engineering.

Thanks,
BB Gun Holder
