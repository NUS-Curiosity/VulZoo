Subject: Re: Apple Safari ... DoS Vulnerability



Dear Michael,
I understand your point, however consider that
your examples are showing the different *impacts* of a DoS condition.

A bug becomes a security problem once it violates at least one of the three
letters C or I or A. That's the point. The impact and risk assesement
is to be done later on and can only be done partialy by a vendor since
the use of the affected products sometimes heavily depends on the
implementation or use case.

This is not to be measured or estimated completely by a vendor
but the client/user/integrator of said products in their specific
enviroment and use and abuse cases. For example Internet Kiosk vendors.
