Versions Vulnerable: 2.1 and below

***********************************************************************

Summary

Banking@...e is an home banking application that allows customers to access
their account information using the web.
The application uses data in a database management system that uses Structured
Query Language (SQL) as a data access standard.

**********************************************************************

Vulnerability Details

The login page of Net Banking is vulnerable to SQL Injection attack,
due to a missing input validation mechanisms.
An attacker can inject SQL code into the username and password fields,
altering the login procedure.
There is a classic error based injection, really easy to exploit to
take control
of the entire server.
Authentication bypass is possible using valid username, no password is
required,
or otherwise the user table can be arbitrary modified.
