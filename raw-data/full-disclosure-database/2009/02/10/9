According to the Federal Standard 1037C, the National Information
Systems Security Glossary, and the Department of Defense Dictionary of
Military and Associated Terms:

"In telecommunications, the term decrypt has the following meanings:

1. [A] generic term encompassing decode and decipher.

2. To convert encrypted text into its equivalent plaintext by means of
a cryptosystem. "

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decrypt>


So no, I mean decrypt.
