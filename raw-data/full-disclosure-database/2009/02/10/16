Subject: Re: connect back PHP hack

i really appreciate all of the responses. this is what community is all about.

i'd seen the "==" in other encoding schemes, but just wasn't sure and
wanted a quick response...thanks to everyone who responded!

I'll post the rest of my findings on here asap. i'm looking into an
old compromised machine. this is nothing new..

whoever mentioned the r57 shell, you're probably right as the script
connects to a remote box @ port 11457. this is r57 behaviour.

i also found a copy of the same script i'm dissecting on someone
else's box, you can check it out here:
http://www.menola.org/~matjaz/images/info/o_meni/config.inc.php

in my case, a bunch of php files were modified. i'll zip everything up
and host it so you can all analyze...

thx,

sr. aka "fabrizio siciliano"
