Synopsis
========

An error in the processing of special sequences in xterm may lead to
arbitrary commands execution.

Background
==========

xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-terms/xterm        < 239                               >= 239

Description
===========

Paul Szabo reported an insufficient input sanitization when processing
Device Control Request Status String (DECRQSS) sequences.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to display a file containing
specially crafted DECRQSS sequences, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user viewing
the file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xterm users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/xterm-239"
