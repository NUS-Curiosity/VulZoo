Impact
======

An attacker with knowledge of the Default Usernames and Passwords
Vulnerability accounts could modify the device configuration and, in
certain instances, gain user access to the host operating system.

An exploit of the Privilege Escalation Vulnerability could allow an
authenticated attacker to execute host operating system
administrative commands.

Successful exploitation of the Crafted SSH Packet Vulnerability,
Crafted SNMPv2 Packet Vulnerability, and Crafted SNMPv3 Packet
Vulnerability may cause a reload of the affected device. Repeated
exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the software table (below) describes the earliest
possible releases that contain the fix (along with the anticipated
date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed in the
"First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended Release"
column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the published
vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory. A device running a
release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a
specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be
vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or later
than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the table.

Workarounds
===========

This Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities and their respective workarounds are
independent of each other.

Default Usernames and Passwords
+------------------------------

To change the default administrative password, use the username
command in configuration mode. The syntax of this command is as
follows:

    username admin [password [0 | 5] {password}]

The keywords, arguments, and options are:

admin--Specifies the default administrative user name.

password--(Optional) Keyword that indicates that a password follows.

0--(Optional) Specifies a clear text password.

5--(Optional) Specifies an MD5-hashed strong encryption password.

password--The password in clear text, encrypted text, or MD5 strong
encryption, depending on the numbered option (0 or 5) that you enter.
If you do not enter a numbered option, the password is in clear text
by default. Enter a password as an unquoted text string with a
maximum of 64 characters.

For example, to create a user named admin that uses the clear text
password my_super_secret_88312, enter the following command:

    ACE(config)# username admin password 0 my_super_secret_88312

Note: This process can also be followed to change the www user
account credentials. The dm user is for accessing the Device Manager
GUI and cannot be modified or deleted. The dm user is an internal
user required by the Device Manager GUI; it is hidden on the ACE CLI.
For more information refer to: 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/app_ntwk_services/data_center_app_services/ace_appliances/vA3_1_0/configuration/virtualization/guide/config.html

Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
+---------------------------------

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.

Crafted SSH Packet Vulnerability
+-------------------------------

SSH management traffic that can be received by the ACE is controlled
through the use of class maps, policy maps, and service policies.

This Management Traffic Service example denies unauthorized SSH
packets that are sent to an affected device. In the following
example, 192.168.100.1 is considered a trusted source that requires
SSH access to the affected device. Care should be taken to allow all
required management access to the affected device. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability using spoofed packets. This workaround
cannot provide complete protection against this vulnerability when
the attack comes from a trusted source address.

The following example demonstrates how SSH access to the ACE is only
allowed from the 192.168.100.1 host:


    !-- Configure a class to allow SSH from the trusted source
    !

    class-map type management match-all Permit_SSH_Class
     description Allow SSH from trusted sources Class
     match protocol ssh source-address 192.168.100.1 255.255.255.255

    !
    !-- Configure a management policy that allows ssh from the
    !--trusted source configured in the above class
    !

    policy-map type management first-match Permit_SSH_Policy
      description Allow SSH from trusted sources Policy
      class Permit_SSH_Class
        permit

    !
    !-- Apply the management policy globally
    !

    service-policy input Permit_SSH_Policy

available at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/interfaces_modules/services_modules/ace/v3.00_A1/configuration/administration/guide/access.html#wp1049450

Additional information about "Configuring Class Maps and Policy Maps"
is available at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/interfaces_modules/services_modules/ace/v3.00_A1/configuration/administration/guide/mapolcy.html

warning Warning: It is possible to easily spoof the sender's IP
address, which may defeat class maps and access control lists (ACLs)
that permit communication to the device from trusted IP addresses.

Crafted SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 Packet Vulnerabilities
+-----------------------------------------------

SNMP management traffic that can be received by the ACE is controlled
through the use of class maps, policy maps, and service policies.

This Management Traffic Service example denies unauthorized SNMP
packets on UDP port 161 that are sent to an affected device. In the
following example, 192.168.100.1 is considered a trusted source that
requires SNMP access to the affected device. Care should be taken to
allow all required management access to the affected device. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability using spoofed packets. This
workaround cannot provide complete protection against this
vulnerability when the attack comes from a trusted source address.


    !-- Configure a class to allow SNMP from the trusted source
    !

    class-map type management match-all Permit_SNMP_Class
    description Allow SNMP from trusted sources Class

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a008088e31f.html
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
