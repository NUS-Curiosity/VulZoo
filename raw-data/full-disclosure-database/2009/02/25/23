Details
=======

ANM is a network management application that manages Cisco ACE modules
or appliances. ANM is installed on customer provided servers with a Red
Hat Enterprise Linux operating system. The ACE Device Manager provides
a browser-based interface for configuring and managing a single ACE
appliance. The ACE Device Manager resides in flash memory on the ACE
appliance. Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ANM and one in the ACE
Device Manager products. The following details are provided for each
vulnerability addressed in this security advisory.

Invalid Directory Permissions
+----------------------------

Versions of the Cisco ACE Device Manager prior to software version
A3(2.1) and Cisco ANM prior software version ANM 2.0 contain directory
traversal vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow
unauthorized access to ACE operating system and host operating system
files. To exploit these vulnerabilities authentication is required to
initially access either product.

This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug IDs:

  * CSCsv66063
  * CSCsv70130

This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and
Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-0615.

Default User Credentials
+-----------------------

Versions of Cisco ANM prior to software version ANM 2.0 do not force
credential changes during installation. If these credentials are left
unchanged, this could allow unauthorized access to the ANM
application with default user credentials.

This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug ID:

  * CSCsu52724

This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and
Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-0616.

MySQL Default Credentials
+------------------------

ANM versions prior to ANM 2.0 use a default MySQL root user password
during installation. The MySQL database is installed by default when
ANM is initially installed. This vulnerability can be exploited
remotely with default credential authentication and without end-user
interaction. Unauthorized access to the database may allow
modification of system files that could impact the function of ANM or
allow execution of commands on the underlying host operating system.
The ACE appliance and module device configuration files in the MySQL
database are encrypted.

This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug ID:

  * CSCsu52632

This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and
Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-0617.

Java Agent Privilege Escalation
+------------------------------

ANM versions prior to ANM 2.0 Update A contain a remotely exploitable
vulnerability that could allow an attacker to view configuration
files and modify ANM processes including the capability to stop
services. Exploitation of this issue could result in system
information disclosure or denial of services.

This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug ID:

  * CSCsu73001

This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and
Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-0618.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the ACE Device Manager and ANM invalid
directory permission vulnerabilities may allow unauthorized access to
view or modify the ACE Device Manager or ANM file system, including host
operating system files. Modification of some system files could result
in a denial of service condition.

Exploitation of the ANM default user credential and ANM MySQL database
default credential vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to gain
unauthorized system access. Modification of ANM settings with the
default user credentials could result in a denial of service condition.
Unauthorized access to the MySQL database may allow modification of
system files that could impact the function of ANM or allow execution of
commands on the underlying host operating system.

Successful exploitation of the ANM privilege escalation vulnerability
may result in unauthorized remote access to system processes and
services with the ability to modify. Modification of these services
could result in a denial of service condition.
