You got that wrong in a subtle and important way.  What Kevin said:

isn't like the doctor telling you "We found a tumor in you but we won't tell
*you* what it is".  It's more like "We found a tumor, and we won't tell your
employer, because they might try to cancel your medical insurance when they
find out how much this is going to cost".

And *that* threat model (retaliation by employers/friends/society) is a
well-understood threat model, and is *why* medical records are in general
considered confidential.
