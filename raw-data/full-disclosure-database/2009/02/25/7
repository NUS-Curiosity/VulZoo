4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Orbit Downloader,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when generating
the "Connecting" log message for HTTP downloads. This can be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a
user into downloading from a malicious HTTP server or opening a
specially crafted HTTP URL containing an overly long host name.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Update to version 2.8.5.
