Subject: BBC "cyber war" piece

"Nato officials have told the BBC their computers are under constant
attack from organisations and individuals bent on trying to hack into
their secrets."

(NB - the author of that piece, IMNSHO, has a tendency to sound like
an uncritical mouthpiece for the military-spooky complex.)
