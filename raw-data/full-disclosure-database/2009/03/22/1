Subject: Suspected default hardcoded root account in
	D-Link embedded Linux for the DAP1353 router

>>From my point of view it looks like the D-LINK DAP1353 includes a hardcoded
root account which would allow, if present, anybody to access the router.

But I am unsure if the provided source code matchs the reality because I do
lack physical access to this device.
I asked serval people know and tried to contact D-LINK as well but nothing
worked out so far.

I will not spread FUD but I think my assumptions about the root-account
are correct.

I would be happy if somebody may spend the time to confirm or deny the existence
of the vuln. on a real router.

More informations can get found here:
www.helith.net/beta/d-link_dap1353_default_password_and_weak_openssh_
configuration.txt

Please do not link to that text yet because I might be wrong at all.

A quick test should be possible by doing this:

Connect to 2.54.45.167 port 22 (this is the hardcoded IP in the source code)
User1 admin
Passwd1 adminpasswd


Kind regards,
Rembrandt
