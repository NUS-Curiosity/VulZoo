Siemes Gigaset SE461 WiMAX router remote dos

Date             : 2008-02-08
Vendor           : Siemens
Affected product : Gigaset SE461 WiMAX router
Firmware version : 1.5-BL024.9.6401
Type             : Denial of Service

There is an error in the referenced device that causes
it to restart. This condition can be triggered by specially
crafted web content or by issuing a connection from the lan interface
to the affected device on port 53. Sometimes it even looses
the configuration for the wan interface (ip, gateway, dns, etc.).
