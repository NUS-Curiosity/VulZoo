It depends on where the piece of data causing the crash has come from.

(1) Could it (or any other piece of data in its place) make arbitrary
changes to the contents of the loaded page without having to rely on any
browser bug (e.g. the top HTML document)?

(2) Does it originate from the same subject (person, company, whatever)
as any other piece of data that is included in the loaded page and able
to make arbitrary changes as per (1)?

The crash is a real (DoS) attack against the browser if and only if
the answer to both questions is negative. (Assuming the crash has no
consequences other than the loss of the page loaded into the crashed
tab.)
