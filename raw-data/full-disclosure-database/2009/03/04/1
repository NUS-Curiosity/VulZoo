IE, Firefox, Safari and Chrome all have basic protection against
long-running scripts -
http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/01/05/what-determines-that-a-script-is-long-running/
has some information on each implementation.

What else would you have browser vendors do? I expect they think their
current strategy of responding to specific bugs along with a bit of
fuzzing and insane-input-testing is cost-effective and 'good enough'
for their users.
