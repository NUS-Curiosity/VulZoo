Does 'telnet www.example.com 80' or 'netcat' count as a browser?  Do
ascii-only things that only render static html count?  Does a mainstream
browser with javascript and/or plugins disabled count?

You then get to do a similar analysis defining "secure".  It isn't a binary
yes/no - it's a continuum of different issues and relative importance, and
different people may rank things in different orders.  Somebody who is
responsible for regulatory compliance probably cares more about data exposure
and identity theft issues - but a browser crash resulting in no data loss
isn't an issue.  Meanwhile, the guy who has to run the help desk cares
if an issue crashes browsers and generates phone calls (anybody who was working
in a NOC when Nachi came around knows how fast the costs of an outage can
pile up, even if no data is permanently lost).

Gotta draw a boundary box if you want reasonable answers.

Again, you have to make a decision - if an exploit *did* manage to abuse
a browser's code, but was then foiled by an OS security feature (ACLs, ASLR,
SELinux, or whatever), does that count as "a secure browser", or "a secure OS"?
