And adding 64 bit support improves l0phtcrack how? (Consider that it doesn't
significantly add to the number of boxes it will run on, because the vast
majority of target boxes are still 32-bit environments).  Remember that
programmer time is *always* limited, so you *always* have to pick and choose
which features will actually get written in time for the next release.

The improved rainbow tables will probably make a hell of a lot bigger *actual*
difference than the 64-bit support.
