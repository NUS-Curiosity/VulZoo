Dear list,

Recently there have been many conversations regarding advanced
browser hacks (denial by crashing attacks, too many tab attacks,
code execution power hacks, etc).  I would like to start a
discussion, weighing in every expert opinion on what the most
secure web browser is and why.  Also whether or not the underlying
operating system matters - is firefox more secure under BeOS than
mosaic under IBM's dos?  How do these things compare?  Does anyone
have any charts and/or graphs for visual comparison on this topic
already that they would like to share?

Thanks,
- -bm
