More people should hijack machines and push updates to them if their
users are unable or unwilling.

First an Analogy:
If someone's letting money launders use their bank account to launder
money out of INACTION that's still illegal, the same SHOULD be true of
people who leave their systems unpatched.

These machines are negligently left open to be used in 'nefarious
criminal activity.'

Plan of Action:
It's your civic duty to write worms, hijack botnets and patch machines
with or without user consent.
This is absolutely moral holding to the various tests (is it self
defeating if -everyone- does it etc etc)
Just don't get caught doing it.

I'm disgusted by the imposition that you'd decry their actions for
being illegal when they were clearly moral and represent a net benefit
for society. Haven't you heard of this guy called Gandhi who didn't
subscribe to the arbitrary superficial morality provided by the word
of the law and only acted on what he knew to be moral?

It's time to elevate yourself out of your own mind-slime and into 2009.
We all still have a long way to go.
