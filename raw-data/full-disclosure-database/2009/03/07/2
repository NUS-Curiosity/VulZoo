Subject: Re: List of Fuzzers

You shut the hell up you piece of fucking garbage. You and the other trolls
like to talk shit in a circle jerk fashion on this fucked up list, and
others can talk it back. I've been following this shit excuse for a
gathering of information by security "professionals" for a while now and I'm
sure like everyone else I'm not the only one who tires of your bullshit you
faceless prick.

Come to orange county and talk shit and see if you don't get knocked the
fuck out. No, you won't come? I'd just about buy your plane ticket if I knew
you would not chicken out. Pussy. I've already got my job in CS so I don't
have to hold anything back when I use my real name, unlike you retarded
fucks.

And for Mr. Kletnieks, Jeremy Brown, Nick FitzGerald, the cool guys @
snosoft/netragard/whatever, all the other guys from the past, present, and
future, and from me... I give a big, hugeee FUCK YOU. That FUCK YOU is also
extended to the other trolls on this list, you've maid everyone's experience
on the internet suck. Fuckups.
