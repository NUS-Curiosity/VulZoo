Synopsis
========

An error in nfs-utils allows for bypass of the netgroups restriction.

Background
==========

nfs-utils contains the client and daemon implementations for the NFS
protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/nfs-utils       < 1.1.3                           >= 1.1.3

Description
===========

Michele Marcionelli reported that nfs-utils invokes the hosts_ctl()
function with the wrong order of arguments, which causes TCP Wrappers
to ignore netgroups.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could bypass intended access restrictions, i.e. NFS
netgroups, and gain access to restricted services.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All nfs-utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/nfs-utils-1.1.3"

==========
