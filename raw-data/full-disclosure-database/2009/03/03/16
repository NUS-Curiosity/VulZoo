Dear Valdis,

I have been able to reproduce a similar situation using Firefox
under MacOSX, using different websites and a significantly larger
number of tabs.  Do you think these issues might be related or are
they operating system specific?  What model of CPU were you testing
this issue under?

Thanks,
- -bm
