Subject: Re: Apple Safari ... DoS Vulnerability

I would like to point out that I have been able to create a "hung"
state in the Firefox browser by opening 30 simultaneous tabs pointed
at http://www.welcometointernet.org/lawnmower/ and adding a 31st tab
viewing http://www.hotrussianbrides.com.

Also, I am not amused.


Your humble servant,
Ze Mustache von Kletnieks
