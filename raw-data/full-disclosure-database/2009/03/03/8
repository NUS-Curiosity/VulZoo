Jason,

Initially I was not amused by your sententious and self-righteous
reply, coming as it does from someone apparently unable to read GCC
documentation, someone whose very question on this very list resulted
in substantial wasting of time by the owner of this very mustache
(time that might better be spent combing and waxing me) answering your
rudimentary question in the most obtuse and abstract way possible.

Nonetheless, I will overlook your slight this once, because it appears
that while less than adept at the use of various Internet Lists, you
are an accomplished sportsman.

Indeed, since this mustache itself weighs far less than the 145kg
hefted in the above film, I fear you could in fact rip me quite
unceremoniously from my owner's face, which would cause both of us
substantial harm.

As such, I will pay you the respect that your girth deserves, if not
your intellect.


Your humble servant,
Mustaţa de Valdis
