But what if www.evil.com has run an injection attack of some kind (SQL, 
XSS in blog comments, etc, etc) against www.stupid.com?

Visitors to stupid.com then suffer a DoS...

Yes, stupid.com should run their site better, fix their myriad XSS holes, 
etc, etc.

But this is the Internet, so this "software flaw" can be leveraged as 
security vulnerability.

I'm with Thierry on this...
