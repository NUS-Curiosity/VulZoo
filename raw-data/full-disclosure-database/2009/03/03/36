By this definition of yours, DoS is fundamentally built in to browsers
(by way of simply following specifications) -- even those with decent
privsep models.

Web security IS fundamentally broken at the foundations, so I'm not

It raises the question: DoS is an overloaded term, perhaps it should
be reserved for cases that actually have real-world significance? Or
is a new term required?
