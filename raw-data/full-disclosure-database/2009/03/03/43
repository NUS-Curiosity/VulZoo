Not necessarily...

Factually, probably so but that says more about our s/w development 
methods and what has (historically) passed as "acceptable" in that arena.

Browsers could reasonably implement various kinds of resource expenditure 
limitations, but few, if any, do OOTB (FF 2.x I think added some basic 
"this script is taking too long" controls, but there is a lot more that 
could be done).

Is that specification antagonistic?  Arguably yes because the 
specifications don't say "... to N levels of recursion" and such.

But maybe that tells us an awful lot about the specifications and the 
culture of the folk who wrote them?

Yep -- they came from that "she'll be right" s/w dev background that is 
responsible for most of the crap that means we're assured of jobs for 
life (well, if you're as old as me anyway!).

DoS is not an overloaded term -- it means pretty much what it says, as 
Thierry pointed out.

Yes, a lot of noobs and journalists confuse it with _D_DoS and its usual, 
deliberate "with malicious intent" connotation, but that might just be an 
education problem...

How do we operationally define "real-world significance"?

That was my original point -- this is a DoS

Whether it's "worthy" of discussion here or not is a different issue that 
touches precisely on the issue of defining "real-world significance".

There may be some subtle use for such a vuln that allows it to be 
combined with one or more other "minor" vulns to make for a modestly 
worrying attack, or there may not.  Until that is found (probably by a 
Black Hat because White Hats are so quick to dismiss things like this 
with "it's only a trivial browser tab-closing DoS" and move on to sexier 
sounding bugs) this may be ignored because no-one deems it "worthy", 
extending the long, sad history of quality neglect in s/w development.
