While I generally agree that if its just a straight DoS that there is
very little difference-- but to play devils advocate some--
the difference is that with JS closing the tab, the code path was a
known/valid/authorized one, whereas the other could potentially be
anything, and whatever it is, it could be useful given the right
circumstances.

I know you know this, Chris, actually both of you (&& Thierry), so I'm
somewhat preaching to the choir perhaps, but imho, all sigsegv's are at
least worth investigating; 99.9% of them may be a useless dos, .09% might
be useful dos's and .01% might just be the thing that turns $'s into #'s.
Say saying 'lol xor eax, eax mov [eax], 0x01234567... trash' is a bit
silly
