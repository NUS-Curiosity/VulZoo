cURL/libcURL Arbitrary File Access
Release date: 03/Jan/2009
CVE: CVE-2009-0037

Quote from: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/:
"libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library,
supporting FTP, FTPS,
HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, TELNET, DICT, LDAP, LDAPS and FILE."

This vulnerability could permit remote arbitrary file access and command
execution under “less-likely” circumstances.

This is a joint advisory release with cURL. The latest version addresses
this problem.
