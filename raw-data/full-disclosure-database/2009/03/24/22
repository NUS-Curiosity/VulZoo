Package        : iceweasel

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (Etch) needed to be
stopped before the end of the regular security maintenance life cycle. 

You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

On a side note, please note that the Debian stable/Lenny version of
Iceweasel - the unbranded version of the Firefox browser - links 
dynamically against the Xulrunner library. As such, most of the
vulnerabilities found in Firefox need only be fixed in the Xulrunner
package and don't require updates to the Iceweasel package any longer.
