With all due respect, my corned beef and sauerkraut smelling
friend, I am simply pointing out that when it comes to security
nvidia is clueless.  Do you not remember the great debacle of 2006
when Rapid7 showed off remote kernel exploitation of the nvidia
driver by webbrowser?  http://kerneltrap.org/node/7228 should
refresh your memory.  40 million lost credit cards but at least
they put nvidia in their rightful place and have their priorities
in order.  And speaking of security concerns and nvidia, why do you
think Microsoft didn't use nvidia in their trusted gaming platform
xbox360????  Everyone in our industry knows that nvidia is shit for
security, even their javascript sucks!!!
