Subject: DEFCON London DC4420 March meeting - Thursday
	19th March

Yes it's that time of the month already! We need to meet in west London 
and drink beer! Errr... I mean talk about techy hacky stuff...

This month we've got Dominic giving us an update on his Bluetooth Foo, 
and, in an attempt to encourage some more speakers to come forward, the 
rest of the session will be devoted only to lightning talks, starting 
with a Dradis overview by etd.

So, if you've got an idea, or a germ of an idea, a few slides or no 
slides at all, come and tell us about it and get some genuine feedback, 
expressions of interest, offers of collaboration, or just shock and awe, 
depending on how leet your shizzle is... :)

Location is, as usual, upstairs at The Glassblower in Soho
42 Glasshouse St, Piccadilly, W1B 5JY

They do good food and real ales, and we have the bar exclusively to 
ourselves until kicking out time...

Talks start at 19:30.

See you there!

cheers,
MM
