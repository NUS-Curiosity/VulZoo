Subject: Re: what is DNS response that 255.255.255.255?

Hello,

Well, the blocklist  of IPv4 address is (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255),
and the IPv4 defines many classes A,B,C,D,E, the address 255.255.255.255
reside in class E (240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255)
and that class should not be used on IP networks. it's just for experimental
purpose.

Anyway, the address 255.255.255.255 is a broadcast  that deliver message
from one sender to many recipients.
Sending a direct message to an IP broadcast for example to 255.255.255.255
indicate that all other nodes on LAN should receive that message.
You can send a broadcast ping on your LAN by typing:
$ ping -b 255.255.255.255
 That result all active target on you local network response to ping.
