Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in libcdaudio might allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libcdaudio is a library of CD audio related routines.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libcdaudio     < 0.99.12-r1              >= 0.99.12-r1

Description
===========

A heap-based buffer overflow has been reported in the
cddb_read_disc_data() function in cddb.c when processing overly long
CDDB data.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious CDDB
server, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libcdaudio users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libcdaudio-0.99.12-r1"
