Subject: Re: what is DNS response that 255.255.255.255?


I lauched

ping windowsupdate.daemon.sh it is resolving to a public IP.
PING windowsupdate.daemon.sh (218.18.149.138) 56(84) bytes of data.

The whois:

inetnum:      218.13.0.0 - 218.18.255.255
netname:      CHINANET-GD
descr:        CHINANET Guangdong province network
descr:        Data Communication Division
descr:        China Telecom
country:      CN

At this web site are showing something different but the virus is using
the same DNS Resolution.

Do you see anything else?
Could you tell me more about your tests?
