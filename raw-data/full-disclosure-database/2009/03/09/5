Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in PyCrypto might lead to the execution of arbitrary
code when decrypting using ARC2.

Background
==========

PyCrypto is the Python Cryptography Toolkit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-python/pycrypto     < 2.0.1-r8                    >= 2.0.1-r8

Description
===========

Mike Wiacek of the Google Security Team reported a buffer overflow in
the ARC2 module when processing a large ARC2 key length.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to decrypt an
ARC2 stream in an application using PyCrypto, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PyCrypto users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/pycrypto-2.0.1-r8"
