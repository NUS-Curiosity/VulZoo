Synopsis
========

Incomplete verification of RSA and DSA certificates might lead to
spoofed records authenticated using DNSSEC.

Background
==========

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/bind     < 9.4.3_p1                           >= 9.4.3_p1

Description
===========

BIND does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL
functions to verify DSA (CVE-2009-0025) and RSA (CVE-2009-0265)
certificates.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could bypass validation of the certificate chain to
spoof DNSSEC-authenticated records.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All BIND users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.4.3_p1"
