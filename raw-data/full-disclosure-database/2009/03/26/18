Lorenzo, I apologise for any confusion - that question was geared
toward Valdis, not you.  I never meant to suggest or imply with any
level of sarcasm that your actual profession was to independently
discover and report URL redirection attacks against random internet
bound hosts; simply I was curious how much Valdis was paid to do
this.  Once again, sorry.
