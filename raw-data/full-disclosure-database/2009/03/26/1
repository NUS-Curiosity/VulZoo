No, but just because this kind of vulnerability is "only" indirectly 
serious dosen't mean that they aren't serious.

Just because _you_ are too dim to imagine a way that someone can profit 
significantly from exploiting this does not mean that there are not such 
methods, NOR that use of such exploits won't "damage" nVidia.

Whether nVidia (and others affected by so many similar vulnerabilities) 
will see this and decide to take action is what really matters.  In this 
regard, I certainly hope that you do not work for, or consult with, or 
otherwise represent the view of nVidia on this issue.
