We've seen weirder things used in phish and other scams...

Remember, open redirectors allow remote "brand reputation transfer" (aka 
theft) for whatever purpose may suit a third a party.  Web app devs and 
admins who do not inherently understand that (some 80+% by my estimates) 
should not be allowed near any servers on the public Internet.  (That 
would put Doubleclick, and thereby much of Google, well out of business.)

I can imagine ways the "fake codec" folk could _very_ conveniently use 
this to boost their install rates.  (If I have to spell this out to 
anyone here, they're on the wrong list...)

...

Now Valdis -- what odds will you give for nVidia fixing this before we 
see it being roundly abused?
