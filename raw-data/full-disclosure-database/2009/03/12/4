Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in ProFTPD might allow for SQL injection attacks.

Background
==========

ProFTPD is an advanced and very configurable FTP server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-ftp/proftpd       < 1.3.2                            >= 1.3.2

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were reported:

* Percent characters in the username are not properly handled, which
  introduces a single quote character during variable substitution by
  mod_sql (CVE-2009-0542).

* Some invalid, encoded multibyte characters are not properly handled
  in mod_sql_mysql and mod_sql_postgres when NLS support is enabled
  (CVE-2009-0543).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests to the server,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary SQL statements.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.2"
