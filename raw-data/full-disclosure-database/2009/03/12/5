Subject: Access any album on any Facebook profile

Hi
everyone,
	I was creating a presentation last week covering the security risks
and weaknesses of social networking websites and I found a few
interesting things. The most interesting flaw I found was the poor
control around access to users photo albums on Facebook, not the
worlds biggest hack by a long way but still interesting. 

	I contacted Facebook last Thursday and I never received a response
so I felt it was time to post the full details on my blog. I think
most Facebook users would know that you can give a public URL to
every photo and album you upload so that non Facebook users can view
them. I wondered if we could exploit this somehow to allow us to
access any users photos and albums without being their friends,
without being in groups with them, have friends who are friends with
them etc etc I found out it is possible! All you have to do is
perform a search, hover over the “add friend” link, fire up the
Burp Suite and sit back and wait for the photos!I have still received
no response from Facebook so I have posted the full details here:

 I acknowledge that this isn't a huge flaw and will not change the
world of security but it I thought people would find it interesting.
