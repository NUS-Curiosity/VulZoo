Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in TMSNC might lead to the execution of arbitrary
code when processing an instant message.

Background
==========

TMSNC is a Textbased client for the MSN instant messaging protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/tmsnc      <= 0.3.2-r1                         Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Nico Golde reported a stack-based buffer overflow when processing a MSN
packet with a UBX command containing a large UBX payload length field.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted message, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Since TMSNC is no longer maintained, we recommend that users unmerge
the vulnerable package and switch to another console-based MSN client
such as CenterIM or Pebrot:

    # emerge --unmerge "net-im/tmsnc"
