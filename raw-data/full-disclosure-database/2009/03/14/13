I'm not sure if I agree with that, you'd have to convince me.

To me, there's a huge difference between growing/cooking drugs and
buying/using them. I think the same sense applies here.

I agree that supporting the bot-runners is a bad idea, but I don't think
that paying them for their bots puts them on equal footing.

(In my humble opinion, of course)
