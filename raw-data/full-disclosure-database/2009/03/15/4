Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libpng, which might result in
the execution of arbitrary code

Background
==========

libpng is the official PNG reference library used to read, write and
manipulate PNG images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libpng      < 1.2.35                         >= 1.2.35

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libpng:

* A memory leak bug was reported in png_handle_tEXt(), a function
  that is used while reading PNG images (CVE-2008-6218).

* A memory overwrite bug was reported by Jon Foster in
  png_check_keyword(), caused by writing overlong keywords to a PNG
  file (CVE-2008-5907).

* A memory corruption issue, caused by an incorrect handling of an
  out of memory condition has been reported by Tavis Ormandy of the
  Google Security Team. That vulnerability affects direct uses of
  png_read_png(), pCAL chunk and 16-bit gamma table handling
  (CVE-2009-0040).

Impact
======

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user opening a specially crafted PNG file by exploiting the erroneous
out-of-memory handling. An attacker may also exploit the
png_check_keyword() error to set arbitrary memory locations to 0, if
the application allows overlong, user-controlled keywords when writing
PNG files. The png_handle_tEXT() vulnerability may be exploited by an
attacker to potentially consume all memory on a users system when a
specially crafted PNG file is opened.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.35"
