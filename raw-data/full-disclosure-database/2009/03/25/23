What is this field you brag experience in?  Independent
Professional Open URL Redirection Vulnerability Reporting?  Can you
cite any of these statistics you're talking about because to be
quite honest we think you're making this up, along with everything
else.  Linking to some actual statistics will improve your full-
disclosure credibility greatly.  How did you determine the 50/50
probability or is that just based up on made-up numbers as well?  I
thought Len Rose removed all the trolls from this list, why are you
still here?
