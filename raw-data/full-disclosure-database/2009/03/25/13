Subject: nVidia.com [Url Redirection flaw]

Yes i've notice that is also vulnerable to Xss.. In fact this link :

http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload/download_confirmation.asp?kw=&url=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22xss%22)%3C/script%3E

will succefully popup an "xss" alert message. Moreover i've checked
Xssed.com and i saw that a Xss flaw(not url redirection)  was already
been found by st@...t ( http://www.xssed.com/mirror/25632/ ) in
17/11/2007. Nevertheless i think that nvidia was not aware of any
vulnerabilities until the day in which I alerted the admin to the url
redirection on nvidia.com (or nvidia is very slow to solve problems,
but i don't wanna do thnik so.. :) ). In fact he answer me that a bug
report was opened and that his team is working to solve the problem.
Despite i've told to nvidia only the "url redirection"  flaw i think
that, if "url redirection" will be solved all the xss inherently
vulnerabilites will be solved too.

Well, we have a XSS too, just put whatever you want on the variable
"url" closing first the meta refresh tag, i.e:

http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload/download_confirmation.asp?kw=&url="><iframe
src="http://www.yahoo.com/" with="100%" height=600></iframe><!--

Since nVidia is a trusted site some people could use it to spread
malware directly from there. This is just a simple redirection issue
and nVidia may have to correct this ASAP, even if they are just
"graphics vendors".

Regards.
