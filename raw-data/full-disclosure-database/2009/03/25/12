Look, this security mailing list is about computer security issues and
not meant to be your video gaming blog  Also you are confusing the
issues of hardware and the drivers and other softwares that interact
with them, but that is beside the point!!!!!!  We are attempting to
discuss serious computer security issues such as XSS, XSRF, url
misguidance attacks, and remote kernel driver exploitation by way of
internet exploration interfaces.  No one on this list cares about which
videocard you prefer for your Rapelay gameplay, and further this simply
isn't the place to talk about that sort of thing.
