What about indirectly? People love to rant and rave about redirectors,
but none of it is informed. Sure, redirectors often feature in URLs
leading to malware etc. But that's irrelevant without click-through
rates and block rates on the redirected vs. non-redirected versions.
All the evidence I see is that the class of users we're trying to
protect will click on arbitrary links without care for the domain.
(And enter their passwords in any domain, without checking for https,
and etc. etc).
