Actual experience in the field has shown that in general, if you report a URL
redirection issue to the maintainers of a website, a large percentage of the
time they will *only* fix the problem with URL redirection, unless you make it
clear to them *and they understand* that the URL redirection is only one
symptom of a larger XSS issue.

I'll give it a 50-50 chance that somebody will get to send NVidia an email
saying "Good, you fixed the URL problem.  Now about that XSS...."
