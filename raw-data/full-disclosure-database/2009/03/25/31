Subject: Re: nVidia.com [Url Redirection flaw]

There's a difference between an xss and an url redirection ..
this post was about an url js based redirection, now it's a Xss, to me
that's a lot of talk ( and i do contribute ) for an no persistant xss , now
if you wanna have your 2 sec of glory post it on xssed.com ..
