Absolutely,

We can use the infallible word 'periodicity' statistical analysis
(which depends on the minutia of word selection, grammar, and sentence
structure, which would totally survive the machine translation
process) pioneered by pseudo-scientists in this recent millenia!
After building a large database of profiles from social networking
websites, where they'll hopefully write in the same engineered tone,
we can then find their twitter accounts, and then find out what latest
evil schemes they have planned.

Yes yes all very useful insights here, please keep them coming.
