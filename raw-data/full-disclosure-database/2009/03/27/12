Dear Mr. M.B.Jr.,

While I cannot show conclusive evidence between the two concurrent 
events, the causality in this case seems pretty obvious for the 
following reasons:

	1. The two (phishing and translation module) occurred at around
	the same time frame.

	2. Previously, this was not happening.

	3. The imperfect Hebrew looks like a machine translation.

	4. In fact, the only new element I can discern being added to
	the game was the new Google module.

Google is not at fault, they provide a valuable and good service. 
Criminals abuse the same tools we use.

I concede that it is not outside the realm of possibility some crappy 
Hebrew translator suddenly started working with the phishing gangs, but 
it doesn't seem likely.

Conversely, do note I did not state it was Google's translation engine 
that was abused, but rather asked if others see this as well and can 
confirm. I say it now, it is the most likely conclusion.

I'd be happy if someone has other ideas to help us reach a better 
conclusion?

	Gadi.
