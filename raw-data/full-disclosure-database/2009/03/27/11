	with Google translations)

Cherished comber of my hairs and waxer of my pointy bits,

On a lark I thought I would attempt exactly the experiment you proposed!

An Original English Phrase:

You are a self-important fucktard with nothing useful to say who responds to
every thread with inanities so that you might see your own name in your
Inbox.

The English Phrase Translated to Hebrew Via Machine Translation:

אתה חשוב fucktard עצמי עם שום דבר מועיל להגיד לכל מי מגיב עם פתיל inanities
כך שאתה יכול לראות את עצמו שם בתיבת הדואר הנכנס שלך.

The Phrase Translated Back Again From Hebrew to English Via Machine
Translation:

You self-important Fucktard with nothing useful to say to anyone who
responds with Inanities thread so you can see the actual name in your inbox.

As you can see, there were a few caveats in using this method, with notable
discrete idiosyncracies in both verb tense and sentence structure in the
second round of translation, and also an apparent lack of Hebrew equivalents
both for "fucktard", and "inanities". This would make communication by an
attacker via this approach imperfect, and provide useful telltale
"fingerprints" on translation-enciphered messages that would be useful in
for forensic lexical analysis.


Your Humble Servant,
Тхе бркови од Валдис

P.S. These stray hairs don't clip themselves, you know. It's been awhile.

It would be interesting if somebody were to reverse it and find the
English that resulted in the imperfect Hebrew, and then do some forensics
on that input text to try to ascertain the original source.
