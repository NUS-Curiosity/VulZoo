Subject: Re: List of Fuzzers

What's hilarious is that none of them are usefull :)
You should really learn the protocol you want to fuzz, and develop a
strategy before you create anything else.
Every fuzzer you've made use the SAME way to ""fuzz"" for differents
app/protocol.

The only change i see is your last fuzzer .. written in a different
language, but still the same way ...
