90% of the research above were found by fuzzing, and those are public.

Wrong.
The IE overhyped bug wasn't found with any of your fuzzers, and also do you
really
need a fuzzer to find a bug in konqueror ?

The rest of theses lists are once again useless bugs, because these software
are used by ~1000 users worldwide.
Let me clarify this: i don't say you cant crash some useless
cnet/download/.com software
with your fuzzer, i only say that you cant beat any widly used software with
your fuzzing methods.
If you really knew what mean "Intelligent Fuzzing", we wouldn't have this
discution right now.
