Synopsis
========

An SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the Courier
Authentication Library.

Background
==========

The Courier Authentication Library is a generic authentication API that
encapsulates the process of validating account passwords.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/courier-authlib      < 0.62.2                  >= 0.62.2

Description
===========

It has been reported that some parameters used in SQL queries are not
properly sanitized before being processed when using a non-Latin locale
Postgres database.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted input to an application
using the library, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary SQL
commands.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Courier Authentication Library users should upgrade to the latest
version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/courier-authlib-0.62.2"
