Hi,

my TV licence money isnt for paying criminals. What the BBC did
breaks several laws, Computer Misuse Act being the major one. Its not
a case of white hat v's black hat, the AV companies etc cant fix the
worlds computers the easiest way  (probe them and patch vulnerable
ones before the bad guys get them) because of these same laws.

either the laws need changing, or rewriting etc to account for 
any 'good' behaviour that has no bad or undesirable consequences.

there again, without vulns the AV companies are out of business.
hmmm.

anyway, the guys involved in this media circus should have the
book thrown at them as any of us would suffer if we tried the same
demonstration/prank
