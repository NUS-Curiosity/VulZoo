Subject: DeepSec 2009 - Call for Papers is open

=== DeepSec In-Depth Security Conference 2009 - The Third
==== Call for Papers and Experts

The DeepSec organisation is happy to announce the Call for Papers for the
next conference in November 2009. The conference will take place at the
Imperial Riding School Renaissance Hotel in Vienna, Austria.

== Topics ==

The focus of DeepSec will be on subtle dangers, stealthy exploits and
things you don't see. If you got something to talk about that doesn't
look like a security problem at the first glance, tell us about it. We'd
like to hear about underestimated security issues that may be turned
into major headaches for computer systems, networks and users alike.
Send us stories about single bits that can change our destiny. Failing that
we welcome less sneaky approaches, too.

 - AJAX/Web2.0/JavaScript Security
 - Cloud Computing
 - Code Analysis
 - Cryptographical Weaknesses
 - Digital Espionage
 - Digital Forensics
 - eVoting
 - Failure anf Fixes of all kinds
 - Incident Response
 - Malware Research
 - Messaging Technologies
 - Network Protocols
 - Operating Systems
 - Secure Software Development
 - Security Management
 - Social Engineering
 - Virtualisation

Please note, that we are a non-product, non-vendor biased security
conference and do not welcome vendor pitches in the conference talks or
trainings. We will provide an opportunity for vendor self presentation
through sponsorship and vendor booths in the conference lounge, where
coffee and snacks will be served during the breaks.

== Hacker Lounge ==

If you don't wish to present a talk or conduct a workshop, you can still
try to participate. We are looking for hackers who want to show us their
gadgets and methods to break (or fix) networks and security systems. You
got something that has lots of blinkenlights, stealth or ideas that go
well with security topics, we want to hear about it. Submit it on the CfP
web page and get a place in the foyer to show off.

== Submission ==

Proposals for talks and trainings at the second annual DeepSec
In-Depth Security Conference will be accepted until
_July 15th 2009, 23:59 CEST_.

All proposals should be submitted through our web site
https://deepsec.net/cfp/ or by email to: cfp@...psec.net
