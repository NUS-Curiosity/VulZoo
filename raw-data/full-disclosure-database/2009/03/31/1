- - All Your Packets Are Belong to Us - Attacking Backbone Technologies by Enno Rey and Daniel Mende. Enno previewed this presentation at our last webcast, and it is a truly fascinating and sobering look at threats to the carrier space.

- - Stripping SSL To Defeat HTTPS In Practice  by Moxie Marlinspike. This is an expansion and update to the presentation that Moxie gave at Black Hat DC, where it got possibly the most press of any talk at the event.

BLACK HAT USA 2009	
July 25-30 isn’t as far away as it might sound.  We’re returning to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip, and this year we’ve got a lot more space to work with. We’re well into our preparations to bring you a great conference. All your favorite events will be back, as well as some new surprises!
https://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-registration/bh-registration-usa-09.html

USA 2009 CALL FOR PAPERS:
We’re still accepting proposals for Black Hat USA 2009 until May 1, 2009.  If you’ve got something you want the security world to hear, submit it at https://cfp.blackhat.com/ Early selection begin May 1st, with the selection process done June 1.

If you like the idea of helping to set the agenda for Black Hat, it’s also a good time to get registered and begin helping us rate and review our presentations.  Paid delegates have access to information about all submitted presentations. The ratings and reviews we get from you help us to create the Briefings lineup. This year the CFP system gets some usability updates to better navigate the hundreds of submissions the USA conference gets.

Space:
Caesars has added (another!) conference expansion for this year and Black Hat will be taking advantage of it. The expanded space means quite a few things - less traffic congestion in the hallways, for starters.  What we’re really excited about, though, is the fact that we’ll have a meet and greet room for each track. This means that after each presentation you’ll be able to follow the speaker(s) into a designated Q&A session and spend some time in a quieter, more personal setting with the speaker and other audience members. This has worked successfully for Black Hat at the smaller conferences and now we are going to try it on a much larger scale at the USA event.

FACEBOOK – we’re trying out a Facebook fan page. If you’re a Facebook user, we’d love to have you join and use it as a place to communicate and share with us. The link is:

TWITTER – We’ve been twittering since Black Hat USA 2008 covering Black Hat updates, speakers in the news, and security news that is relevant to us.

Choose whatever method works best for you, but get involved with our growing community.
