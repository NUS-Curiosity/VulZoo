w3af [0] uses these types of requests to identify the 404 response of
a web application. Maybe its somebody using w3af to scan your website?
Are you seeing a lot of requests coming from the same IP address after
the "random" request?

w3af [0] doesn't perform requests with invalid referers; at least not
in the original version. Someone could have modified it to behave like
this.

How does the corresponding entry in the access.log file look like? It
should show you some user agent... To find this just:

grep hFBeX7EK access.log
