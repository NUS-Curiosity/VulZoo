nope, at least not always:



Looking up the corresponding request in the access log was a good idea..

Here's one example:
221.204.*.* - - [30/Mar/2009:10:21:30 +0200] "GET
/mtERuE0/osOAJo/3dK/tUekE2Ws.gif HTTP/1.1" 404 293 "-" "Mozilla/4.0
(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"

and another one (with referer)

124.236.*.* - - [31/Mar/2009:17:01:59 +0200] "GET
/XePDcSx/BabcSF/4GabcNO0/ncabc/abcf/Babcf-XS/abc/abcFEl/gSabcUs-z/UlabcbF/gib_.gif
HTTP/1.1" 404 362
"http://www.labcdl.com/B2abcBfV-j/zabcZ/33z/NBxab2H6/Bvgzabc/NEabc/20Xab4/lxJabc4x/HnabcE/BabcZU/ezBf/nnx/xUBabcX/0S4Z-SnzG.html"
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"


Grepping these IPs in access log shows up
www:/var/log/apache2# grep "124.236.*.*" access.log|wc -l
12
www:/var/log/apache2# grep "221.204.*.*" access.log|wc -l
1

All these requests are totally random and ending in with .gif. UA is
always the evil IE6. What sane developer would use such a UA? ;)

Why would someone want to do this? It makes no sense for me.
