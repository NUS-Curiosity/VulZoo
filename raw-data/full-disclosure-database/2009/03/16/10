Subject: w32 SEH omelet shellcode stage

Hey all,

I'm releasing some code for a technique which I call "omelet shellcode" that
may be useful in some exploits. It is similar to egg-hunt shellcode, but
will search user-land address space for multiple smaller eggs and recombine
them into one larger block of shellcode and execute it. This is useful in
situation where you cannot inject a block of sufficient size into a target
process to store your shellcode in one piece, but you can inject multiple
smaller blocks and execute one of them.

More details can be found here:

http://code.google.com/p/w32-seh-omelet-shellcode/
I have not had a chance to test this newer version in a live exploit, so do
let me know if you have a chance to use it.


Cheers,
SkyLined
