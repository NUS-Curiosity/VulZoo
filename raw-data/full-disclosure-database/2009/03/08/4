Subject: Belkin BullDog Plus UPS-Service Buffer Overflow
	Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Who:
Belkin International, Inc.
http://www.belkin.com

What:
Belkin BullDog Plus UPS Management Software
v4.0.2 Build 1219

UPS-Service.exe
v1.0.0.1
dated 12/19/2006

How:
The UPS management software contains a built-in web server which
allows for remote management of the UPS. The management interface
is protected by a username and password. Authentication is
performed via Basic authentication.

There is a small stack-based overflow in the base64 decoding
routine which handled the Basic authentication data.

Caveats:
The web server is not enabled by default.

Exploit:
The size of the buffer is too small for shellcode, however, this
can be stored in the GET request, which sits at esp+0x58.

Fix:
I was unable to locate any security contact information for this
vendor, so I attempted to contact their support department, which
turned out to be waste of time.

Workaround:
As previously stated, the web server is not enabled by default.
If you do need to use it, use a firewall or OS port filtering
capabilities to restrict access.
