The real breakdown here comes from Cloe soliciting the services of someone
who is labeling themselves an expert. This whole "Walmart" style penetration
tester in a box theme being promoted by underclued individuals and marketed
to the industry is devaluing the work many have worked hard to perfect. Many
have given countless hours, codes, write-ups, seminars you name it. There is
nothing wrong with making a euro, dollar, baht, don't mistake this but when
there are mission critical applications and institutions at hand, that buck
should take a backseat for the security of lives - or did you miss the subject
portion of SCADA Security.
