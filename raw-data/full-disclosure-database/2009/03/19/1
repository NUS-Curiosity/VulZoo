While I understand your point, how much of our taxes go to criminals?
Governments the world over buy weapons from terrorist organizations to "Save
their soldiers".  In reality the money is then used to pay for better
munitions.  This action will invariably lead to the same sort of backlash.
As a security professional I can now sleep an extra two minutes knowing that
one less acttack vector may have been removed from my radar.

If all of us continue to not act for fear of having our hand slapped, then
nothing will happen.  Take action when the opportunity presents itself and
shut it down.

As for your comments on AV vendors there is a saying that comes from
Despair.com...

If you are not part of the solution, there is money to be made in prolonging
the problem.

It's refreshing to see someone taking the reigns and finally fighting back.
