 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:060-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nfs-utils
 Date    : March 19, 2009
 Affected: Corporate 4.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in nfs-utils,
 which caused TCP Wrappers to ignore netgroups and allows remote
 attackers to bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2008-4552).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to prevent this.

 Update:

 The Corporate Server 4 packages had the wrong release number (lower
 than before) which prevented the update packages from being installed
 automatically. This problem has now been solved with new packages
 with the correct release number.
