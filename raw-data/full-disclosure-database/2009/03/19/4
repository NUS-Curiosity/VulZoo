I don't watch TV. And I certainly wouldn't pay for a license. Even if it
were commercial free.

In any case, what's that dessicated old tart Lizzie gonna do if you
don't pay? Send the bobbies to throw you in TV jail?

No, as I'm not a federal gov't service.

Six TV channels, and 7 radio stations? That's awful, but then again,
it's not like there's anything worthwhile on the hundreds we get over
here. Touch√©, good sir.
