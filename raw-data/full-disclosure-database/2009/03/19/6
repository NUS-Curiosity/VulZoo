Anyone from Canada/America who laughs at the English for "nanny state" needs
to look at their own country...your just a bad. And, we have hundreds of
channels WITH adverts, but we get the BBC advert free, Radio 1 without
adverts is brill...radio adverts are WORSE then TV adverts. And you don't
HAVE to pay a tv licence if you dont have a TV, so in this case, you
wouldn't need to pay for it anyway as you don't watch it.

If you had come from a more free country, like Sweden or something, I'd let
you laugh...but you come from Canada...eff'ing hell son, look at your own
country. And making a joke about English police...they talk about noise on
these lists but come on...yours (and this one as well) are worse then noise

I don't watch TV. And I certainly wouldn't pay for a license. Even if it
were commercial free.

In any case, what's that dessicated old tart Lizzie gonna do if you
don't pay? Send the bobbies to throw you in TV jail?

No, as I'm not a federal gov't service.

Six TV channels, and 7 radio stations? That's awful, but then again,
it's not like there's anything worthwhile on the hundreds we get over
here. Touché, good sir.
