You're in Canada, right? So your TV stations have 15 minutes per hour
of adverts (up until 1st September this year when that limit is
removed (1)) While us 'suckers' have six national TV channels
(including two children's channels) and seven national radio stations
for 67 of your 'cents' per day with no adverts at all. I know which I
prefer.

By the way, shouldn't you have to provide a copy of your email in
French? It IS the nanny state after all.
