Subject: Inquira: Multiple Vulnerabilities

Bonjour,

During a recent penetration test, we discovered and worked with
Inquira to close numerous web-based issues.  The vendor has not
replied back about a formal release of these issues, so I am posting
this notice here to inform customers to check for an update for their
products.  You can contact Inquira via the link below.

http://www.inquira.com/

Additionally, it is also advised that customers change the default
passwords used by the affected software.  For instance, the default
Apache Tomcat administrator account details are listed below and
should probably be added to publicly listed default password databases
(phenoelit, etc).

Vendor: Inquira
Products: (multiple)
Username: inquira
Password: inquira123

Cheers,
