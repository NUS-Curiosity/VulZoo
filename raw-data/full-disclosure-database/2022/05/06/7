Threat: Conti.Ransom
Vulnerability: Code Execution
Description: Conti looks for and loads a DLL named "wow64log.dll" in
Windows\System32. Therefore, we can drop our own DLL to intercept and
terminate the malware pre-encryption. The exploit dll will simply display a
Win32API message box and call exit(). Our Conti.Ransom exploit DLL must
export "InterlockedExchange" function or it fails with error. We do not
need to rely on hash signature or third-party product, the malware will do
the work for us. Endpoint protection systems and or antivirus can
potentially be killed prior to executing malware, but this method cannot as
theres nothing to kill the DLL just lives on disk waiting. From defensive
perspective you can add the DLLs to a specific network share containing
important data as a layered approach. All basic tests were conducted
successfully in a virtual machine environment.
