Threat: Trojan-Ransom.LockerGoga
Vulnerability: Code Execution
Description: LockerGoga looks for and loads a DLL named "wow64log.dll" in
Windows\System32. Therefore, we can drop our own DLL to intercept and
terminate the malware pre-encryption. Four processes are created E.g.
"imtvknqq9737.exe" running under AppData\Local\Temp, the process name is
"imtvknqq" plus a appended random number. Our exploit dll will simply
display a Win32API message box and call exit(). The exploit DLL must export
"InterlockedExchange" function or it fails with error. We do not need to
rely on hash signature or third-party product, the malwares own flaw will
do the work for us. Endpoint protection systems and or antivirus can
potentially be killed prior to executing malware, but this method cannot as
theres nothing to kill the DLL just lives on disk waiting. From defensive
perspective you can add the DLLs to a specific network share containing
important data as a layered approach. All basic tests were conducted
successfully in a virtual machine environment.
