Threat: Ransom.Conti
Vulnerability: Code Execution
Description: Conti looks for and executes DLLs in its current directory.
Therefore, we can potentially hijack a vuln DLL execute our own code,
control and terminate the malware pre-encryption. The exploit dll will
check if the current directory is "C:\Windows\System32", if not we grab our
process ID and terminate. We do not need to rely on hash signature or
third-party product, the malware will do the work for us. Endpoint
protection systems and or antivirus can potentially be killed prior to
executing malware, but this method cannot as theres nothing to kill the DLL
just lives on disk waiting. From defensive perspective you can add the DLLs
to a specific network share containing important data as a layered
approach. All basic tests were conducted successfully in a virtual machine
environment.

Exploit/PoC:
Exploit/PoC:
1) Compile the following C code as "netapi32.dll"
2) Place the DLL in same directory as the ransomware
3) Optional - Hide it: attrib +s +h "netapi32.dll"
4) Run the malware

#include "windows.h"
#include "stdio.h"
