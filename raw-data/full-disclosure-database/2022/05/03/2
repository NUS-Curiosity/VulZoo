Threat: Ransom.LockBit
Vulnerability: DLL Hijacking
Description: LockBit ransomware looks for and executes DLLs in its current
directory. This can potentially allow us to execute our own code, control
and terminate the malware pre-encryption. The exploit dll will check if the
current directory is "C:\Windows\System32", if not we grab our process ID
and terminate. Endpoint protection systems and or antivirus can potentially
be killed prior to executing malware, but this method cannot as theres
nothing to kill the DLL just lives on disk waiting. All basic tests were
conducted successfully in a virtual machine environment.
Family: LockBit
Type: PE32
MD5: 96de05212b30ec85d4cf03386c1b84af
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0572
Disclosure: 05/02/2022
Video PoC URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i6tv4cpfSc

Exploit/PoC:
1) Compile the following C code as "netapi32.dll"
2) Place the DLL in same directory as Lockbit ransomware
3) Optional - Hide it: attrib +s +h "netapi32.dll"
4) Run Lockbit PE file

#include "windows.h"
#include "stdio.h"
