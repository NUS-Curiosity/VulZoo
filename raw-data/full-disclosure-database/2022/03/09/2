---------

"UFONet is a free software, P2P and cryptographic -disruptive toolkit-
that allows to perform DoS and DDoS attacks; on the Layer 7 (APP/HTTP)
through the exploitation of Open Redirect vectors on third-party
websites to act as a botnet and on the Layer3 (Network) abusing the
protocol."

creating a global client/server network."
