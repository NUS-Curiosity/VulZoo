Threat: Backdoor.Win32.BluanWeb
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
Description: The malware "BlueAngel For WebServer" by "leonshoh" listens on
TCP port 80. The malware provides an HTML web-interface that exposes the
entire system and creates HTML links to delete or run programs.

E.g.

[$Recycle.Bin]
[Boot]
bootmgr   [删除]  [运行]
BOOTNXT   [删除]  [运行]
BOOTSECT.BAK   [删除]  [运行]
[Documents and Settings]
[dump]
pagefile.sys   [删除]  [运行]
[PerfLogs]
[Program Files]
[Program Files (x86)]
[ProgramData]
[Recovery]
swapfile.sys   [删除]  [运行]
[System Volume Information]
[Users]
[Windows]

Translated from Chinese:

bootmgr [delete] [run]
BOOTNXT [delete] [run]
BOOTSECT.BAK [delete] [run]
[Documents and Settings]
[dump]
pagefile.sys [delete] [run]
[PerfLogs]
[Program Files]
[Program Files (x86)]
[ProgramData]
[Recovery]
swapfile.sys [delete] [run]

The HREF is like "run_EXECUTABLE". Third-party attackers who can reach
infected hosts can make HTTP GET request appending any executable name.
