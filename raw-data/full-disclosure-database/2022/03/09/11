Threat: Loki RAT (Relapse)
Vulnerability: Directory Traversal - Arbitrary File Delete
Description:  The LokiRAT WebUI panel for "LokiRAT_Relapse.exe" runs on PHP
and MySQL and is used control infected hosts through a central server.
The admin webpage "admin.php" takes four parameters pass, command, id and
type. Theres a single check to authenticate $_GET['pass'] against a
hardcoded clear-text password in settings.php.

The backend "admin.php" code has an upload feature, it uses PHP "unlink"
function to delete a file before moving the new one. However, the code does
not
use any secure coding practices, sanitize or filter user input for
directory traversal characters "/../".  This can allow authenticated users,
compromised bots or third-party attackers
who can guess the password check, ability to delete any file E.g. ".php",
".htaccess" etc in the root panel outside the "uploads/" dir, causing Loki
web panel to become inoperative.

admin.php snippet:

  case "upload":
$fullfilename = "uploads/" . $_GET['filename'];
if (file_exists($fullfilename)) unlink ($fullfilename);
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $fullfilename);
