         CVE Name       CVE-2021-37706                                        

      Description     The header length on incoming STUN messages that        
                      contain an ERROR-CODE attribute is not properly         
                      checked. This can result in an integer underflow.       
                      Note, this requires ICE or WebRTC support to be in use  
                      with a malicious remote party.                          
    Modules Affected  bundled pjproject
