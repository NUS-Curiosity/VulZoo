Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Chubo.c
Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Family: Chubo
Type: Web Panel
MD5: c16b04a9879896ef453a6deb13528087
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0528
Disclosure: 03/26/2022
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 81 and 8080. There is a HTML
web-panel that exposes the entire system and creates HTML links to run
commands made available by the backdoor. Chubo panel users who visit a
third-party attacker website or click an infected link, can trigger
arbitrary client side JS code execution in the security context of the
current user. This can result in data theft or GEO location disclosure of
the user accessing the Chubo web interface.
