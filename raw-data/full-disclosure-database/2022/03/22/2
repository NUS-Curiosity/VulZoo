Subject: [FD] [KIS-2022-02] ImpressCMS <= 1.4.2 (image-edit.php) Path
 Traversal Vulnerability

-----------------------------------------------------------------
ImpressCMS <= 1.4.2 (image-edit.php) Path Traversal Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://www.impresscms.org


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 1.4.2 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located in the 
/libraries/image-editor/image-edit.php script:

161.        if (@copy ( ICMS_IMANAGER_FOLDER_PATH . '/temp/' . 
$simage_temp, $categ_path . $simage->getVar ( 'image_name' ) )) {
162.            if (@unlink ( ICMS_IMANAGER_FOLDER_PATH . '/temp/' . 
$simage_temp )) {
163.                $msg = _MD_AM_DBUPDATED;

[...]

190.        } else {
191.            if (copy ( ICMS_IMANAGER_FOLDER_PATH . '/temp/' . 
$simage_temp, $categ_path . $imgname )) {
192.                @unlink ( ICMS_IMANAGER_FOLDER_PATH . '/temp/' . 
$simage_temp );
193.            }

User input passed through the "image_temp" parameter is not properly 
sanitized before being used in a call to the unlink() function at lines 
162 and 192. This can be exploited by authenticated attackers to carry 
out Path Traversal attacks and delete arbitrary files in the context of 
the web server process. This vulnerability could be exploited also to 
disclose the content of arbitrary files in case the web server allows 
for directory listing.

[-] Solution:

Upgrade to version 1.4.3 or later.
