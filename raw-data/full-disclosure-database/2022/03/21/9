Threat: BuilderTorCTPHPRAT.b
Vulnerability: Remote Persistent XSS
Family: TorCTPHPRAT
Type: WebUI
MD5: 838f67d7a4b6824ec59892057aab3bb7 (Webremote TorCT Client.exe)
MD5: dc40fa699cfce01802213dbbd0cbe37e (SlaveOnline.php)
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0520
Disclosure: 03/17/2022
Description: The TorCT client malwares web-panel allows unauthenticated
users to write data to the Slaves.txt file. There is no secure coding
practice or filtering of input or sanitization of output. Third-party
attackers who can reach the server can make HTTP Post requests writing
arbitrary JS code into the Slaves.txt file. The XSS payload will execute
client side code in the security context of the currently logged on user
anytime the WebUI is accessed. This can result in data modification, theft
or GEO location disclosure of the user accessing the TorCT WebUI.

"SlaveOnline.php" code snippet:

$fn= $_GET['online'];
$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
$extrainfo = $_GET['info'];
$emptystring = "";

function visitor_country() {
        $ip = $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"];
        if(filter_var(@$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'],
FILTER_VALIDATE_IP))
                $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
        if(filter_var(@$_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'], FILTER_VALIDATE_IP))
                $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];
        $derp = @json_decode(file_get_contents("
http://www.geoplugin.net/json.gp?ip=" . $ip));
               $result1=$derp ->geoplugin_countryCode;
$result2=$derp ->geoplugin_countryName;
$result = "[".$result1."] - ".$result2;
        return $result;
}

$countryname = visitor_country();
if ($extrainfo == "") { $extrainfo = "||||";}
$extrainfo = $extrainfo."|||||";
$file = file_get_contents('./Slaves.txt', False);
$write = $countryname."|".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . "|" .$extrainfo. "+" ;
echo $file;

etc...
