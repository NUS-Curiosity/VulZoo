Threat: Hades RAT - Web Panel
Vulnerability: Remote Persistent XSS
Family: Hades
Type: WebUI
MD5: c4cc1317aea42f7dd4a1b786c5278a24
MD5: d1d082cbb2a394c8974e734e2ad9f226 (index.php)
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0514
Disclosure: 03/13/2022
Description: The Hades Rat web-panel listens on Port 80, it takes three
HTTP Post parameters to write bot commands. Commands are written to three
files: commande1.txt, commande2.txt and commande3.txt. The index.php file
does not follow secure coding practices e.g. no sanitizing of input.
Third-party attackers who can authenticate to the Hades server, can make
HTTP Post requests writing arbitrary JS code into the commande1.txt file.
The XSS payload will execute client side code in the security context of
the currently logged on user anytime the WebUI is accessed. This can result
in data modification, theft or GEO location disclosure of the user
accessing the Hades Rat WebUI.
