Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Bushtrommel.122
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 31745 and 1030. Adversaries
who can reach infected hosts can run commands made available by the
backdoor. The "*RUN" command calls CreateProcess() based on CL input,
errors will result in a pop up dialog on the infected host:
"CreateProcess() in function () GetConsoleOuput() failed!". Correct syntax
is as follows *RUN"calc.exe", successful code execution results in the
response "*EVA*" from the backdoored host.
