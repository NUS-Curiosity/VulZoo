Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Destrukor.20
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 6969. However, after sending a
specific cmd "rozmiar" the backdoor returns "moznasciagac" in Polish "you
can download" and port 21 opens. Third-party attackers who can reach
infected systems can logon using any username/password combination.
Intruders may then upload executables using ftp PASV, STOR commands, this
can result in remote code execution.
Family: Destrukor
