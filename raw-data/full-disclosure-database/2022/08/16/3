Threat: Win32.Ransom.BlueSky
Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution
Description: The BlueSky ransomware looks for and executes arbitrary DLLs
in its current working directory. Therefore, we can hijack a vuln DLL,
execute our own code, control and terminate the malware pre-encryption. The
exploit dll checks if the current directory is "C:\Windows\System32", if
not we grab our own process ID and terminate. All basic tests were
conducted successfully in a virtual machine environment.
Family: BlueSky
Type: PE32
MD5: 961fa85207cdc4ef86a076bbff07a409
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0632
Disclosure: 08/13/2022
PoC Video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osuS8GjdERM

Exploit/PoC:
1) Compile the following C code as "CRYPTSP.dll" 32-bit
2) Place the DLL in same directory as the vuln BlueSky ransomware
3) Run malware

#include "windows.h"
