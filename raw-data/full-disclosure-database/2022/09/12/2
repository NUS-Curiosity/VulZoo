CVE Reference:             None assigned
Author of Advisory:        Moritz Bechler, SySS GmbH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"TIBCO JasperReports(R) Server is a stand-alone and embeddable
reporting server. It provides reporting and analytics that can
be embedded into a web or mobile application as well as operate
as a central information hub for the enterprise by delivering
mission critical information on a real-time or scheduled basis
to the browser, mobile device, or email inbox in a variety of
file formats."

Due to JMX/RMI services performing unsafe deserialization, it is
possible to execute arbitrary code and system commands on the
server system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The JasperReports Server web application spawns a non-standard JMX
diagnostic server exposed under the RMI name "jasperserver". The relevant
configuration is found in WEB-INF/js.diagnostic.properties:
------
#Diagnostic default remote access configuration
diagnostic.usePlatformJMXServer = false
diagnostic.port = 10990
diagnostic.name = jasperserver
diagnostic.rmiHost = localhost
------

It is also found in WEB-INF/applicationContext-diagnostic.xml:
------
<!--Bean which create Connector to JMS Servercan be disabled if not Using separate JMX Server-->
<bean id="jasperJMXServerConnector" class="org.springframework.jmx.support.ConnectorServerFactoryBean" lazy-init="false">
		<property name="server" ref="jasperJMXServer"/>
		<property name="objectName" value="connector:name=rmi"/>
		<property name="serviceUrl" value="service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://${diagnostic.rmiHost}:${diagnostic.port}/${diagnostic.name}"/>
		<property name="environmentMap">
				<map>
						<entry key="jmx.remote.authenticator" value-ref="jMXAuthenticator"/>
				</map>
		</property>
</bean>
------


While the hostname for the RMI bind is specified as localhost, this does,
in fact, not set the bind address and both the registry and the
(random) object port are reachable over the network. Only the returned
reference address is broken, as it points to the local address, but
this can be adjusted for exploitation.

And while various security patches have implemented type restrictions
for the fundamental RMI services (DGC, Registry) and the JMX authentication,
the latter is not applied in this case. It is only active if the following
property is set: "jmx.remote.rmi.server.credential.types".

For a regular JMX server, this is configured by the standard
library's JMX ConnectorBootstrap; however, this is not the case for the custom
JMX server created through Spring's ConnectorServerFactoryBean.

Therefore, the RMIServer.newClient endpoint performs unrestricted,
unsafe deserialization and can be exploited using one of the known,
published gadget chains (e.g. from ysoserial[5]) in one of the libraries
bundled by the server. These allow for execution of arbitrary bytecode and/or
system commands on the server.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

JasperReports Server (CE) was installed according to the documentation[4]
on a Debian 11 system running Tomcat 9.0.43-2~deb11u3 and OpenJDK 11.0.15.

After the successful initial setup, a new RMI service can be observed on TCP
port 10990:

------
PORT      STATE SERVICE  VERSION
10990/tcp open  java-rmi Java RMI
| rmi-dumpregistry:
|   jasperserver
|     javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIServerImpl_Stub
|     @127.0.1.1:39297
|     extends
|       java.rmi.server.RemoteStub
|       extends
|_        java.rmi.server.RemoteObject
------

Using a custom Metasploit module, calls on the exposed RMI object can
be made (calling JMX's RMIServer.newClient(Object creds)). The module
is capable of identifying known exploitable types on the remote classpath
and sending malicious crafted objects. These, when deserialized by the remote
RMI server, spawn a Java Meterpreter instance and open a reverse shell.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

Disable the JMX server as per documentation, as per section 9.12 of [6].
Update to version 8.1.0 which disables the JMX service by default.
Do not enable the Diagnostic JMX Server.
