can be used in interactive mode to create and modify financial and
scientific models.

# Advisory

routines. If a victim opens an untrusted malicious worksheet, code
execution could occur.

There have been no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.

We take your security very seriously, in fact, this is the first known
vulnerability reported in Lotus 1-2-3 R3 since it's release in September
1990.

affected users upgrade immediately.

Lotus 1-2-3 releases for other platforms are affected, but are not
actively maintained. MS-DOS, OS/2, OpenVMS, z/OS and SysV/386 users are
advised to migrate to Linux to continue receiving updates.
