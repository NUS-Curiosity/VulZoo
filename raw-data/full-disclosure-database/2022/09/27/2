Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Bingle.b
Vulnerability: Weak Hardcoded Credentials
Description: The malware is packed using ASPack 2.11, listens on TCP port
22 and requires authentication. However, the password "let me in" is weak
and hardcoded within the PE file. Unpacking the executable, easily reveals
the cleartext password.
Family: Bingle
Type: PE32
MD5: eacaa12336f50f1c395663fba92a4d32
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0643
