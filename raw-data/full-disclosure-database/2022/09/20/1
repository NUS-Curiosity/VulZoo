What is the security boundary being violated here? As a maintainer of 
some of the packages implicated here, I’m unsure what my actionable 
tasks are. The threat model(s) for my packages does not consider crashes 
to be a security violation. On the other side, things like crypto code 
frequently use their own non-GMP implementation of bignum arith for this 
(and other) reason.

Not trying to brush this off. But I’m just trying to gain an 
understanding of what the expected remediation is here.
