Threat: Trojan.Ransom.Ryuk.A
Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution
Description: The ransomware looks for and executes DLLs in its current
directory. Therefore, we can potentially hijack a vuln DLL execute our own
code, control and terminate the malware pre-encryption. Once loaded the
exploit dll will check if the current directory is "C:\Windows\System32",
if not we grab our process ID and terminate. All basic tests were conducted
successfully in a virtual machine environment.
Family: Ryuk
Type: PE32
MD5: 5ac0f050f93f86e69026faea1fbb4450
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0640
Disclosure: 09/19/2022

Exploit/PoC:
1) Compile the following C code as "urlmon.dll"
2) Place the DLL in same directory as the ransomware
3) Optional - Hide it: attrib +s +h "urlmon.dll"
4) Run the malware

#include "windows.h"
