Description: The malware builds and writes a PE file to c drive granting
change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard users can
rename the executable dropped by the malware to disable it or replace it
with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the
infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
