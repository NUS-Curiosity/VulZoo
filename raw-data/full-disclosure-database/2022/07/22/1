Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Eclipse.h
Vulnerability: Weak Hardcoded Credentials
Family: Eclipse
Type: PE32
MD5: 8b470931114527b4dce42034a95ebf46
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0625
Disclosure: 07/21/2022
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 6210 and authentication is
required. However, the backdoor accepts any USER name for authentication
and the password "R-M" is weak and hardcoded within the PE file. Unpacking
the UPX packed executable, easily reveals the cleartext hardcoded password.
