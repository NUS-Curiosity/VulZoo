Threat: Ransom Lockbit 3.0
Vulnerability: Code Execution
Description: The ransomware apparently now requires a password to execute
as noted by "@vxunderground" E.g. "-pass db66023ab2abcb9957fb01ed50cdfa6a".
Lockbit looks for and executes DLLs in its current directory. Therefore, we
can hijack a vuln DLL in this case "RstrtMgr.dll", execute our own code and
terminate the malware pre-encryption. The exploit dll checks if the current
directory is "C:\Windows\System32", if not we grab our process ID and
terminate. All basic tests were conducted successfully in a virtual machine
environment.
Family: Lockbit
Type: PE32
MD5: 38745539b71cf201bb502437f891d799
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0621
Disclosure: 07/04/2022
Video PoC URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAXrRcsnzjY

Exploit/PoC:
1) Compile the following C code as "RstrtMgr.dll"
2) Place the DLL in same directory as Lockbit 3.0
3) Optional - Hide it: attrib +s +h "RstrtMgr.dll"
4) Run Lockbit 3.0 {04830965-76E6-6A9A-8EE1-6AF7499C1D08}.exe -k
