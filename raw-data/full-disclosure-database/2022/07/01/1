Subject: [FD] [Extension: CPSIoTSec 2022] The Workshop on CPS&IoT Security
 and Privacy **Submission Deadline: July 25, 2022**

[Apologies for cross-posting]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
C a l l     F o r     P a p e r s

The Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy (CPSIoTSec 2022), in 
conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications 
Security (ACM CCS)
November 7-11, 2022, Los Angeles, U.S.A.
https://cpsiotsec2022.github.io/cpsiotsec/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CPSIoTSec 2022 invites academia, industry, and governmental entities to 
submit:

Original research papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on the security and privacy of 
CPS&IoT
Demos (hands-on or videos) of testbeds/experiences of CPS&IoT security 
and privacy research

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We seek submissions from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds tackling 
security and privacy issues in CPS&IoT, including but not limited to:

- Mathematical foundations for secure CPS/IoT
- Control-theoretic approaches
- High assurance security architectures
- Security and resilience metrics
- Metrics and risk assessment approaches
- Identity and access management
- Privacy and trust
- Network security
- Game theory applied to CPS/IoT security
- Human factors, humans in the loop, and usable security
- Understanding dependencies among security, reliability and safety in 
CPS/IoT
- Economics of security and privacy
- Intrusion and anomaly detection
- Model-based security systems engineering
- Sensor and actuator attacks
- CPS/IoT malware analysis
- CPS/IoT firmware analysis
- Hardware-assisted CPS/IoT security

Also of interest will be papers that can point the research community to 
new research directions, and those that can set research agendas and 
priorities in CPS/IoT security and privacy. There will be a best paper 
and best presentation award.

New Process for Selecting the Best Paper Award: Following the success of 
the 2021 process and in the interest of increasing transparency, the PC 
will select upto 3 top-rated papers based on reviews and place them in a 
single session. Then the audience will vote on what they think should be 
the best paper after viewing the presentations.

------------------------------

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

Submissions include long papers (12 pages), short papers (6 pages), or 
1-page abstracts:

Long papers include a) Original research on a CPS/IoT security and 
privacy topic, b) Systematization of Knowledge of CPS/IoT security and 
privacy;
Short papers include original work-in-progress research on a CPS/IoT 
security and privacy topic;

1-page abstracts include demos/interesting findings/insights on CPS/IoT 
security and privacy, which will be accompanied by a hands-on demo 
during the workshop.

Submitted papers can be up to 12 or 6 pages excluding appendices and 
references. Submissions must use the ACM SIG Proceedings Templates, with 
a simpler version here: https://github.com/acmccs/format. Only PDF files 
will be accepted. Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press 
and/or the ACM Digital Library. Submissions must not substantially 
overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously 
submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Each accepted 
paper must be presented by a registered author. Submissions not meeting 
these guidelines risk immediate rejection. For questions about these 
policies, please contact the chairs.
