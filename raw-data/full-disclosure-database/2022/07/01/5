Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Cafeini.b
Vulnerability: Weak Hardcoded Credentials
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 51966 and 23. Authentication
is required, however the password "mama" is weak and found within the PE
file. Moreover, the FTP server running on non standard port 23 also uses
same password. Trying to execute a program incorrectly you get reply like,
"STATUS I can't run program", as it requires the full path to the file to
execute.
Family: Cafeini
Type: PE32
