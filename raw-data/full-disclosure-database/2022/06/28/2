Hey all

It's now less than two weeks to submit a talk to SEC-T 2022, at least if 
you want to be part of the first talk selection round (recommended) that 
we kick off July first.

SEC-T is non-profit, non-corporate, two day, single track, con in 
Stockholm, Sweden. We pay travel, accommodation and an honorary to all 
speakers.

If you have something fun you'd like to present, send us a submission 
before July 1st... or at least before August 1st (final speaker 
selection round).

For more information check here: https://www.sec-t.org/call-for-papers/

/Sincerely,

Mattias, a SEC-T Organizer
