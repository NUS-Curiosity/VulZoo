Threat: Backdoor.Win32.InfecDoor.17.c
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware writes a ".420" settings file type to c drive
granting change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the file dropped by the malware to disable, change its
settings or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
