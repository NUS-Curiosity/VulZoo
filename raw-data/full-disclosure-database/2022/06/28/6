Threat: Trojan-Mailfinder.Win32.VB.p
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description:  The malware writes a dir with multiple PE files to c drive
granting change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the executable dropped by the malware to disable it or
replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user to
logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
Family: VB
