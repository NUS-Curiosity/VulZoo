Threat: Yashma Ransomware Builder v1.2
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates PE files with insecure permissions when
writing to c:\ drive, granting change (C) permissions to the authenticated
user group. Standard users can rename the executable dropped by the malware
to disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
