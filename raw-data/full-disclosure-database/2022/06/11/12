Author of Advisory:        Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD is a USB drive with AES
256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in fingerprint sensor for
unlocking the device with previously registered fingerprints.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the
drive in real-time. The drive is compliant with GDPR requirements as
100% of the drive is securely encrypted. The built-in fingerprint
recognition system allows access for up to eight authorised users and
one administrator who can access the device via a password. The SSD
does not store passwords in the computer or system's volatile memory
making it far more secure than software encryption."[1]

Due to insufficient firmware validation, an attacker can store
malicious firmware code for the USB-to-SATA bridge controller on the USB
drive which gets executed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

When analyzing the Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD, Matthias
Deeg found out that the validation of the firmware for the USB-to-SATA
bridge controller INIC-3637EN only consists of a simple CRC-16 check
(XMODEM CRC-16).

Thus, an attacker is able to store malicious firmware code for the
INIC-3637EN with a correct checksum on the used SPI flash memory chip
(XT25F01D), which then gets successfully executed by the USB-to-SATA
bridge controller.

For instance, this security vulnerability could be exploited in a
so-called "supply chain attack" when the device is still on its way to
its legitimate user.

An attacker with temporary physical access during the supply could
program a modified firmware on the Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure
SSD, which always uses an attacker-controlled AES key for the data
encryption, for example.

If, later on, the attacker gains access to the used USB drive, he can
simply decrypt all contained user data.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS was able to read and write the SPI flash memory containing the
firmware of the INIC-3637EN controller (128 KB) using a universal
programmer.

By analyzing the dumped memory content, SySS found out that the
INIC-3637EN firmware is stored from the file offset 0x4000 to the file
offset 0x1BFFB, and that the corresponding XMODEM CRC-16 is stored at
the file offset 0x1FFFC.

Matthias Deeg developed a simple Python tool for updating the checksum
of modified firmware images before writing them to the SPI flash memory
chip.

The following output exemplarily shows updating a modified firmware
image:

$ python update-firmaware.py firmware_hacked.bin
Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD Firmware Updater v0.1 - 
Matthias Deeg, SySS GmbH (c) 2022
[*] Computed CRC-16 (0x7087) does not match stored CRC-16 (0x48EE).
[*] Successfully updated firmware file
