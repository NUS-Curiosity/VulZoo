~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Verbatim Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD is a portable USB drive
with AES 256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in keypad for passcode
entry.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the
drive in real-time with a built-in keypad for password input. The SSD
does not store passwords in the computer or system's volatile memory
making it far more secure than software encryption. Also, if it falls
into the wrong hands, the SSD will lock and require re-formatting after
20 failed password attempts."[1]

The security feature for locking and requiring to reformat the SSD after
20 failed unlock attempts does not work as specified.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

When analyzing the external SSD Verbatim Store 'n' Go Secure Portable
HDD, Matthias Deeg found out that the device will not lock and require
reformatting after 20 failed passcode attempts, as described in the
product description[1] and the corresponding user manual[2].

Thus, an attacker with physical access to such an external SSD can try
more passcodes in order to unlock the device.

During the security analysis, SySS could not find out how many failed
passcode attempts would actually lock the device and require
reformatting it, as this device state was never reached.

Additionally, trying to find out the correct passcode by either manually
or automatically entering them via the provided keypad is rather
insufficient compared to an equally possible offline brute-force attack
described in SySS security advisory SYSS-2022-005[3].

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS tried to unlock the Verbatim Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD with
more than 20 consecutively entered wrong passcodes.

Afterwards, contrary to the product description, the external SSD could
still be successfully unlocked with the correct passcode, and access to
the previously stored data was possible without any issues.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for the described security issue.
