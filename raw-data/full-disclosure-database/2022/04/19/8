Threat: Backdoor.Win32.GateHell.21
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The malware runs an FTP server on TCP ports
5301,5432,5300,5299,5298,5297,5296 and 5295. Third-party adversaries who
successfully logon can abuse the backdoor FTP server as a man-in-the-middle
machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This
vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse your system and discreetly
conduct network port scanning. Victims will then think these scans are
originating from the infected system running the afflicted malware FTP
Server and not you.
