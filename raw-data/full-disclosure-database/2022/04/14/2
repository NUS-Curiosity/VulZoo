         CVE Name       CVE-2022-26499                                        

      Description     When using STIR/SHAKEN, it���s possible to send           
                      arbitrary requests like GET to interfaces such as       
                      localhost using the Identity header.                    
    Modules Affected  res_stir_shaken                                         

    Resolution  If you are using STIR/SHAKEN in Asterisk, upgrade to one of   
                the versions listed below to get a new configuration option:  
                stir_shaken_profile. This can be configured in                
                stir_shaken.conf and set on a per endpoint basis in           
                pjsip.conf. This option will take priority over the           
                stir_shaken option. The stir_shaken_profile will contain the  
                stir_shaken option (attest, verify, or both), as well as ACL  
                configuration options to permit and deny specific IP          
                addresses / hosts. The ACL will be used for the public key    
                URL we receive in the Identity header, which is used to tell  
                Asterisk where to download the public certificate. An ACL     
                from acl.conf can be used, but you can specify your own       
                permit and deny lines within the profile itself. A            
                combination of both can also be used.                         
                                                                              
                Note that this patch contains changes that affect the same    
                area as the patch from AST-2022-001. It is recommended that   
                you upgrade to a listed version, otherwise you might          
                encounter merge conflicts.
