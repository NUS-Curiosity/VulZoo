Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Cafeini.b
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The malware runs an FTP server on TCP port 23. Third-party
adversaries who successfully logon can abuse the backdoor FTP server as a
man-in-the-middle machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using
Nmap. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse your system and
discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims will then think these
scans are originating from the infected system running the afflicted
malware FTP Server and not you.
