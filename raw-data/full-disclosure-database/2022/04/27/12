Threat: Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent

Description: The malware writes a PE file to the "Windows\System" directory
granting change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the executable dropped by the malware to disable it or
replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user to
logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
