Subject: [FD] SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab publication: The enemy from within: Unauthenticated Buffer Overflows in Zyxel routers still haunting usersÂ & metasploit exploit

Hi,

earlier this year in February 2022, we published a technical security advisory - https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-multiple-zyxel-devices/ - on 
different critical vulnerabilities in Zyxel devices, resulting from insecure coding practices and insecure configuration.

Those also included a highly critical unauthenticated buffer overflow vulnerability in the proprietary Zyxel web server which allowed remote root access to the device. The only prerequisite for the 
attacker: network-level access to the web interface, e.g. via Internet or LAN/WiFi.

We have just released a blog post giving an overview about the critical buffer overflow vulnerability on a higher level, a list of the affected devices (it seems there still exist vulnerable devices 
on the Internet). We have also developed a Metasploit module to verify whether the buffer overflow vulnerability can still be exploited on one's own affected device.
