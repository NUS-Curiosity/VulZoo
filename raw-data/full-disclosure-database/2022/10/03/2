Description: The malware listens on TCP port 6767. Authentication is
required, however the password "Please change me" is weak and hardcoded in
cleartext at offset 0045E520. Commands get executed by sending the password
delimited by a semicolon ";" E.g. Please change me;SystemInfo;. The command
SendScreen dumps screenshot as .BMF file, to get the next part of the file
issue SendScreenNextPart.
