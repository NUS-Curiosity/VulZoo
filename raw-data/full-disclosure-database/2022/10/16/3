I am not quite sure what point you’re making. CVE-2021-43618 is a 
different issue; a programming error that results in a segfault. I.e. 
even if an application using libgmp supplied their own allocator,¹ they 
could still experience segfaults when dealing with malicious input.

The case you brought to FD (IIUC) is an input including large numbers 
that causes libgmp to exhaust memory when dealing with them. In this 
case, an application supplying their own allocator should be able to 
detect and survive this scenario. So again, I don’t see what security 
boundary is being violated here.

¹ The libgmp API docs describe how to do this,
   https://gmplib.org/manual/Custom-Allocation. “By default GMP uses
   malloc, realloc and free for memory allocation, and if they fail GMP
   prints a message to the standard error output and terminates the
   program. Alternate functions can be specified, to allocate memory in a
   different way or to have a different error action on running out of
   memory.”
