an exciting technical program, including vetted papers, invited talks,
poster and panel discussions as well as collocated workshops.

Important Dates:
-----------------
This year’s symposium will have two review cycles. All submissions must be
received by 11:59 p.m. any where on earth Time on the day of the
corresponding deadline.

■ Full paper submission: January 31, 2022 (hard)
■ Early reject notification: March 15, 2022
■ Notification to authors: March 30, 2022
■ Camera ready due: August 10, 2022

Spring cycle

■ Camera ready due: August 10, 2022

Abstract submissions:
----------------------
You will need to submit your title and abstract by 11:59 pm, any where on
earth, on the day of the corresponding deadline through the Symposium‘s
EasyChair websites by following instructions on how to make a submission (
https://easychair.org/help/how_to_submit).

Paper submissions:
-------------------
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference
/ workshop with proceedings. The symposium proceedings will be published by
Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS). In
addition, the Journal of Computer Security will publish a special issue
containing selected papers from the ESORICS 2022 proceedings. As in
previous years, ESORICS will present a Best Paper Award chosen by the
Program Committee. This award is generously sponsored by Springer.

How to submit your paper:
-------------------------
Submitted papers must follow the LNCS template from the time they are
submitted. Submitted papers should be at most 16 pages (using 10-point
font), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and at most
20 pages total. Committee members are not required to read the appendices,
so the paper should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be
written in English.
Submissions must be uploaded to the following EasyChair website:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esorics2022

Only pdf files will be accepted. Submissions are not anonymous. Submissions
not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their
merits. Authors of accepted papers must agree with Springer LNCS copyright
and guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference.

Review Process - Revised Submissions:
--------------------------------------
This year’s symposium will have two review cycles. Within 1.5 month of
submission, author notifications of Accept/Revise/Reject decisions will be
sent out. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

■ Accept: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the
proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor
changes with the oversight of a shepherd.
■ Revise: A limited number of papers will be invited to submit a revision;
such papers are considered to be promising but need additional work (e.g.,
new experiments, proofs, or implementations). Authors will receive a
specific set of expectations to be met by their revisions. Authors can
resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions, to the spring submission
deadline. In revised submissions, the authors should clearly explain in a
well-marked appendix how the revisions address the comments of the
reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted
or rejected.
■ Reject: Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the
conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be
submitted again (even in revised form) to the second review cycle. A paper
will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the
paper is from the same or similar authors, and there is more than 40%
overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be
considered a resubmission.

Conflict of Interest (CoI):
----------------------------
The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and PC members
to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a
conflict of interest. In the one hand, during the bidding procedure, PC
members will be required to indicate potential CoIs. On the other hand,
authors will be asked during the submission process to indicate any PC
members with whom they share CoIs as well as the types of CoIs. That is, if
they and one the authors 1) share an institutional affiliation at the time
of submission; 2) had at any time in the past a supervisor/PhD student
relationship; 3) have collaborated or published with in the prior two
years; 4) are in some form of financial relationship, or have been at some
point during the past two years; or 5) are related, or have close personal
friendships. For other forms of conflict, authors must contact the chairs
and explain the perceived conflict.

Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper,
including program co-chairs, will be excluded from discussing and reviewing
the submission. Authors also need to notify the PC Chairs of any other
reason or circumstance that creates a risk that professional judgement may
be unduly influenced.

The chairs reserve the right to request further explanation and can remove
non-mandatory conflicts at their discretion.
