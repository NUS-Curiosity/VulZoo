Threat: Email-Worm.Win32.Lama
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware writes a ".BAT" file with insecure permissions
under c drive granting change (C) permissions to the authenticated user
group. Standard users can rename the executable dropped by the malware to
disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
