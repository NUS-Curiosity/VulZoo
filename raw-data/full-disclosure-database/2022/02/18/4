Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official MartFury online service web-application.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The vulnerability is located in the products description and name parameters of the create function in the products module (martfury dashboard).
Remote attackers with privileged account access (user to vendor by product) are able to inject own malicious products. After a product is saved
any customer that buys the article executes the malicious inject payload on events like favorite & compare. On the request a confirm information
is displayed on the left top of the application that executes the script code with persistent attack vector. The request method to inject is post
and the attack vector is persistent located on the application-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious
source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
