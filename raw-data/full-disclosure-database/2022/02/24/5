Threat: Backdoor.Win32.FTP.Ics
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan (MITM)
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 5554 and accepts any
credentials. Third-party intruders who successfully logon can abuse the
backdoor FTP server as a man-in-the-middle machine allowing PORT Command
bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This vulnerability allows remote attackers
to abuse your system and discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims
will then think these scans are originating from the infected system
running the afflicted malware FTP Server and not you.
