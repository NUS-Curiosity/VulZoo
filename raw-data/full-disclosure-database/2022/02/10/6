Subject: [FD] Facebook DNS misconfiguration

Hi everyone,
I submittet to Facebook a DNS misconfiguration issue. Specifically, the 
following URLs will be resoved as private IP addresses.

dev.facebook.com : A [10.110.151.5]
hr.facebook.com : A [10.110.199.9]
prof.facebook.com : A [10.18.4.109]
tps.facebook.com : A [10.110.159.18]
interim.facebook.com : A [10.110.151.5]
nexus.facebook.com : A [192.168.62.201]
alf.facebook.com : A [192.168.16.27]

It's something similar to Same Site Scripting, except the resolved URL 
is not 127.0.0.1 but a private IP address.
You could use them in case of red team activies, for example.
Imagine this scenario:

#1 - there's a public, unprotected wi-fi network
#2 - you are connected to this wi-fi network and your IP is 
192.168.16.11
#3 - you could change you IP from 192.168.16.11 to 192.168.16.27
#4 - you could start a web server with a fake Facebook login page or 
with some malicious file
#5 - you could invite someone, within the same network, to visit 
"http://alf.facebook.com" or to download an update from 
"http://alf.facebook.com/update.exe"

Of course, another scenario would be the one in which you create a 
rogue, free wi-fi access point configured to assing 192.168.16.1/24 IPs

Do you consider this a MITM attack? I'm not 100% sure but Facebook 
stated it is.
See you!

Cheers,
Carlo Di Dato (aka shinnai)
