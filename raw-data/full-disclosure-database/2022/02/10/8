Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Frauder.jt
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware writes an extensionless PE file named "x" with
insecure permissions under c:\ drive granting change (C) permissions to the
authenticated user group. Standard users can rename the executable dropped
by the malware to disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then
wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially
escalate privileges.
