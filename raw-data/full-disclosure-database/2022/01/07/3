Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent post inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Easy Cart Shopping Cart PHP Script.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script code in post method requests to compromise user
session data or to manipulate application contents for clients.

The cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the `keyword_search` parameter of the `index search` module.
Remote attackers without privileged access are able to inject own malicious script code in the search input field of
the index module post method request. The execution takes place in the results page of the search after submit via post.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent
external redirects to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Search (index)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] keyword_search


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side post inject web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without account and with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
