We hope this email finds you well.

CarolinaCon Online 2 will be hosted April 29th to May 1st 2022. The conference will be virtual and submitted talks will be live streamed.
Last year we used discord for conference communication and for this year we will do the same but will provide a bridged matrix server alternative for those interested.

If you are interested in submitting a presentation, you can do so here, https://cfp.carolinacon.org/carolinacon/cfp
