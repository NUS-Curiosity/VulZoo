Subject: [FD] foxit reader Arbitrary File Write

Last year I did some research on JavaScript API used in PDF reader. I found
that if you provide a path to submitForm then this path will be created by
Foxit PDF reader when opening the PDF, this is an *Arbitrary File Write*.

Unfortunately I did not find a way to control the content of the
file.....If you can control the content of the file then you can get *100%
stable RCE*!

This issue was fixed in Foxit PhantomPDF 10.1.5(
https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html).

Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to
Arbitrary File Write vulnerability when executing the *submitForm* function.
Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary files in the
local system and inject the uncontrolled contents.
