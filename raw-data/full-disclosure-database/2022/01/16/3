Threat: Win32.MarsStealer Web Panel
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Persistent XSS
Description: The Mars-Stealer web interface has a "Marker Rules" component
area. Third-party attackers who can reach the Mars-Stealer server can send
HTTP POST requests injecting arbitrary JS code into the "mars" MySql
database in the markerrule table. This results in a persistent cross site
scripting condition, executing client side code in the security context of
the currently logged on user anytime the WebUI is accessed. This can result
in PHPSESSID token and data theft or GEO location disclosure of the user
accessing the Mars-Stealer WebUI.

PHP code snippet "markeractions.php"

require_once '../../db.php';

switch (trim($_POST['func'])) {
case "markeradd":
markeradd();
break;
case "markerdelete":
markerdelete();
break;
case "markeractive":
markeractive();
break;
}

Type: WebUI
