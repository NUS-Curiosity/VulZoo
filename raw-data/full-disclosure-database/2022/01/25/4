Threat: AgentTesla Builder Web Panel
Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Description: AgentTeslaBuilder WebUI uses "ionCube" to encode and protect
its PHP code. AgentTesla panel users who visit a third-party attacker
website or click an infected link, can trigger arbitrary client side JS
code execution in the security context of the currently logged on user.
This can result in PHPSESSID token, data theft or GEO location disclosure
of the user accessing the AgentTesla panel.
Type: WebUI
MD5: db9629508fda139f71f625d764c7eff7  (Agent Tesla.exe)
