Threat: CosaNostra Builder WebPanel
Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Description: The Panel does not provide a CSRF security token to verify and
process only authorized HTTP POST requests for "tasks.php". This can allow
unauthorized deletion of tasks from the MySQL database if a panel user
clicks an infected link or visits a malicious webpage, the bot HWID however
would need to be known up front or guessed.

$id = @$_GET['id'];
    if(isset($id)){
mysqli_query($condb,"DELETE FROM `tasks` WHERE `HWID`='$id'");


Type: WebUI
