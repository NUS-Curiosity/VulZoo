Threat: AgentTesla Builder Web Panel
Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Description: The AgentTeslaBuilder WebUI uses ionCube to encode and protect
its PHP code. However, the parameter 'table' is vulnerable to post-auth SQL
Injection. Authenticated users can easily dump all databases, tables and
contents including the MySQL database schema. Manually testing the panel I
identified an SQL error probing the following URL /AgentTeslaBuilder/server_
side/scripts/server_processing.php?table=%27HELL%20OR%201=1 which gave me
"An SQL error occurred: SQLSTATE[42S02] Base table or view not found 1146
Table 'agenttesla.'hell or 1=1' doesn't exist" Then switched to use Sqlmap
to do the heavy lifting.

Database: agenttesla
Table: passwords
[1 entry]
