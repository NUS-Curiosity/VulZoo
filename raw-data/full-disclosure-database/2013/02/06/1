--[ Introduction:

It's 2013 and we're alive! Awesome! Let's have a look at what
hacking future we have.

>>From the tectonic shift of forces from the West to the East, the
rise of military-powered attack software, and the evermore
sophisticated games of spooks, yesteryear's "cloak-and-dagger"
has come to the hacking world. This is a game of mapping
individuals and their influences at hacking conferences,
cancelling Visas of potential future-enemies in a the
foreshadowed "cyber-war", buying AND selling 0-days to identify
hidden networks of the underground, raising their filternet,
establishing red-button routers, identifying challenge winners
and profiling their hacking methodologies, and owning botnets for
sheer firepower.

We are in deep shit.

But hey, wait, that's FUN! No matter the forces that threaten our
liberties and trace our modems, we still have not and will not
loose our passion to tinker, to explore, to peal back the layers
of technological reality. We have not lost the Will to Hack.

For the rest of us, we're still all alike when we read media and
government propaganda: hackers intruding everything and waging
cyberwar, panic-spreading, FUD-driven definition of us as bad
guys, mafia, and evil-doers. All alike.

Our world is the world of hack, of the beauty of the baud and the
sheer madness of the screaming electron, (respect to Phrack and
The Mentor), and we won't change it for anything. Because it is
the most immense and yet most fragile human creation; it is our
world and we own it.

If a khaki-pants warmonger or a 3-piece suit master-of-the-world
wannabee wants to confiscate it from us, restrict our freedom,
ban our activities, turn the public opinion to follow their
agenda, well, they may try, they may block some of us, they may
even put some of us out of the circuit, but they can't replicate
our passion, our energy, our love of what we do, our insane
attention to the detail and effectiveness of our techniques.

Because in end, we're all alike. And we're damn ALIVE!

Now for the enlightened, our shared future is full of
opportunities, the humbling discoveries of others, and open
projects that inspire us to join and create together. Our futures
is limited only by our capability to collaborate in great
projects, and also to leave space for the others. TOR is kicking
and OONI roaring; TRAILS offers OS privacy and security for those
who needs it; many conferences are being born everywhere; Frida IRE
is an amazing reversing tool; Qubes provides long sought-out
tough security; plenty of new tools are being released to reveal
unique weaknesses and failures. This furious creativity and
ecosystem gives birth to world-changing start-ups, vital
resources, must-have open source projects, and of course, one of
the most open and creative cultures. All this, against all odds,
exists and develops without bias nor prejudice. Just like it is.


So for Hackito Ergo Sum 2013, we want to see you exactly in the
same way: just like you are (ALERT: if you think about food here
you need to smash your TV and DNS bind youtube.com to github.com), new
or old school, skiddie or security professional,
n00b or l33t, to share and show diversity, and, most of all, to
LEARN. It is therefore our utmost pleasure to welcome you to this
4th edition of HES!


Since 2010, the goal of Hackito Ergo Sum has been to promote
security research, broaden public awareness, and create an open
forum so that communication between researchers, the security
industry, experts, and the public can happen.

Like every year, we offer the possibility to hackers, security
researchers, students, and academics to present their projects
and research.

During the three days of HES, research conferences, solutions
presentations, panels, debates, AND PARTIES will aim to share,
mix, and determine the future of IT security & hacking.


--[ Content of the Research Track:

We are expecting submissions in English only.
The format will be 45 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A.

Please note that talks whose content will be judged too
commercial or biased toward a given vendor will be rejected.

We will have slots for AnonConf -- that is, speaking about topics
for which improved anonymity and freedom of speech is imperative.
(Write Anon in email, use PGP).

We will also consider new and first time presenters, so that
anyone can get his/her foot in the door. Don't be shy, just say
"It's one of my first conf submission", and we'll be kind.

For the research track, preference will be given to offensive,
innovative, and highly technical proposals.

As a suggestion, we would love to see things about:

* SIPRnet, NIPRnet & other defense networks funny stories
* LTE radio and signaling abuses and/or real life hacks
* 4G, Diameter & GRX/IPX hacks
* Exploit style stylography
* CTF Antiforensics: Detection of Intelligence gathering CTFs
* Government filternets (formerly known as Internet, R.I.P)
* x86/64 & Non-x86 exploitation
* New methods to detect software bugs (source or binary based)
* Funky Kernel land exploits
* Offensive forensics
* Current kernel buffer overflows exploit techniques for your
grandmother
* SAT solving your ROP gadgeting and chaining
* Real life hack automation (yeah, default passwords and reuse DO
work better than overflows in a kernel 3.x world)
* IOS vuln research & vulndev
* Identifying tainted 0-day sploits for government-sponsored grey
market tracing
* Mobile Botnets and Overlay networks-based C&C
* IPv6 & "Carrier Grade NATs" advances
* M2M Machine Type Communication
* Sound hacking: binaural, brown, ...
* UEFI malware writing
* Android, RIM, Bada, IOS Mobile applications & OS hacks
* TPM and Secure Boot kitting & knifing
* FPGA backdoors
* Automated Hardware reverse engineering
* Hardware security & lockpicking in 2013

We will also have a Zero Day Show, as last year, at the end of
the conference so that people can share (love/kindness) or show
(salivate/envy) their new babies to the world. Prepare! Zombie
Exploitocalyps incoming :)

We highly encourage any other presentation topic, especially the
one we may not even imagine.

If you want to share skills on a specific subject during a
workshop, feel free to contact us.

--[ Sponsors:

We are looking for sponsors. Don't forget that sponsors are

HES2013 Sponsor Kit at
    hes2013-orga@...ts.hackitoergosum.org.

--[ Journalists:

Journalists are welcome, but are required to comply with simple

"We shall respect privacy and people" is the only motto.
Register here: http://2013.hackitoergosum.org/press/


--[ Challenges

Of course, there will be an online challenge during the
conference, hosted and animated by Over The Wire. We will
announce the country of honor for that regard shortly.

We will also have a new Hacker & Vendors challenge:

                  -^-^-^- The Fuzzor -^-^-^-

This challenge will enable the ultimate test between offensive
and defensive people. If you think you can hack anything, you're
offensive. If you think your product is so secure it won't suffer
a hack, you're defensive. And we'll get the two groups to meet on
a neutral ground, in a never-done before fashion.

Hackers: Register to the conference and prepare your Hacking
tools.
Vendors: Prepare your software to be tested like never before.

We will give more details before the conference. This new
challenge will rock your underwear!


--[ Security Vacation Club - Hackito Tour

After Hackito Ergo Sum, we will need to rest from the intensity
of the conference.

That's why we're organizing a Hackito tour!

Beach, clubs, code, meeting great people and party. We will go
from Paris to Ibiza to Berlin and back to Paris. For the lucky
few, one sponsored Villa will host us in Ibiza. See you there.


--[ Anti-sexism and LGBTA Friendly:

This conference is open to any sex, any color, any genre, any
alienness, whatever it may be.


--[ Greetz:

We would like to thank the HES2013 Team, its reviewing committee
and all the volunteers for their time and dedication in making
this event a success.

We would also like to greet all the speakers of last year's
edition for the quality of their presentation and the great time
we shared in Paris: you are all most welcome back in Paris for
the 2013 edition.

Likewise, we'd like to thank last year's sponsors for their
unconditional support. Feel free to support us again for this
2013 edition.

Finally, we would like to thank all the people who participated
to last years edition: whatever different views of the world,
communication and exchange is probably what makes people human,
and that's why we make Hackito happen. See you all in May! Peace,
Love, Passion.
