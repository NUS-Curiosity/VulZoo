Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2013-0231 CVE-2013-0871

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-0231

    Jan Beulich provided a fix for an issue in the Xen PCI backend drivers.
    Users of guests on a system using passed-through PCI devices can create
    a denial of service of the host system due to the use of non-ratelimited
    kernel log messages.

CVE-2013-0871

    Suleiman Souhlal and Salman Qazi of Google, with help from Aaron Durbin
    and Michael Davidson of Google, discovered an issue in the
    ptrace subsystem. Due to a race condition with PTRACE_SETREGS, local users
    can cause kernel stack corruption and execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-48squeeze1.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze1

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
