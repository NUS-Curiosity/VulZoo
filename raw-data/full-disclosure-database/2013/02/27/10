  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-024
  * Project: Creative Theme [1] (third-party theme)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-February-27
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Creative Theme is a light weight Drupal 7 theme with a modern look and feel.

The theme doesn't properly sanitize user-entered content in the social icon
leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would have to
have the 'administer themes' permission.

    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Creative Theme 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Creative Theme
[4], there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Creative Theme for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Creative Theme
    7.x-1.2 [5]

Also see the Creative Theme [6] project page.
