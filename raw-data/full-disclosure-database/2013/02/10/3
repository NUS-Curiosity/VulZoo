That would require that you have sufficient access to create pseudo-eth
devices in the first place.  A vector of attack which requires previous
privilege escalation or which is carried out by an individual in a
position of trust is wholly uninteresting.   The former requiring too
much effort and the latter requiring a reexamination of your
interpersonal relationships.
