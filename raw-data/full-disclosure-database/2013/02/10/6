I'm not sure I agree with this statement. When Sony pissed off folks
over the Playstation, countless hours were spent on the breaks and
breach. Confer:
http://thehackernews.com/2012/10/sony-playstation-3-hacked-with-custom.html
and http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/ingame/hackers-stole-personal-data-playstation-network-123618.

It does not hurt that Sony chronically drives drunk on the information
superhighway. Confer:
http://attrition.org/security/rants/sony_aka_sownage.html.

Don't under estimate an attackers will or resolve.
