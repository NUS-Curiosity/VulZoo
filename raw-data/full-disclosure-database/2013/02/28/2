Subject: user data collection

Hi all,

I have a simple question to this list:
Do we have somewhere specified in detail who (Facebook, Apple, etc.)
collects what exact (data) on users ?
I do NOT mean 'in general terms' or whatever blurb these companies put on/in
their web pages, privacy policies, terms and conditions; but the factual
fields they collect (per company/field).
 
Thanks,
Tony
