There's probably not an up to date accurate list, for several reasons:

1) It's a moving target - companies change what they collect.
2) Especially for large companies like Facebook or Google, the data
collected by different business units may be different - that's part of
why Google's privacy policy was so hairy for a while.
3) Some information may be gathered indirectly - for instance, geolocation
information, your ISP/employer (as intuited from IP->ASN translations),
and data collected by third parties (run NoScript sometime, and look at
how many sites load Javascript from tons of other sites).
4) Similar to 3 - third-party cookies and other tracking.  Get the Collusion
plugin for Firefox, and be prepared to be amazed.
5) Keep in mind that many of these companies (and basically 100% of those
who provide any "free" service) consider the data to be valuable business
assets that they intend to monetize and not share - when your business model
depends on being able to correlate the type of music you download with
how often you visit Wikipedia, you're going to try *really* hard to avoid
letting anybody find out that you're tracking music downloads and Wiki hits.
