Subject: Advisory Notification

Advisory ID: EWS00001
Product: SecureCRT
Vendor: www.vandyke.com
Vulnerable Version(s): 7.0.3 and probably prior
Tested Version: 7.0.3
Vendor Notification: February 23, 2013
Vendor Patch: No patch
Public Disclosure: February 28, 2013
Vulnerability Type: Insecure password stored
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Workaround by Vendor
Discovered and Provided: Intersistemi Spa EWS Early Warning Services (
http://www.intersistemi.it/ )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Successful exploitation allows to malicious people show encrypted password
stored in config file
session .ini .

Advisory Details

To exploit the vulnerability:

1) Edit the .ini file for example change the username and put in a bad
username

For example

S:"Server To Client MACs"=MD5,SHA1,SHA1-96,MD5-96
S:"Username"=root  (change to roots)
D:"Disable Resize"=00000002
D:"Audio Bell"=00000001

2) Save and try to connect the server. At this time the client try to
establish a ssh connection, when the
authentication fail the client show us a popup precompiled form whit
username (false) and password obscured by asterisk


3) Now we use a simple software such as Asterisk Key for reveals Hidden
Passwords



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

In the interim, there are ways to work around the problem
and mitigate the issue:

   1) Do not save passwords. The ability to save passwords is
      a feature that many of our customers find convenient,
      even though it is not a best practice.

   2) Disable saving passwords within SecureCRT.  For
      administrators who want to ensure a high level of
      security, we strongly recommend disabling the save
      password functionality entirely.  SecureCRT provides a
      GPO Administrative template to enable administrators to
      control whether saving passwords is allowed. Information
      about this administrative template can be found in the
      SecureCRT help under the "Administrative Template"
      topic. Individuals who desire more information regarding
      this administrative restriction should contact our
      technical support team: support@...dyke.com.
