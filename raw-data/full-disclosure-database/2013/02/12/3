That's assuming that they didn't do the risk analysis and decide that
the effort required to fix the problem (which will probably require,
among other things, having every single user change their password)
is worth the effort.  Given that so many places have gotten hacked and
pwned that the user community response is usually "Meh. Another one",
they may rightfully have concluded that risking public shaming is
in fact a good business decision...
