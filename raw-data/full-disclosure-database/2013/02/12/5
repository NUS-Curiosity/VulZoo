Package        : rails
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0276 CVE-2013-0277

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Ruby on Rails, a Ruby framework
for web application development.

CVE-2013-0276
	The blacklist provided by the attr_protected method could be
	bypassed with crafted requests, having an application-specific
	impact.

CVE-2013-0277
	In some applications, the +serialize+ helper in ActiveRecord
	could be tricked into deserializing arbitrary YAML data,
	possibly leading to remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze7.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
