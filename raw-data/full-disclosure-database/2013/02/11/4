Subject: #warning -- DICE.COM insecure passwords

job / recruiter website dice.com use ancient crypt() hash function.
passwords limited to seven characters. cracking user passwords quite
simple. be very afraid of future hash / cracked password dump. maybe
dice.com should improve their security to avoid public shaming?
