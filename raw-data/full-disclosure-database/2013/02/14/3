Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0166 CVE-2013-0169
Debian Bug     : 699889

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2013-0166

    OpenSSL does not properly perform signature verification for OCSP
    responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service via an invalid key.

CVE-2013-0169

    A timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding
    allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical
    analysis of crafted packages, known as the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze14.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
