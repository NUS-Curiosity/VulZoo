Subject: Re: Apple iOS v6.1 (10B143) - Code Lock Bypass
 Vulnerability #2

If you as you say 'discovered' the exploit, how come you weren't the first
ones to publish it? And why did someone else publish it on the day you
claim you discovered it?

> Introduction:
> =============
> iOS (previously iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system developed and
> distributed by Apple Inc. Originally released in 2007 for
> the iPhone and iPod Touch, it has been extended to support other Apple
> devices such as the iPad and Apple TV. Unlike Microsoft`s
> Windows Phone (Windows CE) and Google`s Android, Apple does not license
> iOS for installation on non-Apple hardware. As of
> September 12, 2012, Apple`s App Store contained more than 700,000 iOS
> applications, which have collectively been downloaded more
> than 30 billion times. It had a 14.9% share of the smartphone mobile
> operating system units shipped in the third quarter of 2012,
> behind only Google`s Android. In June 2012, it accounted for 65% of mobile
> web data consumption (including use on both the iPod
> Touch and the iPad). At the half of 2012, there were 410 million devices
> activated. According to the special media event held by
> Apple on September 12, 2012, 400 million devices have been sold through
> June 2012.
>
> The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation,
> using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements
> consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS
> includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch,
> all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS
> operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal
> accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the
> device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating
> it in three dimensions (one common result is switching from portrait to
> landscape mode).
>
> iOS is derived from OS X, with which it shares the Darwin foundation. iOS
> is Apple`s mobile version of the OS X operating system
> used on Apple computers.
>
> In iOS, there are four abstraction layers: the Core OS layer, the Core
> Services layer, the Media layer, and the Cocoa Touch layer.
> The current version of the operating system (iOS 6.1) dedicates 1-1.5 GB
> of the device`s flash memory for the system partition,
> using roughly 800 MB of that partition (varying by model) for iOS itself.
>
> Usage: iOS currently runs on iPhone, Apple TV, iPod Touch, and iPad.

> Details:
> ========
> A code lock bypass vulnerability via iOS as glitch is detected in the
> official Apple iOS v6.1 (10B143) for iPad & iPhone.
> The vulnerability allows an attacker with physical access to bypass via a
> glitch in the iOS kernel the main device code lock (auth).
>
> The vulnerability is located in the main login module of the mobile iOS
> device (iphone or ipad) when processing to use the screenshot function
> in combination with the emegerncy call and power (standby) button. The
> vulnerability allows the local attacker to bypass the code lock
> in iTunes and via USB when a black screen bug occurs.
>
> The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with physical device
> access without privileged iOS account or required user interaction.
> Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized
> device access and information disclosure.

> 0.  Connect your device with itunes and the appstore to make sure the code
> lock is activated
> 1.  Push the power button (top|right)
> 2.  The mobile will be activated and the iOS code lock will be visible
> 3.  Now, you click on the emergency call
> 4.  Try to dail any random emergency call number from a public listing (we
> used 911, 110 and 112)
> 5.  Call the number and cancel the call directly after the dail without a
> direct connection to the number
> 6.  Push again the power button and push after it the iphone button
> (square) in the middle
> 7.  In the next step you push the power button 3 secounds and in the third
> secound you push also with one finger the square and with another the
> emergency call button
> 8.  After pushing all 3 buttons you turn your finger of the square
> (middle) button and after it of the power button
> 9.  The display of the iOS will be black (blackscreen)
> 10.  Take our your usb plug and connect it with the iOS device in black
> screen mode
> 11. All files like photos, contacts and co. will be available directly
> from the device harddrive without the pin to access. Successful reproduced!
