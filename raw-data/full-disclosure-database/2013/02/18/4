Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : several issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3555 CVE-2012-4929
Debian Bug     : 700399

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the TLS/SSL protocol. This
update addresses these protocol vulnerabilities in lighttpd.

CVE-2009-3555

  Marsh Ray, Steve Dispensa, and Martin Rex discovered that the TLS
  and SSLv3 protocols do not properly associate renegotiation
  handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions. This issue is solved
  in lighttpd by disabling client initiated renegotiation by default.
  
  Those users that do actually need such renegotiations, can reenable
  them via the new 'ssl.disable-client-renegotiation' parameter.

CVE-2012-4929

  Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered a weakness in the TLS/SSL
  protocol when using compression. This side channel attack, dubbed
  'CRIME', allows eavesdroppers to gather information to recover the
  original plaintext in the protocol. This update disables compression.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid)
these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.30-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
