Subject: ifIndex overflow (Linux Kernel - net/core/dev.c)
	[maybe offtopic]

Hi,

I was looking into the net/core/dev.c from the current Kernel (previous also have this) and found out that ifIndex gets incremented by an endless loop.

After creating 4 billion pseudo-eth devices I finally got it to overflow and endless loop, had to kill the kernel - fun right?



General question, is this known?
