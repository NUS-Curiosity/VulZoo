Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-015 - Manager
	Change for Organic	Groups - Cross site scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1916312

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-015
  * Project: Manager Change for Organic Groups [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-February-13
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module extends Organic Groups to allow the manager of a group to select
a new manager for their group (ie if they want to leave the group).

The autocomplete field for selecting a new manager didn't properly filter
usernames.

The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that Drupal's default registration
validation prevents the creation of username that contain cross site
scripting attacks. However, a contributed module may bypass that validation
or alter the way usernames are loaded in a way that introduces an attack
vector.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Manager Change for Organic Groups 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the 2.x branch of the Manager Change for Organic Groups module
    for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Manager Change for Organic Groups 7.x-2.1 [4]

Also see the
Manager Change for Organic Groups project page.
