== Description ==

A Use-after-free memory corruption vulnerability was identified in
Microsoft Internet Explorer 8. This allows a malicious user to remotely
execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable userâ€™s machine, in the context of
the current user. The memory corruption happens when the application of
a style sheet performs style computations on the DOM. A CParaElement
node is released but a reference is still kept in CDoc. This memory is
reused when a CDoc relayout is performed.


== Solution ==

Microsoft validated this security issue in Internet Explorer 8 and
issued a patch (MS13-009) to remedy it. Security-Assessment.com
recommends applying the patch which has been made available via Windows
Update.
