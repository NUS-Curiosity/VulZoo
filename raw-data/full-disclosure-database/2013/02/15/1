Subject: Re: CFP: InfoSec Southwest 2013

Due to popular request, we've extended the CFW for InfoSec Southwest
through **March 1, 2013**. That's right, your procrastination has paid
off, so make the most of these extra two weeks.

For submission guidelines, please see:

http://2013.infosecsouthwest.com/cfp.html

ISSW 2013 will be held in beautiful and likely balmy Austin, Texas,
USA, April 19-21.

Please mail your material to cfp@...osecsouthwest.com .
