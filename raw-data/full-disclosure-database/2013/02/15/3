Subject: SilentCircle (Encrypted VoIP auditing) - Please
	cooperate

Hi,

this is the output of a quick analysis done on SilentCircle source
code published on https://github.com/SilentCircle/silent-phone-base .

It seems that someone "friendly with SC" is continuously vandalizing
the PAD where this activity was done at
https://pad.riseup.net/p/silentcircle .

Some hackers there should really complete the audit and prepare some
better organized analysis.
* A Latvian company wrote most of the software, not SilentCircleThe 
application of SilentCircle seems to be a rebranded and customized 
edition of TiviPhone, available from www.tivi.com made in
Latvia.silent-phone-base$ grep -ir tiviphone.com . | wc -l     180    
     From TiVi's page: http://www.tivi.com/en/company/news.php      
"Until September 30, 2010, buy TiviPhone with ZRTP voice and video  
encryption. The difference? You enter theprice; we approve it. Pay by 
 PayPal, get the license key, run it and tell your friends how much
more   competitive TiviPhone is! If you resell (or rebrand) TiviPhone,
even   better: bid for bigger batches of licenses in one go!" but I
can't find   anything about licensing as FOSS. And it also looks to
have a prior   relationship with Zfone per
http://www.tivi.com/en/company/news.php?Secured-mobile-VoIP-calls.    

Copyright tells the story.Copyright © 2004-2012 Tivi
LTD,www.tiviphone.com. All rights reserved.Copyright   © 2012-2013,
Silent Circle, LLC.  All rights reserved. So the   rebranding needed
to be more complete - and the prior TiVi partnership   with Zfone and
Zimmermann resulted in this emergence. Much ado about   nothing. as
usual.. jsut cut and past ",much ado about nothing"
_Indeed it appears the TiViPhone people work ~for~ Silent Circle. Just
like the bit about ZRTPCPP and Wener Dittmann below. Wait__ —_   so
Silent Circle has been developing TiviPhone since 2010 through  those 
people? With the intention of releasing it as Silent Phone years 
later?  I can't be that specific but look at
https://silentcircle.com/web/founders-leadership/ and the various
names associated with these libraries and projects appear all through
that list. Except PolarSSL.I   don't know, but Occam's Razor would
probably say that they just made a   deal with this company and either
bought them or partnered with them.   That's pretty common for
startups. I noticed they have a "rebranding"   pitch on their website,
maybe SC just took that a step further.   Definitely seems like it was
around long before SC was formed though.   Sounds more likely.Werner 
dittman, looking from a Linkedin profile  works for Nokia Siemens 
Networks . Werner Dittman and Janis are both  listed on the SC page 
founders listed above. I think a number of them  have "day jobs" in
the  early phases of this startup.
"Silent   Circle’s team:  a unique and eclectic mix of
world-renowned    cryptographers, Silicon Valley software engineers,
German VoIP    engineers, Latvian system analysts and former US Navy
SEALs &  British Special Air Service (SAS) security experts."

* Application is designed for VoIP, not specifically for SecurityThe
software TiviPhone appear to be designed for general mobile voip use
and not specifically designed for security.It does include a custom
written SIP parser rather than reusing existing code from other
projects:

	*sipparser/client/CSipParse.cpp 
	*sdp/parseSDP.cpp
* It does use an outdated SSL library (PolarSSL 1.1.1) with some known
security vulnerabilities ?

	*Latest version is 1.2.5 (2013-02-02), the project seems very active
as 1.1.1 has been released 2012-01-23
	*PolarSSL Security Advisory:
https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/security-advisories (most recent
advisory Feb 2nd) .
	*PolarSSL Changelog
https://github.com/polarssl/polarssl/blob/master/ChangeLog 
	*they embed 1.1.1 and 1.1.4 in libs, but I only find 1.1.1 usage in
the code
	*TODO: It should be checked in details if that 1.1.1 is vuln and/or
patched to some of the advisory. 
	*^--- PolarSSL 1.1.1 suffers from "Weak Diffie-Hellman and RSA key
generation":
https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/security-advisories/polarssl-security-advisory-2012-01
	*Easily a non-issue as w/ many other projects. Verifying against
binaries is tougher.
* It does not use LibZRTP by Philip Zimmermann used in Zfone but
ZRTPCPP  The application does use the ZRTPCPP available on
https://github.com/wernerd/ZRTPCPP but it does not use the LibZRTP 
made by Philip Zimmermann that SilentCircle itself license (LibZRTP
SDK) https://silentcircle.com/web/zrtp-sdk/   Werner Dittmann works
for Silent Circle.
* It does use an outdated version of ZRTPCPP library?  Looking at
libs/zrtp/Changelog it does use ZRTPCPP 1.5.2 version (released on
05-Dec-2010).  Latests version is libzrtpcpp 2.3.2 (released on
20-Nov-2012)  ZRTPCPP 1.5/1.6/2.3 download:
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccrtp/ .

* It does reveal their test/development server?  In the file
./apple/ios/VoipPhone/settings.txt there is the hostname
fs-devel.silentcircle.org with ip 50.116.49.43    Do we have that code
too? It would be nice to have a full development   enviornment to play
with / even a fake one would have its uses.    That's a nice inquiry.
It would be also very interesting, while i  think  it's not doable
technically for smartphone platforms's  constraints, to  have
"Deterministic Building" to always have the exact  checksum of files 
given the same build process repeated in the same  environment 
(Unfortunately that's an hard topic, due to various  timestamps and
stuff  that linked put into the executable  files).//AppStore binaries
are  encrypted/heavily obfusticated... right,  proving the released
binary  match the released source code is hard.Unless  the build is 
reproducible and verifiable, releasing the source is  pretty 
meaningless.
