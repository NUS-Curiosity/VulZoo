Subject: McAfee Vulnerability in VSE and Host IPS


McAfee just release a patch for their Host IPS and VirusScan Enterprise.

See https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10034

Notice no CVE number or US Cert notification info.  So when did this
security vendor decide that they don't need to tell US Cert about a 
vulnerability that affects a wide swath of US businesses?

Isn't it wonderful they treat others products bugs/vulnerabilities
differently than their own in-house weaknesses.
