Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official News-Aktuell - PressePortal website web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to execute own sql commands by usage of a vulnerable application value GET method request.

The vulnerability is located in the `../services/content` module with the vulnerable iframe.htx file. Remote attackers are able 
to inject own sql commands by usage of the vulnerable `id` parameter. After the inject the website returns with a a obviously 
blank page but when you watch the source the execute is in the listed rss and context values. The issue is a classic remote sql 
injection. The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerability is estimated as critical with a cvss (common vulnerability 
scoring system) count of 8.7(+).

Exploitation of the sql injection web vulnerability requires no privileged web application user account and also no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in web application (website), account system & dbms compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] services/content

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] iframe.htx

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id

Affected Domain(s):
				[+] http://www.presseportal.de


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction and also without privileged 
web application user account. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below.
