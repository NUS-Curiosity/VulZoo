Subject: iCloud and privacy...last word

Apple Discussions has a large portion of people dead set on making
sure everyone knows that iCloud data is different then your "other"
data.  I disagree...follow you're data:

http://www.apple.com/privacy
"Here are _some examples _of the types of personal information Apple
_may_ collect and how we may use it."

What:
"we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing
 address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit
 card information."
"When you share your content with family and friends using Apple 
products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to
join  you on Apple forums, Apple may collect the information you
provide about  those people such as name, mailing address, email
address, and phone  number."

So....my info and any info about friends...gotcha.

How they use/share:
"It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising."
"You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are
in  contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.  Apple and its 
affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use
 it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with
 other information to provide and improve our products, services, 
content, and advertising."

iCloud:

the Pièce de résistance:
"This article explains how iCloud keeps your personal information and 
data secure. In addition to this article, you should also review
Apple’s  Privacy Policy, which covers iCloud."

Yea last word on this....use iCloud, share your stuff with Apple and
their affiliates...and done!
