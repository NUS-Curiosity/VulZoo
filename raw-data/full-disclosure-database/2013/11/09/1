Subject: Re: OpenSSH Security Advisory: gcmrekey.adv

It would be interesting to know how many people fall I to this combination.
Fedora 19 has the correct version and cipher suite.
Redhat AS/Enterprise 6 has a earlier version of OpenSSH so presumably not vulnerable (but I haven't tested ).
So that leaves Ubuntu as the other major Linux distro who might run a recent enough version.
I haven't checked *bsds or open Solaris.

Cheers,
Harry
