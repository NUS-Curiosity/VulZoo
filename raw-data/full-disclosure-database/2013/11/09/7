Subject: Cloud Questions

I’ve been lurking here for some months now and have seen plenty of vulnerabilities go by for applications, and the occasional OS level exploit.

I don’t think I’ve seen a single post about cloud security.

Is ‘the cloud’, AWS in particular, believed to be secure?  Is it simply not targeted?  Or would it be covered by some other list?  Inquiring minds are, uh, inquiring.


TIA,

— David
