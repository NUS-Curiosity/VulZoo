I don’t think I’ve seen a single post about cloud security.

Is ‘the cloud’, AWS in particular, believed to be secure?  Is it
simply not targeted?  Or would it be covered by some other list? 
Inquiring minds are, uh, inquiring.

There is no such thing as "cloud security" (to me at least). 
Companies may transfer/store encrypted, but if the NSA/law enforcement
ask for it, they give it up.  That's not secure to me..that's
more...."data held hostage (iCloud anyone?)".
