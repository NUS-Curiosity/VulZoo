Stallman has a term for it: Careless Computing.

The only list I've seen so far is OpenStack's security list.
http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-security.

From what I've seen, cloud security seems to have three broad tracks
(in addition to all the secure coding and HTML app stuff). First is
low-level security that acts on block devices, like Amazon's CloudHSM
and other who focus on VM security. Second is high level security that
attempts to secure databases (table fields) and object stores (Amazon
S3 and OpenStack Swift), like CipherClod and Armor-Cloud. And third is
identity management, like the federated and single sign-on
integrations.
