 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:272
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : poppler
 Date    : November 21, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated poppler packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Poppler is found to be affected by a stack based buffer overflow
 vulnerability in the pdfseparate utility. Successfully exploiting
 this issue could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in
 the context of the affected application. Failed exploits may result
 in denial-of-service conditions (CVE-2013-4473).
 
 Poppler was found to have a user controlled format string vulnerability
 because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may
 exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the
 vulnerable application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result
 in a denial-of-service condition (CVE-2013-4474).
