 looking for Beta-testers

Mmmm, I haven't played a lot with Radare, but I think that it already has all (or almost all) your "unique features" ;)
http://radare.org/
Moreover, they have a great documentation:http://radare.org/y/?p=documentation

Just in case you don't know the tool :)

Subject: [Dailydave] Capstone disassembly framework: looking for Beta-testers

Hi,

I am going to release a disassembly framework named Capstone, which has some unique features:

- Support all important hardware architectures: X86 (16/32/64bit) + ARM (including Thumb & Thumb2) + ARM-64 (aka ARMv8) + Mips.




- Simple lightweight intuitive architecture-neutral API that works in the same way across all archs.

- Implemented in pure C language, with native lightweight bindings for Python, Ruby, OCaml, C#, Java & GO vailable.




- Provide details on disassembled instruction (called "decomposer" by others).

- Offer some semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of all implicit registers read/written, or if the instruction belongs to a group of instructions (like ARM Neon, or Intel SSE4.2 group).




- Native support for Windows, Mac OSX & Linux.

- BSD license.


So if you can help to beta-test Capstone before it is public (soon), please contact me via this email or via website at:

   http://www.capstone-engine.org





Thanks,
Quynh
