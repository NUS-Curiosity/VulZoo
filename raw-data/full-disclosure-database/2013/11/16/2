A lot of software using that piece of code are still vulnerable. Especially
plugins/modules. Also lot of attacks on-going using this in my honeypots
(AS29422). Attacks are not verifying software version numbers or existence of
the software. They just attack with all payloads and hope that some sites get
infected. I have been actively sending abuse-reports of those and notified
several project upstreams about the vulnerability. You can contact me off the
list if you are interested to get more information.
