i've seen this done for testing purposes, when running hardware
through a quality check harness which needs such static configuration.

what is the IP? (publicly route-able or internal only?)
what is the MAC OUI prefix? (valid vendor or some arbitrary unallocated ident?)

answering these questions would help identify test vs. backdoor intent...
