Subject: SPLUNK > 6 universal forwarder cypher weakness

Hiho List,

SPLUNK > 6 might have some issues under the hood.

Issue #1

We have discovered the issue within a  Pen-Test.
Tested. 5.0.3, 5.0.4, 6

OS:
Linux
SOLARIS
Windows
OS X
BSD - the Open one
(...)

Issue #2
Have a quick look what is in the tar-ball
Seen Django.
IMHO several CVE's might be a reason to update the package.

Mitigation/Workarounds:

Issue #1
http://answers.splunk.com/answers/90990/allow-only-a-specified-ssl-cipher-in-the-splunk-forwarder
Issue #2
Check Out the latest Django release.
Overwrite the /Django Binaries at the SPLUNK > Folder.

Timeline.
Issue #1
Contacted SPLUNK > Security at Summertime Sadeness
2 Weeks later - and Licensing stuff more later, and phone Calls later - we received the KB.
Issue #2
Hmmm.

Version 6.
If you might upgrade the universal FW - welcome back to Issue # 1.  Thriller - Baby.
