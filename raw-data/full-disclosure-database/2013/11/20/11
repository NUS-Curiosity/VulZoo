Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-096 - Entity
	reference - Access	bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2140237

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-096
   * Project: Entity reference [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2013-November-20
   * Security risk: Not critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

By default, with an autoselect or a select widget, a user cannot autocomplete
an entity title, nor can they select an entity that they have no access to.
This will correctly throw a 'invalid id' error and does not show the title of
the entity.

However, if a user (A) that has access to the referenced entity (Node 1),
makes that reference on a node (Node 2), and gives edit access to another
user (B), user B will be able to see the node title for the referenced node
(Node 2).

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must get a user
with access to a private node to reference it via another node that attacker
has edit access to. No other node information is leaked other than the title.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
