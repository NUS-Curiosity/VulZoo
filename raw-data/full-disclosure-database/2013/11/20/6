Subject: CORRECTION: DesktopCentral Arbitrary File Upload
	Vulnerability

The previously posted advisory for the DesktopCentral Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability incorrectly listed build version 80293 as vulnerable. In fact, build 80293 is the first that contains the fix for this issue, and customers should contact ManageEngine to obtain this fix. All versions below 80293 are vulnerable.
