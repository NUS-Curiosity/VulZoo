Subject: Capstone disassembly framework: looking for
	Beta-testers

Hi,

I am going to release a disassembly framework named Capstone, which has
some unique features:

- Support all important hardware architectures: X86 (16/32/64bit) + ARM
(including Thumb & Thumb2) + ARM-64 (aka ARMv8) + Mips.

- Simple lightweight intuitive architecture-neutral API that works in the
same way across all archs.

- Implemented in pure C language, with native lightweight bindings for
Python, Ruby, OCaml, C#, Java & GO vailable.

- Provide details on disassembled instruction (called "decomposer" by
others).

- Offer some semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of all
implicit registers read/written, or if the instruction belongs to a group
of instructions (like ARM Neon, or Intel SSE4.2 group).

- Native support for Windows, Mac OSX & Linux.

- BSD license.


So if you can help to beta-test Capstone before it is public (soon), please
contact me via this email or via website at:

Thanks,
Quynh
