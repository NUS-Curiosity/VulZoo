 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:270
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nss
 Date    : November 20, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple security issues was identified and fixed in mozilla NSPR
 and NSS:
 
 Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.2 does not ensure
 that data structures are initialized before read operations, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger a decryption failure
 (CVE-2013-1739).
 
 Integer overflow in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.15 before
 3.15.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a large size value (CVE-2013-1741).
 
 The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, has
 many single-byte biases, which makes it easier for remote attackers
 to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of
 ciphertext in a large number of sessions that use the same plaintext
 (CVE-2013-2566).
 
 Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.14 before 3.14.5 and 3.15
 before 3.15.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via invalid handshake packets
 (CVE-2013-5605).
 
 The CERT_VerifyCert function in lib/certhigh/certvfy.c in Mozilla
 Network Security Services (NSS) 3.15 before 3.15.3 provides an
 unexpected return value for an incompatible key-usage certificate
 when the CERTVerifyLog argument is valid, which might allow remote
 attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted
 certificate (CVE-2013-5606).
 
 Integer overflow in the PL_ArenaAllocate function in Mozilla Netscape
 Portable Runtime (NSPR) before 4.10.2, as used in Firefox before
 25.0.1, Firefox ESR 17.x before 17.0.11 and 24.x before 24.1.1, and
 SeaMonkey before 2.22.1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
 via a crafted X.509 certificate, a related issue to CVE-2013-1741
 (CVE-2013-5607).
 
 The NSPR packages has been upgraded to the 4.10.2 version and the NSS
 packages has been upgraded to the 3.15.3 version which is unaffected
 by these security flaws.
 
 Additionally the rootcerts packages has been upgraded with the latest
 certdata.txt file as of 2013/11/11 from mozilla.
