-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The Invitation module restricts registration to users who have an invite code
(for running a private beta).
The module provides default views that don't check access to views prior to
displaying private information like usernames and email addresses.

     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

   * Invitation 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Invitation [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Invitation module for Drupal 7.x, you should disable the
module. There is no release with a fix.
