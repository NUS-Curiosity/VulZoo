Subject: [HITB-Announce] #HITB2014AMS Call for Papers Now
	Open

Hi everyone - The Call for Papers for the 5th annual HITB Security
Conference in Amsterdam is now open. #HITB2014AMS takes place at the
Beurs van Berlage from the 27th - 30th of May 2014. The official
conference hotel for the event is the Hilton DoubleTree.

As always we start with 2-days of hands on technical trainings followed
by a 2-day triple track conference. However, 2014 also sees the
introduction of a brand new addition to the HITB line up - the HITB
Haxpo or hacker expo!

With support and backing from iAmsterdam, HITB Haxpo is going to be
unlike anything that's been done before. Think IT security exhibition
meets Makerfaire with a generous touch of HITBSecConf flavor thrown in
for good measure.

What exactly does that mean? Imagine an area dedicated to hackerspaces;
makers with 3D printers, laser cutters and other fabrication goodies
coupled with TOOOL's Lock Picking Village, HITB and Mozilla's
HackWEEKDAY developer hackathon, a hackerspaces challenge featuring LEGO
Mindstorms EV3, our Capture the Flag 'live hacking' competition and
topped off by a 3 day IT exhibition featuring Microsoft and Google as
the main anchors. The best part? Entrance to the 3-day Haxpo is
COMPLETELY FREE!

As 2014 marks our 5th year anniversary of HITB in EU, #HITB2014AMS will
be a very special edition conference with an ALL WOMEN keynote line up:

Opening Keynote (29th May 2014):
================================

Katie Moussouris (Lead, Microsoft Security Response Center)
