Subject: Re: whatsapp opening url in background

Hi, please, refer to the advisory:

http://foosec.com/docs/whatsapp.html

Here you have an abstract:

*WhatsApp <http://www.whatsapp.com/>* advisory published in *Nov-2013* about
an internal side effect - as they said - that may provoke, among others, a
DoS against the application and information disclosure as well, everything
without any kind of human interaction with the device. Already *solved in
version 2.11.134*.

Kind regards!
