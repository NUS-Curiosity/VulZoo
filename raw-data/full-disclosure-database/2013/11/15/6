Subject: Re: whatsapp opening url in background

Hi,

fyi
I've seen Chrome (on Mac OSX) doing at least two requests to the
"first domains" of the results of a search
It appears to be like a pre-cache functionality, however I didn't
investigate more (so I don't know if it is related to pre-load / Do
Not Track)
I wonder how it could be used in combination with techniques like
google bombing for tracking or malware...

Regards
/JA
