Subject: Re: whatsapp opening url in background

Hi Frank,

I just received a URL via Whatsapp from a friend, and I haven't noticed that behavior. What's more, I don't remember if I ever noticed it.

Could you post more precise reproduction steps, please? How did you notice that the URL was opened in background?

Thanks.

Asunto: [Full-disclosure] whatsapp opening url in background

Hi List, i wonder about url opening in background in whatsapp. I am using an android phone. If i send a url to some other user(with android) in whatsapp my whatsapp and the the other user is opening the url in background without any user interaction. Is this normal? I could reproduce this only on android. Not on ios. Is this a android problem or a whatsapp problem? Sounds very strange and insecure for me. regards, Frank _______________________________________________ Full-Disclosure - We believe in it.
