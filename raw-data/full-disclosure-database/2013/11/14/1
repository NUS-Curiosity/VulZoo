Subject: whatsapp opening url in background

Hi List,

i wonder about url opening in background in whatsapp.
I am using an android phone.

If i send a url to some other user(with android) in whatsapp my whatsapp
and the the other user is opening the url in background without any user
interaction.
Is this normal?

I could reproduce this only on android. Not on ios.

Is this a android problem or a whatsapp problem?
Sounds very strange and insecure for me.

regards,
Frank
