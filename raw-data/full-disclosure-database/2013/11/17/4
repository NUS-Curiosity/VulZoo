Subject: Re: Ip address and mac address hardcoded

Hello,
  I have check it with IDA, its used in the case, but I'm still
working on the details. Its a public routable ip address and the mac
is a valid one from the same vendor. Doesn't make sense to be the mac
from the device, because the firmware I'm analyzing is an upgrade so
it must be generic. I will give more information has I have it.

Check the firmware with IDA and control if the MAC/IP addresses are
used for a condition. Not far ago, we've seen the D-Link Router
backdoor was using a hardcoded user-agent. So it is slightly possible
to by-pass authentication from a pre-configured IP address or MAC
(from a local network).

 Hi all,
  I've been doing some investigation, and I come acrosss an ip address
and a mac address hardcoded in some libraries of a firmware for a
vendor. Why should it be there this kind of hardcode?
