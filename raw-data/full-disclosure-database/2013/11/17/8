Subject: BF, LE and IAA vulnerabilities in InstantCMS

Hello list!

In addition to multiple vulnerabilities in InstantCMS, which I've disclosed 
earlier, here are new ones.

These are Brute Force, Login Enumeration and Insufficient Anti-automation 
vulnerabilities in InstantCMS.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are InstantCMS 1.10.3 and previous versions.

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

Brute Force (WASC-11):

In login form there is no protection from Brute Force attacks.

BF vulnerabilities I found in older versions of engine. In InstantCMS 
1.10.1, according to changelog, BF holes were fixed by adding captcha. 
Checking at official web site didn't reveal any captcha, so this fix for 
both BF holes wasn't verified and the captcha wasn't tested (how much is it 
secure, as I showed in my Month of Bugs in Captchas in 2007, captchas can be 
very insecure). Plus a lot of sites use older versions of InstantCMS and 
with all mentioned Login Enumeration vulnerabilities in InstantCMS, these BF 
holes are very actual.

Login Enumeration (WASC-42):

In registration form (http://site/registration) logins are enumerating via 
ajax-requests.

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

Presence of the captcha in registration form (for protecting against 
automated registration) doesn't protect from automated login enumeration. 
The requests are sending to the script 
http://site/core/ajax/registration.php.
