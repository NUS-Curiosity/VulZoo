 Multiple Registry Key Value Parsing Local Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

>From a technical point of view, it's a vulnerability because you can

The reason why a victim would probably import an arbitrary .reg file is
the same as why he would use a .wav file from an untrusted source, which
exploits a flaw in the installed .wav converter. If you can convince
(social-engineer) your victim, because of a lack of knowledge, this
scenario would work.

But I was thinking about another attack scenario: Imagine that you have
already access to the victim's computer - then you could use this flaw
to place a backdoor-shellcode (e.g. a reverse shell) into the registry,
which is executed every time the application starts - by default: on
startup. Since the application does not validate the values from the
registry (and does not remove them too), you've got some kind of
persistent code execution.

Regards.
