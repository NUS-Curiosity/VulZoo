Subject: Hack.LU 2013 CTF Wannabe challenge writeup

Hi all,

I made an extensive writeup of one of the harder challenges of the Hack.lu
CTF, held one week ago. It involves two major phases: one web exploitation
phase (SQL Injection, Preg_replace code exec, PHP loose typing) and one
buffer overflow exploitation phase (Linux x64 - Return Oriented Programming
approach) of a custom binary. You can find the full writeup here:

Cheers,

Arne
