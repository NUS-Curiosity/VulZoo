Subject: DoS vulnerability in Internet Explorer 6, 7,
	8 (access violation)

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Denial of Service vulnerability in Internet
Explorer. This is access violation.

This exploit is based on exploit by Asesino04 for IE7. As I've tested, it
also works in IE6 and IE8.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Internet Explorer 6 (6.0.2900.2180), Internet Explorer 7
(7.00.5730.13), Internet Explorer 8.0 (8.00.6001.18702) and previous
versions of these browsers. IE 9, 10 and 11 were not tested, but potentially
they can be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

Denial of Service (WASC-10):

Browser crashes at access by id to element of web page via method
document.getElementById. At that in IE 6 and 7 the browser crashes, but in
IE8 the tab is automatically restarting after error message (this
functionality appeared in IE8).
