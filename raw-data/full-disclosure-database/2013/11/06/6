Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-087 - Payment for
	Webform - Access	Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2129373

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-087
   * Project: Payment for Webform [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2013-November-06
   * Security risk: Not critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to ask for or require payments before users can
submit webforms. It previously allowed anonymous users to sometimes use other
anonymous users' payments when submitting a form. Payment for Webform never
supported anonymous users, but there was also nothing that prevented them
from using the Webform component.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be
anonymous and that other anonymous users must have made payments that have
not been used for submitting a webform yet. It does not compromise sites'
security, nor does it allow anonymous users to do anything they would not
have been able to do, if they had made a payment themselves.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

   * Payment for Webform 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.5.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Payment for
Webform [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

   * If you use the Payment for Webform module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to
     7.x-1.5 [5]

Additionally, if you have any forms that use the component and are accessible
to anonymous users, you may need to update those to prevent form validation
errors.

Also see the Payment for Webform [6] project page.
