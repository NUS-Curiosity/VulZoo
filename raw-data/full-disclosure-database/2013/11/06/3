Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the WIL-A module of Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in as the admin user of the device using a blank password.

The vulnerability is due to a coding error that resets the password for the admin user to a blank password on every reboot. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the administrative interface as the admin user with a blank password.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:
