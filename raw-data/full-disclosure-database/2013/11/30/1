yes; this requires trust in my efforts on your behalf.

alternatively you can file the requests yourself, covering your own
fees, if any, and collaborate with others on the relevant aspects of
the returned information.  i will provide details on performing these
requests and assisting with a collaborative analysis of them for those
who wish to pursue this route.

this entails some hours of preparation for specific and detailed
wording of requests, sending the requests to the many dozens of
relevant field offices, headquarters, and executive offices relevant
to the query, and paying fees, or providing subsequent justifications
for requests not immediately serviced.


my sincere thanks to those who wish to assist this effort to ensure
accountability and proper use of powerful technologies applied in the
public interest.
