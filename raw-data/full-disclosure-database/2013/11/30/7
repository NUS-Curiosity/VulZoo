Subject: Re: Vulnerabilities hiddenly fixed in WordPress
 3.6 and 3.6.1

Although I do not agree with this point, WordPress's stance on this is:

"Why are there path disclosures when directly loading certain files?
This is considered a server configuration problem. Never enable
display_errors on a production site." -
http://codex.wordpress.org/Security_FAQ#Why_are_there_path_disclosures_when_directly_loading_certain_files.3F

WordPress do not consider this a security bug and instead a configuration
problem. They will not fix any and therefor WordPress is absolutely full of
FPD issues.

I did some research back in 2011 and found that the first version of
WordPress I could install (0.71-gold) had 44 FPDs, whereas the latest at
the time of the research (3.2.1) had 155 FDPs -

Here is every FPD issue I identified from version 0.71-gold to version
3.2.1 - http://ethicalhack3r.co.uk/files/misc/wp_paths.tar (I would
estimate thousands across the versions, I used YEHG's inspathx tool)

>From this research I found that the "wp-includes/rss-functions.php" file is
the most consistent to give a FPD across all versions, this is the file now
used in WPScan to detect FPDs in WordPress reliably -
https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/blob/2fb6f7169acb5263f11586e742474193ed3b4ee1/lib/wpscan/wp_target/wp_full_path_disclosure.rb

Until WordPress decide to start fixing them, individual FPD bugs are a
non-issue.
