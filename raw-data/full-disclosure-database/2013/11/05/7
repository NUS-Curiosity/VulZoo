III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
LinkedIn social network is affected by Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerability. The

persistent (or stored) XSS vulnerability is a more devastating variant
of a cross-site scripting

flaw: it occurs when the data provided by the attacker is saved by the
server, and then

permanently displayed on "normal" pages returned to other users in the
course of regular

browsing, without proper HTML escaping. The affected resource is

http://www.linkedin.com/people/connections when you create new tags.

    + <IMG SRC=# onmouseover="alert('XSS')">
    + <IMG onmouseover="alert('XSS')">

Finally, you should pulse "Add New Tag" button, and then show you the
injection.

Second Option
=========================
