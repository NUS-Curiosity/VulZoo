Package        : strongswan
Vulnerability  : Denial of service and authorization bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6075

A vulnerability has been found in the ASN.1 parser of strongSwan, an IKE
daemon used to establish IPsec protected links.

By sending a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID payload to a vulnerable pluto or
charon daemon, a malicious remote user can provoke a denial of service
(daemon crash) or an authorization bypass (impersonating a different
user, potentially acquiring VPN permissions she doesn't have).

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.4.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
