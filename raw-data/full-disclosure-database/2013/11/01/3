That's good news that the newer firmware does not share this issue, but
they should patch the old firmware too!

You seem to have amazing patience when reporting such things. I am
personally the type of person that will spend all day on the phone with a
company until I reach someone who actually knows what I'm talking about &
knows who to get ahold of! Until I get ahold of someone who is relevant I
find it amazingly difficult to do anything else, it eats away at me until
the problem is resolved. LOL.
