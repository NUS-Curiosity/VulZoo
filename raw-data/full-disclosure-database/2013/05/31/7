What is WCE?
------------

Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) v1.4beta allows you to

NTLM authentication:

* List logon sessions and add, change, list and delete associated
credentials (e.g.: LM/NT hashes)
* Perform pass-the-hash on Windows natively
* Obtain NT/LM hashes from memory (from interactive logons, services,
remote desktop connections, etc.) which can be
used to authenticate to other systems. WCE can perform this task without
injecting code, just by reading and decrypting information stored in
Windows internal memory structures. It also has the capability to
automatically switch to code injection when the aforementioned method
cannot be performed

Kerberos authentication:

* Dump Kerberos tickets (including the TGT) stored in Windows machines
* Reuse/Load those tickets on another Windows machines, to authenticate
to other systems and services
* Reuse/Load those tickets on *Unix machines, to authenticate to other
systems and services

Digest Authentication:

* Obtain cleartext passwords entered by the user when logging into a
Windows system, and stored by the Windows Digest Authentication security
package


Supported Platforms
-------------------
Windows Credentials Editor supports Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 2008,
Windows 8.
