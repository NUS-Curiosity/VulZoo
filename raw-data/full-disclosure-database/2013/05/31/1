Subject: No Directory Traversal Vulnerability in sthttpd

Hi everyone,

I've gotten reports from a couple of directions now regarding Metropolis 
Hexor's directory traversal attack against thttpd 2.25b [1].  Since I'm 
maintaining sthttpd, a fork of thttpd [2], I thought I'd better let 
people know that the exploit does not affect sthttpd.  Several people 
have tried and just can't trigger it.  sthttpd has about a dozen patches 
that have accumulated over the years (one reason for the fork) and one 
of those is the fix.

Please play with the code base [3] and report problems (or better yet, 
submit patches) and I will address them issues.

I'm not on the list so please cc me.
