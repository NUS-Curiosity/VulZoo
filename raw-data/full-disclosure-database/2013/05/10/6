Subject: OT bait on freelancer.com about md5 preimage

stumbled upon this 
http://www.freelancer.com/projects/Cryptography/Preimage-for-specific-hash.html


Project Description:
I need a preimage for a specific MD5 hash (will be revealed in private message).
Length or content of the image doesnt matter (however I would pay more if I could choose a prefix).
