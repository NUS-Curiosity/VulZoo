Although there are easy attacks to collide two texts to the same MD5 hash, the
actual hash generated is not controllable. As far as I know, there's no known
easy way to pre-image a text to a pre-specified hash.

Would be interesting to see who bids on that project for a few thousand $$.
I know if I knew how to do that, I'd be busy making a bit more than a few
thousand doing it. :)
