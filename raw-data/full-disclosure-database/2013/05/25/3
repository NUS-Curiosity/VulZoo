Subject: PayPal.com XSS Vulnerability

Hello all!

I'm Robert Kugler a 17 years old German student who's interested in
securing computer systems.

I would like to warn you that PayPal.com is vulnerable to a Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerability!
PayPal Inc. is running a bug bounty program for professional security
researchers.

https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security/reporting-security-issues

XSS vulnerabilities are in scope. So I tried to take part and sent my find
to PayPal Site Security.

The vulnerability is located in the search function and can be triggered
with the following javascript code:

';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";
alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--
></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>

https://www.paypal.com/de/cgi-bin/searchscr?cmd=_sitewide-search

Unfortunately PayPal disqualified me from receiving any bounty payment
because of being 17 years old...

PayPal Site Security:

"To be eligible for the Bug Bounty Program, you *must not*:
... Be less than 18 years of age.If PayPal discovers that a researcher does
not meet any of the criteria above, PayPal will remove that researcher from
the Bug Bounty Program and disqualify them from receiving any bounty
payments."

I don’t want to allege PayPal a kind of bug bounty cost saving, but it’s
not the best idea when you're interested in motivated security
researchers...

Best regards,

Robert Kugler
