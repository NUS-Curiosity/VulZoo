Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1990 CVE-2013-1999

A regression was discovered in the security update for libxvmc,
causing segfaults with some applications. Updated packages are available
to address this problem. For reference, the original advisory text
follows.

Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in
multiple components of the X.org graphics stack and the related
libraries: Various integer overflows, sign handling errors in integer
conversions, buffer overflows, memory corruption and missing input
sanitising may lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.0.5-1+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.0.7-1+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxvmc packages.
