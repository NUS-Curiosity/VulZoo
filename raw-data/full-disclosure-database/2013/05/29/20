Subject: FPD and Security bypass vulnerabilities in
	Exploit Scanner for WordPress

Hello list!

These are Full path disclosure and Security bypass vulnerabilities in 
Exploit Scanner for WordPress. This is security plugin for detecting 
exploits and backdoors in WordPress. Which failed to identify my Backdoored 
Web Application (BWA) - a reference test of backdoor scanners (released in 
December).

Last week I've published article "Backdoor scanners testing among plugins 
for WordPress" 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-May/008832.html). 
In which I described the results of the testing of multiple plugins-scanners 
for WordPress and described methods of bypassing all of these scanners. 
Exploit Scanner was the most bypassable scanner among tested plugins.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Exploit Scanner for WordPress 1.3.3 and previous versions. Tested in Exploit 
Scanner 0.95, 1.0.4 and 1.3.3.

Affected vendors:

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

Security bypass (WASC-31):

This security bypass allows to inject php backdoor into web site (for 
executing OS commands), which will not be identified by the plugin.

All details about detecting BWA by different versions of the plugin and 
methods of their bypass are described in my article.
