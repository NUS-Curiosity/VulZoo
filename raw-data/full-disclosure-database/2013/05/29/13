  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-049
  * Project: Node access user reference [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-May-29
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module allows different access permissions to be given to authors,
referenced users and non-referenced users.

When an author has created content containing a user reference field (with
author update/delete grants enabled) and the author's user account is later
deleted, content created by them can be edited by anonymous users.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED

    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
