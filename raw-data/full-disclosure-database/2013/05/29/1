Fortunately Microsoft and Firefox took a more reasonable positions for
the bugs you discovered with their products.

PCWorld and MSN picked up the story:
http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039940/paypal-denies-teenager-reward-for-finding-website-bug.html
and  http://now.msn.com/paypal-denies-reward-to-robert-kugler-teen-who-found-bug-in-code.
It is now news worthy to Wikipedia, where it will live forever under
Criticisms (unfortunately, it appears PayPal does a lot of
questionable things so its just one of a long list).
