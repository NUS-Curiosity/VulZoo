Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-048 - Edit Limit
	- Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/2007048

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-048
  * Project: Edit Limit [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-May-29
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Edit Limit enables you to set time and count-based limits on how and when a
user can edit nodes or comments.

The module doesn't sufficiently check user access when editing comments to
see if the user has the necessary permissions to edit a comment outside of
the limits applied by this module. This makes it possible for a user who can
edit their own comments to edit the comments of any other user.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "edit comments".


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------
