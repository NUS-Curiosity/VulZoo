Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-046 - Filebrowser
	- Reflected Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1984212

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-046
  * Project: Filebrowser [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2013-May-1
  * Security risk: Highly critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Filebrowser module allows site administrators to expose a particular file
system folder and all of its subfolders with an FTP-like interface to site
visitors.

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user input when presenting lists of
files.

Because the vulnerability is /Reflected/ Cross Site Scripting, the only
mitigating factor is that an authenticated user must be tricked into visiting
a specially crafted malicious url.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Filebrowser 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Filebrowser
[4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Filebrowser module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Filebrowser
