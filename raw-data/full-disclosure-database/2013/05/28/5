Subject: Re: PayPal.com XSS Vulnerability

It may also be that in many countries, including the US where PayPal is based, it can be difficult to enter into a legally binding contract with a minor.  In many cases (with exceptions) a minor can void or exit a contract as they see fit, so you enter into a contract with a minor at your own peril.  Sometimes a way around this is for a parent to enter into the contract on behalf of, or in addition to, the minor.
