Subject: Re: PayPal.com XSS Vulnerability

Robert,

Paypal is actually a cool company and im sure they are not worried about
stiffing you on the money that is deserved from the bounty.
Dan actually had some cool words to say about the situation. The XSS is not
extremely complicated but it is good that you found it. Did they fix the
issue before you disclosed it?
