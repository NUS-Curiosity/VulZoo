There could be legal concerns here too (if a prosecutor takes interest
if folks besides the Swartz's of the world).

I can't wait to see the first CFAA violation brought against
interception services like these. Consider: the owner of the remote
server surely did not authorize the interception service to access the
site with a user's username and password. That's a clear violation of
exceeding one's authority under the CFAA since the interception
service had no authority from the server's owners.
