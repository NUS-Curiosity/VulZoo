Subject: Re: My ISP is routing traffic to private
	addresses...

Time Warner Cable (roadrunner) used to have this problem. They used the
10.x.x.x in various subnet masks for backend management IP addresses on all
of their customer cable modems, plus whatever other network equipment they
had. 2600 mag had an article a few years ago discussing this very issue. I
assume RCN is also a cable internet provider, so my guess is your issue is
one in the same. I can safely report that TWC is now filtering out those
from the ethernet side of the cable modem (has been for about a year or
so), so I cannot see any other 10.x.x.x networks outside of my own.
Probably done via the cable modem config & ACLs.
