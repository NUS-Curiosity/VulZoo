Subject: Re: My ISP is routing traffic to private
	addresses...

There are many ISP that route IP traffic through networks with private
addresses, my ISP to do the same thing and has 10.0.0.0 class A addresses
routable.
May be it is a miss of IP addresses or may be a NAT that was published due
to some network need.

regards,
