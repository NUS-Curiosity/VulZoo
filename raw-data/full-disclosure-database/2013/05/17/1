Oddly, I have an HTTP request from 65.52.100.214 in my apache log files.
It asked for http://stratigery.com/scripting.ftp.html by far the most
popular page on my web site.  It used a HEAD.  Referer and user agent
both '-'

That much is the same as everyone else.  I have a little more to add.
I have p0f version 2 running at the same time.  I can match up the
65.52.100.214 with this from p0f:

UNKNOWN [8192:56:1:48:M1460,N,N,S:.:?:?]

p0f also claims an "ethernet/modem" link.

I find 1 other hit in my p0f log file with that OS guess, from
1.23.166.134, which was also asking for
http://stratigery.com/scripting.ftp.html, but with a GET.

1.23.166.134 had a referer of http://www.google.co.in
1.23.166.134 had a user agent of " Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.1; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)"


65.52.100.214 hit my web server at 2013-04-30 07:26:26-06
1.23.166.134  hit my web server at 2012-04-09 11:26:00-06

Note that I do not use Skype at all.
