Subject: Re: My ISP is routing traffic to private
	addresses...

I'm having a little trouble understanding the problem here .. my ISP
uses public addresses for our cable modems. I host an SSH server at
home, and given my nightly logs, I can guarantee that it's accessible
from the wide wed ;-), if the intermediate routers in the ISP's network
use 10.x.x.x/8 space, who cares? No one but their techs need to access
them, I assume they filter 'private' addresses at their edge so that
10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x and 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 addresses don't leak
to the net. The only problem is that anyone on a cable modem could
access their 10.x.x.x/8 address space and frankly who cares. I don't see
anything wrong with this practice.
