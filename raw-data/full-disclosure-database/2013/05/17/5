Subject: Re: My ISP is routing traffic to private
	addresses...

I'm with a largish cable provider in Quebec, and they use the 10.x.x.x
network throughout theirs, but if you're trying to access a 172.30
device inside your private home or work network why is that traffic
escaping to your ISP? If you're trying to access 172.30.x.x devices over
the Internet, it's not supposed to work.

$ traceroute -n www.videotron.com
traceroute to www.videotron.com (24.201.243.21), 30 hops max, 60 byte
packets
 1  192.168.0.2  0.137 ms  0.064 ms  0.071 ms
 2  * * *
 3  10.170.169.49  16.351 ms  17.245 ms  17.185 ms
 4  10.170.162.214  12.740 ms  13.593 ms  13.539 ms
 5  10.170.167.14  24.527 ms  25.335 ms  25.282 ms
 6  10.170.177.165  18.039 ms  18.904 ms  18.833 ms
 7  10.170.163.177  14.135 ms  9.233 ms  12.787 ms
 8  10.170.163.182  13.678 ms  12.584 ms  11.337 ms

etc...

If I was using 10.x.x.x then I would route the traffic inside, I use
192.168.0.x at home, so 10 would leak to the net, but that's RFC'd not
to work.
