Me, if they're still not signing (much less encrypting) packets on the
local loop, and continuing to wish real hard that no one builds serial
or other debug ports—or board headers for same—into "certified" cable

I have a Verizon Wireless femtocell with what looks like an HDMI port
on the bottom, but *probably* isn't. I've been afraid to experiment,
for fear of what I'd find. Embedded device security continues to amuse
/ terrify.
