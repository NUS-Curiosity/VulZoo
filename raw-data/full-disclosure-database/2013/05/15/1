Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-2121

    Benjamin Herrenschmidt and Jason Baron discovered issues with the IOMMU
    mapping of memory slots used in KVM device assignment. Local users with
    the ability to assign devices could cause a denial of service due to a
    memory page leak.

CVE-2012-3552

    can cause a denial of service (system crash) on servers running
    applications that set options on sockets which are actively being
    processed.

CVE-2012-4461

    Jon Howell reported a denial of service issue in the KVM subsystem.
    On systems that do not support the XSAVE feature, local users with
    access to the /dev/kvm interface can cause a system crash.

CVE-2012-4508

    Dmitry Monakhov and Theodore Ts'o reported a race condition in the ext4
    filesystem. Local users could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2012-6537

    users on 64-bit systems can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2012-6540

    Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Linux virtual server subsystem.
    Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory. Note: this issue
    does not affect Debian provided kernels, but may affect custom kernels
    built from Debian's linux-source-2.6.32 package.

    users maybe able to bypass the address space layout randomization (ASLR)
    facility due to a leaking of information to child processes.

CVE-2013-1767

    Greg Thelen reported an issue in the tmpfs virtual memory filesystem.
    Local users with sufficient privilege to mount filesystems can cause
    a denial of service or possibly elevated privileges due to a use-after-
    free defect.

CVE-2013-1773

    Alan Stern provided a fix for a defect in the UTF8->UTF16 string conversion
    facility used by the VFAT filesystem. A local user could cause a buffer
    overflow condition, resulting in a denial of service or potentially
    elevated privileges.

CVE-2013-1774

    Wolfgang Frisch provided a fix for a NULL-pointer dereference defect
    in the driver for some serial USB devices from Inside Out Networks.
    Local users with permission to access these devices can create a denial
    of service (kernel oops) by causing the device to be removed while it is
    in use.

CVE-2013-1792

    Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat EMEA GSS SEG Team discovered a race condition
    in the access key retention support in the kernel. A local user could
    cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference).

CVE-2013-1796

    Andrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM subsystem. A user in
    a guest operating system could corrupt kernel memory, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2013-1798

    Andrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM subsystem. A user in
    a guest operating system could cause a denial of service due to a use-
    after-free defect.
    
CVE-2013-1826

    Mathias Krause discovered an issue in the Transformation (XFRM) user
    configuration interface of the networking stack. A user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability maybe able to gain elevated privileges.
    
CVE-2013-1860

    Oliver Neukum discovered an issue in the USB CDC WCM Device Management
    driver. Local users with the ability to attach devices can cause a
    denial of service (kernel crash) or potentially gain elevated privileges.

CVE-2013-1928

    Kees Cook provided a fix for an information leak in the
    VIDEO_SET_SPU_PALETTE ioctl for 32-bit applications running on a 64-bit
    kernel. Local users can gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2013-1929

    Oded Horovitz and Brad Spengler reported an issue in the device driver for

    Communication (TIPC) protocol support. Local users can gain access to
    sensitive kernel memory.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32-48squeeze3.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze3

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
