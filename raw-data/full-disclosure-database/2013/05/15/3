Subject: Indusface Website Hacked and Infected?

Dear All,

I was searching for some information on the internet and it seems that the
Indusface website was infected with Russian Spam and Malware. There seems
to be spam and malicious code in the homepage along with many more spam
pages added into the webroot. Below are some screenshots of the same:

*These Spam Pages on the Indusface Website Contain Potentially Malicious JS
Files*

Does anyone know how this sort of hack takes place? Please let me know any
information possible.

Thanks - Rahul
