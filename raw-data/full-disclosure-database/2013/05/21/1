other products), which could be exploited by an attacker to execute
commands on the affected machine under the context of the SYSTEM user
or user with local administrative privileges.

Technical Background:
The vulnerability exists because Infotecs products installs to folder
with insecure permissions. "Everyone" group has "Full Control" rights
to the files/folders in the following path: "%Program

can modify, delete or change permissions of any file in data the
folder consists of data, executable and configuration files.
