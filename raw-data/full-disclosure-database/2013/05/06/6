Subject: Introducing libOnionRoute,
	the library to anonymize software

Hi Everyone:

LibOnionRoute, the library to anonymize software was just released. It
is basically a modification of Tor to transform it into a library you
can link to your software. Some of us believe is more secure in some
situations to use it like that.

To find out more please visit:

Waldo
