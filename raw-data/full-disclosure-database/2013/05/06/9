  This is the current version (released 2012-05-31), but built with
  vulnerable components too (see above), so yet another company that
  is unable to keep its software uptodate and protect its customers.

              "3CX phone system is per objective evidence the safest phone
               system on the market. If you dont like it, use asterisk."

I second that: dont use software from 3CX! Request your money back.
