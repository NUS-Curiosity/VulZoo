Subject: VULNERABLE and COMPLETELY outdated 3rd-party
	libraries/components used in 3CX Phone 6

Hi @ll,

the current 3CXPhone6.msi (for Windows), available from
<http://www.3cx.com/VOIP/sip-phone/>, digitally signed on 2012-07-30,
installs the following outdated and vulnerable 3rd-party libraries:

* libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll version 0.9.8h (from 2008-05-28)
  of OpenSSL.

  The current version of OpenSSL is 0.9.8y, see
  <http://www.openssl.org/>, it fixes about 20 CVEs found in earlier
  versions downto 0.9.8h.


* FFmpeg/FFdshow version 1.1.0

  The current version of FFmpeg/FFdshow is 1.2, see
  <http://www.ffmpeg.org/security.html> for the 24 fixed CVEs since
  1.1.0.

              "3CX Phone is freeware, use another software"

I second that: don't use software from 3CX!
