Subject: Pentesting Distributions or Projects for
	Raspberry Pi

Hey there guys,

Do you know other projects, distributions, and installer kits for Raspberry
PI aside from the distributions and kits mentioned in this article:
http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/pentesting-distributions-and-installer-kits-for-your-raspberry-pi/
 ?

I am very much interested in trying out new projects :)

Also lately I have been addicted to RetroPie (
https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup) ahahhaha although it is not
related to security really but I just love emulating some cool and classic
games from SNES.

Regards,

Jay Turla
