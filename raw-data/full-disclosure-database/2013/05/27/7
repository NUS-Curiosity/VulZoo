Severity:
=========
Low


Details:
========
A remote redirection (external) vulnerability is detected in the Barracuda SSL VPN 680 v2.2.2.203 (Vx) Web Application Appliance.
The bug allows remote attackers to prepare links to client side external redirects with malware, phishing websites or malicious 
web context. 

The vulnerability is located in the resourceId parameter request when processing to load via GET method an internal `returnTo` file redirect.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] launchApplication.do [resourceId]

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] returnTo


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without privileged application user account but with medium or
high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
The first url shows the standard request via GET request
https://sslvpn.127.0.0.1:8080/launchApplication.do?resourceId=1&policy=1&returnTo=%2FshowApplicationShortcuts.do

1.2
The secound url shows the manipulated remote context via GET request
https://sslvpn.127.0.0.1:8080/launchApplication.do?resourceId=1&policy=1&returnTo=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com

https://sslvpn.[SERVER]/[FILE].do?[RES+ID]=x&[POLICY]=x&returnTo=[EXTERNAL TARGET]


Solution:
=========
The vulnerability can be patched by allowing only local file requests when processing to load the vulnerable returnTo parameter via GET.
