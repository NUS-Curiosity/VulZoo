Subject: Re: Sony PS3 Firmware v4.31 - Code Execution
	Vulnerability

Hallo Julius,
after our team was reading your messages in the morning, i want to
respond shortly with some facts.

It was a file object code execution to use it as html injection was only
one attack vector and you have choosen the smallest.
Your view on the issue is restricted to see also other exploitation
vectors because you do not want to grant the researcher
the disclosure of the awesome vulnerability.

A Command injection (file|path) in the main menu with ability to load
more usb content, a file object code execution with affect
to the core menu, a persistent script code injection (you named
useless). In your first response you said it is bullshit, the secound
time you answered with "i reproduced ... and it was only a html inject".
When you are able to repro, load via a command inject the
.sfo as file with the followup code to execute from the main context
menu like benjamin did. On his test he prepared a usb to load with
the first char by char inject the secound file code through the filter
for an execution.

Sony japan got informed about the 7 discovered issues by the german ps3
community team (MUC).

In the submission benjamin provided with the firmware issue a password
reset session vulnerability in the psn network but also
different minor priority issues.
