Subject: [CVE-2013-2115] Struts 2.3.14.2 GA (important
	security fix)

The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.3.14.2 is
available as a "General Availability" release. The GA designation is
our highest quality grade.

Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating
enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to
streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to
maintaining applications over time.

A critical security issue was solved with this release - see [1] for
detailed information:
* A vulnerability introduced by forcing parameter inclusion in the URL
and Anchor Tag allows remote command execution, session access and
manipulation and XSS attacks

All developers are strongly advised to immediately update existing
Struts 2 applications to Struts 2.3.14.2.

Struts 2.3.14.2 is available in a full distribution or as separate
library, source, example and documentation distributions, from the
releases page. The release is also available through the central Maven
repository under Group ID "org.apache.struts". The release notes are
available online [2].

The 2.3.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum
requirement of the following specification versions: Servlet API 2.4,
JSP API 2.0, and Java 5.

Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts
framework, please post your comments to the user list, and, if
appropriate, file a tracking ticket.
