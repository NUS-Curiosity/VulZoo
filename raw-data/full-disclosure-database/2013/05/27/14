Hi Robert,

Interesting. The Bug Bounty page
(https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security/reporting-security-issues)
does not state there's an age restriction or minimum.

It appears PayPal is sending the message that its best to sell the bug
privately, rather than participate in responsible disclosure (despite
what their Bug Bounty page states).

Has anyone written about the issue? For example, an established
researcher? I'd like to see homage paid on PayPal's wikipedia page
(wikipedia has some rules about citing sources, so the person writing
would have to meet criteria).

Sorry to hear about the crappy treatment.

Jeff
