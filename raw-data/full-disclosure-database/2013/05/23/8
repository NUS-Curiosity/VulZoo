Subject: SEC Consult whitepaper :: Blackberry Z10 Research
 Primer - "Dissecting Blackberry 10 - An initial analysis"

SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab released a new whitepaper titled:
Blackberry Z10 Research Primer - "Dissecting Blackberry 10 - An
initial analysis"


Abstract:
---------
In 2013, Blackberry has presented a brand new operating system which 
significantly differs from others presented on the smartphone market.
A very high security level is announced, and the expectations are
corresponding. Some analytics consider this as the last chance for
Blackberry "to get back in the big game" and stand in the row with
such giants as iOS and Android.
The goal of this whitepaper is to show an approach for testing the
new Blackberry 10 operating system and to identify vulnerabilities
on a new Blackberry 10 device.


A set of methods and tools has been developed. In the paper we will:

  * Discuss specifics of the operating system
  * Check for vulnerabilities "by design"
  * Talk about fuzzers
  * Test default utilities
  * Dump the "boot sector"
  * Mention other interesting entry points / notices
  * Propose further steps for future research
