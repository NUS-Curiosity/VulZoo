Subject: XSS and FPD vulnerabilities in I Love It New
	theme for WordPress

Hello list!

These are Cross-Site Scripting and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities in I 
Love It New theme for WordPress. This is commercial (premium) theme. Earlier 
I've wrote about vulnerabilities in VideoJS 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/21) and in multiple web 
applications.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

All versions of I Love It New theme for WordPress. The theme contains 
vulnerable versions of VideoJS and Audio Player.

Vulnerable are web applications which are using VideoJS Flash Component 
3.0.2 and previous versions. Version VideoJS Flash Component 3.0.2 is not 
vulnerable to mentioned XSS hole, except XSS via JS callbacks (as it can be 
read in repository on github). Also there are bypass methods which work in 
the last version, but the developers haven't fixed them due to their low 
impact. So update to last version of VideoJS.swf.
