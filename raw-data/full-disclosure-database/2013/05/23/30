Subject: Question on SMBRelay through Meterpreter

Hi guys,
 
Does anyone here have any experience with SMBRelay? Specifically running this module on a meterpreter session?
 
Imagine I run: run autoroute -s 10.1.13.0/24 and the IP of the meterpreter client is 10.1.13.26. If I set the SRVHOST to listen on this address would that work?
 
I have tried this an received an error saying that port 445/139 are busy. But if I elevated to SYSTEM, closed these ports and then ran SMBRelay. Would this technically work?
