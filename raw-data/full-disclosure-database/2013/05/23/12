Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in
multiple components of the X.org graphics stack and the related
libraries: Various integer overflows, sign handling errors in integer
conversions, buffer overflows, memory corruption and missing input
sanitising may lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.0.7-1+squeeze1.
