[ESNC-2013-005] Remote Code Injection in SAP ERP Central Component - Project System

Please refer to http://www.esnc.de for the original security advisory, updates and additional information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Business Impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project System, which is part of SAP ERP, provides tools to track project costs and resources. It is tightly integrated with Controlling, Human Resources, and Logistics modules.

This vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary program code of the user's choice.

According to SAP, the user can:

* "Inject and run their own code,

* Obtain additional information that should not be displayed,

* Modify data, delete data."

Since this issue exists on a remote function module, attacker can directly call the RFC from the network or from Internet via SOAP-RFC services.

Risk Level: High
