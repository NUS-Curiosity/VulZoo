Several issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The 
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream 
version, 5.5.31, which includes additional changes, such as performance 
improvements and corrections for data loss defects. 

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.31+dfsg-0+wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.31+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.5 packages.
