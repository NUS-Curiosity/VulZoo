It should. Private address ranges are not marked "magic cows" inside a 
classical router's firmware.

Still the problem OP is experiencing is strange, since if there is a 
local subnet, it should have a priority local route. Why isn't it there?

Btw, I'd be cautious to state that ISP filter incoming packets with 
dst=private. The limitation here would be that private ranges will 
usually be router upstream, so you can't really get past and internet 
exchange.
