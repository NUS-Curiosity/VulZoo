Subject: AFU vulnerabilities in MCFileManager for TinyMCE

Hello list!

MCFileManager, as all web applications which have MCFileManager in their 
bundle.

These are Arbitrary File Uploading vulnerabilities, which lead to Code 
Execution on IIS and Apache web servers.

Arbitrary File Uploading (WASC-31):

Execution of arbitrary code is possible due to bypass of program's security 
filters (on IIS and Apache web servers).

Code will execute via file uploading. Program is vulnerable to three methods 
of code execution:

1. Via using of symbol ";" (1.asp;.txt) in file name (IIS).

2. Via "1.asp" in folder name (IIS).

3. Via double extension (1.php.txt) (Apache with special configuration).
