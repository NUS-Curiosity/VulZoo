Subject: Re: Forticlient VPN client credential
	interception vulnerability

Reminded me of a bug I found in an EAL4 certified military encryption product.

The source code actually says "FIXME - need to add parameter validation."

So instead of spending a few minutes adding input sanitisation, the
developers just added a reminder that none exists and shipped the
product as-is. One of those face slap moments.
