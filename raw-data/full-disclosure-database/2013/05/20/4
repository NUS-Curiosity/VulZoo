Subject: Critical issues affecting multiple game engines


We have just released a paper [1], in which we detail several 0-day
issues affecting a number of different game engines, including: Unreal
Engine, CryEngine 3 and idTech 4.

During our presentation at the recent NoSuchCon conference in Paris, we
discussed [2] additional details about game engine issues. Additionally
we demonstrated [3] how an attacker can use master servers to perform
mass-exploiting of game vulnerabilities, in order to target and potentially
take down entire game networks.
