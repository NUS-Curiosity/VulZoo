Maybe when we cut over to IPv6 the ISPs will revert to the golden age of
putting all their gear on publicly addressable space :)

Conversely, an enjoyable network design is where you route public IPs from
a private network to a private network, and the public IP has different
services on the internet to the internally routed version, but clients need
access to both.

NATing heaven.
