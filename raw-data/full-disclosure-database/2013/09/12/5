the primary issue: protocols and applications which facilitate mass
surveillance, dragnet style.  efforts like crippling internal
standards, or embedding weaknesses in algorithms in deployed systems,
are counter to the security of everyone, not just US citizens.

there is stronger justification for end-point targeted activities, and
indeed, evidence shows these techniques are absolutely effective.

there is no justification for blanket mass surveillance, especially
when deployed via subterfuge and deceit.

thwart it via every means possible! opportunistic encryption, forward
secrecy, mix networks, other technical tricks.



P.S. every means possible also implies political involvement, as the
funding for these efforts flows through a legal diffusion of
responsibility under legitimacy of democratic consent. Ron Wyden was
intentionally slighted in conversation with Alexander last month[0]; a
greater compliment i could not imagine.
 :P
