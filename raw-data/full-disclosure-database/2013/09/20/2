Package        : puppet
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4761 CVE-2013-4956

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in puppet, a centralized
configuration management system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-4761

    The 'resource_type' service (disabled by default) could be used to
    make puppet load arbitrary Ruby code from puppet master's file
    system.

CVE-2013-4956

    Modules installed with the Puppet Module Tool might be installed
    with weak permissions, possibly allowing local users to read or
    modify them.

The stable distribution (wheezy) has been updated to version 2.7.33 of
puppet. This version includes the patches for all the previous DSAs
related to puppet in wheezy. In this version, the puppet report format
is now correctly reported as version 3.

It is to be expected that future DSAs for puppet update to a newer,
bug fix-only, release of the 2.7 branch.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) has not been updated for this
advisory: as of this time there is no fix for CVE-2013-4761 and the
package is not affected by CVE-2013-4956.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.23-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 3.2.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
