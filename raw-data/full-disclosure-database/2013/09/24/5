Subject: jetty shutdown

Saludos:

When I've scanning a Jetty Server 7.3.0.v20110203, the tool found a
shutdown.php filename, and of course the service was "shutdown". The
machine is a MacOS. I'm searching information about  this file o feature,
but don't find information about this. Can anyone tell me if this is a
default configuration? Thanks.

  Atte.
