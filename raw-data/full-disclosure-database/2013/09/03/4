Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1.3

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 31st of August DAVOSET v.1.1.3 was
released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.1.3:

Use, don't abuse.

Among improvements in new version, in 1.1.3 there was added support of
cookies (for those web sites which protect themselves from automated attacks
by cookies). And was added support of setting ports. Also there were added
new services into full list of zombies (including a cookies protected site).

Best wishes & regards,
