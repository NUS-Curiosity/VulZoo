Completely right!

Again: completely right!

This is real: see <https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2781197> alias
<http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms13-034> or
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/10> for exactly this "stuff".

And dont forget to read <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Aug/75>
as well as <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/14>


Also see <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=871084>,
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=786407> and
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=868746> and notice
especially how a Mozilla developer tries to weazel and ignore
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/ibrary/ms997548.aspx>!


JFTR: Windows is the ONLY system that covers such silly beginners errors
      due to the documented idiosyncrasy of CreateProcess() (see
      <http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682425.aspx).


Finally take a look at the registry subkey

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall]

of your own Windows installation (if you have one): you'll most probably
find unquoted pathnames in "UninstallString", for example:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\SumatraPDF]
"UninstallString"="C:\\Program Files\\SumatraPDF\\uninstall.exe"
