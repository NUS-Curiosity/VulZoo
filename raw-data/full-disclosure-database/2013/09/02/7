Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-5641 CVE-2013-5642

Colin Cuthbertson and Walter Doekes discovered two vulnerabilities in
the SIP processing code of Asterisk - an open source PBX and telephony 
toolkit -, which could result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze11.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.13.1~dfsg-3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
