Subject: Event Easy Calendar 1.0.0 WP plugin

Details
========================
Application: Event Easy Calendar
Version: 1.0.0
Type: WordPress Plugin
Vendor: Adamson ( http://profiles.wordpress.org/adamson/ )
Url: http://wordpress.org/plugins/event-easy-calendar/
Vulnerability:
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352)

Description
========================
Events Easy Calendar will enable WordPress sites to manage all their bookings and appointments.

Vulnerability
========================
This plugin contains CSRF on all forms and some are also vulnerable to XSS. This entire plugin can be remotely controlled by crafting arbitrary payloads and send a malicious link to a site admin. By doing this you can create and update customers, create new services/cupons, change settings, enable reminders/auto approval, delete all bookings, etc. It's also possible to modify the PayPal recipient email address, so that all payments are sent to the attacker instead of the service provider. The cost of any services are also easily modified.

Solution
========================
No fix by vendor at this point. Remove the plugin from your WordPress installation.
