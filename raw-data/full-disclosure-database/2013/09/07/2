Package        : phpbb3
Vulnerability  : permissions too wide
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: yes
Debian Bug     : 711172

Andreas Beckmann discovered that phpBB, a web forum, as installed in
Debian, sets incorrect permissions for cached files, allowing a
malicious local user to overwrite them.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.7-PL1-4+squeeze1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.10-4+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpbb3 packages.
