Which "they" was it?

If you're referring to this:

http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.selinux/16844

Note that the guy you were replying to was a Japanese software engineer
employed by NEC.  If you want to argue the guy was an NSA plant trying to get a
backdoor in, feel free. But don't expect to be taken seriously without some
additional evidence.

And it counted as "underhanded", how, exactly?

In other words - under what conditions can you make a truncation to MAX_PATH
cause an actual hole? And to count as "underhanded" rather than merely "buggy",
you'd need at least a whiff of evidence that it was intentional.

Or as Kohei replied to you:

"The selinux_mnt is not a variable given by external one, unless
application does not update it by itself.

It is not difficult to modify this part to return ENAMETOOLONG
when snprintf() returns larger or equal with PATH_MAX."

In the Linux community, this would count as '-ENOPATCH', as I'm not
finding where you ever submitted a patch to fix the issue.
