Now you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. SELinux is FOSS and very
auditable.

Sure, potentially compromised by pretty much anyone in the world since anyone
can contribute to it. But all of the contributions happen out in the open so
the code can be reviewed for trickery.

There would be no point in doing so.

Despair? No. More like relief.
