Cryptography and security expert Bruce Schneier said he's heard of
these same types of tactics from others the government has approached
seeking technological backdoors.

"It's not an explicit ask, [...] it's an informal, oblique mention,
joking conversation, where you're felt out as to whether you're
amenable to it," Schneier told Mashable. "If you're amenable to it,
that conversation continues, if you're not, it's like it never
happened."

Schneier is working with The Guardian on new, undisclosed documents
provided by NSA leakerEdward Snowden. And he is now looking for
whistleblowers in the tech industry who are willing to share their
experience with government officials asking for backdoors.

** unfortunately this means the NSA went around Biddle and Ferguson,
then tightly compartment'ed the side door access...
