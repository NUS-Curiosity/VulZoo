Subject: Automated SQL Injection Detection

Dear,

I just published a new blogpost named 'Automated SQL Injection Detection'
which contains an overview of existing detection methods for SQL Injection
with accompanying SQLFiddle examples, as well as new payloads for
time-based detection. It's located here:
