View online: https://drupal.org/node/2087095

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-076
  * Project: jQuery Countdown [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-September-11
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This jQuery Countdown Module enables you to display a countdown block based
upon date settings.

The jQuery Countdown Module does not properly sanitize the settings, allowing
a malicious user to embed scripts within a page, resulting in a Cross-site
Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the
"access administration pages" permission.

    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

Countdown [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------
