Timeline:
------------ 

2013.07.14 - informed organizers of YAPC::Europe 2013, on which site I've
found this and other holes. They ignored to fix this and all other holes at
their site (which they had for 10 years while use Act), arguing that
developers of Act should do that and they don't care about security of their
site.
2013.07.14 - informed Act developers. They hadn't answered.
2013.07.16 - announced at my site.
2013.07.27 - developers fixed this vulnerability (without answering and
thanking)
(https://github.com/book/Act/commit/e9c5257594f7eb69c4f935fb14fadb1bc79b46d7).
2013.08.29 - disclosed at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/6657/).
