For Public Release 2013 September 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

The Cisco IOS Software implementation of the network address translation (NAT) feature contains three vulnerabilities when translating IP packets that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.

This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-nat

Note: The September 25, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes eight Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September 2013 bundled publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep13.html
