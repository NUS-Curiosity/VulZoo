It seems to me that a simple fix to the CookieStore would be to add a
time stamp to the serialized (and signed) data.  Then an expiration
time frame could easily be enforced.

In general, stateless cookies like this have great advantages.  They
just need to be implemented correctly (which is admittedly tricky).
