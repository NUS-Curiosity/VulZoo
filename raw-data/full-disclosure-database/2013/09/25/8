Hi AIXperts and friends,

I did some tests on this and it seems that the script is working pretty well.

Anyway, I found out that you need this package in order to run it:

devices.common.IBM.ib.rte

I have tested it on

7100-02-01-1245
6100-08-01-1245

and both were exploitable.

BR,
Adrian-Daniel Bacanu

Does anyone have IBM AIX > v6.1 or VIOS to test?
