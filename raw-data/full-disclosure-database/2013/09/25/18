Cisco IOS Software Queue Wedge Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130925-wedge

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 September 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the T1/E1 driver queue implementation of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge condition, which could lead to loss of connectivity, loss of routing protocol adjacency, and could result in a denial of service (DoS) scenario.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect implementation of the T1/E1 driver queue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending bursty traffic through the affected interface driver. Repeated exploitation could cause a DoS condition.

Workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability are available.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-wedge
