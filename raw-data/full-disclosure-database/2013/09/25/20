Cisco IOS Software Internet Key Exchange Memory Leak Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130925-ike

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 September 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a device reload.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKE version 1 (IKEv1).

Although IKEv1 is automatically enabled on a Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software when IKEv1 or IKE version 2 (IKEv2) is configured, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv1 packet.

In specific conditions, normal IKEv1 packets can also cause an affected release of Cisco IOS Software to leak memory.

Only IKEv1 is affected by this vulnerability.

An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability. 

This advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-ike

Note: The September 25, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes eight Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September 2013 bundled publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep13.html
