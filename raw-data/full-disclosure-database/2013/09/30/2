lately by the staffs of Pentest Magazine because of their spam
promotions and "Would you write for Us" inquiries despite saying no to
their proposals. I don't like to write for them because they don't
offer their services for free (Also they sell their magazines to other
people yet they don't pay their writers - no just compensation ). So
here is my full disclosure of Pentest Magazine, Data Recovery
Magazine, and Software Developer's Journal which are all from the same
company or somehow related. The official websites of the magazines
mentioned are all vulnerable to DOM XSS because of the prettyPhoto js.
