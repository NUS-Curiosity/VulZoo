Subject: [Tool] nimbostratus: Pivoting in Amazon Clouds

Guys,

    Nimbostratus is the first toolset to help you in the process of
pivoting in Amazon AWS clouds. At this moment you can:

    * Enumerate permissions to AWS services for current IAM role
    * Use poorly configured IAM role to create new AWS user
    * Extract local and remote AWS credentials from meta­data, .boto, etc.
    * Clone DB to access information stored in snapshot
    * Inject raw Celery task for pickle attack

   For those who don't know much about AWS, I wrote a small article
[1] which should help you understand what this is all about.

    Also, and because it would be difficult to find a legal way to
test this toolset, I created a fabric script [2] that will deploy a
vulnerable infrastructure for you to play with.

    Have fun, learn cloud, report bugs and send pull-requests.
