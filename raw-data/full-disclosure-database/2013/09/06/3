Subject: Re: Analysis of the Carna Botnet (Internet Census
	2012)

Dear All,

I am now releasing a research paper on my Carna Botnet research. This can be
accessed here: http://bit.ly/carna-paper

I have some further updates that you may be interested in. 

Firstly, a YouTube video summarising my Carna Botnet research has kindly
been put together by APNIC. It's a 4 minute video that would be useful to
help anyone understand the issue quickly. This video can be viewed at:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyT2Rqi-OUU

Secondly, I have been accepted to present on the European devices in the
data of the Carna Botnet at DeepSec in Vienna on Friday 22nd of November
2013. If you are interested in contributing ideas or meeting me or talking
to me in person then you can find me there:
https://deepsec.net/schedule.html.

Finally, I have been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to present my
research at four conferences since my initial email below. Resources from
all of these conferences are publicly available through the links below.

Subject: Analysis of the Carna Botnet (Internet Census 2012)

Dear All,

I have made my presentation on the Carna Botnet freely available for view
and/or download: http://bit.ly/auscertcarna

This presentation is on the Compromised Devices of the Carna Botnet (also
known as Internet Census 2012). This analysis is done from data obtained
directly from the researcher. The data used is NOT publicly available for
download.

This was recently presented at the AusCERT Conference 2013. Info:
http://conference.auscert.org.au/conf2013/speaker_Parth_Shukla.html

This presentation is freely available for viewing and downloading as I wish
to spread awareness of the issues raised as a result of the Carna Botnet.

I am sending this email as I suspect many of you will find the contents of
this presentation interesting. Apologies to those who are subscribed to
multiple mailing lists and are receiving this email multiple times as a
result. Please forward this onto any mailing list or any individual who you
think may appreciate the contents of the presentation.

Regards,
Parth
