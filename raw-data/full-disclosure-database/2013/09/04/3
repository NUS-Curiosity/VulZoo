Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in the Cisco WebEx Recording Format and Advanced Recording Format Players

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130904-webex

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 September 4 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) and Advanced Recording Format (ARF) Players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to crash an affected player, and in some cases, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system of a targeted user.

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on the computer of an on-line meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.

Cisco has updated affected versions of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx 11 meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx WRF and ARF Players to address these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:
