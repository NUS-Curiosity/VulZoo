Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-073 - Make
	Meeting Scheduler -	Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2081637

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-073
  * Project: Make Meeting Scheduler [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2013-September-04
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to create polls accessible by an url with hash (e.g.
example.com/makemeeting/sn9028xh3398) so that anonymous users can view and
vote on the poll.

The module didn't sufficiently check access when a poll is accessed directly
via its node url (e.g. node/123). Note: a user with the hashed url can still
access and vote on the poll as that is the intention of the module.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED

  * Make Meeting Scheduler 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Make Meeting
Scheduler [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
