*About The Webinar:*

Our members have two options to view the webinar from the comfort of their
home or office:

*1) Google+ Hangout:*

Our members can join us in our webinar discussion by participating in our
Google+ Hangout session. You will *need to have a Gmail or Google+ account* to
join the Hangout session. Google currently*does not support non-Google
accounts* for any Hangout.

By joining the Hangout session, you can ask questions or queries that you
may have to the speaker during the session.

We will be providing all members who are *RSVPing* for this event with
an *individual
form* to fill in their email address. We are not providing a common form to
fill in which can be viewed by everyone as individual forms would be more
appropriate to address any privacy concerns.

Only members who have *both RSVPed* and have *provided their email address* via
the individual form will be sent the Hangout invitation.

*2) YouTube Broadcast:*

For the members who are not comfortable in creating a Google+ account, we
will be broadcasting our event live on the air to our YouTube channel.

We will be sharing the link for the YouTube broadcast with everyone shortly
before the event begins.

Members accessing the YouTube broadcast can *only view the streaming session
* but cannot participate in asking questions.

Looking forward to see you all on the day of the event.

With Best Regards
