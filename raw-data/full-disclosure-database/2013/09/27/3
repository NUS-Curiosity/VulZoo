Subject: Fwd: New version of JBrute

Hey folks,


There's a new version of JBrute, an Open Source, multi-platform tool to
"decrypt" hashed passwords written in Java. It supports both brute-force
and dictionary attack methods, with a built-in rule pre-processor similar
to the JTR one, and it actually supports several standard algorithms and
several algorithms from propietary apps  (like Microsoft SQL Server,
Oracle, SYBASE, and so on).


The change log of the current version:


v0.95:

Date: 26/09/2013

-----

Fixes:

------

 _ "--test --algorithm=A" working now.

 _ Changes in Oracle11g.java class, using constants now (syntax issues).

 _ Performance improved for NTLM algorithm (50% faster).

 _ Performance improved for MSSQL-2000 algorithm (20% faster).

 _ Performance improved for MSSQL-2005 algorithm (15% faster).

 _ Performance improved for MSSQL-2012 algorithm (15% faster).

 _ Performance improved for SYBASE-ASE1502 algorithm (5% faster).


New Functionalities:

--------------------

_ Partial mask support for rule pre-processor. Available masks only on '$'
and '^' simple commands:

a-z, A-Z, 0-9, a-z0-9, a-zA-z, A-Z0-9, a-zA-Z0-9

custom masks (ex: [arx], [789])

_ New insert/delete commands supported: '[', ']' and 'DN' (no need to
escape from '[' or ']')

Please, take a time to test it and send me comments! I need volunteers for
deep testing.
