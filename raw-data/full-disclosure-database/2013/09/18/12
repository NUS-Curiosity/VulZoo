Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in RokIntroScroller for
	WordPress

Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in plugin RokIntroScroller 
for WordPress. In August 2012 I wrote about multiple vulnerabilities in 
RokBox for WordPress (http://securityvulns.ru/docs28871.html). These 
vulnerabilities are similar, since the same developers put the same 
vulnerable TimThumb into another their plugin (vulnerabilities in which I 
disclosed already in 2011).

These are Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse of 
Functionality, Denial of Service and Arbitrary File Upload vulnerabilities.

In July 2013 developers released a patch for their plugins and themes with 
TimThumb 
(http://www.rockettheme.com/wordpress-updates/1871-security-patch-for-wordpress-timthumb), 
which can be used to fix these vulnerabilities (except the last FPD).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are RokIntroScroller 1.8 and previous versions (to attacks on 
TimThumb and all versions are vulnerable to FPD).

Besides standalone WP plugin, this web application comes as part of the 
themes. Many of 56 RocketTheme's WP themes 
(http://www.rockettheme.com/wordpress-themes) use RokIntroScroller and old 
versions of these themes are vulnerable to attacks on TimThumb (and all 
versions of them are vulnerable to FPD).

(bypass of restriction on domain, if such restriction is turned on)

About such Abuse of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities you 
can read in my article Using of the sites for attacks on other sites 
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html). 
For such attacks my tool DAVOSET (http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/) can be 
used.

Arbitrary File Upload (WASC-31):

This Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability in TimThumb was disclosed after 3,5 
months after my disclosure of previous holes.
