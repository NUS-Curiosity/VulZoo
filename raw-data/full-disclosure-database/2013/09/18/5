Package        : chrony
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4502 CVE-2012-4503

Florian Weimer discovered two security problems in the Chrony time
synchronisation software (buffer overflows and use of uninitialised data 
in command replies).

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon in 1.24-3+squeeze1 (due to a technical restriction in the archive
processing scripts the two updates cannot be released together).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24-3.1+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.
