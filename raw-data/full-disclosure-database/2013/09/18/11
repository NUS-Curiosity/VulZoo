	Search - Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2092395

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-077
  * Project: Google Site Search [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-September-18
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to use the Google API to search one or more sites and
show the result in your Drupal site, with your custom styling.

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize the data retrieved from the Google
API.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attack must come from the
API which requires either compromising Google or spoofing DNS.

    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
