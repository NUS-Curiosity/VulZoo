Subject: New version of JBrute

Hey folks,


There's a new version of JBrute, an Open Source, multi-platform tool to
"decrypt" hashed passwords written in Java. It supports both brute-force
and dictionary attack methods, with a built-in rule pre-processor similar
to the JTR one, and it actually supports several standard algorithms and
several algorithms from propietary apps  (like Microsoft SQL Server,
Oracle, SYBASE, and so on).


The change log of the current version:


v0.94:

Date: 19/09/2013

-----

Fixes:

------

 _ Performance improved dramatically (around 900%) for dictionary
decryption method (all rules). Now I am using StringBuilders instead
Strings in the rule preprocessor (DictionaryRulePreProcessor class).

 _ Performance improved for Rule Action "V".

 _ Performance improved for Rule Action "R".

 _ Performance improved for Rule Action "t".

 _ Parameter "--stdout" for dictionary decryption is working now.

 _ Wrong reject result with complementary character classes in "%" reject
condition.

Please, take a time to test it and send me comments! I need volunteers for
deep testing.
