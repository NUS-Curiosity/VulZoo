Subject: Belkin Wemo 0day exploit (Remote shell + Rapid
	State change)

Discovered several UPnP vulnerabilites which allowed me to gain full shell access and modify the state of the device being controlled. Im in the process of disclosing to Belkin. PoC soon to come. Link to video below.

Belkin WeMo with latest firmware. Able to gain full root access and send commands including changing the state of connected device via flaw in UPnP implementation. Chose small desk lamp and simple on/off sequence due to safety concerns. Real world this could be a fan or space heater and rapidly turn on/off without limitation.
