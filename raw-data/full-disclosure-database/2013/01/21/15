My understanding was that this allowed you to make copies of a system for security evaluation. The DMCA is about  copyright and copyright prevention mechanisms, not unauthorised network intrusion. Having said that, I'm from the UK, so I may be totally wrong - I certainly think it would be covered under  by Computer Misuse legislation over here

In any case, none of that precludes enforcement of Terms of Service.

You may wish to be able to attempt to access and test any system containing data on you, but in most countries this isn't a legal right.
