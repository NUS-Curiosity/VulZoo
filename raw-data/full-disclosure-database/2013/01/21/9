Subject: Student expelled from Montreal college after
 finding vulnerability that compromised security of 250,
 000 students personal data

A student has been expelled from Montreal’s Dawson College after he
discovered a flaw in the computer system used by most Quebec CEGEPs
(General and Vocational Colleges), one which compromised the security of
over 250,000 students’ personal information.

Ahmed Al-Khabaz, a 20-year-old computer science student at Dawson and a
member of the school’s software development club, was working on a mobile
app to allow students easier access to their college account when he and a
colleague discovered what he describes as “sloppy coding” in the widely
used Omnivox software which would allow “anyone with a basic knowledge of
computers to gain access to the personal information of any student in the
system, including social insurance number, home address and phone number,
class schedule, basically all the information the college has on a student.”
