Subject: DNSChef 0.2 - DNS Proxy for pentesters and
	malware analysts

Hello fulldisclosure,

I would like to share an update to a tool built to aid penetration
testers and malware analysts with application traffic analysis and
interception.

DNSChef 0.2 adds support for IPv6, crafting of fake "A", "AAAA", "MX",
"CNAME", "NS", "TXT", "PTR", "NAPTR" and "SOA" records, custom
listening ports and many other features. The tool was tested to run on
Linux and Windows (bundled with an exe) platforms.

DNSChef source and documentation:
http://thesprawl.org/projects/dnschef/

Sincerely,
-Peter
