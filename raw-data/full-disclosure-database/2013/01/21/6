Subject: no-ip.com interesting way to handle newsletter
	options

Hello.

The newsletter no-ip.com sends to his customers has an unsubscribe
link like this:

http://www.no-ip.com/unsubscribe.php?email=user@example.com

which means everybody can change your subscription options, just by
knowing the email address you used to register.

Let's see if this email helps them to disable the non privacy-aware
PHP script more quickly.

Thanks.
