  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2013-January-30
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module creates images of user email addresses and email fields. The
module doesn't sufficiently check node access restrictions when displaying
such fields.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only impacts sites using
node access.

    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

---------------------------------------------------

  * All email2image 6.x-1.x and 6.x-2.x versions.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed email2image
[4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the email2image module for Drupal 6.x you should uninstall the
    module

Also see the email2image [5] project page.
