	Authenticator login -	Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1903282

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-012
  * Project: Google Authenticator login [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-30
  * Security risk: Highly critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module will allow you to add Time-based One-time Password Algorithm
(also called "Two Step Authentication" or "Multi-Factor Authentication")
support to user logins.

Users with the permission to use multi-factor authentication need to
associate a Google Authenticator token with their acount before they can use
the multi-factor authentication for login. If this step is not done or not
completed, their accounts can be logged-in to by supplying the username only
due to a logic bug in the module's validation. This means that when an
administrator enables the module and grants the permission to use
multi-factor authentication all user accounts with that permission can be
logged-in to via the username.
