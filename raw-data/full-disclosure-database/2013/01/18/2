Stop conferring trust.

Pin the certifcate or public key. Google used it to vet out the
Diginotar compromise in Chrome (all other browsers suffered). Its
similar to SSH's StrictHostKeyChecking option. Its also on track for
internet standards:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-key-pinning-04.

Use Secure Remote Password (SRP). SRP is basically Diffei-Hellman
using the password as an exponent (lots of handwaiving).

Don't trust browsers. That includes Mozilla (Trustwave and the closed
door, back room deals) or Opera (Nokia and its 'Acceleration
Interception').
