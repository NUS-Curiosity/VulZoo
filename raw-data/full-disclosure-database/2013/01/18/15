CA20121220-01: Security Notice for CA IdentityMinder

Issued: December 20, 2012
Updated: January 18, 2013


CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to two potential risks in CA 
IdentityMinder (formerly known as CA Identity Manager).  Two 
vulnerabilities exist that can allow a remote attacker to execute 
arbitrary commands, manipulate data, or gain elevated access.  CA 
Technologies has issued patches to address the vulnerabilities.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2012-6298, allows a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary commands or manipulate data.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2012-6299, allows a remote attacker to gain 
elevated access.


Risk Rating

High


Affected Platforms

All


Affected Products

CA IdentityMinder r12.0 CR16 and earlier
CA IdentityMinder r12.5 SP1 thru SP14

How to determine if the installation is affected

All versions of CA IdentityMinder r12.0, r12.5 prior to SP15, and r12.6 GA 
are vulnerable.

You can confirm that patches have been successfully applied by checking the
dates associated with the following IdentityMinder jar files (the jar files
are created in the patch output sub-folder structure in the root folder 
from which you have run the patch utility):

CA IdentityMinder r12.0 CR16 and earlier – user_console.jar
CA IdentityMinder r12.5 SP1 thru SP6 – user_console.jar
CA IdentityMinder r12.5 SP7 thru SP14 – user_console.jar & imsapi6.jar
CA IdentityMinder r12.6 GA –  user_console.jar & imsapi6.jar

The dates on these jar files will be set to the date on which the patch was
applied.

vulnerabilities.  Download the appropriate patch(es) and follow the 
instructions in the readme.txt file.  These patches can be applied to all
