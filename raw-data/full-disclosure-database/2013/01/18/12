You'd be amazed how many people try that sort of thing.  Consider
that over on the GPL side of the fence, there's more than enough
companies that try to play fast-n-loose with the GPL requirements
that www.gpl-violations.org stays in business.

(Also, keep in mind that there *are* a large number of exploits that
are in limited circulation.  Hacker X releases it to 10 or 15 of
his friends, and then one of his friends turns around and cashes it
in at some corporate, and then said corporate starts selling it as
part of their cyber-defense product.  At that point, Hacker X wants
to get paid (money, fame, credit, whatever)).

I believe I mentioned PGP way back at the start of the thread.  Also
helps if you actually PGP-signed your release.

Bonus points for figuring out how to explain digital signatures
to a jury, stripping it down to "up-goer-five" level needed for
the people who can't figure out how to avoid serving on a jury
(see  http://www.xkcd.com/1133/ for the details on that).

And why should they ask that other person instead?  You think
if the LEO is interested in a particular person's activities, that
person gets a free pass just because they're involved in an unrelated
court case?  That the cops are just going to say "Wow, he's busy in
court today, let's go hassle somebody who's name hasn't even come up
in this context"?
