 finding vulnerability that compromised security of 250, 000

@Valdis, your correct.

"He was expelled for other reasons. Despite receiving clear directives not
to, he attempted repeatedly to intrude into areas of College information
systems that had no relation with student information systems.

These actions and behaviours breach the *code of professional
conduct<http://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/public/72b18975-8251-444e-8af8-224b7df11fb7/info_desk/420a0_-_professional_conduct.pdf>
* for Computer Science students, a serious breach that requires the College
to act."
