I do not think the issue is whether or not he broke the law; rather,
the issue is whether or not the law serves the people's interest.  I am
not a Canadian, so maybe I do not really have a say, but given that
this kid did not cause any measurable damage, it seems hard to make the
case that he should have been punished for his actions.  Throwing a
student out of school because he used a pen-testing tool is more
damaging to the school and to society as a whole than what the student
actually did.

There is also the matter of the school itself.  They were presented
with a student who had found a vulnerability, reported it, and then
checked to see if there were still problems.  Does expulsion really
sound like a reasonable punishment to you?  Does any punishment seem in
order, given that the student made no attempt to maliciously exploit
his discoveries?  It seems to me that a much better approach would have
been to offer the student a chance to present the vulnerability in a
computer security class.  The school's mission is, theoretically, to
teach its students -- why, then, would they remove from the student
body someone who could do just that?

Sure, maybe the school has a policy of expulsion for any student who
breaks the law -- but why would the school expel a student
preemptively, before he was even found guilty by a court (or even
charged with a crime)?  If he had been arrested, it would have made
sense for the school to put him on academic suspension until the
conclusion of his criminal case, at which point a guilty verdict might
mean expulsion.
