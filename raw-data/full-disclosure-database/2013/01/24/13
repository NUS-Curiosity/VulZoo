I think you misunderstand - the ethics document was signed *when he
applied as a student".  If you think that's "unprofessional", you
might want to consider that doctors, lawyers, and other professions
have ethics standards as well.  As does anybody who has a CISSP:

I'd say anybody who persisted in doing something after they promised
not to would be running afoul of the "necessary public trust and confidence"
clause of the CISSP code of ethics?
