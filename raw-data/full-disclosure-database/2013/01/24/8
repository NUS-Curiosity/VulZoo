Subject: Re: Student expelled from Montreal college after
 finding vulnerability that compromised security of 250, 000

The real funny part is where 15 teachers voted .. you mean there are 15
teachers at Dawson that understand the implications of a pen test tool?
I am in Montreal and I know Dawson, they are usually much saner than that!

Let's see if they now have the guts to do a Mea Culpa and fix this
injustice.
