I've seen reference to a few more details on this - namely:

1) The kid, as part of his major, signed an ethics document.
2) He was either told or agreed to not run the scanner again.
3) He did so anyhow.

and that he didn't get kicked out because he ran the scanner, but
because he did so *in violation of the ethics standard*.

I'll probably have to go back and find references for all that - but
even without that, it's something to think about.  If somebody
agrees not to do something, and then does it anyhow, is he *trustworthy*
enough for a degree in that field?
