View online: http://drupal.org/node/1896782

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-010
  * Project: Search API sorts [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-23
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to sort by Search API facets.

The module doesn't sufficiently filter user entered text in field labels.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the ability to modify field labels such as "administer taxonomy".


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Search API Sorts 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Search API
sorts [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Search API Sorts module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Search
    API Sorts 7.x-1.4 [5]

Also see the Search API sorts [6] project page.
