Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-006 - Video -
	Arbitrary Code	Execution

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1896714

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-006
  * Project: Video [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-23
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Arbitrary PHP code execution

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The video module enables you to upload video and audio files and transcode
them into other formats and sizes using other tools like FFmpeg or Zencoder.

The module saves information about the FFmpeg executable in a temporary PHP
file, but doesn't check if the file has been tampered with when reading the
file, allowing any PHP code in that file to be executed.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have write
access to the temporary PHP file (something which is not known to be possible
via the module itself). Sites not using the FFmpeg transcoder are only
vulnerable if the attacker has the 'administer site configuration' permission
in order to change the transcoder to FFmpeg.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
