	Relationships - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1896720

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-007
  * Project: User Relationships [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-23
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The User Relationships module allows you to create multiple relationship
types and maintain relationships between users in your Drupal site.

The module does not sufficiently escape relationship names before display.
This allows users with the correct permissions to create relationship names
containing arbitrary Javascript which will then be executed by the browser.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer user relationships".


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

---------------------------------------------------

  * User Relationships 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.4
