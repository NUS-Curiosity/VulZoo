First of all I am impressed that you MustLive have studied this issue so much and given valuable information to this mailing list. Thank you. I'll bet you can give lot to the community if you start to find vulnerabilities from important software and don't waste time to non-issues (not saying that you haven't done this already in some level).

Could you give me references where WordPress developers enabled XML-RPC again? In my opinion this is not wise decision. The interface should have at least some kind of ACL enabled. I have no idea what is now allowed or is there possibility to configure the interface. Last time I tested this interface it did need authentication to do some of the tasks. I did not check all of them.
