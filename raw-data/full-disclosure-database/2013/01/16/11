Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-003 - RESTful Web
	Services - Cross	site request forgery (CSRF)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1890222

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-003
  * Project: RESTful Web Services [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-16
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to expose Drupal entities as RESTful web services. It
provides a machine-readable interface to exchange resources in JSON, XML and
RDF.

The module doesn't sufficiently verify POST requests thereby exposing a Cross
Site Request Forgery vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must trick an
authenticated user onto a prepared page that leverages a weakness in certain
browser plugins.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * RESTWS 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.
  * RESTWS 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.0-alpha4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed RESTful Web
Services [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the RESTWS 1.x module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to RESTWS 7.x-1.2
    [5]
  * If you use the RESTWS 2.x module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to RESTWS
    7.x-2.0-alpha4 [6]
