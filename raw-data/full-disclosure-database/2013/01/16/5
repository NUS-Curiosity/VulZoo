Its not so much Draconian laws as it is greedy politicians who take
bribes from corporate america to grow their wealth, and then spend the
rest of their careers performing fellatio on industry and their
special interests (just an observation :).

Its legal in the US, too. Dr. Jon Callas (one of PGP's co-founders)
was fortunate (persistent?) enough to have the provisions added to
DMCA (PUBLIC LAW 105â€“304). It has exceptions for reverse engineering
and security testing and evaluation. The RE exemption is in Section
1205 (f) REVERSE ENGINEERING. The ST&E exemption is in Section 1205
(i) SECURITY TESTING.
