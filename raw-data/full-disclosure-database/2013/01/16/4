I'm happy to reside outside of the US...

That means, all these activities should not be performed in the US
(and other countries with similar Draconian laws)...

In general, this problem may be solved using the international division
of labour, when people do only what is legal in their country. Example:
reverse engineering is legal in Russia (unless it is used to create the
competing product), so I can perform it and share the results. Someone
else may then find suspicious code, other people may prove that code is
vulnerable by writing an exploit... In this case, everyone performs in
legal manner - except, obviously, the script kiddies who will use the
ready tool to break something.

I'd simply not bother at all, as releasing materials to public domain
is the best protection against both plagiarism and "piracy".
