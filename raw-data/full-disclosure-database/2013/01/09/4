Subject: Nokiaâ€™s MITM on HTTPS traffic from their phone

http://gaurangkp.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/nokia-https-mitm/
Conclusion
>>From the tests that were preformed, it is evident that Nokia is 
performing Man In The Middle Attack for sensitive HTTPS traffic 
originated from their phone and hence they do have access to clear text 
information which could include user credentials to various sites such 
as social networking, banking, credit card information or anything that 
is sensitive in nature. In short, be it HTTP or HTTPS site when browsed through the phone in 
subject, Nokia has complete information unencrypted (in clear text 
format) available to them for them to use or abuse.
