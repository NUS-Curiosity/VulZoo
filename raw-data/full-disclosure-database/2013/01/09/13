Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in TinyBrowser

Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in TinyBrowser for
TinyMCE. These are new vulnerabilities in addition to my 2009 and 2011
advisories about Arbitrary File Upload and Code Execution vulnerabilities in
TinyBrowser. It concerns as TinyBrowser, as all web applications which have
TinyBrowser in core or as third-party plugins for them.

These are Information Leakage, Full path disclosure and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are old versions of TinyBrowser (such as 1.33 and previous
versions). Last versions are not affected - in TinyBrowser 1.42 these
vulnerabilities are already fixed.

In tinybrowser.php and edit.php FPD is shown, if there is no upload
directory.
