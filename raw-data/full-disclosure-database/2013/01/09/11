Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-001 - Search API
	- Cross Site	Scripting

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1884332

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-001
  * Project: Search API [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-January-09
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to build searches using a wide range of features,
data sources and backends.

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user input when displaying errors in
a view with certain backends, including the database backend. This enables
attackers to create a Reflected Cross Site Scripting attack by manipulating
the URL.
This is mitigated by the fact that the vulnerability only occurs with some
backends (the Solr backend, e.g., is safe) and for certain common
configurations of facets.
The module also doesn't sufficiently sanitize output field names in the admin
view.
This is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would have to have the
necessary permissions to change the field names of an indexed entity type.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
