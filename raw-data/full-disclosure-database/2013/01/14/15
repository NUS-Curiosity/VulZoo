True however his family think it was enogth of an issue to point it out
in their official statement
"Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a
criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial
overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S.
Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death." (see
http://www.rememberaaronsw.com/, the section titled "Official statement
from family and partner of Aaron Swartz")
