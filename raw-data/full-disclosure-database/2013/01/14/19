Yes, but the spam companies at least filed under their own name.  Running
a lawsuit with a John Doe plaintiff is a little bit harder, and requires
finding a cooperative lawyer and judge.

The really hard part is proving that you're the rightful owner of the
copyright while remaining anonymous (in particular, proving you're the
*same* anonymous person who wrote the code).  At this point, it helps if
you posted the item in question signed with a pseudonymous PGP key that
you control, or have other ways to prove that your anonymous is the author's
anonymous.
