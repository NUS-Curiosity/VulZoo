CA20121018-01: Security Notice for CA ARCserve Backup

Issued: October 18, 2012
Updated: January 2, 2012

CA Technologies support is alerting customers to multiple risks with
certain CA ARCserve Backup RPC services. Two vulnerabilities exist
that can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause
a denial of service condition.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2012-2971, occurs due to a flaw with how
RPC requests are processed. An attacker can potentially execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on server installations.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2012-2972, occurs due to insufficient
validation of certain RPC requests and exploitation can result in a
service crash. This vulnerability affects both server and agent
installations.
