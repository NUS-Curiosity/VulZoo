Actually, claimed or not, if the exploit was coded in a Berne signatory
country, it's almost always automatically copyrighted at creation (most likely
to the coder, or to their employer if it was a work-for-hire).  In the US,
there's a exemption for work product of federal employees - that's one of
the few ways for US-produced material to become public domain (expiration of
term is the other one, but with ever-increasing copyright terms, it's unclear
that anything will ever actually expire in the US).

More interesting is the question of how to enforce a copyright claim
while remaining anonymous...
