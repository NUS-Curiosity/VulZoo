Perhaps. In the absence of a note, all we have to go on is the family
and girlfriends experience with his personality: "On Saturday, his
family and girlfriend called his death "the product of a criminal
justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach" and
blamed decisions by the Massachusetts U.S. attorney's office and MIT
for contributing to his death."
