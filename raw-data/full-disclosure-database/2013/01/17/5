Subject: Are software cracks also a form of security
	vulnerabilities?

Hello,

First of all, the question is in the subject. Should say enough.

In my opinion they are, since a software crack allows unauthorized use of software and the exposure of (possible) trade secrets, but I want to know how other people think about this. Also, by cracking software packages, other issues pop up quite often - quite a lot of applications aren't tamper-proof. But does "not tamper-proof" mean that the software is flawed? 

Since we're moving to a smartphone/app-centric world, application security (and especially mobile application security) is an important topic, since many developers think that a walled garden is safe. It's not because you can't get out, that others can't get in.
