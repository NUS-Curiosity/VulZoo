Subject: How to prevent HTTPS MitM

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

If this message is offtopic, please excuse me.

I was reading about Nokia HTTPS MitM. Many corporate firewall can MitM HTTPS
for content inspection and many governments do this for their reasons.

I was thinking: could it be possible to create a fake HTTPS stream to DoS the
MitM attempt?






Ciao,
