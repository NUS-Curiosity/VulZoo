Subject: TomatoCart 1.x | Unrestricted File Creation

1. OVERVIEW

TomatoCart 1.x versions are vulnerable to Unrestricted File Creation.


2. BACKGROUND

TomatoCart is an innovative Open Source shopping cart solution
developed by Wuxi Elootec Technology Co., Ltd. It is forked from
osCommerce 3 as a separate project and is released under the GNU
General Public License V2. Equipped with the web2.0 Technology Ajax
and Rich Internet applications (RIAs), TomatoCart Team is devoted to
building a landmark eCommerce solution.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

TomatoCart 1.x versions contain a flaw related to the /admin/json.php
script's failure to properly restrict created files. This may allow an
attacker to create arbitrary shell script to launch further attacks on
the application server.
