Subject: Re: [0 Day] XSS Persistent in Blogspot of Google

I know JZ, but this vulnerability is in the post and no in the template.
And this could be generated by blogger and affect to administrator!
The blogger can edit, but haven't admin. If the blogger post some script,
this affect to administrator.
