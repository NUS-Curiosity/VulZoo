Does anyone know if it has it been definitely determined if JRE6 is vulnerable to this? There were some conflicting reports at the time of 0-day news hit the net.
Thanks!

Hello All,

This post might be interesting for those concerned about the
state of Oracle's Java SE security.

We have successfully confirmed that a complete Java security
sandbox bypass can be still gained under the recent version
of Java 7 Update 11 [1] (JRE version 1.7.0_11-b21).

MBeanInstantiator bug (or rather a lack of a fix for it [2][3])
turned out to be quite inspirational for us. However, instead
of relying on this particular bug, we have decided to dig our
own issues. As a result, two new security vulnerabilities (51
and 52) were spotted in a recent version of Java SE 7 code and
they were reported to Oracle today [4] (along with a working
Proof of Concept code).

Thank you.

Best Regards
Adam Gowdiak
