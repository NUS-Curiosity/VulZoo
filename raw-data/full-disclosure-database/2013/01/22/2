 finding vulnerability that compromised security of 250, 000

And that is the reason why no one wants to report anything they find,
it's because of people like you and your kind of thinking.

Did they public post all the private information?
No

Did they try to use it for malious or illicit purposes?
No

Did they report it when they found it?
Yes

A horrible moral compass indeed! Arrest these people for being
concerned and reporting it after stumbling upon security flaws!
Amiright?
