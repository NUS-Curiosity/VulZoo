Verisign's WHOIS server performs a prefix match.  To restrict to
actual domain names, use "domain EXAMPLE.COM" as the query string.
The server's help message explains it quite well, but few WHOIS client
authors know about this.  (Just like you have to use "701" instead of
"AS701" to query for AS numbers on ARIN's WHOIS server.)
