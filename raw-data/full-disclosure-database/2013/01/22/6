Which may well put you on very thin legal ice.

According to at least one legal ruling in Germany, it is "hacking" (as 
in the negative, illegal kind) to deliberately try to access upper-
level directories of _published_ URLs _if_ the specific URLs to those 
resources have not also been made publicly available, _despite_ that 
they are necessarily discernible from the published URL.  Silly as that 
may seem, I'm pretty sure that tweaking tokens in cookie values and the 
like would be equally, if not more, egregious "hacking" in front of 
that court.

Indeed, we do not know, but as there is no suggestion that anything 
further was done with whatever records were "illicitly" accessed, I 
suspect that nothing is what was done with that data (and it seems 
likely the heavy-handed legalistic mouthings of the vendor spokespeople 
would have touched on this if they had any inkling or evidence that 
such had happened).

Sadly, you cannot protect it when it is already in other's hands...

It seems that, in general, once you've _en_trusted such data to others 
our (current) legal system is of the opinion that you have accepted 
that you _trust_ their ability to maintain its confidentiality, etc.

This is not good, but it's also very difficult to see how an individual 
can really do much _useful_ about that either.

A lot of our "technological advances" have come at the cost of a loss 
of lot of control of confidentiality of information.  This is a trade-
off that many have probably made without even realizing it, and 
certainly without realizing the _scale_ of it.

I'm sorry, for you, to hear this.

In my previous message I did not address the responsibilities -- nor 
their common, commonly egregious and often entirely predictable failing 
of such -- of those holding personal, confidential, etc data.

I think my opinion of that part of the industry, in general, is pretty 
obvious though, from this and many other messages I have posted to 
public lists like this...

Sadly, as I said above, our legal (and perhaps societal) mechanisms 
have not yet caught up with the implications of our recent (last ~70 
years) technological progress in the areas of data processing, 
retention, sharing and mining.  I suspect though, that on balance, it 
is probably better that such legalistic and societal changes lag such 
technological advances, but I also suspect we are getting to the point 
where that gap may be too large and too much power (or too little real 
responsibility) will end up in the hands of those who clearly should 
not only be doing more, but should be expected and required to do more.

Nick FitzGerald
