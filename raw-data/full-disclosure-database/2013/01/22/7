Sanguinarious Rose to me:

As you seem to have assumed a whole bunch about "my kind of thinking" 
that I did not put in the original post, I find the above laughable.

> Did they public post all the private information?
> No

Agreed.

> Did they try to use it for malious or illicit purposes?
> No

Not that we know from what seems to be a rather one-sided, self-serving 
to the victim, "the system screwed poor little me" telling of the 
story.

> Did they report it when they found it?
> Yes

Agreed.

> A horrible moral compass indeed!  ...

No -- I said nothing about what could or should be considered about 
their moral compass _in finding_ the problem.  I did say they probably 
broke _both_ school/other ToS agreements and unauthorized access laws, 
but I did not say what I felt about that.

It is often the case that minor transgressions of such nature are 
necessary in doing many useful things in the computer security domain.  
That alone makes it precarious territory in which to work and such 
issues should obviously be front-of-mind for _anyone_ potentially in 
such territory.

No, I did not say that either.

What you seem to have missed (other than that you are reading things 
into my previous post that are not there) was that _after_ these two 
students notified the relevant system owners/operators and/or vendors, 
apparently only _one_ of them went back and did stuff that he probably 
should not have originally done (but that we can _probably_ excuse 
because of a "greater good"), _again_.

_That_ is what tells us something critical about _his_ moral compass 
(either he does not have one, it is rather under-developed for a 20-
year old or it is rather broken).

Did you notice that this story was not titled "Youths expelled..." "or 
"Students expelled..." _despite_ the first sentence of any substance in 
the National Post article starting:

   Ahmed Al-Khabaz ... was working on a mobile app ... when he and a
   colleague discovered what he describes as "sloppy coding" in ...

Did you notice how the rest of story fails to mention that his 
colleague was expelled?

Poor journalism, missing a fairly major fact in the story?

Or perhaps evidence that his "colleague" was not expelled because his 
colleague did not continue to mess with stuff that he should have (now) 
known he should not be messing with?

If _both_ students had been expelled, surely the tone of indignation 
and righteousness would have been greater, so I doubt the fact that the 
article only talks of one student being expelled is due to journalistic 
oversight...

So, Mr Rose, do you now see what you chose to avoid noticing on your 
first pass through this story and its "clever hacker cruelly 
ostracized" skew?
