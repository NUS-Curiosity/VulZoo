From a European point of view, I see more a young guy thinking
he was doing the right thing, then making sure the flaw's
fixed.

There are some strange things:

he retries and *minutes* after that the phone's ringing - from 
what I know of Canada's system, only 24/7 official eavesdropping
could lead to such a short delay (but even in his case more than
minutes). and I don't really think the college nor skytech had
triggered such an _official_ survey (otherwise authorities would
have call, not the skytech CEO).

It looks like more a foreseeable behavior exploited to build a
setup to push him signing the NDA.

So I think he was rather na√Øve than a moron.

Rise and shine, this completely justify the existence
of this wonderful mailing list ;)
