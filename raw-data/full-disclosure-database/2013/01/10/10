Subject: how to sell and get a fair price


List,
Here is the link to Information Security Magazine issue with "Market for vulnerability information grows - Cashing on Zero-day exploits" for your information.
I once shared my idea that ZDI is not right way to go. It should be a market place (web portal) for selling vulnerabilities based on action price. Like eBay. That would be the place to get fair price for your hard work and skills. I would like to see HP and MS betting on 0-days. After all,a  vulnerability and an exploit are intellectual products. Not sure copyright could be claimed, but why not?
