Subject: Re: [0 Day] XSS Persistent in Blogspot of Google

Agree with Michal,

at the end you achieve code execution with an XSS as well, it's just in
the DOM.
Depending on the attack surface, browser type and so on, this can be
devastating.

I bet you remember the XSS on Amazon EC2 web interface, which combined
with XSRF lead to stealing x.509 certificates and so on :D

Cheers
