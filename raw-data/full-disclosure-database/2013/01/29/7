Subject: Re: [0 Day] XSS Persistent in Blogspot of Google

Hello,

Agree with Michal. It is very interesting to get to know know new
complex xss vulnerabilities.

IMAHO, the issue here is claiming to have found a vulnerability
without providing a PoC of how to use it to violate a security policy
of the targeted service, probably because there are none, and
therefore it's not a vulnerability but a feature.

Regards,
Guifre.
