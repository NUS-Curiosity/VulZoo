Subject: Re: how to sell and get a fair price

Hey Mikhail,

Nice idea! Although it does not fit very well with "Information must be
free" principle I feel we all love and care about.

That aside, there are a few key stones missing in your arc, namely --
quality and trust. Nobody wants to pay for crap, you know, and right now I
just don't see how this trust and quality level could be established in
your project. I wouldn't pay j0nnyh4x0r for something I cannot read (and
allowing to read the info before buying just kills the whole point, isn't
it? Read-fix-release... no money spent), and for well-known and trustworthy
persons... why not just hire them and be happy?

So let's see how you would patch this vulnerability in your idea! ;-)

P.S. No offense intended.

Cheers,
Ź.
