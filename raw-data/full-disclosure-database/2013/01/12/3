Subject: Microsoft Lync Server 2010: Remote Code
	Execution/XSS - User Agent Header

Summary
=======
Microsoft Lync 2010 fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, which
can lead to remote code execution.

Microsoft was originally notified of this issue December 11, 2012.

The details of this issue were made public January 11, 2013.

CVE number: Not Assigned
Impact: Low
Vendor homepage: http://lync.microsoft.com/
Vendor notified: December 11, 2012
Vendor fixed: N/A

Affected Products
================
Confirmed in Microsoft Lync Server 2010, version 4.0.7577.0.  Other
versions may also be
affected.

Details
=======
Microsoft Lync 2010, version 4.0.7577.4087, fails to sanitize the
“User-Agent Header” for meet.domainame.com.

By inserting JavaScript into the aforementioned parameters and stacking
commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands in the context of the
application.

Impact
======
Malicious users could execute arbitrary applications on the client systems,
compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
on the client system.

Solution
========
The vendor should implement thorough input validation in order to remove
dangerous characters from user supplied data.  Additionally, the vendor
should implement thorough output encoding in order to display, and not
execute, dangerous characters within the browser.

Vendor Statement
==============
The vulnerability described in this report is a XSS vulnerability in the
User-Agent which requires an attacker to be in a man-in-the middle
situation in order to be able to modify the User-Agent.   In a default
configuration of Lync server, TLS encryption is used to protect against
this type of attack. Customers concerned about this issue should check
their environments to ensure that Lync is configured to use TLS to encrypt
all traffic, a default configuration.


Disclosure Timeline
==============
December 11, 2012: Disclosed to vendor (Microsoft Security Response Center).
December 18, 2012: Vendor’s initial response.
December 20, 2012: Vendor deemed issue a Low severity and confirmed issue
would be fixed in next product release.
December 27, 2012: Received vendor approval to disclose along with Vendor
Statement (see above).
