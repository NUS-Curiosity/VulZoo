------------------------------

This is a tragedy caused by the pressure from US authorities. Getting (or facing) the same imprisonment as a killer (I consider 50 years as the same as life in prison) is absolutely unfair. He paid ultimate price for what he believed in. There is no depression in such cases, it is pure pressure coming from the situation he got in and authorities handling the case. He should be respected for what he believed and what he paid for.
As my common sense tells me, copying articles is not stealing. 5,000,000 in MIT possession were very likely already published papers, thus, public domain. If I come in a library, take a book and copy it, there is no crime in such activity . I do not get a profit, and neither caused any damage to any person.
Unfortunately, US authorities like such high profile case very much. If persecuted, a person gets pretty tough imprisonment, and the guy who handled the case a few more "stars". Personal career advancement is the real reason of their efforts, not a protection of private property rights.
