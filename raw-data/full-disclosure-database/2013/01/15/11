As I said, it's doable, but *not* a slam dunk, and requires help from
both your lawyer and the judge.

If you publish an exploit as "BitWizard97", and somebody scarfs it up and
starts selling it, filing the suit to enjoin them from selling it without your
permission under a company name doesn't make it any easier to prove that you,
or the company, have any legal standing to represent BitWizard97.

It's especially problematic if the local law enforcement authorities want
to have a little chat with BitWizard97 regarding some other activities...
