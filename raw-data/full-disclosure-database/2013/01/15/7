That may be true -- I don't know...

...but that claim is not supported by your reference.

The Wikipedia article simply does not address whether the pseudonymous 
author's real identity was exposed in the legal preceedings or not.  
Note that the case was "Rice v Paladin Enterprises" and the legal claim 
was that Paladin (the _publishers_) aided and abetted a murder.

Presumably (again, IANAL) they could have brought a similar suit 
against the author, but saw the publisher as having deeper pockets (and 
perhaps reasonably assumed, or even knew, that the publisher would have 
extensive commercial insurance to cover any damages ruling they may 
receive if their case prevailed).
