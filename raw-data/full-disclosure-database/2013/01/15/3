I think its a slippery slope in the US.

On one hand, you have, for example, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
(FCAA), Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and Unlawful
Intercept. US corporations are rarely prosecuted under the law
(confer, Trustwave [1], Nokia [2]); but individuals are regularly
prosecuted (confer, Weev (et al) [3], Wise Guys [4], Dmitry Sklyarov
[5]).

I'm amazed at how federal law is 'opt-in' for US corporations, but
individuals such as Weev/Goatse and Sklyarov must endure politically
motivated judicial heavy handedness. In Goatse's case, they aggregated
public data (names and email addresses) from a public server offering
public services hanging off a public internet. In Sklyarov case, he
demonstrated flaws in Adobe's PDF DRM scheme. Note that for Sklyarov,
the DMCA (PUBLIC LAW 105â€“304) has exceptions for reverse engineering
and security testing and evaluation. The RE exemption is in Section
1205 (f) REVERSE ENGINEERING). The ST&E exemption is in Section 1205
(i) SECURITY TESTING.

If I had copyright over material used for security testing and
evaluations, I would probably assert my copyright. If I wrote malware,
I would likely want to stay anonymous (confer, David L. Smith and
Melissa macro-virus [6]).
