In general practice, where ever you would like to publish, the publisher will ask for copyright rights. Thus, a site publishing exploits can do the same and thus may protect rights of the author, well, together with its ones.
After all, my idea was about fare sale, and that could require release of rights to the mediator/auctioneer.
Somebody I would bet is having a fair thought "buddy, would you do your idea?" I need to say frankly that I do not plan. I'm stretched by my current www.201cmr1700ma.com<http://www.201cmr1700ma.com> and its very likely extension. But feeling unfairness, will be glad to support and devout some time.

Regards

Mikhail

Valdis, we've had spam companies suing blacklist/antispam companies before...
Surely an anonymous person legitimately and legally enforcing copyright can't be harder?

Actually, claimed or not, if the exploit was coded in a Berne signatory
country, it's almost always automatically copyrighted at creation (most likely
to the coder, or to their employer if it was a work-for-hire).  In the US,
there's a exemption for work product of federal employees - that's one of
the few ways for US-produced material to become public domain (expiration of
term is the other one, but with ever-increasing copyright terms, it's unclear
that anything will ever actually expire in the US).

More interesting is the question of how to enforce a copyright claim
while remaining anonymous...
