[Overview]
Want to learn the Hula while increasing your security skills?  Want to
attend a conference where 
you can grab a drink with some of the top security minds in the
industry?  Want to surf the
beautiful waters of the pacific in the morning and then drop some 0day
in the afternoon?  
Sitting around somewhere freezing your a$$ off?  Dreaming about warm
days, rainbows, decadent 
tropical drinks sipped out of coconuts? Sure you could drop your 0day in
Vegas, bring down the 
Internet in Germany, or satisfy your dark desires in Asia; however,
wouldn't you rather submit your 
research or topics to our CFP and maybe win yourself a paid trip to
Hawaii?  If the answer to any 
of the above is yes then we are your conference.

The Shakacon security conference is a laid back conference where
industry, government, academia 
and independent experts will get together to share knowledge and
experience in one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.  

Shakacon will offer local, national, and international participants a
casual, social, learning 
environment designed to present a "holistic" security view and the
opportunity to network with 
peers and fellow enthusiasts in a relaxed setting.  Leave your ego at
the airport (or shoreline 
if you come in via another method) as we look forward to attendees
varying in skill level from N00b 
to Ninja.
  
During the day, sessions will include: best practices, case studies,
research projects, etc. 
covering all different aspects of the information security landscape.
There will be something 
for everyone and if sitting through talks isn't your cup of kava, there
will be exciting events 
and contests for you to sharpen your skills and knowledge on.

You will not want to miss the closing ceremonies where we pour enough
alcohol that we convince some
interverted security geniuses to get up on stage and dance the Hula.

[Trainer Opportunities]
Don't want to speak at the Con but have an uncanny ability to teach and
a proven track record for 
delivering quality courseware and want to come to Hawaii? We're also
interested in bringing in trainers
to provide world class training leading up to Shakacon (June 25 and 26).
Submit a synopsis/class agenda, 
prior teaching experience, and maybe get selected to teach in Hawaii.
