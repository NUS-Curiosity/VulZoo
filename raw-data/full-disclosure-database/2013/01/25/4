I don't personally think a degree should or shouldn't be awarded because a
student has or has not met some kind of arbitrary moral standard. It should
assess their abilities in computer science, not that their ethics meet with
what the dominant powers in society currently deem to
be acceptable behaviour. In the future some of these people may be
remembered as freedom fighters - and our whole conception of what was
ethical action at that time may shift.
