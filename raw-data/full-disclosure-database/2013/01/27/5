Arbitrary moral compass? Amazing.

Please, explain the morals behind finding a bug, reporting it, getting a slap on the a wrist, and then running a vuln scanner against the site? If his true intent was to see if it was fixed, I would suggest that he checked it with the finesse, logic and precision that I would expect from a baby with a hammer.

Morals would tell you to ask, logic would tell you to ask, common sense would tell you to ask before the last step, especially after being told off and AGREEING to the colleges code of conduct aka morals. If he didn't agree with them he shouldn't have agreed to them.

'My banks interest rates seem immoral, I will only pay 6%'. Let me know how that logic works out for you.

Pretending that this guy is more than an idiot is astounding.

Do you want your university students to follow the law, or does the law not matter if the morals behind it are fine in someone's opinion?

'I robbed the bank and shot the guard, but don't worry it was to keep up on my mortgage payments to house my family'

Who uses Acunetix anyway?

As far as I can tell, this argument is now debating opinion which is inherently stupid. 

Sent from my lack of morals, and about 3 cans of taurine/caffeine

I thought university lecturers held positions due to their talents in their respective susbjects - not becuase of their ability to implement social policy?
