My point being, a degree in computer science should reflect the student's
ability in computer science - not compliance with some arbirary moral
compass dreamt up in a university board somewhere.

Who gave these university beaurocrats the power to exclude this young
person from the education system?  Why is their moral compass deemed to be
correct?  I thought university lecturers held positions due to their
talents in their respective susbjects - not becuase of their ability to
implement social policy?
