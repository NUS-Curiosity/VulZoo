Subject: FPD and Security bypass vulnerabilities in
	AntiVirus for WordPress

Hello list!

These are Full path disclosure and Security bypass vulnerabilities in 
AntiVirus for WordPress. This is security plugin for detecting exploits and 
backdoors in WordPress. Which failed to identify my Backdoored Web 
Application (BWA) - a reference test of backdoor scanners (released in 
December).

Last week I've published article "Backdoor scanners testing among plugins 
for WordPress" 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-May/008832.html). 
In which I described the results of the testing of multiple plugins-scanners 
for WordPress and described methods of bypassing all of these scanners.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

AntiVirus for WordPress 1.0 and previous versions.

Versions from 1.1 to 1.3.4 are still vulnerable to Security bypass, but Full 
path disclosure was fixed by removing uninstall.php in 1.1.

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

AntiVirus for WordPress
http://wpantivirus.com

----------
Details:
----------

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/antivirus/uninstall.php

Security bypass (WASC-31):

This security bypass allows to inject php backdoor into web site (for 
executing OS commands), which will not be identified by the plugin.

All details about detecting BWA by the plugin and methods of the bypass are 
described in my article.
