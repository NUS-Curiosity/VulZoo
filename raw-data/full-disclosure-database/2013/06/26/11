FWIW: *not* confirmed for :
64-bit Linux host = Debian Squeeze 6.0.7 amd64
32-bit Linux guest = Debian Squeeze 6.0.7 i386
VirtualBox = 4.1.26 (guest network adapter set to virtio for the test)

'$ tracepath 8.8.8.8' run in the guest works fine, and no unpleasant
effects are noticed on either host or guest.

I note that VirtualBox 4.1.26 (latest update to 4.1 series) was
released on the same day as 4.2.14 (latest update to 4.2 series) -
specifically 21st.June.2013 - which happens to be the same day you
reported the problem here after getting apparently zero response from
Oracle Support for 8 days.  Maybe they just silently fixed the bug
during those 8 days - in which case they should have had the manners
to let you know.
