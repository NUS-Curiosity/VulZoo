Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 June 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance is affected
by the following vulnerabilities:

  * Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability
  * IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability
  * Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability

Successful exploitation of the Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection
Vulnerability could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute
arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.
Successful exploitation of either of the two denial of service vulnerabilities
may cause several critical processes to become unresponsive and make the
affected system unstable.


Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available. This advisory is
available at the following link:
