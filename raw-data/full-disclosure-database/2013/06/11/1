Why is the Prims program such a big deal today?  Most of us  knew about
echellon and the patriot act didnt we? This program was unconstinutional at
the first place and should have raised indignation when it was approved at
that time...

Seems like some people spend way to much time focusing on the second
amendment rather than the first one...
