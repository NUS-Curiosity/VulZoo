WTF? Most Most Small- to Medium-Sized Businesses are not
security-minded enough (even if they had the financial means) to
secure their local networks properly, so keeping the data local makes
it readable not only to government agencies, but to anyone else who´s
willing to invest some time and trouble.
Local data is either a case of "hopefully I´m obscure enough to be
secure" or an attitude like "driving a car is safer than taking the
airplane because I´m doing the driving myself".#
