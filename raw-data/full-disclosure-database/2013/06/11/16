What? I am not from EEUU, so why should I be happy with this? I have my 
own constitution and it is been ignored and crushed be EEUU, Google, 
Yahoo, Microsoft, Dropbox, Amazon?, UK etc.

Their Naurs devices get my info even if I store my data in Germany (My 
link to Germany goes through EEUU). SSL is not the solution for every case.

I hope the people that adhere to this idea also adhere to the China 
spying network (and other around the world). Do not you? :)

Regards,
