Introduction:
=============
The one and only taxi review platform for Malaysia and South-East Asia is here, equipped with taxi booking feature! Ever been cheated 
by rigged taxis, rude taxi drivers making a pass at you, or denied a service simply because they don’t feel like it? Or have you ever met 
a wise taxi driver who speaks like Yoda, or had a good taxi ride experience? Share your taxi stories and woes with other taxi users, and 
let taxi drivers out there know that taxi users have a voice too.

Abstract:
=========
An independent vulnerability researcher (Ismail Kaleem) discovered a persistent web vulnerability in the TaxiMonger v2.6.2 mobile android v2.3.3 application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2013-06-15:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
TaxiMonger
Product: TaxiMonger App & Online Service 2.6.2 & 2.3.3 (Android)


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A persistent input validation web vulnerability is detected in the official Taxi Monger v2.6.2 Android (v2.3.3) Mobile Application (Google - PlayStore).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious persistent (application-side) script codes to compromise the android application or device.

The persistent input validation web vulnerability is located in the username input field when processing to inject malicious script codes as name.
Attackers can inject own malicious script codes to execute the context persistent from the index listing. To inject the script code the remote attacker 
do not need to bypass the basic validation of the application for successful exploitation.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a low privilege application user account. Successful exploitation of the 
persistent input validation web vulnerability results in persistent session hijacking, persistent web phishing, persistent external redirects or persistent 
module context manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Registration

Vulnerable Input Fields(s):
				[+] Username

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] name (context)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index and Profile Listing


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent script coe injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low user interaction and low privilege 
application user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

XSS (JS) PoC:

<Script Language='Javascript'>
<!--
document.write(unescape('%3C%69%6D%61%67%65%20%73%72%63%3D%68%74%74%70%3A%2F%2F%76%75%6C%6E%2D%6C%61%62
%2E%63%6F%6D%20%6F%6E%65%72%72%6F%72%3D%61%6C%65%72%74%28%27%69%73%6D%61%69%6C%6B%61%6C%65%65%6D%27%29%20%2F%3E'));
//-->
</Script>


Solution:
=========
Restrict the username and name input field and parse the input with a secure encoding or filter.
Encode and parse the output listing and profile site to prevent persistent script code executions from the main application module.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium(+)|(-)high.
