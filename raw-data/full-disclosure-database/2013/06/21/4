Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - June meet - Lightning
 Talks!!! - Tuesday 25th June 2013

If you have prepared a Lightning Talk already, thanks we are looking
forward to seeing you!

Otherwise, you've got one last weekend ahead of you to dig out that
project you *know* you've been dying to talk about but haven't quite
got the rough edges off...

This month we're doing our annual lightning talk session, and we
welcome any and all 15 minute submissions. (Can be shorter if you
prefer.) In fact, don't bother submitting them, just come along and
give us what you've got!

There will be prizes! Probably hacking related, who knows? And some
stickers, obviously. And maybe a hard-to-get t-shirt or two...


If you want to display slides from your MacBook or Netbook please note
that the projector only has a VGA connection.
