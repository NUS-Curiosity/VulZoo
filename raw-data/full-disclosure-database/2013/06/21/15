What does 'uname -r' on the host return?

This is almost certainly a bug in either the host network stack or the
VirtualBox modules (probably one of the vboxnet ones).

Also, if you can manage to capture the output of 'sysrq-T' or 'echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger'
(unfortunately, netconsole will probably *not* be an option here),
so we can see where teh various kernel threads are locked up.

Do you have the stack traceback that should have come out with the BUG message?
