 of Integrity



"Case in point: Google don't even offer support for S/MIME in GMail and
it's probably the most widely used online email service available
today." 

You mean like using GMail via Webmail (without PGP)? Which security
professional would do this? Do you still use Telnet to manage your
devices instead of SSH?
