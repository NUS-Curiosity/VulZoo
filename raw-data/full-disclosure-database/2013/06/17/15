Subject: Re: Microsoft Outlook Vulnerability: S/MIME Loss
	of Integrity

Completely agree with your sentiments here, Valdis.

The error messages given to everyday users are completely ridiculous in
most cases. I feel though with the padlocks and green bars in browsers
nowadays, there has at least been some effort made to make security
understandable for the average user out there. But you're right in saying
so much more is needed/could be done.

What bewilders me in 2013 is that email has been completely left behind. As
if to say "everyone accepts it as insecure so we just wont worry about it".
But if you don't work in IT, lets be honest, most people out there do
actually believe email is secure and don't think twice about it. If
encryption and trust are so part and parcel on the web, why has email been
so left in the dark?

Case in point: Google don't even offer support for S/MIME in GMail and it's
probably the most widely used online email service available today.
