I have found Open URL Redirection Vulnerabilities in facebook's
dialogs such as"Option Dialog","Friends Dialog","OAuth Dialog".This
Vulnerability is exploitable to all users who are signed into
facebook.

Impact of Vulnerability:
1. The user may be redirected to an untrusted page that contains
malware which may then compromise the user's machine.

2. The user may be subjected to phishing attacks by being redirected
to an untrusted page.

3. This bug can be applicable to any user who are signed in which
works at any browsers with any version.

Vulnerable Dialogs:
Option Dialog  :    (/dialog/optin)
OAuth Dialog   :  (/dialog/oauth)
Friends Dialog : (/dialog/friends)
