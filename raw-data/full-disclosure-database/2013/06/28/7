Subject: DAVOSET v.1.0.8

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. On Friday, 28.06.2013, DAVOSET
v.1.0.8 was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.0.8:

Use, don't abuse.

Among other improvements in new version, in 1.0.8 there was added support of
POST requests. So now you can use Abuse of Functionality vulnerabilities at
web sites which require POST. Also there was added new service into both
lists of zombies (exactly for POST requests). With adding of support of POST
requests to vulnerable sites, also the format of the file with list of
zombie-servers was changed. New format of the file is backward-compatible
with previous format.

Best wishes & regards,
