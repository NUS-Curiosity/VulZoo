Product Information:

"Backup" and "spritebud" are a setting and application backup/restore
system written by Sprite Software and deployed on LG Android smartphones.
"Backup" is the end user front end app, and "spritebud" is the service that
preforms the backup and restore functions.


Details:

The "spritebud" daemon is started by the init scripts and runs as the root
user. Listening on a unix socket, the daemon accepts instructions from the
"Backup" app. Using a crafted backup, we can write to, change permission
and change ownership of any file, being that "spritebud" is running under
the root user.


The crafted backup contains restore data for our exploiting application,
"com.cunninglogic.lgpwn". The data includes a 50mb dummy file (a) used to
increase our exploit window, su binary (b), a script (c) to install su, and
a text file (d) containing the path to our script. All files are owned by
the application, and are world write/read/execute. All files are restored
in alphabetical order. The entire backup, after compress, is approximately
2mb. The structure of this backup is as follows:


drwxrwxrwx u0_a114  u0_a114           2013-05-28 20:13 files


./files:
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114  52428800 2013-05-22 20:06 a
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114     91992 2013-05-22 20:07 b
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114       251 2013-05-22 20:12 c
- -rwxr-xr-x u0_a114  u0_a114        42 2013-05-22 20:07 d


Prior to restoration, our exploit app runs, watches the process and waits.
During restoration, the spritebud daemon first creates the files directory,
then sets it's permission and owner. Next it decompresses and restores the
"a" file, our 50mb dummy files. During the restoration of "a", our exploit
application has time to symlink "d", our text file containing the full path
to our script (c), to /sys/kernel/uevent_helper. Upon restoration of file
"d", our path is written to uevent_helper. When a hotplug even occurs
(which occur every few seconds), the path contained in uevent_helper is
execute by the kernel and our script (c) is executed and installs the su
binary (b).
