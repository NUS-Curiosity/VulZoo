Subject: SolusVM WHMCS module privilege escalation,
	also libcurl vuln?

Ran across a new post on a blog I frequently visit: 
http://localhost.re/p/solusvm-whmcs-module-316-vulnerability

It describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in the WHMCS module 
for SolusVM that basically lets you do anything, but if I'm reading it 
correctly, it appears to be a result of a vulnerability - or at the 
very least weakness - in the implementation of libcurl; in particular, 
weak randomness in generating the form boundary.

Thoughts?

Note: I'm not the author of this exploit (it's actually quite a bit 
beyond my capabilities), I just ran across it and decided to post here 
since it doesn't seem to be discussed anywhere. Just to avoid people 
making incorrect assumptions... again :)
