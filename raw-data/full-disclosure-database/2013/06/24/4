Subject: Re: SolusVM WHMCS module privilege escalation,
 also libcurl vuln?

Why, hello there.

weakness - in the implementation of libcurl; in particular, weak randomness
in generating the form boundary.

Is the boundary value generation required to be cryptographically strong?
It does not come as a requirement as far as I know.

The application itself has to perform proper input sanitation on ALL of its
inputs coming from outside. For some reason, it is always libraries that
are blamed for application flaws.
