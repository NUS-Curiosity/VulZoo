Subject: [CVE-2013-1768] Apache OpenJPA security
	vulnerability


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
 
CVE-2013-1768: Apache OpenJPA security vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

OpenJPA 1.0.0 to 1.0.4
OpenJPA 1.1.0
OpenJPA 1.3.0
OpenJPA 1.2.0 to 1.2.2
OpenJPA 2.0.0 to 2.0.1
OpenJPA 2.1.0 to 2.1.1
OpenJPA 2.2.0 to 2.2.1

Description: Deserialization of a maliciously crafted OpenJPA object can
result in an executable file being written to the file system. An
attacker needs to discover an unprotected server program to exploit the
vulnerability.  It then needs to exploit another unprotected server
program to execute the file and gain access to the system.  OpenJPA
usage by itself does not introduce the vulnerability.

Mitigation: Users of OpenJPA using a release based upon the JPA 1.0
specification level should upgrade to the OpenJPA 1.2.3 release.  Users
of OpenJPA using a release based upon the JPA 2.0 specification level
should upgrade to the OpenJPA 2.2.2 release.  Users needing to stay on
their current release should get the latest code from svn for the
corresponding branch level or apply a source patch and build a new
binary package.  Nightly snapshots of the latest source builds are also
available for many branches.

OpenJPA release branch levels and corresponding fix revisions:

OpenJPA 1.0.x revision 1462558:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462558
OpenJPA 1.1.x revision 1462512:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462512
OpenJPA 1.2.x revision 1462488:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462488
OpenJPA 1.3.x revision 1462328:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462328
OpenJPA 2.0.x revision 1462318:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462318
OpenJPA 2.1.x revision 1462268:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462268
OpenJPA 2.2.1.x revision 1462225:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462225
OpenJPA 2.2.x revision 1462076:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1462076

Example: An attacker creates a customized serialization of an OpenJPA
object.  The attacker exploits an unprotected server program to execute
the object.  The object includes logic that results in malicious trace
being written to a file, such as a JSP.  The file containing malicious
commands is written to a potentially vulnerable area of the system.  The
attacker exploits a second unprotected server program to execute the
file and gain access to the system.
