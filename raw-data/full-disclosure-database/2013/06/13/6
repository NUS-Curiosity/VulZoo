Subject: Yet another (unpaid and unfixed) Paypal XSS

Hi People

Found a XSS on german Paypal website last week and reported it exactly 7
days ago.
Their response was one we very well know
Another researcher already discovered the bug.

So, someone else found the Vulnerability before me and reported it.
Fine, looks like I was too slow. I can live with that.

Now, i received an answer exactly 7 Days ago. That means they had more than
a week to fix this

alert('XSS') || "

All they'd have to do is escape quotation marks or remove them since
they're not used anyways.
The Approximate time that takes is ~15 Seconds.

I am amazed by how long it takes some huge companys to close holes in their
websites
