Subject: CFP Extended - OWASP InfoSec India Conference 2013

Good News for information security experts who couldn't yet submit
their papers for "OWASP InfoSec India Conference 2013" happening at
Hotel Crowne Plaza, Gurgaon, New Delhi NCR, India from August 30-31,
2013.

With few great papers submitted already, we would like to take this
opportunity to extend the CFP submission dates to 10 more days in
order to allow maximum participation.

CFP is now closing on June 25th, 2013, more details can be found at:
http://2013.owasp.in/category/cfp/

Don't miss out the opportunity to present your paper to a vibrant
information security community of CIOs, CISOs, investigators, policy
makers, INTs, defense, CERTs in the cyber city and national capital
region of India.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv Soi
Chair - OWASP India
