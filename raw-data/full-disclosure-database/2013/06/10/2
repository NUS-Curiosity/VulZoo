Immunity is excited to announce our fourth annual Hack Cup this year in
Las Vegas! As always, it will be held the day after BlackHat  (August
2nd).

Anyone interested in playing indoor soccer is welcome to join!
The rules will be the same as previous years:

 o The tournament will go from 9:00-13:00.

 o We will have 12 teams of five players each, playing 15-minute matches
in four different groups. We recommend that you have up to 3
substitutes as it's a very fast field and you may have had a few beers
the night before. Last year, several teams absorbed people who came
without a team, so if you don't know five other soccer players, all is
not lost. You'll make new friends!

Brazil won last year cup... Will this be the Argentinian year? or with
the Champion League triumph, Germany will finally put together a team?

We just opened the team subscription page which can be found here:

Keep in mind that there are only 12 spots and it's first come, first
serve!

Thanks,
Team Hack Cup!
PS: And don't forget, if you dont have a team, just sign-up by
yourself and we will find you one.
