Subject: Re: Botnet using Plesk vulnerability and takedown

my action supposed to be a counter-measure agains bad guys who could  
register that domain and host some bad code there. you know that kind of  
social engineering, right?
- post some fake or real advisory on popular security forum/maillist
- give a link to the "patch"
- ????
- get a lot of roots
i think it will be better to have that link offline - some guys will  
blindly run your code, then they will find out that it doesn't work and  
they will get enlightened by reading the code and realizing that they must  
change the link themselves.
