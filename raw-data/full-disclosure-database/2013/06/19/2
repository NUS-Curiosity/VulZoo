Subject: User Credentials Leakage in Panda Cloud Office
	Protection

Dear List,

More than a year ago I identified a pretty serious bug in the deployment
system of Panda Cloud Office Protection. The bug seems to be fixed since
version 6 (I didn't assess the new implementation thoroughly), but I am
unaware of any official notices about it from the vendor although
management passwords may still be recovered from leftover installers, so I
think it worth to publish the info here:
