 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:178
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nfs-utils
 Date    : June 25, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated nfs-utils packages fix security vulnerability
 
 It was reported that rpc.gssd in nfs-utils is vulnerable to
 DNS spoofing due to it depending on PTR resolution for GSSAPI
 authentication. Because of this, if a user where able to poison DNS to
 a victim&#039;s computer, they would be able to trick rpc.gssd into talking
 to another server (perhaps with less security) than the intended server
 (with stricter security). If the victim has write access to the second
 (less secure) server, and the attacker has read access (when they
 normally might not on the secure server), the victim could write files
 to that server, which the attacker could obtain (when normally they
 would not be able to). To the victim this is transparent because the
 victim&#039;s computer asks the KDC for a ticket to the second server due to
 reverse DNS resolution; in this case Krb5 authentication does not fail
 because the victim is talking to the correct server (CVE-2013-1923).
