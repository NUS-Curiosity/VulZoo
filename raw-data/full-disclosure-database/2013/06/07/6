Subject: DEFCON London - DC4420 - June CFP - Lightning
 talks!!! - Tuesday 25th June 2013

OK, you've got the whole weekend ahead of you to dig out that project 
you *know* you've been dying to talk about but haven't quite got the 
rough edges off...

This month we're doing our annual lightning talk session, and we welcome 
any and all 15 minute submissions. In fact, don't bother submitting 
them, just come along and give us what you've got!

There will be prizes! Probably hacking related, who knows? And some 
stickers, obviously. And maybe a hard-to-get t-shirt or two...

Meet is on Tuesday 25th June in the usual place at the usual time...

Details here:

Don't let us down!

cheers,
MM
