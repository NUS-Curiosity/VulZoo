Subject: DAVOSET v.1.0.7

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. On Friday, 21.06.2013, DAVOSET
v.1.0.7 was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.0.7:

Use, don't abuse.

Among other improvements in new version, in 1.0.7 there were removed
non-working URLs of services from both zombies lists and added new
vulnerable services. The total number of zombies URLs was left the same: 20
and 30 in two lists.

In particular, I've removed Babelfish from the lists, since Yahoo closed it
already in 2012. Instead of fixing Cross-Site Scripting, Abuse of
Functionality and Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerabilities in their
Babelfish service, about which I've informed them already in 2009, they
first ignored these holes and after three years completely closed the
service. This is fate of all holed web sites. But there are a lot of other
vulnerable sites, so the lists will be updating.

Best wishes & regards,
