There actually are other EU countries as well, with high standards, do
your homework, and I'm not your educator

I am Australian, and I am fully aware of the eyes of 5, however, my
statement stands, the protections in this country far far far exceed
that of what your country does, and it likely wont be directly to ASIO,
it would be more like ASD, and inside this country they can NOT just spy
on data for the fucking sake of it like your country does, I am aware
that NSA would pass certain information they illegally (by AU standards)
accessed and passed onto ASD or the like,  however, if AU data stayed
within AU, there is no chance in fuck your out of control govt can
access it to pass onto our spies, nor any way our spies can locally
access that data without a court order, something the NSA is apparently
even required to get to spy on its citizens (but does not need to spy of
non US citizens - which is where the outcry is), but clearly doesn't
from all the CNN reports I;ve seen.

anyway, I better let you trundle off to your office in the NSA now ta
ta.
