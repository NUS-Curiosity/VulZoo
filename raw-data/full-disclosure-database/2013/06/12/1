Now, that, that is rubbish. I'm assuming you're German. You're doing
your countries history a disservice with such nonsense and hyperbole.
Total sidenote, what year did Germany go through a "de-stasi-fication"
ala the de-baath-ification of Iraq or the de-Nazi-fication? Oh yeah
you didnt. Don't look too hard at Nord Stream or Gazprom Germania and
I bet all those old timers grandfathered in at the top tiers of
deutsch telekom don't think like old-time spooks.. You realize that
Berlin isn't just a hotspot for the worlds intelligence community but
basically THE hotspot right? Go ask the people at CCCB about the
people who used to surveil them when they first moved in.

Yeah, indeed, I remember being at CCC in IIRC 2007 when they came for
Julian. But no really, the German government is *THE* exception in the
world, they don't spy on you or anyone else, also, we have the london
bridge in Arizona, I bet it would look good over the Rhine, would you
like to be the london bridge?

Dear god, I hope you don't look up the ASIO or you know, the
5-eyes/AUSCANNZUKUS.

Every country in the world engages in intelligence collection, it
doesnt matter where your server is, if a country feels inclined,
they're in it, watching your data. Everything else is feel good
fluff.. Expect them.
