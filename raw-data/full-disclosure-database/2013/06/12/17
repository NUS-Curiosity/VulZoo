Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-052 - Display
	Suite - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2017933

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-052
  * Project: Display Suite [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-June-12
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Display Suite allows you to take full control over how your content is
displayed using a drag and drop interface.

In certain situations, Display Suite does not properly sanitize entity bundle
labels, allowing a malicious user to embed scripts within a page, resulting
in a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker has to be able
to create entity bundle labels of some sort, which usually needs a higher
level permission such as administer taxonomy.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Display Suite 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.7.
  * Display Suite 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.3.
