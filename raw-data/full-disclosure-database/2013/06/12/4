Let me also make it clear to you, in a previous life I was in such
position working at an ISP/telco here, so I know fully well what our
LEO's and spies can and can not do, to capture the data similar to NSA
is doing, it is the telco providor that must enable this, and only then
to a direct specific circuit and only under court order, not a free for
all dont give a fuck catch-and-store-all like NSA is doing.

So, if AU businesses kept their email in AU, they have far stronger
protections than if they left it in the U.S. despite being a member of
that not so secret club.
