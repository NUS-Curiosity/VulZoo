from a first look, i don't think a vendor-supplied recovery partition is
necessary. it appears that it would also be possible if the "system
restore" setting was enabled (but don't quote me on that).

i'm not sure how likely that is in your average large, corporate
environment. the ones i've seen have system restore disabled and opt to
reimage systems instead when issues occur. i'm sure there are some
environments where this could be useful, however.
