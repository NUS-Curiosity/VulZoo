no, he can't. there isn't such a scenario. this is one of those
situations where in theory he is correct but in reality this is simply
not an issue.

there are a thousand other attacks one could do that would be more
efficient and more effective (which others have been trying to explain
to him) but he refuses to listen and insists this is a major problem.

this is *not* an issue -- which is why everyone has been ignoring it for
5.5 years.
