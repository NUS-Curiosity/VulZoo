Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-051 - Services -
	Cross site request	forgery (CSRF)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2012982

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-051
  * Project: Services [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-June-05
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to expose an API to third party systems using REST,
XML-RPC or other protocols.

The module doesn't sufficiently verify writing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE)
with session cookie authentication, thereby exposing a Cross Site Request
Forgery vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that session based authentication
must be enabled for an endpoint.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Services 6.x-3.x versions.
  * Services 7.x-3.x versions prior to 7.x-3.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Services [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version or uninstall the module.

  * If you use the Services module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Services 7.x-3.4
    [5]
  * If you use the Services module for Drupal 6.x, uninstall the module.

Note that Services clients using session authentication now should supply a
special X-CSRF-Token header with a token that can be retrieved from
http://example.com/services/session/token [6]. This is needed for writing
HTTP methods calls (POST, PUT, DELETE).

Also see the Services [7] project page.
