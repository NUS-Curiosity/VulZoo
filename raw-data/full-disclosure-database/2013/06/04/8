Insufficient Authorization (WASC-02):

There is no restriction on accessing file manager and image manager. Which
is not default behavior (developer of MCFileManager and MCImageManager
states, that by default these web applications require authorization) and is
made by developers of aCMS.

http://site/assets/js/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/pages/im/index.html

Arbitrary File Uploading (WASC-31):

Plugins MCFileManager and MCImageManager for TinyMCE, which are using in the
system, are vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code through bypass of
programs' security filters (on IIS and Apache web servers).

http://site/assets/js/tiny_mce/plugins/filemanager/pages/fm/index.html

http://site/assets/js/tiny_mce/plugins/imagemanager/pages/im/index.html

Code will execute via file uploading. The first program is vulnerable to
three methods of code execution: via using of symbol ";" (1.asp;.txt) in
file name (IIS). via "1.asp" in folder name (IIS), via double extension
(1.php.txt) (Apache with special configuration). And the second program is
vulnerable to two methods of code execution (#1 and #3).
