As of recently this security hole has been silently fixed.

Any.Do transmits Passwords in plaintext.
== Some of you may be interested to know that the Task Management and TODO-list Application, Any.Do, happily transmits your password and just about everything else in plaintext. They were even so kind to include a README.md documenting exactly this "feature": >>> Login
>>> -----
>>> 
>>> * Right now, the only form encoding call done to the server is the login process.
>>> * Only POST is supported.
>>> * The parameter *_spring_security_remember_me* should always be specified.
>>> * Password is not encoded/encrypted in the request.
>>> 
>>> Endpoint: /state-manager/j_spring_security_check
>>> 
>>> POST parameters:
>>> 
>>> 	{
>>> 		j_username: <email>,
>>> 		j_password: <password>,
>>> 		_spring_security_remember_me: "on"
>>> 	} Just to verify this is actually happening I made use of wireshark:
