Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
The vulnerability laboratory research team discovered a persistent web vulnerability  in Barracuda Networks CudaTel v2.6.002.040 appliance application.
The input validation vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious persistent script code on application side of the vulnerable module.

The vulnerability is located in the `find me` module of the `call forwarding` function when processing to request manipulated parameters via `add listing`.
Local low privilege application user accounts can inject persistent script code to exploit higher privilege web application accounts. 

The remote bug can be exploited by remote attacker with low privileged application user account and low required userinteraction. Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerabilities result in persistent session hijacking, persistent persistent external redirects to malware or malicious sites, persistent phishing 
and persistent web context manipulation (vulnerable module).

Vulnerable Section(s):
				[+] Find Me

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Call Forwarding - Add

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Calling Sequence - Listing


Proof of Concept:
=================





Solution:
=========
The vulnerability can be patched  by parsing the listed (output) web context after processing to add.
restrict also the input fields and disallow special chars or wrong strings.

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium.
