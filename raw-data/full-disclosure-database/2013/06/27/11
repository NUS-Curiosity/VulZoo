Subject: Re: Denial of Service in WordPress

This just affects the client though right? So doesn't DoS a WordPress blog,
just presents an error message to the user if they click on a crafted link.
How could this be used in the real world to cause any risk?

>From my understanding you'd have to get the user to click on the tinyurl,
which would then show them a browser redirect error? If this is the case,
how does this benefit an attacker?
