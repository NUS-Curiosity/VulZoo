 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:183
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : java-1.7.0-openjdk
 Date    : June 27, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages fix multiple security
 vulnerabilities
 
 Multiple flaws were discovered in the ImagingLib and the image
 attribute, channel, layout and raster processing in the 2D
 component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly
 use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption
 (CVE-2013-2470, CVE-2013-2471, CVE-2013-2472, CVE-2013-2473,
 CVE-2013-2463, CVE-2013-2465, CVE-2013-2469).
 
 Integer overflow flaws were found in the way AWT processed certain
 input. An attacker could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code
 with the privileges of the user running an untrusted Java applet or
 application (CVE-2013-2459).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Sound,
 JDBC, Libraries, JMX, and Serviceability components in OpenJDK. An
 untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass
 Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-2448, CVE-2013-2454, CVE-2013-2458,
 CVE-2013-2457, CVE-2013-2453, CVE-2013-2460).
 
 Multiple flaws in the Serialization, Networking, Libraries and CORBA
 components can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet
 to gain access to potentially sensitive information (CVE-2013-2456,
 CVE-2013-2447, CVE-2013-2455, CVE-2013-2452, CVE-2013-2443,
 CVE-2013-2446).
 
 It was discovered that the Hotspot component did not properly handle
 out-of-memory errors. An untrusted Java application or applet could
 possibly use these flaws to terminate the Java Virtual Machine
 (CVE-2013-2445).
 
 It was discovered that the AWT component did not properly manage
 certain resources and that the ObjectStreamClass of the Serialization
 component did not properly handle circular references. An untrusted
 Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to cause
 a denial of service (CVE-2013-2444, CVE-2013-2450).
 
 It was discovered that the Libraries component contained certain errors
 related to XML security and the class loader. A remote attacker could
 possibly exploit these flaws to bypass intended security mechanisms
 or disclose potentially sensitive information and cause a denial of
 service (CVE-2013-2407, CVE-2013-2461).
 
 It was discovered that JConsole did not properly inform the user when
 establishing an SSL connection failed. An attacker could exploit
 this flaw to gain access to potentially sensitive information
 (CVE-2013-2412).
 
 It was discovered that GnomeFileTypeDetector did not check for read
 permissions when accessing files. An untrusted Java application or
 applet could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive
 information (CVE-2013-2449).
 
 It was found that documentation generated by Javadoc was vulnerable to
 a frame injection attack. If such documentation was accessible over
 a network, and a remote attacker could trick a user into visiting a
 specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web content being
 displayed next to the documentation. This could be used to perform a
 phishing attack by providing frame content that spoofed a login form
 on the site hosting the vulnerable documentation (CVE-2013-1571).
 
 It was discovered that the 2D component created shared memory segments
 with insecure permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to
 read or write to the shared memory segment (CVE-2013-1500).
