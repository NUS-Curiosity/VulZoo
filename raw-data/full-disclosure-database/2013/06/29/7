Subject: Re: Abusing Windows 7 Recovery Process

"If you have non-administrator credentials that get you past the bootloader
or the entire boot process hasn't been made secure"

Aside from this, the scenario I've always seen:
1.) Home/regular user that doesn't know/care
2.) Paranoid user or company machine employing full disk encryption

However, I think this is still interesting. It's been a while since I've
played with Windows boxes and won't have access to one for a couple days,
but isn't this triggering off of vendor supplied recovery partitions? This
is a regular Windows 7 sole partition box you tried this one?
