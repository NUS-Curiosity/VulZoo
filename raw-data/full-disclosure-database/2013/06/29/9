Not really, in terms of the bandwidth you can use up / the number of
requests you can create. You're essentially trading this:

for (var i = 0; i < whatever; i++) {
   var x = new XMLHttpRequest(); /* or new Image() or whatever */
   ...
}

...for this:

for (var i = 0; i < whatever / redirect_limit; i++) {
  for (var j = 0; j < redirect_limit; j++) { /* implicit loop */
    ...
  }
}

...and it shouldn't matter.

You can generate a ton of expensive traffic from within JS these days.
