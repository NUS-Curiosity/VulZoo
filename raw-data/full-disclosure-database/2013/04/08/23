 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:074
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : drupal
 Date    : April 8, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated drupal packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Drupal core&#039;s text filtering system provides several features including
 removing inappropriate HTML tags and automatically linking content
 that appears to be a link. A pattern in Drupal&#039;s text matching was
 found to be inefficient with certain specially crafted strings. This
 vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that users must have the ability
 to post content sent to the filter system such as a role with the post
 comments or Forum topic: Create new content permission (CVE-2012-1588).
 
 Drupal core&#039;s Form API allows users to set a destination, but failed
 to validate that the URL was internal to the site. This weakness could
 be abused to redirect the login to a remote site with a malicious
 script that harvests the login credentials and redirects to the live
 site. This vulnerability is mitigated only by the end user&#039;s ability
 to recognize a URL with malicious query parameters to avoid the social
 engineering required to exploit the problem (CVE-2012-1589).
 
 Drupal core&#039;s forum lists fail to check user access to nodes when
 displaying them in the forum overview page. If an unpublished node
 was the most recently updated in a forum then users who should not
 have access to unpublished forum posts were still be able to see
 meta-data about the forum post such as the post title (CVE-2012-1590).
 
 Drupal core provides the ability to have private files, including
 images, and Image Styles which create derivative images from
 an original image that may differ, for example, in size or
 saturation. Drupal core failed to properly terminate the page request
 for cached image styles allowing users to access image derivatives for
 images they should not be able to view. Furthermore, Drupal didn&#039;t
 set the right headers to prevent image styles from being cached in
 the browser (CVE-2012-1591).
 
 Drupal core provides the ability to list nodes on a site at
 admin/content. Drupal core failed to confirm a user viewing that page
 had access to each node in the list. This vulnerability only concerns
 sites running a contributed node access module and is mitigated by the
 fact that users must have a role with the Access the content overview
 page permission. Unpublished nodes were not displayed to users who only
 had the Access the content overview page permission (CVE-2012-2153).
 
 The request_path function in includes/bootstrap.inc in Drupal 7.14
 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
 via the q[] parameter to index.php, which reveals the installation
 path in an error message (CVE-2012-2922).
 
 A bug in the installer code was identified that allows an attacker to
 re-install Drupal using an external database server under certain
 transient conditions. This could allow the attacker to execute
 arbitrary PHP code on the original server (Drupal SA-CORE-2012-003).
 
 For sites using the core OpenID module, an information disclosure
 vulnerability was identified that allows an attacker to read files
 on the local filesystem by attempting to log in to the site using a
 malicious OpenID server (Drupal SA-CORE-2012-003).
 
 A vulnerability was identified that allows blocked users to appear
 in user search results, even when the search results are viewed by
 unprivileged users (CVE-2012-5651).
 
 Drupal core&#039;s file upload feature blocks the upload of many files that
 can be executed on the server by munging the filename. A malicious
 user could name a file in a manner that bypasses this munging of the
 filename in Drupal&#039;s input validation (CVE-2012-5653).
 
 Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core
 version 7 (DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2013-001).
 
 A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified
 in certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input
 into jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended
 behavior is to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed
 modules are affected by this issue.
 
 A vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some
 cases, the content of nodes that the user should not have access to.
 
 Drupal core provides the ability to have private files, including
 images. A vulnerability was identified in which derivative images
 (which Drupal automatically creates from these images based on image
 styles and which may differ, for example, in size or saturation) did
 not always receive the same protection. Under some circumstances,
 this would allow users to access image derivatives for images they
 should not be able to view.
 
 The drupal package was updated to latest version 7.19 to fix above
 vulnerabilities.
