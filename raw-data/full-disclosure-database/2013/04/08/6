 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:059
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : dhcp
 Date    : April 8, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A security issue was identified and fixed in ISC DHCP:
 
 libdns in ISC DHCP 4.2.x before 4.2.5-P1 allows remote name servers to
 cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors involving
 a regular expression, as demonstrated by a memory-exhaustion attack
 against a machine running a dhcpd process, a related issue to
 CVE-2013-2266 (CVE-2013-2494).
 
 The updated packages have upgraded to the 4.2.5-P1 version which is
 not vulnerable to this issue
