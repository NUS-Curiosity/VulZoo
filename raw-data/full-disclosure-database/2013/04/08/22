 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:073
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : dokuwiki
 Date    : April 8, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated dokuwiki package fixes security vulnerabilities:
 
 DokuWiki 2009-12-25c allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information via a direct request to a .php file, which reveals
 the installation path in an error message, as demonstrated by
 lib/tpl/index.php and certain other files (CVE-2011-3727).
 
 A full path disclosure flaw was found in the way DokuWiki, a
 standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, performed sanitization of
 HTTP POST &#039;prefix&#039; input value prior passing it to underlying PHP
 substr() routine, when the PHP error level has been enabled on the
 particular server. A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain
 full path location of particular requested DokuWiki page by issuing
 a specially-crafted HTTP POST request (CVE-2012-3354).
