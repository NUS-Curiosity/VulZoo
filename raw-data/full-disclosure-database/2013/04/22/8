Subject: 0day Vulnerability in VLC (this is my first
	release of the vuln anywhere)

if VLC media player is launched in QT mode and the user is on windows NT
(any version of windows so far as tested) connected to the internet there
is a vulnerability in the handling of unicast packets. The Proof of concept
code is in development and should be ready for publishing within the next 2
weeks. More in depth vulnerability information will be released with the
proof of concept. This is a joint effort (the POC (proof of concept) code
and vuln discovery) by 2 security firms. 4sData IT solutions and another
firm that would like to remain nameless for the time being. This
vulnerability exposes almost everyone using VLC media player (unless on
linux systems and thats just because of the lack of testing so far may
still be found to be exposed.). Thank you for your time and if interested
please respond and let me know,.

                 - Jay @ 4sData-IT-Solutions (www.4sdata.com - coming soon)

  P.S. Launching 4sData this week to coincide with the VLC vuln.
