I usually use both secure@...mple.com and security@...mple.com. One is
specified in an RFC (see below), the other was popularized by
Microsoft around the same time the RFC was being assembled.

There are few other addresses published in RFC2142
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt). I usually try them too for good
measure.

You also have the Technical and Administrative contacts from the WHOIS
database (http://whois.domaintools.com/vodafone.de).

That sounds like Dell and their call routing system (Dell did the same
to me a few years ago when trying to report some issues). Are they
using the same outsourcing firm???

I think the extra effort to contact the company through well known
email addresses and WHOIS contact is a courtesy and due diligence, so
good job on that. But face it - if Vodafone were going to acknowledge
or respond, it would have happened by now. So you get the 0-day effect
with a free conscious.
