Subject: Coliseum101 - Security Conferences Calendar

Hi all!

I would like to introduce you to `Coliseum101 - Security Conferences CalendarÂ´. The URL is: http://coliseum101.com

You'll find the best -well known- security conferences around the globe, with some additional info about them, etc. 

There's a place for sponsors too, so just shoot me an email if you're interested in being there. 

I know that there are some other websites with kind-of-the-same info, however, the idea is to include only the very best conferences, with minimalistic style.. if you believe there's en error, or if we missed some conference, please, contact me.

Also, there's a Forum (http://forum.coliseum101.com), Full Disclosure style, where you can post whatever you want about every conference, e.g.. the best way to get to that country / city, places to visit, best hotels near the venue, cool talks, workshops, etc.

Well, that's all. Hope you like it! If you find it useful, I'll appreciate any donation through the Paypal button.

Thanks!

salud!

Nahu.-
