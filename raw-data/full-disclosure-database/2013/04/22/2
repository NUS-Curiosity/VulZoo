Subject: [SE-2012-01] Yet another Reflection API flaw
 affecting Oracle's Java SE


Hello All,

Today, a vulnerability report with an accompanying Proof of
Concept code was sent to Oracle notifying the company of a
new security weakness affecting Java SE 7 software.

The new flaw was verified to affect all versions of Java SE
7 (including the recently released 1.7.0_21-b11). It can be
used to achieve a complete Java security sandbox bypass on
a target system. Successful exploitation in a web browser
scenario requires proper user interaction (a user needs to
accept the risk of executing a potentially malicious Java
application when a security warning window is displayed).

What's interesting is that the new issue is present not only
in JRE Plugin / JDK software, but also the recently announced
Server JRE as well [1]. Those concerned about a feasibility
of exploitation of Java flaws in a server environment should
consult Guideline 3-8 of "Secure Coding Guidelines for a Java
Programming Language" [2]. It lists the following software
components and APIs as potentially prone to the execution of
untrusted Java code:
- Sun implementation of the XSLT interpreter,
- Long Term Persistence of JavaBeans Components,
- RMI and LDAP (RFC 2713),
- Many SQL implementations.

In Apr 2012 [3], we reported our first vulnerability report
to Oracle corporation signaling multiple security problems in
Java SE 7 and the Reflection API in particular. It's been a
year since then and to our true surprise, we were still able
to discover one of the simplest and most powerful instances
of Java Reflection API based vulnerabilities. It looks Oracle
was primarily focused on hunting down potentially dangerous
Reflection API calls in the "allowed" classes space. If so,
no surprise that Issue 61 was overlooked.

Thank you.

Best Regards
Adam Gowdiak
