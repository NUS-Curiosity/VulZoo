Subject: Vulnerabilities in AI-Bolit

Hello list!

These are Brute Force and Information Leakage vulnerabilities in AI-Bolit. 
This is security web application.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of AI-Bolit.

In version 20121014 the filename format was changed (with adding date and 
time). Which is not enough to protect from guessing, as I stated to the 
developer. He promised to fix these vulnerabilities. After my 
recommendations, in version 20130201 the developer added protection against 
Information Leakage (forbad indexing reports by search engines and added 
random number to the filename). But software is still vulnerable to Brute 
Force.

Details:
----------

Brute Force (WASC-11):

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site/AI-BOLIT-REPORT.html

http://site/AI-BOLIT-REPORT-<date>-<time>.html (since version 20121014)

Leakage of reports with stats and FPD. Also these reports are indexed by 
search engines. If there is mentioned backdoors on the site in report, then 
after getting access to report, it's possible to get to know about backdoors 
and hack web site with using them.

Timeline:
------------ 

2013.01.22 - announced at my site.
