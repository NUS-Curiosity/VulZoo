Subject: Re: Allegro.pl XSS [0-day]

XSS isn't a critical issue. CVSS2 define a standard XSS ~4.3/10, more
critical are CSRF ~6.8 or Open Redirect ~5.8. It's no sense public XSS in
ONE website on this list! Too many websites are vulnerable. If someone have
a nice XSS in software like phpmyadmin, it could be interesting.
