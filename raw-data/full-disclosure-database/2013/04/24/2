Valdis,

You are teaching me how to behave, outsourcing _your problems_ to me.

Let me suggest you ``responsible people'' fix the problem yourselves.
One approach is to work hard, find the bugs and report them --
in this case you won't depend on people like me.
It ain't going to be easy, future versions will bring new bugs.

btw, I wouldn't bother to do this smalltalk, but someone
repeatedly spammed about responsible disclosure so I thought
other opinions should be heard.
