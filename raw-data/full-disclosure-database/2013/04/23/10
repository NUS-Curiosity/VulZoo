And disclaimer or no disclaimer, there's a lot of vendors who want to
Do The Right Thing and fix their stuff to protect their users (if for
no other reason than the possibility of lost customers if they ignore
security issues too often).

If you're a black hat, do whatever the heck you want.

If you're a white hat, be responsible and at least try to engage the
vendor.  If you're worried about being stiffed for the credit for the
find, write the advisory and post the MD5 hash somewhere before contacting
the vendor.  If they respond and work on the problem, the process works.
If they blow you off, go blackhat and do whatever the heck you want. :)

Now wasn't that easy? :)
