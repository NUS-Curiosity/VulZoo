 release of the vuln anywhere)

And any vendor who says it will take 18 months to fix this, tough, give
them whatever you feel is reasonable, tell them when you will be
releasing and then go, but keep in mind, fixing a bug that affects
Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 2003, 2008 and 2012 will take longer than
fixing a bug in VLC. Yes we are all adults and have to make our own
decisions, but when some of us act impulsively, it hurts all of our
reputations. In the end, I hope we are all here for our users and customers.
