Subject: Re: 0day Vulnerability in VLC (this is my first
 release of the vuln anywhere)

Someone earlier (in another thread?) mentioned notifying the vendor 
first and, if they don't respond within a week or some other reasonable 
period of time, going public with the 0day and a clear conscious. And I 
completely agree- at least make an effort to let the vendor know before 
you go public.
