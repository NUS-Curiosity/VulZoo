 release of the vuln anywhere)

Please remember that the title of the list is "full disclosure" not
"responsible disclosure". This is not a corporate list and nobody have
to act responsible if they don't want so. They are old enough to judge
what they do.

Some people are in the security field just for the fun part, that's not
their job. Contacting a vendor, collaborating with him, and waiting X
years for a appropriate patch is not that fun ;)

If the vendor is concerned about the security, he will see the mail sent
to this list and will act upon it.

You should already be happy because they decided to release it and not
to keep it for them ;)
