Perhaps you don't realise that your opinion is not universally shared.

Georgi is pointing out that you're trying to evangelize your preferred
disclosure policy on a mailing list called "full-disclosure", with the
tagline "full disclosure: we believe in it".

If you don't believe in full disclosure, that's fine. All of us are aware
that not everyone understands the benefits, you really don't need to tell
us. Your posts are written almost as if you're telling off naughty children
for not using whichever disclosure policy you like the best.

Tavis.

p.s. Georgi is well respected in the field of vulnerability research and
certainly doesn't need you to explain disclosure to him!
