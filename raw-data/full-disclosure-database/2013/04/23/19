Sure, but how does full disclosure solve that? Most vendors refuse to credit
researchers who don't play by their rules (which is almost universally tell
them and then keep quiet until they give you permission to speak) - so if
you're primarily driven by vendor credit, you should not choose full
disclosure.

Trivializing full disclosure as something people do for "shout outs" then
calling it "blackhat" is unfair and inaccurate, but we're used to this from
the Scott Culpists ;-)
