 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:090
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : argyllcms
 Date    : April 9, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A security issue was identified and fixed in argyllcms:
 
 An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
 found in Ghostscript&#039;s International Color Consortium Format library
 (icclib). An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or
 PDF file with embedded images that would cause Ghostscript to crash
 or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
 user running Ghostscript (CVE-2012-4405).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
