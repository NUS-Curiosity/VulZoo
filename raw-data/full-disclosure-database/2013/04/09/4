 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:080
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ganglia
 Date    : April 9, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated ganglia packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 There is a security issue in Ganglia Web going back to at least
 3.1.7 which can lead to arbitrary script being executed with web user
 privileges possibly leading to a machine compromise.
 
 Additionally, an issue where active NFS mounts caused gmond to not
 start has also been corrected.
 
 When installing ganglia-gmetad, the installer uses the non-existent
 nobody, and not nogroup, as the group when changing new ownership
 of files.
