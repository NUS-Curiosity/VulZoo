View online: http://drupal.org/node/1972804

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-043
  * Project: MP3 Player [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2013-April-17
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to easily enable a Flash MP3 Player on a CCK
FileField.
The module doesn't sufficiently filter user-supplied text from mp3 filenames.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to create a node with an mp3 filefield with the MP3
player set as the display widget.

--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED

  * All MP3 Player versions.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed MP3 Player [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Disable the module:

  * If you use the MP3 Player module for Drupal 6.x you should disable the
    module.
