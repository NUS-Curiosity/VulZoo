	Autocomplete Widgets for Text	and Number Fields
	(autocomplete_widgets) - Access bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1972976

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-045
  * Project: Autocomplete Widgets for Text and Number Fields [1] (third-party
    module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-April-17
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Autocomplete Widgets module adds autocomplete widgets for Text and Number
fields.

The autocomplete callback implemented by this module does not honor node
permissions to access existing fields, allowing users to see field values
even though they are not authorized to access that information.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to create or edit content.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

---------------------------------------------------

  * Autocomplete Widgets 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.4.
