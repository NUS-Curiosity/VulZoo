Subject: Allegro.pl XSS [0-day]

Hi All!

I was looking for a 19" rack mount today and found this XSS instead:
http://allegro.pl/listing/listing.php?string=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E

it turns out to be a custom data-headline attribute that is not properly escaped

tested on Firefox 20, Chrome and others need an xss filter bypass
