Wow, interesting!

CDNs could mitigate this by, instead of resetting connections with lots of headers,
just reading all the cookies and throwing them into the bit bucket instead of keeping
them in RAM, right? That way, there would still be the wasted bandwidth, but
combined with the Google approach, it should work fine, right? If the client sends too
many headers, just ignore everything until you reach \n\n, then send back the error
script?
