 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:054
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : sudo
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in sudo:
 
 A flaw exists in the IP network matching code in sudo versions 1.6.9p3
 through 1.8.4p4 that may result in the local host being matched
 even though it is not actually part of the network described by the
 IP address and associated netmask listed in the sudoers file or in
 LDAP. As a result, users authorized to run commands on certain IP
 networks may be able to run commands on hosts that belong to other
 networks not explicitly listed in sudoers (CVE-2012-2337).
 
 sudo 1.6.0 through 1.7.10p6 and sudo 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6 allows
 local users or physically-proximate attackers to bypass intended time
 restrictions and retain privileges without re-authenticating by setting
 the system clock and sudo user timestamp to the epoch (CVE-2013-1775).
 
 Sudo before 1.8.6p7 allows a malicious user to run commands via
 sudo without authenticating, so long as there exists a terminal the
 user has access to where a sudo command was successfully run by that
 same user within the password timeout period (usually five minutes)
 (CVE-2013-1776).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
