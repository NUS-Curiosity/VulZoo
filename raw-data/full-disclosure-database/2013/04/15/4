Mandriva Linux Security Advisory MDVSA-2013:ALL

_______________________________________________________________________


Package : Entire F'n OS
 Date : April 11, 2013
 Affected: Entire F'n
OS

_______________________________________________________________________


Problem Description:

 Updated OS packages fail to fix multiple
security vulnerabilities:

 It was discovered that we have absolutely no
clue on how to get it right so we issue several hundred security
advisories each and every calendar day just to keep the rest of the
planet up to date on how totally incompetent we are in managing a
fork.

 We appreciate your tolerance of clogging your inbox w/ alert
after alert which reaffirms our stated distribution goal of being "the
least secure Linux on the planet" and hope that you will continue to
support us in our endeavors.
