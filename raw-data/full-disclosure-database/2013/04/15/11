Subject: Re: RAT list

I have been working on this side project for a while now, it is currently a
dead simple reverse TCP backdoor, more features are coming though, like
DNS/ICMP/Tor C&C. A better shell environment, rootkit hooks, encryption,
etc. Don't expect too much right now, as it is still in very early alpha,
but feel free to contribute :)
