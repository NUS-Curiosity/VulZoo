 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:039
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : freetype2
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated freetype2 packages fixes security vulnerabilities:
 
 A null pointer de-reference flaw was found in the way Freetype font
 rendering engine handled Glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF)
 fonts. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted BDF font
 file, which once processed in an application linked against FreeType
 would lead to that application crash (CVE-2012-5668).
 
 An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way FreeType
 font rendering engine performed parsing of glyph information and
 relevant bitmaps for glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF). A remote
 attacker could provide a specially-crafted BDF font file, which once
 opened in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that
 application crash (CVE-2012-5669).
 
 An out-of heap-based buffer write flaw was found in the way FreeType
 font rendering engine performed parsing of glyph information and
 relevant bitmaps for glyph bitmap distribution format (BDF). A remote
 attacker could provide a specially-crafted font file, which once
 opened in an application linked against FreeType would lead to that
 application crash, or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with
 the privileges of the user running the application (CVE-2012-5670).
