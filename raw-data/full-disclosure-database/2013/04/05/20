 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:046
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libtiff
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated libtiff packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 libtiff did not properly convert between signed and unsigned integer
 values, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this flaw
 to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would
 cause an application linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly,
 execute arbitrary code (CVE-2012-2088).
 
 Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer
 overflows, were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use
 these flaws to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that would cause
 tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code (CVE-2012-2113).
 
 Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered that the tiff2pdf utility incorrectly
 handled certain malformed TIFF images. If a user or automated
 system were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image,
 a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial
 of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges
 (CVE-2012-3401).
 
 It was discovered that a buffer overflow in libtiff&#039;s parsing of files
 using PixarLog compression could lead to the execution of arbitrary
 code (CVE-2012-4447).
 
 ppm2tiff does not check the return value of the TIFFScanlineSize
 function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PPM image
 that triggers an integer overflow, a zero-memory allocation, and a
 heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2012-4564).
 
 It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed
 images using the DOTRANGE tag. If a user or automated system were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker
 could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or
 possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges (CVE-2012-5581).
