 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:042
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : krb5
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in krb5:
 
 Fix a kadmind denial of service issue (null pointer dereference),
 which could only be triggered by an administrator with the create
 privilege (CVE-2012-1013).
 
 The MIT krb5 KDC (Key Distribution Center) daemon can free an
 uninitialized pointer while processing an unusual AS-REQ, corrupting
 the process heap and possibly causing the daemon to abnormally
 terminate.  An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute
 malicious code, but exploiting frees of uninitialized pointers to
 execute code is believed to be difficult.  It is possible that a
 legitimate client that is misconfigured in an unusual way could
 trigger this vulnerability (CVE-2012-1015).
 
 It was reported that the KDC plugin for PKINIT could dereference a
 NULL pointer when a malformed packet caused processing to terminate
 early, which led to a crash of the KDC process. An attacker would
 require a valid PKINIT certificate or have observed a successful
 PKINIT authentication to execute a successful attack. In addition,
 an unauthenticated attacker could execute the attack of anonymouse
 PKINIT was enabled (CVE-2013-1415).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
