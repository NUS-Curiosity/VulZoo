Subject: Hackersh 0.1 Release Announcement

Hi All,

I am pleased to announce the first version of Hackersh (
http://www.hackersh.org).

Hackersh ("Hacker Shell") is a free and open source shell (command
interpreter) written in Python with built-in security commands, and
out-of-the-box wrappers for various security tools, using Pythonect as its
scripting engine. Pythonect is a new, experimental, general-purpose
high-level dataflow programming language based on Python. It aims to
combine the intuitive feel of shell scripting (and all of its perks like
implicit parallelism) with the flexibility and agility of Python.

The combination of the two makes:

"http://localhost" -> url -> nmap -> w3af -> print

An actual workflow that takes 'http://localhost', parses it as a URL, scans
it for open ports (via Nmap), and for each HTTP service - launches a
separate web vulnerabilities scan (via W3af).

Curious about the output? Here's a screenshot:

Hackersh is not limited to penetration testing and can be applied to other
security domains including but not limited to: malware analysis,
vulnerability development and intelligence gathering (OSINT).
