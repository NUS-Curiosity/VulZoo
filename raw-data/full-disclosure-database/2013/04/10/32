Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE
Software for 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130410-asr1000

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 April 10 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR)
contains the following denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities:

    Cisco IOS XE Software IPv6 Multicast Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IOS XE Software MVPNv6 Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IOS XE Software L2TP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IOS XE Software Bridge Domain Interface Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IOS XE Software SIP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that
is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the
others.

Successful exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities could allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a reload of the Embedded
Services Processors (ESP) card or the Route Processor (RP) card, causing
an interruption of services. Repeated exploitation could result in a
sustained DoS condition.

Note: Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS-XR Software are not affected by
these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.
