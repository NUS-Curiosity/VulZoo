 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:106
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nss-pam-ldapd
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated nss-pam-ldapd packages fixes the following security
 vulnerability:
 
 Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in
 the use of FD_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd can lead to a stack-based buffer
 overflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw
 to cause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or
 potentially execute arbitrary code.
 
 The issue can be triggered in a network daemon by opening a large
 number of connections and forcing a name lookup. This would result
 in a crash and possibly remote code execution. This issue may also
 allow local privilege escalation if a suid program does name lookups
 and doesn&#039;t close file descriptors inherited from the parent process
 (CVE-2013-0288).
