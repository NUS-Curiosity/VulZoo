Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified
MeetingPlace Solution

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130410-mp

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 April 10 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server contains an authentication
bypass vulnerability and Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing
Server contains an arbitrary login vulnerability. For both
vulnerabilities, successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and send arbitrary
commands to the affected system with the privileges of that user.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified
MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server Arbitrary Login Vulnerability. This
advisory is available at the following link:
