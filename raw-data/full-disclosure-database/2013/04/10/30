Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Firewall
Services Module Software

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130410-fwsm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 April 10 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) Software for Cisco Catalyst
6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers is affected by the
following vulnerabilities:

    FWSM HTTP Proxy Traceback Vulnerability
    IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is
affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other.

Successful exploitation of either of these vulnerabilities may result
in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS)
condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. A workaround is available for the IKE vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:

Note: The Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) may be affected
by some of the vulnerabilities listed above. A separate Cisco
Security Advisory has been published to disclose the vulnerabilities
that affect the Cisco ASA. That advisory is available at:
