DeepSec 2013 "Seven Seas" - Call for Papers

Dear Researchers, Hackers, Developers, dear Members of the IT-Security
Community: This is our call for papers for DeepSec 2013, the seventh DeepSec
In-Depth Security Conference. Our annual event will take place from November
19th to 22th at the Imperial Riding School Renaissance Hotel in Vienna. It
consists of two days of workshops followed by a two day long conference. Our
speakers and trainers traditionally come from the security community,
companies, hacker spaces, journalism and academic organisations, talking
about different topics and aspects of IT-Security: current threats and
vulnerabilities, social engineering and psychological aspects as well as
security management and philosophy.

Content

For DeepSec 2013 we're not looking for talks about the latest trending
technologies, gadgets and behaviours, no, DeepSec 2013 is all about secrets,
failures and visions!  We are looking for talks that will enable us to see
things from another perspective and hopefully give us a lot to think about.
We still talk about technology, exploits, bug, vulnerabilities, defence
(hopefully in-depth), software, hardware, infrastructure, procedures and
everything. We just think it's important to put your findings into
perspective with the real world – which in turn consists of secrets, failures
and vision on a daily basis.

Secrets

Every person, every group, every enterprise and every government has them.
Secrets are the very reason why information security uses encryption, access
control, even doors and locks (physical and otherwise). You wouldn’t need all
of this if it wasn’t for safeguarding these secrets. How do you protect your
secrets? And are secrets still secret once they escape?

Failures

Sometimes things go wrong. Often not only by malicious action, but by bad
design or bad implementation. Human error contributes as well to major and
minor catastrophes. All it takes is a missed state (or states or bugs or
anything) during quality assurance or changes to an already “perfect” system
to start the chain reaction. Failures are always an option. So how do you
deal with failures? How do you detect them? Do you dare to talk about them?
And what do you (not) learn from them?

Visions

In an ideal world nothing stays bad forever. While sometimes it can get
worse, there are lots of ideas for improvement. That’s what upgrades and
changes in behavior are for (learning helps too).  If you have ideas how to
improve the current state of affairs, then visions are for you. We want to
hear them!

You can put all hot topics of IT security into either one of these
categories. Really good lessons touch all three.

Categories - You can submit content for three categories:

- Talks for the conference (45 minute slots)
- Two day workshops
- U21 (a special category for young security researchers)

Talks

Talks should be up-to-date, of high quality and preferably exclusive. We're
looking for the vanguard and lateral thinkers – No Rock Stars, no Marketing,
no panic creating, no 2nd hand opinions – we want you to introduce us to new
ideas and we do like a bit of controversy: We're keen on unconventional
thoughts that challenge the mainstream.

Speaker privileges:
- Free entrance to the conference
- Hotel accommodation for three nights (single/double room)
- Travel expenses (please have your ticket up to EUR 800,- approved)
- Invitation to our famous Speaker's Dinner with traditional Austrian food

Workshops

Again: It's quality that counts. We're looking for novel, challenging
lectures for a sophisticated audience with a very high level of technical
understanding, deeply involved with security management, implementation,
operation and research. There's no need to keep it simple but we like you to
be precise. Don't try to cover too much ground, focus! Two days may sound a
lot but it isn't.

Trainer privileges:
- Free entrance to the conference
- Invitation to our famous Speaker's Dinner with traditional Austrian food
- 50% of the net profit of your class

U21

DeepSec will sponsor young security researchers by providing an opportunity
to attend the conference for free. In order to take advantage of this offer
your have to submit a description of your own security research project.
Please don't copy & paste, be creative! Be original! There's no need to be
shy: Viennese people may look grumpy, but they don't bite and we're really
looking forward to introduce some brand new faces to the IT security
community.
If you get accepted your work will be an exhibit during the breaks at the
conference, optionally you can do a lightning talk about your work (roughly
5 minutes).
The offer is intended for everyone with a maximum age of 21 (or slightly
more, depending on your social engineering skills).

U21 privileges:
- A 5 minute lightning talk on the conference
- Free entrance to the conference
- Invitation to the Speaker's Dinner, but no alcohol without age check ;)
- We help you with your travel expenses to Vienna, but cannot cover the full
  speakers allowance, if in doubt talk to us we can work something out.

Formal Requirements

All CfP submissions must go through the form on our web site:
https://deepsec.net/cfp.html

Please make sure that you read http://blog.deepsec.net/?p=294 before
submitting your ideas. Practice is never a bad thing. :)

We will support anyone if you have question, need clarification or whatever
comes to your mind, just contact us for additional questions:
cfp@...psec.net

We invite you to send us your submissions for talks and trainings and we’re
looking forward to it!

Keep secrets, failures and visions in mind!

Yours truly,
the DeepSec Organisation Team.
