 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:110
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openjpeg
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated openjpeg packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 An out-of heap-based buffer bounds read and write flaw, leading
 to invalid free, was found in the way a tile coder / decoder (TCD)
 implementation of OpenJPEG, an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in
 C language, performed releasing of previously allocated memory for
 the TCD encoder handle by processing certain Gray16 TIFF images. A
 remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image file,
 which once converted into the JPEG 2000 file format with an application
 linked against OpenJPEG (such as &#039;image_to_j2k&#039;), would lead to that
 application crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the
 privileges of the user running the application (CVE-2009-5030).
 
 An input validation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow,
 was found in the way OpenJPEG handled the tile number and size in an
 image tile header. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
 image file that, when decoded using an application linked against
 OpenJPEG, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
 application (CVE-2012-3358).
 
 It was found that OpenJPEG failed to sanity-check an image header field
 before using it. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
 image file that could cause an application linked against OpenJPEG
 to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code (CVE-2012-3535).
