Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-042 - RESTful Web
	Services (RESTWS)	- Denial of Service

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1966780

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-042
  * Project: RESTful Web Services [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-April-10
  * Security risk: Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Denial of Service

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to expose Drupal entities as RESTful web services. It
provides a machine-readable interface to exchange resources in JSON, XML and
RDF.

The module interferes with Drupal's page cache and allows an attacker to
poison the cache with non-HTML page responses, thereby exposing a denial of
service vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that page caching must be enabled
and the anonymous user role must be assigned a RESTWS permission, for example
"access resource node".


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * RESTWS 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.3.
  * RESTWS 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.0-alpha5.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed RESTful Web
Services [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

  * If you use the RESTWS 1.x module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to RESTWS 7.x-1.3
    [5]

    7.x-2.0-alpha5 [6]
