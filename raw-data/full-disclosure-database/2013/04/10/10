 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:102
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : mariadb
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated mariadb packages includes fixes for the following security
 vulnerabilities:
 
 Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL Server component in Oracle
 MySQL 5.5.26 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect integrity
 and availability, related to MySQL Client (CVE-2012-3147).
 
 Unspecified vulnerability in the MySQL Server component in Oracle MySQL
 5.1.64 and earlier, and 5.5.26 and earlier, allows remote attackers
 to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown
 vectors related to Protocol (CVE-2012-3158).
 
 Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the replication code in
 Oracle MySQL possibly before 5.5.29, and MariaDB 5.1.x through 5.1.62,
 5.2.x through 5.2.12, 5.3.x through 5.3.7, and 5.5.x through 5.5.25,
 allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands
 via vectors related to the binary log. NOTE: as of 20130116, Oracle
 has not commented on claims from a downstream vendor that the fix in
 MySQL 5.5.29 is incomplete (CVE-2012-4414).
 
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the acl_get function in Oracle
 MySQL 5.5.19 and other versions through 5.5.28, and 5.1.53 and
 other versions through 5.1.66, and MariaDB 5.5.2.x before 5.5.28a,
 5.3.x before 5.3.11, 5.2.x before 5.2.13 and 5.1.x before 5.1.66,
 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a
 long argument to the GRANT FILE command (CVE-2012-5611).
 
 A buffer overflow that can cause a server crash or arbitrary code
 execution (a variant of CVE-2012-5611)
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in Oracle MySQL 5.5.19 and other versions
 through 5.5.28, and MariaDB 5.5.28a and possibly other versions,
 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code,
 as demonstrated using certain variations of the (1) USE, (2) SHOW
 TABLES, (3) DESCRIBE, (4) SHOW FIELDS FROM, (5) SHOW COLUMNS FROM,
 (6) SHOW INDEX FROM, (7) CREATE TABLE, (8) DROP TABLE, (9) ALTER
 TABLE, (10) DELETE FROM, (11) UPDATE, and (12) SET PASSWORD commands
 (CVE-2012-5612).
 
 MySQL 5.5.19 and possibly other versions, and MariaDB 5.5.28a, 5.3.11,
 5.2.13, 5.1.66, and possibly other versions, generates different error
 messages with different time delays depending on whether a user name
 exists, which allows remote attackers to enumerate valid usernames
 (CVE-2012-5615). Be advised that for CVE-2012-5615 to be completely
 closed, it&#039;s recommended to remove any anonymous logins. Previously,
 such a user without access rights was added by default.
 
 A vulnerability was found in the handling of password salt values in
 MySQL. When a user logs into MySQL a salt value is generated that
 is then used to prevent password guessing attacks (since the salt
 value must be known in order to send a password). This salt value is
 created at the start of a session and used for the entire session,
 once authenticated an attacker can use the MySQL change_user command
 to attempt to login as a different, as the salt value is known a
 password guessing attack will be much more efficient (CVE-2012-5627).
 
 in addition it fixes MDEV-4029 and rpl.rpl_mdev382 test from
 mariadb-bench, and a problem preventing the feedback plugin from
 working has been corrected.
