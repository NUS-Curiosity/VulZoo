Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Colormix theme for
	WordPress

Hello list!

Last year I've disclosed vulnerabilities in JW Player and in RokBox. Which 
were fixed by the developers - JW Player developers fixed one hole and 
promised to fix others later and RokBox fixed all holes (but it was 
questionable how they fixed holes related to JW Player).

In December I've wrote about 47 RocketTheme's themes for WordPress (which 
contain RokBox). Besides their themes I've found in December similar 
vulnerabilities in multiple themes of other developers (including custom 
themes).

Now I'll inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in Colormix theme for 
WordPress. These are Cross-Site Scripting, Content Spoofing and Full path 
disclosure vulnerabilities.

-------------------------

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and 
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of 
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which 
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file 
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary 
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have 
crossdomain.xml.
