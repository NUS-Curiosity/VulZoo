 RTMP Data Processing Object Confusion (CVE-2013-2555)

I am just saying that developers and designers make mistakes and
that there is no getting around that. Rather than relying on the
benevolent 0day researchers from the sky publicly disclosing their
vulnerabilities, more responsible QA testing within the company will
prevent many of these vulnerabilities from occurring in the first
place. Or do you have a better idea?
