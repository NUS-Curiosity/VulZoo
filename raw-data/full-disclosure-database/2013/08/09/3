Subject: ReviewBoard Vulnerabilities

ReviewBoard (www.reviewboard.org) aims to 'take the pain out of code
review'. Integration with source control makes it imperative to
maintain proper protections on this server.  I have worked with the
developers to resolve multiple XSS conditions and harden web server
configurations.  The XSS conditions are resolved by upgrading to the
latest release but the arguably more important fix (configuration
change) must be manually applied to existing sites.

ReviewBoard admins are advised to upgrade and review your Apache/nginx
configurations to avoid access control bypass, code execution, and
xss.  I have prepared a blog post to explain the issues and provide
proof-of-concept/reproduction information:
