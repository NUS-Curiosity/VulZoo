Subject: Re: Special Issue "Threat Detection,
 Analysis and Defense" of JISA



It is, e.g. PhD students need papers published with high impact factors
for the PhD (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor [7]) and
are forced to give the rights to e.g. Elsevier for publishing. They lose
the right to publish them elsewhere (on their own or university
homepage). You can find facebook groups where students have access to
different journals and share those papers between each other, when a
department has no Elsevier subscription. It is a pain. Ask some PhD
students if you know some. They can tell you more.

Althought you submit your paper for free (or even pay for "corrections").
