The guys from NANOG are great indeed, but that's way above them :)

Deal with carrier is a one thing, silent deals with IX another. And 
surely they do both. You can also tap in many places when cable is going 
from/to the ocean (needs a carrier deal, so what? Easy.)

Also, there's a lot of carrier connectivity on wireless - think 
satellite, or directed micro waves links. It's much easier to use a 
satelite for say, a phone calls than connecting your XX islands with a 
fibre.

Guess what these guys are doing:
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Collection_Service
2. FORNSAT
3. SSO, which is the Special Source Operations division, the branch of 
NSA which taps cables, finds microwave paths, and otherwise collects 
data not generated by F6 or foreign satellites. (from Wikipedia)

I just wonder how many of the under water cable "repairs" were caused by 
a real incidents, and how many not really ;) There's no magic, you need 
to disconnect the cable for a while to tap it.
