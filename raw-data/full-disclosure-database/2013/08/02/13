Well, for a long time, the NSA was legally prohibited from spying on US citizens,
and the British CGHQ was similarly not allowed to spy on Her Majesty's subjects.

So we'd spy on Brits and they'd spy on our people and we'd have a data swap of
stuff, and everybody involved could with a clear conscience testify in a court
of law under oath that they never installed a network tap to spy on their own
people...

Of course, that seems to have eroded over the past decade or so and countries
no longer outsource their domestic surveillance...
