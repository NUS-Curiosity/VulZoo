	Menus - Multiple	Vulnerabilities

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2059823

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-066
  * Project: Monster Menus [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-07
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Monster Menus enables you to create granular page permissions, and apply them
to a hierarchical page structure. The mm_webform submodule enables you to
assign permissions derived from Monster Menus to webform forms.

The module doesn't sufficiently filter titles entered into page settings and
echoes the supplied title back to the next user editing the settings, thereby
allowing a Cross Site Scripting attack (XSS). This vulnerability is mitigated
by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to add pages to the
Monster Menus tree, and must also entice another user to edit the settings of
a maliciously-crafted page. The mm_webform submodule doesn't correctly
prohibit users with only "Who can read data submitted to this webform"
permission from deleting webform submissions leading to an Access Bypass.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have an
active login which is permitted to read a webform's submissions.
