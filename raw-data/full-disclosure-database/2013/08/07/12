	Services (RESTWS)	- Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2059603

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-062
  * Project: RESTful Web Services [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-07
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to expose Drupal entities as RESTful web services. It
provides a machine-readable interface to exchange resources in JSON, XML and
RDF.

The module doesn't sufficiently check for field level access when preforming
entity write operations on POST and PUT requests. It also does not check the
allowed filter formats for a user for formatted text fields, thereby allowing
an attacker to exploit XSS with a format that displays full HTML or even PHP
code execution with a PHP code format.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with a RESTWS permission such as "access resource node" and a permission to
write entities such as "create page content". PHP code execution is only
possible if the PHP module is enabled.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
