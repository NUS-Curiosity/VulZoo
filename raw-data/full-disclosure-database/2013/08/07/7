Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1701 CVE-2013-1709 CVE-2013-1710 CVE-2013-1713 
                 CVE-2013-1714 CVE-2013-1717

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version 
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors, 
missing permission checks and other implementation errors may lead to 
the execution of arbitrary code, cross-site scripting, privilege 
escalation, bypass of the same-origin policy or the installation of 
malicious addons.

The Iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no 
longer supported with security updates.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
