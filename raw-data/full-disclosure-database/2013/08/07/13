	Cross site request	forgery (CSRF)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2059599

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-064
  * Project: Mozilla Persona [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-07
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables users to sign into a Drupal website using Mozilla Persona
[3].

The module uses a security token to ensure that a sign-in request is made
from a web page that is participating in the current session. It was possible
for a security token that was not of type "string" to be accepted as correct
regardless of it's value, thereby bypassing the protection against cross site
request forgery.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker can only cause a
victim to become signed in to an account that the attacker already has the
ability to sign in to.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [4] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Persona 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.11

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Mozilla
Persona [5] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Mozilla Persona module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Persona
    7.x-1.11 [6]

Also see the Mozilla Persona [7] project page.
