Summary
=======

A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence System could allow a remote attacker to access the web server via a user account that is created with default credentials.

The vulnerability is due to a default user account being created at installation time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely accessing the web server and using the default account credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to log in with the default credentials, which gives them full administrative rights to the system.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.
