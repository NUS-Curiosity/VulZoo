	Groups - Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2059765

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-065
  * Project: Organic groups [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-07
  * Security risk: Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass, Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables users to create and manage their own 'groups'. Each group
can have subscribers, and maintains a group home page where subscribers
communicate amongst themselves.

The module allows any authenticated user to guess the node ID of private
groups, and subscribe to them without approval, thus being able to see their
content.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the permissions to subscribe
are set to allow without approval.

Furthermore, misconfiguration of the OG access fields (a.k.a visibility
fields) could have lead to nodes not being private even though a site admin
would expect them to be private, due to the group default setting.
This vulnerability is mitigated by requiring a non-default configuration
where the "Group visibility" field was not attached to the group node, and
only the "Group content visibility" was attached to the group-content node.
