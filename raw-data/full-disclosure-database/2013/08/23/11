Package        : python-django
Vulnerability  : cross-site scripting vulnerability
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no

Nick Brunn reported a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability in
python-django, a high-level Python web development framework.

The is_safe_url utility function used to validate that a used URL is on
the current host to avoid potentially dangerous redirects from
maliciously-constructed querystrings, worked as intended for HTTP and
HTTPS URLs, but permitted redirects to other schemes, such as
javascript:.

The is_safe_url function has been modified to properly recognize and
reject URLs which specify a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS, to prevent
cross-site scripting attacks through redirecting to other schemes.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze6.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.5.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
