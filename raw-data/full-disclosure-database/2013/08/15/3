Subject: Introducing Bletchley

I've made an initial release of Bletchley, which is a collection of
cryptanalysis tools I've been working on for a while.  The focus of the project
is to make black-box detection and exploitation of common cryptography problems
easier.  Bletchley is still in the early stages of development and consists of
tools which provide:

* Automated token encoding detection (36 encoding variants)
* Passive ciphertext block length and repetition analysis
* Script generator for efficient automation of HTTP requests
* A flexible, multithreaded padding oracle attack library with CBC-R support

More info can be found here:
  https://code.google.com/p/bletchley/

I'd love to hear any feedback.

Also note, I am teaching a 2-day course on application cryptanalysis class at
AppSec USA that will rely heavily on Bletchley to implement realistic attacks in
a lab environment. Schedule and info here:

Thanks,
