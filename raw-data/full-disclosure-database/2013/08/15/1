Subject: Simple Machines Forum (SMF) <= 2.0.5 - multiple
	vulnerabilities

According to

http://simplemachines.org/community/?topic=509417#msg3592194

Simple Machines Forum <= 2.0.5 (but > 1.1.*) is vulnerable to one or
more (currently undocumented) security issues.

The changes between v2.0.4 and 2.0.5 can be reviewed at
http://custom.simplemachines.org/upgrades/index.php?action=upgrade;file=smf_patch_2.0.5.tar.gz;smf_version=2.0.4

This is just a heads up, I haven't tried to look into those in detail.

CVE folks: If you'll handle this, please also check the last ones:
