Subject: XSS and FPD vulnerabilities in WPtouch and
	WPtouch Pro for WordPress

Hello list!

I want to inform you about vulnerabilities in WPtouch and WPtouch Pro 
plugins for WordPress.

These are Cross-Site Scripting and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities. 
These XSS holes are in ZeroClipboard.swf, which is used in the plugin. In 
February I wrote about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in ZeroClipboard 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Feb/103) and in multiple web 
applications.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of plugin WPtouch and WPtouch Pro.

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

XSS via id parameter and XSS via copying payload into clipboard (as 
described in my advisory).

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wptouch/wptouch.php

And other php-files in plugin folder and subfolders.

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wptouch-pro/error_log

In plugin folder and subfolders (at web sites where showing errors is off 
and they are saving into error_log).
