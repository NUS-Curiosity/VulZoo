Subject: ACCDE and macros

In Access 2003, the warnings shown when using Medium security level was useless unless you used digital signatures, because there was no way to open databases with macros disabled and because they always appear.

This changed in Access 2007, when they added support for opening MDB/ACCDB with unsafe macros disabled. Not MDE/ACCDE though, and you can't sign ACCDE either so the warning message is useless EXCEPT that you can rename one to ACCDB and it will still open so blocking ACCDE attachments is useless!
