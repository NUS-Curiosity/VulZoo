Subject: Re: Facebook allows disclosure of friends list.

Noting that I tried it myself just now had different results, and I'm not
sure if this is exploitable as easily as it originally seemed to be.


At his third image, the one that gives the three options 'google account',
'email', or 'smartphone', I clicked Continue. Instead of the page that he
showed, I got a page that sent me straight to gmail to reset my password.
Based on his image though, I dropped
https://www.facebook.com/recover/extended into the URL and got the
interface that he described which let me see my entire friend's list.


Then I tried to access a friend of mine's account, and got a different
interface. There were three links to email providers citing "follow one of
the links below to learn how to reset your email password with major email
providers", and a "I Cannot Access My Email" button. Clicking that, I got a
page at https://www.facebook.com/recover/extended/ineligible, which says:

 "We're sorry you're having trouble recovering your email address.

This was in a private browser session, so no cookies for facebook existed
(also in firefox, which I don't normally use anyway).

My speculation on this is that facebook keeps track of IPs that you
commonly log in from. If you are trying to recover your account from one of
said IPs, then it will give you an easier account recovery process.
