Same here, it seems to differ 

a) if phone is registered to facebook (maybe they send a code to it) 

b) if gmail is available 

My testaccount said "it cannot recover my data". Another account went to
the new email window, but had no option to chose the "friends" way. 

But the <username>@facebook.com worked.

Instead of the page that he showed, I got a page that sent me straight to gmail to reset my password. Based on his image though, I dropped https://www.facebook.com/recover/extended [3] into the URL and got the interface that he described which let me see my entire friend's list.

There were three links to email providers citing "follow one of the links below to learn how to reset your email password with major email providers", and a "I Cannot Access My Email" button. Clicking that, I got a page at https://www.facebook.com/recover/extended/ineligible [4], which says:
