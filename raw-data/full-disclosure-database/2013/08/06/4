persistent cross-site scripting
Description=================Usernoise is a "just works" modal contact
/ feedback form. It became responsive starting from 3.5 release. You
will not need to change even a line of code in your site.
Vulnerability=================The summary field is vulnerable to
persistent cross site scripting, and the affected area is the
Wordpress admin dashboard. The reason why this vulnerability exists is
because the user input is not being properly handled when a feedback
is submitted. It accepts any type of arbitrary code, including
JavaScript, and when the content is displayed in the feedback section
in the dashboard, all JavaScript code is executed causing a sever
vulnerability with administrators as the target.
