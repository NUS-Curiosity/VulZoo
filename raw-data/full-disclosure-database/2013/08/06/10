You don't need to know it. [vanityname]@facebook.com should work just fine.
For example, if my Facebook URL were:

http://facebook.com/adampapsynet

Then you'd be able to reference that account using adampapsynet@...ebook.com
.

That was the biggest shocker to me, when they started auto-creating those
emails without the user's knowledge or control. It went from needing two
things (email/pass) to access an account to just one (pass) - same with
recovery things (like above).

I'm one of the (seemingly few) people who've actually received a bounty
from them though. Figured it'd be the min $500, and they offered/sent
$1500. I was pretty happy.
