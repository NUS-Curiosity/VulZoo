Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-068 - Entity API
	- Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2065207

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-068
  * Project: Entity API [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-14
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Entity API module extends the entity API of Drupal core in order to
provide a unified way to deal with entities and their properties.

The module doesn't sufficiently enforce node access restrictions when
checking for a user's access to view a comment associated with a particular
node. The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only applies to a
user's access to view a comment in a situation where access should be
restricted with entity access.

The Entity API also does not properly restrict access when displaying
selected entities using the Views field or area plugins, allowing users to
view entities that they do not have access to. The vulnerability is mitigated
by the fact that entities are only improperly exposed when a View has been
configured to display them in a field, header or footer of a View.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED

module, there is nothing you need to do.
