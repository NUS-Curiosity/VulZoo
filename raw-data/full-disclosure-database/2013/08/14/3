Subject: Re: CALEA & Re: XKeyscore

Now that you have kindly explained your point, i must say This has been a wonderful discussion. It has certainly shed some additional light into how CALEA can be used domestically for other functions not part of its intended purpose.

Now that I have basked in the limelight of my 5 minutes of fame... I will diminish, and crawl back to my cave to admire the glistening shine of my precious.

If someone can sing me a song, a lullaby if you will, that briefly touches on how the hell XK can claim they will decrypt VPN user traffic... that would be just dandy.

Does or Does not the NSA Â have the keys to decrypt common 3DES traffic?
