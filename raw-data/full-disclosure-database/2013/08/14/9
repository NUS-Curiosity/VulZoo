	Policy - XSS

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2065387

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-069
  * Project: Password policy [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-14
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to specify a certain level of password complexity
(aka. "password hardening") for user passwords in Drupal by defining a
password policy.

When viewing and editing a password policy, the module doesn't sufficiently
filter the form text field input and display for the "Password Expiration
Warning" field.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "Administer policies" to create and edit password
policies.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Password policy 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.5.
  * Password policy 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Password
policy [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

    policy 6.x-1.6 [5]

    Password policy 7.x-1.5 [6]
