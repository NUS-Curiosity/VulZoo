Subject: Subverting BIND's SRTT Algorithm: Derandomizing
	NS Selection

Hi,

BIND is exposed to a new vulnerability which can be exploited remotely
in order to derandomize the name server selection algorithm.
Exploitation of this vulnerability can be used in conjunction with
other off-path DNS cache poisoning exploits in order to make them more
efficient. ISC has acknowledged the vulnerability and plans to address
this deficiency by re-implementing the SRTT algorithm in future
maintenance releases of the BIND 9 code.
