The SNMP theory is a pretty horrible one.

Firewalls and ACLs both block SNMP at ISPs

Even if you it did suddenly allow the NSA/whoever to SPAN a port the amount
of traffic would be extremely obvious.

If you were going to do this passive optical taps would be easy, cost
effective, and non intrusive(once installed)
