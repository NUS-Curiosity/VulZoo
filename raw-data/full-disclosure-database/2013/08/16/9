Subject: t2'13: Challenge to be released 2013-09-07 10:00
	EEST

It is that time of the year again - we’re pleased to announce the
release of the t2’13 Challenge!

Soon after t2’12 was over, we discovered that the conference had been 
infiltrated by an APT. Our best guess is that the APT pwned the laptop 
of one of the conference organizers and successfully exfiltrated some 
data. Luckily for us, our beloved APT got so hammered on the conference 
dinner on Thursday that he forgot his USB thumb drive to Zetor. We are 
confident that this OPSEC blunder will lead us to what was stolen but 
despite our best efforts we have not been able to decipher the contents 
of the USB drive. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to 
recover the stolen content.

The first person to recover all content will win a free ticket to 
t2’13 conference. In addition to this, the creators of the Challenge 
will select another winner among the next ten correct answers. The 
criteria for the other selection is the elegance of the answer. In 
short, you can win with both speed and style.

The t2’13 Challenge will be released 2013-09-07 10:00 EEST right here 
at http://t2.fi/

Good luck,

   T

pS. Seriously, this is even better than last year ;)
