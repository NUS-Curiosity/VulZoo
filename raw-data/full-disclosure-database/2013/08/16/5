About the JoinSEC London



Designed by Information Security professionals



The Information Security has been one of the most increasing concerns
worldwide. Everyday new attacks and counter attacks emerge, making it
impossible for professionals to keep themselves up to date.



The JoinSEC London (first edition) intends to convene busy IT and
Information Security Professionals with very little time to learn new
technologies or just deepen their knowledge on IT security tools and
techniques. With this in mind we gathered a group of hand picked
internationally renowned professionals to share their expertise with all
participants through training sessions and workshops.



We would like to invite the information security community to submit papers
and projects proposals.



All presentations and techniques presented and demonstrated during the
event, should be used to prevent and defense mechanisms, by industry,
technology professionals, academics, researchers, system administrators,
and other stakeholders.



Speakers will be given a 30 to 40 minutes slot, *except* for workshops or
training sessions.



Note: *If the speaker are not from UK, the organization will try (is not
guaranteed) to support some of the traveling expenses, but it will be
evaluated case by case.*
