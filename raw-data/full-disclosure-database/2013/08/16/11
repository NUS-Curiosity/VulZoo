Let's check how massive that "attack" is.

He said above 30 packets per second, right? I'll just assume it's around 30.
And the sample packet from that "packet storm" contained this part: "LEN=52".
So that's around 1500 bytes per second, or 12 kilobits per second. And those
packets are downstream for him.

Now take a look at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem#List_of_dialup_speeds>.
A good modem connection can give you up to 56kbit/s per direction as far as I
understand. So unless I made some weird calculation errors, someone on a good
modem connection should be able to take that "attack" without any problems.

An "attack" from one (!) bot on a normal DSL line should already be much bigger.

Calling this a DoS attack would be ridiculous, calling it a DDoS even more so.

(Of course, it might still be that he really was hacked and his systems were
attacked in a smarter way, but it's very clear that nobody tried to take him
out with pure bandwidth.)
