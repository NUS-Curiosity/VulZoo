I met him a few years ago at BankXXXX technology gathering where we both spoke (it was organized by Jason XXXXX who is now the CSO of BankYYYY). He gave his ATM hacking talk. Interesting, but not all that difficult! Turns out that our work designing systems that are hard(er) to hack is much more difficult than breaking poorly built ancient systems.
