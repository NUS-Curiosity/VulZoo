The US does that.

In 'The Spy Factory' (http://video.pbs.org/video/1051968443/) from
2009, the producers interviewed the AT&T technicians who worked at the
COs where the taps occur. They also interviewed a US Army analyst who
listen in on the calls.

Since the video, there's been a number of documents circulating about
the practice. See, for example,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind_(code_name).
