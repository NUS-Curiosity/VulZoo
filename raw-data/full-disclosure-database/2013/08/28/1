          CVE Name        Pending                                             

    Description  A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the     
                 SIP channel driver if an ACK with SDP is received after the  
                 channel has been terminated. The handling code incorrectly   
                 assumes that the channel will always be present.             

    Resolution  A check has now been added which only parses SDP and applies  
                it if an Asterisk channel is present.                         
                                                                              
                Note that Walter Doekes, OSSO B.V., is responsible for        
                diagnosing and providing the fix for this issue.
