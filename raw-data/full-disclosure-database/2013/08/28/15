Subject: Vulnerabilities in multiple plugins for WordPress
	with GDD FLVPlayer

Hello list!

These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in 
multiple web applications with GDD FLVPlayer. Earlier I wrote about 
vulnerabilities in GDD FLVPlayer 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Aug/247). This is video and audio 
player, which is used at thousands web sites and in multiple web 
applications.

Among them are the next themes for WordPress: I Love It (I wrote about it 
earlier http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jul/116), Megusta, 
Multipress, Lolzine, V1. Also this flash video and audio player is used as 
standalone web application in many custom themes and in different CMS 
(WordPress, Joomla) in non-themes folders.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are web applications which are using GDD FLVPlayer v3.635 and 
previous versions.

Vulnerable are all versions of the next web applications: I Love It, 
Megusta, Multipress, Lolzine, V1.

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

GDD FLVPlayer was developed by GeDeDe.

XSS (via Flash Injection) (WASC-08):

I Love It:

Multipress:

Lolzine:

V1:

http://site/wp-content/themes/v1/flv/gddflvplayer.swf?mylogo=xss.swf

http://site/wp-content/themes/v1/flv/gddflvplayer.swf?splashscreen=xss.swf

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

All mentioned themes have FPD vulnerabilities in php-files (in index.php and 
others), which is typically for WP themes.

http://site/wp-content/themes/iloveit/

http://site/wp-content/themes/megusta/

http://site/wp-content/themes/multipress/

http://site/wp-content/themes/Lolzine/

http://site/wp-content/themes/v1/

In the last theme the path can be v1, v1.0, v1.3.5 and other variants. And 
at some web sites Jplayer (about multiple vulnerabilities in which I wrote 
earlier) is used instead of GDD FLVPlayer.

These are examples of XSS and FPD vulnerabilities, examples of 8 Ð¡S 
vulnerabilities see in above-mentioned advisory.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/6731/).
