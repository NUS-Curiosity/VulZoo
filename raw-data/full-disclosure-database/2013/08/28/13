Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-072 - Node View
	Permissions -	Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2076315

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-072
  * Project: Node View Permissions [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Node View Permissions module adds permissions "View own content" and
"View any content" for each content type on the permissions page.
However, it only implements hook_node_access() and not hook_query_alter(),
which means any listing of nodes does not respect the node view permission.

    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

Permissions [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
