Subject: Google Docs Clickjacking / Information Disclosure

I reported this problem to Google in June but I did not get the usual reply
saying they were working on it, so I guess it isn't serious enough to be
fixed.

The problem is the page for requesting access to a private document. It
does not have any protection against being framed, so you can make a
private document, trick someone into clicking the button to request access
and get an email from Google Docs with their full name and email address.
