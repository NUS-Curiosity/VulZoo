Subject: Vulnerabilities in multiple web applications with
	GDD FLVPlayer

Hello list!

These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in 
multiple web applications with GDD FLVPlayer. Earlier I've wrote about 
vulnerabilities in GDD FLVPlayer 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Aug/247). This is video and audio 
player, which is used at thousands web sites and in multiple web 
applications.

Among them are Order Master Pro, CMS Pask (Pixelwerk admin), gddflvplayer 
for MODx, Pixelfind Administrator, WHMCompleteSolution. And other web 
applications. Also this flash video and audio player is used at many web 
sites as standalone web application.

Vulnerable are web applications which are using GDD FLVPlayer v3.635 and 
previous versions.
