	Site Scripting

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2071157

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-070
  * Project: Zen [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-August-21
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Zen theme is a very popular base/starter theme.

Zen doesn't sufficiently escape the breadcrumb separator field, allowing a
possible XSS exploit.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer themes".


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Zen 7.x-3.x versions prior to 7.x-3.2.
  * Zen 7.x-5.x versions prior to 7.x-5.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Zen [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Zen theme for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Zen 7.x-3.2 [5] or Zen
    7.x-5.4 [6].

Also see the Zen [7] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY  
---------------------------------------------------------

  * Daniel Nitsche [8]

-------- FIXED BY  
------------------------------------------------------------

  * John Albin Wilkins [9], the theme maintainer

-------- COORDINATED BY  
------------------------------------------------------
