Subject: HackInTheBox CTF Weapons of Mass Destruction: War
	of the World

HackInTheBox Capture The Flag Malaysia is now back with more firepower 
and epic pwnage!

#-------------------------#
#    A Bit of Histrory    #
#-------------------------#

In our previous CTF (Fallout Apocalypse), each team had a set of 
daemons (called the Reactor Cores, or RC) running on their machines. 
Every solved RC granted the solving team with a Weaponized SCADA Exploit 
(WSE) that can be used to damage rival team’s’ RC. Teams could also bid 
for exploits of certain RC on the Black Market using the currency 
LeetCash (LC). Each team started with an equal amount of LC and they 
generated LC by keeping their RCs up and running.

#    Moving On to 2013...    #
#----------------------------#

Sponsored again by Trustwave Spiderlabs, CTF WMD: War of the World 
(referred to as WMD:WotW) will see teams given a ‘country’ which they’re 
required to protect their daemons  represented by Government Centers 
(GC), Finance Centers (FC), and Business Centers (BC). They are also 
required to launch attacks against rival teams’ countries. Teams will 
also be given side challenges (from categories such as forensic, 
reversing, network analysis (pcap), steganography and cryptography) that 
can be accessed by solving daemons. Nukes that are capable of completely 
destroying a rival team’s daemon can be unlocked by solving bonus 
challenges.
