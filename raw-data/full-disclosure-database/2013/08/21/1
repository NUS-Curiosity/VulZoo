Subject: Sparty : A SharePoint and FrontPage Security
	Auditing Tool !

Hi All

Sparty is an open source tool written in python to audit web
applications using SharePoint
and FrontPage architecture. The motivation behind this tool is to
provide an easy and robust
way to scrutinize the security configurations of SharePoint and
FrontPage based web applications.
Due to the complex nature of these web administration software, it is
required to have a simple
and efficient tool that gathers information, check access permissions,
dump critical information
 from default files and perform automated exploitation if security risks
are identified.

It still in its first version and more updates will be made in next version.
