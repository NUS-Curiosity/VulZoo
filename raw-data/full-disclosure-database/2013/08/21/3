Subject: Last (short) chance to submit papers for PacSec
	in Tokyo Nov 13-14. Deadline FRIDAY.

Since we didn't mail out to the traditional mailing lists for the PacSec CFP this year, this note is being sent out, and
we are allowing submissions to secwest13@...sec.jp up until this Friday, August 23.  

After more than ten years, you know the drill, and if you don't CFP details are on the website.

thanks,
