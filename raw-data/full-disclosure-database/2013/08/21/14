Subject: Vulnerabilities in Avaya IP Office Customer Call
	Reporter

Hello list!

I want to warn you about vulnerabilities in Avaya IP Office Customer Call
Reporter. These are Remote HTML Include and Remote XSS Include (Cross-Site
Scripting) vulnerabilities.

After I found multiple vulnerabilities in Avaya IP Office Customer Call
Reporter in December, I informed ZDI about them (critical ones). ZDI was
very slow in processing these holes (regardless of my remindings) and only
at 30th of July they begun actively working with them. I wrote about this
case with ZDI in WASC Mailing List
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-July/008883.html).

When Avaya ignored my informing in July and ZDI stopped working on this case
in August (since Avaya was not responding to them also), I published these
two vulnerabilities (the least critical). There are many other
vulnerabilities, including critical holes which allow to take control over
admin panel, so Avaya still has a chance to get details of vulnerabilities
in their product before public disclosure.

-------------------------
Affected products:

Vulnerable are Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter 8.0.9.13 (tested in
December 2012) and 9.0.0.0 (tested recently) and previous versions.
