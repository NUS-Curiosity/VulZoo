Introduction:
=============
Microsoft Online Services is Microsoft`s hosted-software offering and a component of their software plus services strategy.
Microsoft Online Services are hosted by Microsoft and sold `with` Microsoft partners. The suite includes Exchange Online, 
SharePoint Online, Office Communications Online, Microsoft Forefront, and Microsoft Office Live Meeting. For businesses, 
the Software-plus-Services approach enables organizations to access the capabilities of enterprise software through on-premises 
servers, as online services, or a combination of both, depending on specific business requirements. Services also provide the 
option to add complementary capabilities that enhance on-premises server software and simplify system management and maintenance.

Affected Products:
==================
Microsoft Corporation
Product: Security Response Center (MSRC) - Blog aspx Web Application 2013 Q2


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Low


Details:
========
It has been discovered that the file `ssfeedgenerator.aspx` is not validating the input parameters and hence is vulnerable 
to remote xss attacks. Since no validation is being performed, it is possible to include remote xml files to be parsed and 
displayed on the main microsoft website. A remote attacker can include malicious xml files via URLS variable which can lead 
to remote java-script execution on the client machine within the context of microsoft.com website.

The vulnerability is located in the rssfeedgenerator.aspx\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" file and the vulnerable parameter is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'URLs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' which can be exploited 
via GET method to include remote (external) xml files. 

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires no privilege application user account but low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non persistent phishing, non persistent malware 
injects, external redirects and manipulation of affected module  or application context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] RSS Feeds

Vulnerable Path:
                                [+] /security/msrc/rssfeedgenerator.aspx

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] rssfeedgenerator.aspx

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] URLs


Proof of Concept:
=================
The client side web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privilege application user account and with low user interaction.
For demonstration or reproduce ...
