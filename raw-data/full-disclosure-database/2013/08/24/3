Hash: SHA1

CVE-2013-2192: Apache Hadoop Man in the Middle Vulnerability

Severity: Severe

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
All versions of Hadoop 2.x prior to Hadoop 2.0.6-alpha.
All versions of Hadoop 0.23.x prior to Hadoop 0.23.9.
All versions of Hadoop 1.x prior to Hadoop 1.2.1.

Users affected: Users who have enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features.

Impact: RPC traffic from clients, potentially including authentication
credentials, may be intercepted by a malicious user with access to run
tasks or containers on a cluster.

Description:
The Apache Hadoop RPC protocol is intended to provide bidirectional
authentication between clients and servers. However, a malicious server or
network attacker can unilaterally disable these authentication checks. This
allows for potential reduction in the configured quality of protection of
the RPC traffic, and privilege escalation if authentication credentials are
passed over RPC.

Mitigation:
Users of Hadoop 1.x versions should immediately upgrade to 1.2.1 or later.
Users of Hadoop 0.23.x versions should immediately upgrade to 0.23.9 or
later.
Users of Hadoop 2.x versions prior to 2.0.6-alpha should immediately
upgrade to 2.0.6-alpha or later.
