Pedro Ribeiro and Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala discovered multiple 
vulnerabilities in various tools shipped by the tiff library. Processing 
a malformed file may lead to denial of service or the execution of 
arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze10.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
