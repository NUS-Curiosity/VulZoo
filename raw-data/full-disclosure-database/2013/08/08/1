Subject: Two Vulnerabilities in NetworkMiner : DLL
	Hijacking + Directory Traversal

Security Advisory ID: NETRESEC-1386968
http://netresec.com/?b=1386968

NetworkMiner version 1.4.1 and older is vulnerable to DLL hijacking
and contains a directory traversal vulnerability.

==Description==
NetworkMiner is a tool designed for network forensics and network
security monitoring. It is primarily used in order to analyze captured
network traffic in PCAP files, but can also be used for live sniffing.
NetworkMiner uses Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLLs) for parts of its
functionality. The location of these DLLs are not specified using a
fully qualified path name, which makes the application vulnerable to
DLL hijacking. The DLL hijacking can occur if NetworkMiner is used to
open a pcap file from an attacker-controlled directory.
An important part of NetworkMiner's functionality is the ability to
extract files from sniffed network traffic. NetworkMiner supports file
extraction from protocols such as HTTP, FTP, TFTP, SMB, SMTP and the
OSCAR protocol (used by AOL's ICQ and AIM). Files extracted from
network traffic are written to a sub-directory of NetworkMiner called
”AssembledFiles”. However, due to a directory traversal vulnerability
in NetworkMiner, a malicious PCAP file loaded by NetworkMiner can
cause files to be written to directories other than ”AssembledFiles”.

==Impact==
Both vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
on the victim's machine. For an attack to be successful the victim
must open a specially crafted malicious PCAP file or open a PCAP file
from an insecure location.

==Solution==
These two vulnerabilities have been fixed in NetworkMiner 1.5 and
NetworkMiner Professional 1.5.

Customers who have purchased a previous version of NetworkMiner
Professional can download an update for free from our customer portal.

==Credit Statement==
We would like to thank Alyssa Milburn for reporting the directory
traversal vulnerability and Ucha Gobejishvili for reporting the DLL
hijacking vulnerability.
