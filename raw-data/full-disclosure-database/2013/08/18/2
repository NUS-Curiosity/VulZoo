(a) Because 75% of the Internet doesn't allow spoofing of source addresses,
and (b) Although there's a chance that one machine throwing 3,000 SYN
packets a second will show up on somebody's network monitor, you're never
going to see 3,000 network monitors pop on 1 SYN packet per second.

And oh yeah, (c) sometimes you don't want to spoof the connection but
want to actually *make* the connection, in order to send them stuff that
will consume even more system resources than just a dangling half-open
connection....

Remember - *you* are the guy who thinks that a DDoS is just bandwidth, it's
going to take you a while to look in your Apache logs. And then it's going to
take you even longer to twig into what's going on, because it all looks like
normal traffic until you pay attention to the timestamps. And then you'll find
it's *very* hard to block requests that belong to a malicious attack because
they look *real similar* to legitimate traffic.  Sometimes, they look identical.

You don't believe me - ask anybody who's site has ever folded under the load
after they got mentioned on Slashdot.  Every single hit looked like a
legitimate request - because it *was* a legitimate request coming from an
actual like human using a browser. Sure - you can then turn around and put in a
filter for references to your homepage to "stop" the attack.

But then you're just cutting off your nose to spite your face, because now
your legitimate customers/readers/visitors/whatever can't actually use your
site either.

Near as I can tell, they've stopped teaching Evil 101 to the newbies. Doesn't
anybody spend any time anymore thinking about "Wow, if I'm going to attack
this site, what can I do to maximize the pain per packet?"
