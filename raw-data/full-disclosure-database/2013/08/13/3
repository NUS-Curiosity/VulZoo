The red dots are basically showing places where NSA can intercept 
communication. Any communication. Ever heard about radio links?

Oh wait, NSA was intercepting Soviet communication for ages, including 
the "private" phone from communist leaders car phone. I bet they didn't 
agree, either ;)

Man, you just created a mental loop in what you said. So, two lines 
earlier you said Chavez / Putin would not allow them to intercept 
communication by means of taping cables and now you are saying that ... 
NSA was able to install a quite complicated distributed architecture in 
Moscow. I'm sure mr Putin would be happy to talk with you and it might 
be an experience you could brag about all day and night long. You should 
definitely call him.

You don't need to intercept Russian traffic in Russia. Ever heard about 
Internet Exchange Points? The traffic will, sooner or later, leave the 
country. And if it does not, and stays local, and you have no local 
means, you are out of luck. No magic there, only a network design.

Cisco architecture is there, like there are many others. And it's just 
one of the brands. You just use best means you have for the situation. 
And it's accidentally managed by SNMP... so what? It could be telnet, 
who cares.

These days you just mix and match all the technologies you have for 
intercepting. And whenever you can tap the cable, you do it, because it 
gives you the best bang for the buck.

Red dots are most likely (guessing here) - we can have data from there. 
It does not mean "everything" but something. To show off to everyone how 
great we, the NSA are. What the heck, you need slides like that for the 
budget planning.

Seriously, decide what do you want to say ;)
