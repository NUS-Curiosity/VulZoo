Working for a mobile operator I have some minimal experience.

Police or whoever needs to or wants to tap info uses a Corba based client
for the purpose. On the SGSNs reside the Corba server side of LI. Traffic
goes out via ipsec vpn. There are docs from 3gpp to cover the architecture
but not really enough to reverse engineer. LI is a licensed feature. Where
I work only SGSNs have the license not GGSNs

The LI MIbs quoted in the thread are probably useless since they will only
provide counters to "things" not the "things"
