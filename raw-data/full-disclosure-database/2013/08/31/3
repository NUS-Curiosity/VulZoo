Subject: Re: Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part
 9): erroneous documentation

I'm on the same page as Pascal, what is the point of this? The part
that really stands out for me is how Microsoft is being singled out
here. If it's about their documentation, then it's not really about a
vulnerability. If it's NOT about their documentation, then you'd be
hard pressed to find a platform that _doesn't_ work this way.
