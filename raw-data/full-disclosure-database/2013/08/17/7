Maybe I'm being a dick, and maybe I'm being a dick for no reason, but I
don't think I'm being a _stupid_ dick.

He was talking about a DDoS. Right, a DoS is just an attempt to make some kind
of service unavailable, but a DDoS is an attemt to make a system unavailable
by flooding it with an overwhelming amount of traffic from multiple sources.
IMO mentioning a DDoS implies "massive".

And yes, you're right, a DoS attack can be unsuccessful. My point was that
this small amount of traffic shouldn't be called a DDoS because there's no
way that the intention behind this amount of traffic was to take down that
service with pure bandwidth.

Heh, you have a point.

Uh, he didn't use it as a verb. He used the noun "storm", and two times, he
said "packet storm". I read "packet storm" as "a storm of packets", so my
interpretation is that he was talking about a storm on the packet level.

If you have a look at the Jargon File, you'll see that in the context of
IT, a "storm" usually means something that is characterized by massive
amounts of network activity. A packet storm then would be something that looks
like a really big amount of activity on the network level, right?

Why would you call 30 packets per second an attack unless that actually impacts
your system? It was an ironic statement intended to hint at the possibility
that the OP was mistaken about what exactly impacted his system.

Right.

Tough question. No, seriously, to me this means that he piped his firewall logs
or so into some command-line commands without making really sure that the
commands extract exactly the data he wants. Therefore, this line means for me
that there's a high possibility of totally unrelated IPs being in that list
that just happened to communicate with his system at the wrong time. For me,
this line makes the validity of that whole list very questionable.

That's right. I assumed that the traffic was highly uniform because:
 - as far as I know, traffic usually is relatively uniform in attacks
 - he picked this one line and apparently thought that it was sufficient
   to give us an idea of what the attack traffic looked like (otherwise,
   he would have shown us a bunch of lines and not just one because his
   intent here obviously was to illustrate the nature of the attack,
   right?)
Well, maybe I jumped to conclusions here, but I don't think so.

Right.

Oh, interesting. So even back then, connections were asymmetric?

True, but he said "DDoS" and "packet storm".

Right, that kind of DoS attack is obviously more effective and doesn't require
the attacker to use a "storm" of packets.

Yes, true, if the log really was currupted in a very weird way.

Well, I've tried to explain those assumptions now.

OK, to help with the "clueless" part: Here's the original for that mysterious
binary he posted:

g 13 20:51:04 tagesuhu user.warn kernel: [hammer] : IN=vlan2 OUT= MAC=00:21:27:fa:dd:44:00:15:f9:2a:9f:d9:08:00:45:00:00:34 SRC=216.245.221.107 DST=189.38.235.250 LEN=52 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=48 ID=15314 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=2956 DPT=8123 WINDOW=65535 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0

He somehow managed to mess up his logfile to be byte-swapped, just as if
someone had sent it through "dd conv=swab". I don't know how
he ended up with that, but that doesn't look like such a malicious, evil attack
to me. :D
