How quickly they forget....

Not all DDoS are pure bandwidth based.  Consider SYN flooding, where the
packets sent are relatively small and often not even all that frequent, but can
tie up large amounts of resources on the target machine. This sort of attack
works particularly well against sites that have a big blind spot because they
think that all DDoS attacks are massive bandwidth hosedowns.

How many connections/sec does it take to forkbomb your Apache server into
uselessness?  And if you rate limit your Apache so your system doesn't
forkbomb, how many does it take to prevent legitimate traffice from being
serviced?
