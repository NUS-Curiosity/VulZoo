Hello Bart, how's life today?!

Apart from this code I found and some offline hours, I could not
identify any real damage on my system. I agree with you this packet
storm shouldn't have succeeded on driving my machine offline and I still
don't know why it could do it.

To clarify the issue: (i) my ISP is not the most trusted one. The link
speed often changes and sometimes gets real lame. (ii) The attacker
might have tried to reach my tor server, but he could not do it. The
firewall that caught these transmissions is on a different guard
machine. (iii) there are more services and machines protected by this
guard machine and various of them were online at the time the attack
started. (iv) though I said the attack endured at least three hours, it
did not take me three hours to notice it and I unplugged the machine
much earlier, so the total packet count and max packet rate are not the
real picture, but just the representation of what the machine flagged
when it was connected. 

The binary is a corrupted part of "/var/log/messages". From what I know,
it could be the attack triggered some hidden bug and that's all. But it
could also be that the attacker had previously gathered useful info on
my system and new this would happen. So I won't leave much space to
chance.

That said, I'm no expert on assembly, hex and lowlevel computing. So it
may take quite some time before I understand the issue. If you find
something useful on happy hacking times, please do tell me.

Finally, I'm glad you found this address from outside limestone. Since
there were mani IP's, I randomly tested 20 or so and all of them were
inside limestone so I jumped to the conclusion that all addresses were
inside.

Happy debian b-day!
