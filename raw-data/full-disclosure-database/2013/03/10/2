Subject: CS and XSS vulnerabilities in SWFUpload

Hello list!

These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in 
SWFUpload.

This is very popular flash-file, which is used at tens millions of web sites 
and in hundreds of web applications (such as WordPress, only this web 
application is used at more then 62 millions of web sites according to 
wordpress.com).

Last year I've wrote about XSS vulnerability in swfupload in WordPress 
(http://securityvulns.ru/docs28759.html) and in many other web applications. 
Neal Poole wrote in April 2012, when he disclosed XSS vulnerability in one 
swf-file in WordPress (CVE-2012-3414), that none developers of SWFUpload 
support their software. This application is still not maintained. Earlier 
I've informed two developers (on their e-mails) about these new 
vulnerabilities, but without any response from them, which was predictable 
due to Neal's experience.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of SWFUpload - SWFUpload v2.2.0.1 and previous 
versions. And all web applications with affected versions of SWFUpload are 
vulnerable. There are many such web applications, about many of them I've 
wrote last year, like WordPress.

Vulnerable are versions WordPress 2.5 - 3.3.1. The fixed version of 
swfupload.swf in WP 3.3.2 contain fix as for previous XSS, as for these CS 
and XSS vulnerabilities.

File swfupload.swf is bundled with WordPress 2.7 - 3.3.1. File 
swfupload_f9.swf is bundled with WordPress 2.5 - 2.7.1. In versions WP 2.7 - 
2.7.1 both flash-files are contained.

-----
Fix:
-----

Use swfupload.swf from WordPress 3.3.2 and higher versions.

----------
Details:
----------

There are different names of files of SWFUpload: swfupload.swf, 
swfupload_f9.swf, swfupload_f8.swf, swfupload_f10.swf and swfupload_f11.swf. 
All of them are vulnerable, except swfupload.swf bundled with WordPress 
since version 3.3.2.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://site/swfupload.swf?buttonText=test%3Cimg%20src=%27http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/images/logo.gif%27%3E

It's possible to inject text, images and html (e.g. for link injection).

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/swfupload.swf?buttonText=%3Ca%20href=%27javascript:alert(document.cookie)%27%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS.
