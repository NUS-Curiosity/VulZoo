You can report next issue to the plugins<snip>wordpress.org address and they will
remove the plugin from showing up in plugin index site[1] or whatever it is
called and users can't install it using WordPress administrator-interface before
developer of the plugin has fixed the vulnerability. I will send the
plugins-guys email right now to get the process on-going. You can also directly
contact me in case you need help coordinating issues. Have a great day.
