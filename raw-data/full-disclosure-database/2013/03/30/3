I'm sorry, but since when got Full Disclosure a list for random things?
Sure its sad somebody died but hundreds die everyday and nobody gives a fuck...

In my opinion this is not the right place to discuss this bullshit. It just
shows that americans think they're the top of the world...
Just because some idiot killed somebody else... Go to africa, ask them for
sympathy when their kids die one at a day, every day...
I'd like to see that...

For now, can we please go back to topic? The Charter is beeing posted here many
times, why not sticking to it for once, shall we?


Best regards from Finland,

Daniel Preussker


PS: No offense meant, if you feel offended, delete the mail and ignore me and
