Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2266
Debian Bug     : 704174

Matthew Horsfall of Dyn, Inc. discovered that BIND, a DNS server, is
prone to a denial of service vulnerability. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially-crafted DNS query to named that, when
processed, would cause named to use an excessive amount of memory, or
possibly crash.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze10.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
