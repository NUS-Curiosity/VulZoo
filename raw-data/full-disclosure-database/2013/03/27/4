I know this is a security board but this hits a little to close to home for me.

On/off boyfriend and gf, she was at his place and then was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head. Neither one tested for gunshot residue on their hands and the gun didnt have any prints.

His mom, dad, 2? local pd and a lawyer were on the scene before the primary murder investivators. The suspect was allowed to enter a restroom and change clothes is all that ISP reported since they didnt observe him. They walked into a crime scene with possibly a shooter and let him go to another room? Let alone to change clothes and wash his hands or?

Illinois State Police allowed the suspect to change clothes is all they report. After all were done talking, he was allowed to go to Denny's for breakfast. He has yet to cooperate with police.

The twist. His mom and dad are Police in a neighboring county. They were on scene before anyone, except the lawyer or cleaner of the gun.

They had a coroner's inquest. Undetermined.
The parents were allowed to ask police 3 questions of the investigators and states attorney. WTF? (Why did that asshole kill my daughter?)

if you need a laugh look up Carbondale, IL Police. They cant do shit right. A few years ago one tried to rob a bank. At least he was off duty.

If you think you have it bad, think of Molly's family. I feel sorry for Ritchie Minton, the ex. No matter what, he's done for. He is a punk and needs dealt with. Look up his myspace. Thats all thats left but last I checked it was open and full of crazy shit. Maybe a plot for crazy? They use truth serium now...

I love that shit!

I wish Ritchie the best no matter what. He's gonna pay for it the rest of his life.

Join this group and lets kick Illinois corruption in the ass! (At least some of it)

3/24/12 Molly Young was found dead in her exboyfriends apartment. He is a dispatcher for Carbondale, IL pd and his parents work in a neighboring county at police departments.

Ritchie Minton was allowed to change clothes and use the restroom when police arrived. Since her death he has not cooperated except by getting a dui. (guilty conscience is my guess)

we know she is dead but no one is saying how. It was his gun! It had NO PRINTS! How does your own personal gun have no prints? (Obstruction and evidence tamering)

She was shot in the left side of her head but is right handed.
His family says she was depressed and did it herself. (she's like 5'2, 100 pounds and used her left hand to hold a .45 to her head AND shoot and managed to not leave prints?)

When Illinois state police arrived his mom and dad were there. Also his lawyer. So this sick fuck called mommy and daddy before 911... They trampled on all the evidence and mean while her family and friends sit, waiting for no resolution.

If he was my son, we would know what happened. I pray for an ending. If it was an accident, fine. MAN THE FUCK UP! To Ritchie and his dad. Fucking punk assholes... To serve and protect (their own) Justice, you get what you pay for...
