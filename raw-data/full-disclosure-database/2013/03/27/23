Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-037 - Rules -
	Cross Site Scripting	(XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1954592

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-037
  * Project: Rules [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-March-27
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Rules module allows site administrators to define conditionally executed
actions based on occurring events (known as reactive or ECA rules). It's a
replacement with more features for the trigger module in core.

The module contains a persistent cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due
to the fact that it fails to sanitize rule tags before display.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer rules".


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
