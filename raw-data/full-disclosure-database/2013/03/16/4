Subject: Critical issue affecting EA Origin users

We have just released a paper [1], in which we prove that the EA Origin
platform can be used as an excellent attack vector to exploit local issues
remotely.

EA Origin [2] is one of the biggest gaming related digital delivery platforms
with a user-base of more than 40 million people, supporting several
different platforms including Windows and MacOS.

A video [3] summarizing the issue is available.
