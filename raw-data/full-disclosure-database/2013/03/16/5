> Affected Version:       < 3.1.1.2
> Vulnerability:          Polycom Command Shell Grants System-Level Access
> Risk:                   LOW

>
> Overview:
>
> The Polycom Command Shell is a command-line based administrative interface
> to the Polycom HDX system. It can be accessed either via a RS-232 serial
> connection or via telnet on port 23.
>
> Description:
>
> The Polycom Command Shell can be used to view and also change several
> settings of the system. However it can also be used to get system-level
> access (i.e. root access) to the HDX system. The "printenv" and "setenv"
> commands can be used to read and write variables respectively which are
> stored in flash memory.
>
> The easiest way to get root access to the HDX system is to enable the
> "development mode" of the system which will then enable a telnet server
> where a root login without a password is possible. In order to enable
> the development mode, the "devboot" U-Boot environment variable must
> be set. This can be done through the Polycom Command Shell with the
> following commands:
>
>     $ cu -l ttyUSB0 -s 9600
>     -> setenv othbootargs "devboot=bogus"
>     -> reboot
>     reboot, are you sure? <y,n> y
>
> This will reboot the system and enable a telnet server where a login as
> root is possible.

>
> Impact:
>
> Someone with legitimate access to the Polycom Command Shell can get
> direct system-level access to the underlying embedded Linux system.
> This can be used to further analyze the system.
>
> Solution:
>
> Polycom released version 3.1.1.2 of the HDX software which fixes this
> issue. It can be downloaded from the Polycom Support page at
> http://support.polycom.com.
