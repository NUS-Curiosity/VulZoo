Automaton for Web Application Penetration Testing
--
We aim at identifying how the web app pentesting community would react
to the introduction of an additional source of information during
their pentest: an automaton of the web application obtained in a
blackbox test harnessing. Results of this research poll will be
published in a (white)paper.

PS: One person having filled this form will be picked up to receive a free
entry to GreHack 2013 (see http://grehack.org/2012/ )

Thanks for your time,
