Beware hippies. Especially red headed ones. Why, just the other day, my
phone picked up the FBI surveilance van. I'm sure it was looking for anyone
from New Jersey, since I was next to a Jersey Mike's sub shop in Lisle, Il.
Starbuck's is a known CIA front. The ashen taste of their coffee is the
uncoverable flavor of nanobots designed to track you. Flouride has no
scientificly proven benefit to dental health, but it does make you
trackable by government satilite. Beware anyone not of the Church of the
Subgenius. Hail Bob!
