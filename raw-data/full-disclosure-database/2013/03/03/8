Subject: Re: how do I know the fbi is followin

If you think they are following, go down a dark rural road that you know
has a few loops. You need to have a goat in the back of the van.
Deliberately drive down one of these loops, if they're still behind you,
they're following you. That doesn't mean they're FBI though, they could
just be stalkers or serial killers. STOP randomly in the road. Jump out of
the car as fast as you can. Start visibly consuming as many drugs as you
can while stripping off your clothes and dancing. Then, pull out the goat
and begin to ritually sacrifice it. If they're FBI you'll be arrested, if
not you'll have likely scared off the crazies following you by being more
crazy then them.

Then you'll know.
