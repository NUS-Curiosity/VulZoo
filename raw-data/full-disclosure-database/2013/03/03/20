3/1/2013

http://rubygems.org/gems/flash_tool

https://github.com/milboj/flash_tool

If files downloaded contain shell characters it's possible to execute 
code as the client user.

ie: flash_file;id>/tmp/o;.swf

./flash_tool-0.6.0/lib/flash_tool.rb

Lines:

26         command = "swfstrings #{file}"
27:        output = `#{command} 2>&1`
88:        command = "#{command} #{option} #{file}"
89:        output = `#{command} 2>&1`

./flash_tool-0.6.0/lib/flash_tool/flash.rb
75:      command = "#{command} #{args.join(" ")}"
76:      output = `#{command} 2>&1`
