The ostrich-style technique of getting the message and then silently
killing it can lead only to increasing number of spam messages: once
you accept the message (issuing the SMTP 354 code in reply to the
DATA command), spammers get a confirmation that the address they are
sending to is alive, and will send more and more. When you respond
with 550, they don't.

For ClamAV, its' primary task is to check whether executable (in wide
sence) attachments contain something dangerous. Using it for checking
all the messages is just an ineffective waste of resources...
