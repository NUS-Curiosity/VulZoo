It seems that andrew has evolved. He has turned into some sort of rubbish
cyberstalker/PI and has unearthed 2 publically available photos of me, one
from my publically available google profile and one with my work colleagues
based on information that I put out on this list. I haven't been reported
to his lawyer though.

Still miss my dog who died almost 2 years ago but that is also me at the
back with my fellow docs in the addiction service.
I may have put on a bit of weight since those photos were taken

I am concerned that Andrew is turning night into day and is plainly
becoming more obsessive - an hour searching to find the second photo is an
hour that he will never get back.

The good news is that I have convinced the clinical psychologists that i
work with to run a "coping with emotions" (PD) group therapy course.

I think this could help as it is clear in my professional opinion that
Andrew Wallace is becoming significantly more disturbed and his mental
health is deteriorating. Andrew Wallace needs urgent treatment for his
Narcissistic Personality Disorder
