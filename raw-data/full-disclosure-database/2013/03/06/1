Considering the cost to Andrew of all this legal work I guess telling
everyone that you are a super-spook level sec genius type consultant must
really bring in the big bucks.

Unless it is all just part of some delusional state of being of course.

I was going to suggest that he gets un-muted to see if there is any
progress upwards or downwards in his state of mind, his comments on the
free-fire zone running in the middle east might have been fun but I guess
he hasn't changed any. Maybe in a couple of years we can try again. He has
to burn out at some point,
Narcissistic personality disordered people always do eventually.
