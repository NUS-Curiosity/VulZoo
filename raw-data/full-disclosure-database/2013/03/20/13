Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-035 - Views -
	Cross Site Scripting	(XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1948358

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-035
  * Project: Views [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-March-20
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers to
control how lists and tables of content, users, taxonomy terms and other data
are presented.

The module incorrectly prints some view configuration fields without proper
sanitization opening a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "Administer vocabularies and terms" or other
administer-related permissions from contributed modules that integrate with
Views.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Views 7.x-3.x versions prior to 7.x-3.6.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Views [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Views module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Views 7.x-3.6 [5]

Also see the Views [6] project page.
