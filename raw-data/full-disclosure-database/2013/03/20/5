This is a true word.
I gave up CTF, Cups and similar because nobody cares for the small "hacker"...
They always reject the New-Ones, ones that haven't had 20 0-days on his account or a shiny company name and is alone out in the wild.

I think its getting ridiculous, if you don't have a name in the industry you're getting sued for the vast majority of bugs you solve...
And on the other hand, those same companies give away 3-15.000 for a single bug if the researcher happens to be known :|

Now I don't intent to start a shitstorm or a war here...

Kind regards from the U-Bahn,
