Package        : libapache2-mod-perl2
Debian Bug     : 702821

The security fix applied to the perl package due to CVE-2013-1667
introduced a test failure in libapache2-mod-perl2 source package
specific to the rehash mechanism in Perl. See Debian Bug #702821 for
details. This update fixes that problem. For reference, the original
advisory text for perl follows.

Yves Orton discovered a flaw in the rehashing code of Perl. This flaw
could be exploited to carry out a denial of service attack against code
that uses arbitrary user input as hash keys. Specifically an attacker
could create a set of keys of a hash causing a denial of service via
memory exhaustion.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-7+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.7-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.7-3.
