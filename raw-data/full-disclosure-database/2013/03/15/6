___________________________________________________________________________
Vendor:		Polycom, http://www.polycom.com
Affected Products:	Polycom HDX Series
Affected Version:	< 3.1.1.2
Vulnerability:		Polycom Firmware Update Command Injection
Risk:			MEDIUM
___________________________________________________________________________

Overview:

Polycom HDX systems can be upgraded via Polycom Update Files (PUP files).
The upgrade functionality is available in the Polycom administrative web
interface.

Description:

The firmware update functionality in the Polycom web interface is
vulnerable to a simple command injection vulnerability which allows an
attacker with access to the web interface to execute arbitrary commands
on the underlying embedded Linux system.

When uploading a PUP file via the web interface the file is first stored
on the device and then the filename is passed as an argument to a call
to the "puputils.ppc" binary in order to verify its integrity. Missing
input validation allows an attacker to inject additional shell commands
by using shell metacharacters (such as a semicolon). In order to mount the
attack a valid PUP file can be renamed as follows:

    $ mv polycom-hdx-release-3.0.5-22695.pup 'test;logger PWNED;bla.pup'

When this file is uploaded through the web interface the injected command
"logger PWNED" is executed on the system. This can also be observed in
the logs:

Utilities.

2012-09-02 20:17:01 ERROR jvm: pc[0]: softupdate: command "./puputils.ppc
verify ../web2/docroot/data/test;logger pwned;bla.pup" returned unexpected
error 127.

Impact:

Someone with access to the Polycom administrative web interface can
execute arbitrary commands on the underlying embedded Linux system.
In combination with some other vulnerability such as a Cross-Site
Request Forgery vulnerability this attack could potentially be
performed even without direct access to the web interface. However
we didn't verify that yet.

Solution:

Polycom released version 3.1.1.2 of the HDX software which fixes this
issue. It can be downloaded from the Polycom Support page at
http://support.polycom.com.
