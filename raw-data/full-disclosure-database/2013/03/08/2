Andrew,


You realize this guy is trying to advise people through a tutorial?
It's not like we're talking about average Joe shipping buggy software...
people *teaching bad practices,* especially in this field should be shot
dead
before they do any more damage.

You just can't learn how to code by teaching others to do it wrongly.

Pointing back to my comprehensive list, the author missed some of
the very basics of programming in general (undefined variables, no
indentation..).


Chris.
