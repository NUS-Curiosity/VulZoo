  I didn't know the gentleman, but have known some depressive people. There may have been other problems bothering him in his life, but spending a fortune on a lawyer to try and avoid 30 - 50 years in prison and the reputation that he would have if he ever got out is probable quite near the top of the list of things setting his mind frame and causing this unfortunate decision. The powers that be have blood on their hands and hopefully are having rather poor nights sleep these days. Personally I would be having trouble looking in the mirror for my daily shave.

Above link to remove this prosecutor needs to have signatures by
February 11.
Its unfortunate Schwartz committed suicide over the incident.
>>From the fine article:

"On his blog, Swartz had written of his history of depression."

Given that, and the fact that the article doesn't mention a suicide note
stating Aaron's reasons, it's not entirely clear that he in fact committed
suicide over the incident.  It may have been one factor out of many.
