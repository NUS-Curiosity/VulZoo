Subject: Crossbow, a lightweight,
	cross-platform exploit development framework.

I'm proud to announce the open source release of a project I've been working on for a while called Crossbow.  Brought to you by Tactical Network Solutions, Crossbow is a framework built in Python whose purpose is to help make exploit development easier.  It currently targets MIPS Linux systems, but I hope to expand it to support other architectures in the future.
