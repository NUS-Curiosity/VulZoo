Special Issue on Intrusion Detection and Security Mechanisms for Wireless Sensor Networks

International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks
ISI Thomson Impact Factor (2011): 0.203

Call for Papers

Wireless sensor networks are gaining significant interest from academia and industry. Wireless sensor networks are multihop, self-organizing, self-healing, and distributed in nature. These characteristics also increase vulnerability and expose sensor networks to various kinds of security attacks. Advance security mechanisms and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) can play an important role in detecting and preventing security attacks.

This special issue aims to gather recent advances in the area of security aspect of wireless sensor networks. It welcomes research and review articles that focus on the challenges and the state-of-the-art solutions. The papers will be peer reviewed and will be selected on the basis of their quality and relevance to the topic of this special issue. Potential topics include, but are not limited to:

� Intrusion detection systems
� Secure neighbor discovery, localization, and mobility
� Security architectures, deployments, and solutions
� Denial of service attacks and countermeasures
� Intrusion prevention techniques
� Adaptive defense systems
� Trust establishment and privacy
� Confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurance
� Authentication and access control
� Secure routing protocols
� Cryptography, encryption algorithms, and key management schemes
� Experimental validation and experiences with testbed and/or deployment
