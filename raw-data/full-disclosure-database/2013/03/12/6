Ruby gem fastreader-1.0.8 remote code exec
3/6/2013


https://rubygems.org/gems/fastreader
ï»¿

if the url contains any ; characters code will be executed as the user when a web browser is launched.

for example if fastreader is fed http://www.g;id;.com id will be executed.

./fastreader-1.0.8/lib/entry_controller.rb

.strip only removes whitespace before and after the URL.

115       # open web browser
116       command = (ENV['FASTREADER_WEB'] || "open") + " {@...rent_entry.url.strip}"
117       `{command}`
