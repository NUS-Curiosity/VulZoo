3) Technical details
============================
The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow error in the
cam2pc.exe When allocating memory
For BITMAPINFOHEADER(biHeight) values. This can be exploited to cause
a heap-based buffer overflow
Via a specially crafted BMP,JPG,TIF file.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but
requires tricking a user into opening a malicious file.
