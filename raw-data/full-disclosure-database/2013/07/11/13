FYI, the openssh guys have known this for quite a while and they don't
treat it as an issue worth fixing. They don't want to introduce extra
anti-timing code just to prevent user enumeration from working.

You can also see a measurable difference when you try logging in with
random public RSA keys â€“ around 100% difference over localhost, over the
internet it's much lower, but with a few attempts, you can still get good
data. Well, for systems that have password auth enabled, your approach seems
a lot more reliable.

By the way: If you can hog the CPU for seconds by sending a few kilobytes
of data, isn't that a DoS issue?
