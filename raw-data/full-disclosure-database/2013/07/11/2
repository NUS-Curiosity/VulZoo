Subject: Re: OpenSSH User Enumeration Time-Based Attack

I havent tried this yet but it makes sense.
To avoid linearization attacks from figuring out sensitive data, there are
specific precautions that are taken. (some UNIX login program had a similar
timing issue if I am not mistaken).
>From the looks of it, sshd is looking for the username in some file and if
it doesn't exist, it waits sometime and returns, if it does, then it
calculates the long hash.
