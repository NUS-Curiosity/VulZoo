	exploit (CVE-2013-2028)

I would like to personally thanked KingCope for this PoC. A great work for
the GREATER good impact.
Still peeking on the code for tests BUT with very happy feeling,because if
this works very well (which I know it will be) then (say) 80+% of the
Malware Exploit Kit servers and Malware proxy servers & infectors which
mostly are running on NGNIX are ALL affected (hahaha!)

A vulnerability for the good guys, and ZERO f*ckin DAY for those bad guys!
Seriously. I am saying this out loud in the Full Disclosure maillist for
all of the good guys to know and bad guys to start to sweat!!
(not provoking anything) (grins)
