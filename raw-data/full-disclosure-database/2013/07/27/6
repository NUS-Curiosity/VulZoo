Dear Mr. Lux,

Do I undertsand it correctly, that you are capable of re-directing plain
HTTP traffic?
Congratulations... *applause!!!*

Please forgive me my scepsis but even your last report was not fully
impressing.
In the commercial sector and in any SANE company WhatsApp is not allowed....

I could tell you like 7 DoS Exploits against an Telecom V921 Router and
write down an AWESOME blog entry...
but in the end it's kind of useless anyway like your news...

Please do us, and I speak partly for the german community as well, a favour.
POST MORE QUALIFIED things.... or get into vacations soon.

Your purely unqualified statements do dishonor our professional work in
germany and disqualify any german
who is a serious penetration tester. And you made it all because to
market your company. Sorry Marco:
NO.... and I aint the only one thinking so.


Kind regards,
Sebastian Rother

p.s.
Seriously: Was there anybody impressed? It was not even Mr. Lux
himself... but his staff.
That aint a blaming.. just not everything should get made up as "LATEST
NEW SHIT ISSUE AND WE ALL GONNA DIE TOMMOROW" or Marco... *hust*.
I think People like Jericho might angree partly with me, he even
corrected you once, like I did....
Just get into vacanci
