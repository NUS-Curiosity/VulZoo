Subject: FINAL CALL for papers for SEC-T.org

Last Reminder and final call for paper submissions!
The deadline for submissions to SEC-T is coming up shortly. Papers submitted after August 1:st will not be considered for the €1000 best-submitted-paper price and might be even get rejected due to being past the deadline.
So send in your submissions ASAP to cfp@...-t.org for your chance to be a speaker at this years SEC-T conference in Stockholm, Sweden.

The SEC-T conference is an information security conference strongly rooted in the technical realm. Talks on technical subjects with no applicability to information security are admissible as long as they are cool! Some topics we find interesting are: 
Interesting or new vulnerability research
Novel defensive technology or architecture
Neat hardware hacks and funny broken products
Analysis of protocols and/or wireless modes
Speaker slots are either 20 or 60 minutes long so please indicate length of your presentation in your submission. We will allow additional time for audience questions if needed. Talks that actively engage the audience to participate are preferred. Every submission will be considered and we will judge each proposal by its content and not the name attached. Proposals should include a description of the talk contents and what attendees will learn from it. The paper, talk and material must be presented in English and you must be able to hold your talk on the 12:th or 13:th of September 2013 at the conference venue in Stockholm, Sweden.
If your talk is accepted, the SEC-T conference will arrange or help you arrange and pay for travels between your location and the venue as well as provide you with accommodations during the conference.
