Subject: DEFCON London - DC4420 July - social event -
	Tuesday 30th July 2013

It is summer holiday time, not to mention that many people are making
their way this week to Las Vegas for Def Con or to the Netherlands for
OHM2013.

There are no scheduled speakers this month, and Major Malfunction &
Tony are both out of town.

Fear not though, as the downstairs bar is sill booked for us and
normal service will resume at the end of August!


Cheers,
Tony
