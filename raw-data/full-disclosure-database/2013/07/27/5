Subject: Releasing full source code of Aux Browser

Releasing full source code of Aux Browser:
http://code.google.com/p/auxbrowser/

Intro
Aux Browser is a small tool for securely browsing the web.

Tech
 * There is kernel level sandbox(the entire thing runs in sandbox,
including plugins).
 * A dedicated sandbox is configured automatically(no manual
configuration needed).
 * Sandbox is emptied every time the browser starts(it's always a clean start).
 * Every web page is loaded in separate process(no memory leak here).

Greetings
We express gratitude to the following people:
 * dross
 * neo
