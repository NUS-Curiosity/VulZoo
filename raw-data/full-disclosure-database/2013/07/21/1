The "personal" message came from Michael Schierl <schierlm@....de>
and it was sent both to us and to the Full Disclosure mailing list.
We don't know if it was cancelled, refused or simply hasn't hit the
list yet.

Jeffrey Walton <noloader@...il.com> doesn't have anything to do with
this - his message and questions perfectly fit the designated purpose
of the list.

Our apologies to Jeffrey for the confusion.

Thank you.
