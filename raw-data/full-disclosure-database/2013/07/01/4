CVE-2013-1777: Apache Geronimo 3 RMI classloader exposure

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Version Affected:
Apache Geronimo 3.0
Apache Geronimo 3.0 Beta 1
Apache Geronimo 3.0 M1

Description:
A misconfigured RMI classloader in Apache Geronimo 3.0 may enable an attacker to
send a serialized object via JMX that could compromise the system.

Mitigation:
Geronimo 3.0, Beta 1 or M1 users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to
Geronimo 3.0.1.
Remote exploits can be prevented by hiding the naming (1099) and JMX
(9999) ports
behind a firewall or binding the ports to a local network interface.
