Subject: [HITB-Announce] REMINDER: #HITB2013KUL CFP Closes
	25th July

Hi everyone,

Just a gentle reminder that the Call for Papers for the 11th annual HITB
Security Conference in Malaysia, #HITB2013KUL, closes on the 25th of
July at 23:59 MYT!

As always, we're looking for talks that are highly technical, but most
importantly, material which is new, cutting edge and content that
hasn't been seen before.

HITB CFP: http://cfp.hackinthebox.org/

The conference takes place at the Intercontinental Kuala Lumpur on the
16th and 17th of October in a triple-track format with keynote
speakers Joe Sullivan (Chief Security Officer for Facebook) and Andy
Ellis (Chief Security Officer at Akamai).

Alongside the main conference, there will also be an open to public
lock picking village run by TOOOL, a technology showcase
area/exhibition area, a 24-hour developer hackathon (HackWEEKDAY) and
of course a team-based Capture The Flag competition!
