Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. Today DAVOSET v.1.1 was released -
DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.1:

Use, don't abuse.

Besides improvements and fixes in new version, in 1.1 there was added
logging. So now people can log their activity with the tool. Also I've
described usage of the tool in readme.txt - added descriptions of different
attacks, which I wrote about in my articles. So it must become easier for
new users of the program to understand it.

Best wishes & regards,
