Subject: Security Mistakes That We And Others Have Made

When we developed our open source 
project(http://code.google.com/p/auxbrowser/), we found several common 
security mistakes.

Security Issue #1 - FEATURE_LOCALMACHINE_LOCKDOWN

If an application uses Microsoft web browser object to access internet, 
it's extremely important to have this enabled.

We made this mistake. Others also made the same mistake.

For example, EditPlus uses web browser object, and it does not have this 
enabled - it's vulnerable.

Security Issue #2 - SizeOf Used For Buffer Size in Characters

SizeOf is "in bytes", when buffer size is "in characters".

In the Unicode world, it's wrong to use SizeOf for buffer size in 
characters.

We made this mistake. Others also made the same mistake.

For example:
http://delphi.about.com/cs/adptips2001/a/bltip0401_3.htm
...
Buffer: array[0..2047] of Char
...
GetPrivateProfileString('InternetShortcut',
             PChar('URL'), NIL, Buffer, SizeOf(Buffer),
             PChar(dir+searchrec.Name))
...

In the end, if you find bugs in our open source project, please contact 
us. We will put your name in the "Thanks" part here:
