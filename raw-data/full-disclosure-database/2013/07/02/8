Subject: Re: Skype for Android Lockscreen Bypass

It appears that it is in some way device or firmware dependent (when tested
on a Sony device, it happened on the Sony ROM, but not on CyanogenMod ROM).

Unfortunately I'm not sure of the criteria that make this happen, but it
seems a little difficult to reproduce right now on some devices.
