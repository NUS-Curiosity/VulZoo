Subject: Fwd: Re: Collabtive multiple vulnerabilities.

I wrote about shell upload that it was found in older releases, bit it is
still present.. Your link talks about versions <= 0.7.6...

Actually there si the 1.0 release.

About Account deletion.. Dunno, i wrote to the developer the same day
(21/06) and the blog published the following day (22).
