*** Call for Papers ***

The potential for applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine
learning, and data mining to security and privacy problems is
ever-more lucrative.  The analytic tools and intelligent behavior
provided by these techniques makes AI and learning increasingly
important for autonoumous real-time analysis and decision-making in
domains with a wealth of data or that require quick reactions to
ever-changing situations.  Particularly, these intelligent
technologies offer new solutions to security problems involving Big
Data analysis, which can be scaled through cloud-computing.  Further,
the use of learning methods in security-sensitive domains creates new
frontiers for security research, in which adversaries may attempt to
mislead or evade intelligent machines.  The 2013 ACM Workshop on
Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec) provides a venue for
presenting and discussing new developments in this fusion of
security/privacy with AI and machine learning.

We invite original research papers describing the use of AI or machine
learning in security, privacy and related problems.  We also invite
position and open problem papers discussing the role of AI or machine
learning in security and privacy.  Submitted papers of these types may
not substantially overlap papers that have been published previously
or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or
conference/workshop proceedings.  Finally we again welcome a
'systematization of knowledge' category of papers, which should
distill the AI or machine learning contributions of a previously
published series of security papers.

Regular research, systematization of knowledge, and open/position
paper submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format
(note: pages must be numbered) excluding the bibliography and
well-marked appendices, and at most 12 pages overall.  Committee
members are not required to read the appendices, so the paper should
be intelligible without them.  Submissions need not be anonymized.  We
recommend the use of the ACM SIG Proceedings templates for
submissions.  The ACM format is the required template for the
camera-ready version.  Accepted papers will be published by the ACM
Digital Library and/or ACM Press.

Submissions can be made through EasyChair at:
