Subject: Top Information Security Consultants to Hire --
	WANTED

Hi Guys...

So my business consulting company just released a list of the "Top
Information Security Consultants to Hire World Wide --
http://sparkah.com/top-infosec-information-security-and-network-security-consultants-in-the-world/
"
BUT... turns out that about half of the people we mentioned are NOT looking
for new clients.

SO...

If any of you guys are taking new clients, I'll replace them and put you on
the list. I'll also put you on our internal short list of people to refer
to new leads that come directly to our desk.

Anyhow... just send me your contact data if you want to be put on that
list.
