High


Details:
========
An auth bypass session web vulnerability is detected in the official PayPal QR Labs Service Web Application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the web- or system user auth of the affected 
vulnerable computer system to compromise paypal accounts.

The bug is located in the application account login module when processing to load manipulated j_password 
parameters via GET method. Attackers are able the decrypt and exchange the information in the request live 
with a session tamper to take-over other accounts. At the end the vulnerability allows remote attackers to 
enter remotely any paypal qr labs account of the web application.

Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require user interaction but a low privileged paypal qr labs 
application user account. Successful exploitation results in account steal or compromise and stable user 
session manipulation with different effects.

Vulnerable Service(s):
				[+] PayPal Inc – qr.paypal-labs.com

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Account - Login

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] j_password

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Account System


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privilege paypal qr labs application user account and 
without user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Note:
After some security checks to authenticate in the qr.paypal-labs.com web application, the last request for being authenticate 
in this web application it is not secure implemented.

Note:
If we look at the request wich is a GET method request we will soon see ...
If we encrypt the j_username parameter value as SHA1 ... 
The result will be the value of the j_password parameter

Note: PoC Video
The username loger177@...il.com is encrypted in SHA1 it is equals with < 96301aa9f02b5d12278b0e902dc5434ed9477d19
In the demonstration above it seems that the password of the username is encrypted in SHA1 ;)


Solution:
=========
2013-06-20:    Vendor Fix/Patch (PayPal Inc Developer Team)


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the auth bypass web session vulnerability is estimated as high(+).
