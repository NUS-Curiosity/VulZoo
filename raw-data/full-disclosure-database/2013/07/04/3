Subject: WordPress User Account Information Leak / Secunia
	Advisory SA23621

Hi,

the mentioned User account Enumeration Weakness
stated in Advisory https://secunia.com/advisories/23621/
still exists in the actual version 3.5.2 .

The corresponding trac entry for wordpress is closed as
"wontfix":
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1129

Why?

Maybe, because the trac bug mentions just version 1.5 as affected?

I can easily reproduce this in version 3.5.2 .

Please fix this, this bug is 8 years old!

Kind Regards

Sven Kieske
