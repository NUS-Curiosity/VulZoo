Yes, some inconsistent cheks are reported.  Here's a public example
quoting some of the (textual) reporting:

<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.libvirt.cim/422/focus=423>

For real logic bugs, this will not work because hopefully, your logic
is far more concentrated and not spread all over the place.  (I think
this Coverity feature works only to ensure correct error threading, as
a poor man's substitute for exceptions.)
