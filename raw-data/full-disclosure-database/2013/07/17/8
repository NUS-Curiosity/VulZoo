Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple client side input validation vulnerabilities are detected  in Barracuda Networks CudaTel v2.6.002.040 appliance application.
The non-persistent vulnerabilities allows an attacker (remote) to manipulate client side application to browser requests.

The first vulnerability (client side) is located in the gui route module when processing to request the vulnerable 
bbx_outbound_route_name parameter & affected listing. The route module allows remote attackers via bbx_outbound_route_flag_locked 
parameter to request and execute script codes in the bbx_outbound_route_name listing.

The secound vulnerability (client side) is located in the ajax - html module when processing to request the vulnerable 
queues_wall_stub file and the ops opOpenQueueWallboard link parameters. The vulnerability allows remote attackers (client side) 
to change the link of the Queue Monitor Board on requests to redirect.

The third vulnerability (client side) is located in the Web login attempt fail exception-handling of eventlog module when 
processing to load the manipulated bbx_eventlog_message parameter. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own 
script code (client side)  in the queues_wall_stub.html file from the exception-handling location for Web login attempt fails.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege application user account and medium or high user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities result in client side phishing, client side session hijacking, client side 
external redirects to malware or evil websites and client side module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Section(s):
				[+] GUI - ROUTE
				[+] AJAX - HTML
				[+] Eventlog

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] route - Listing
				[+] queues_wall_stub - Monitor Queue Link
				[+] eventlog - Web login attempt fail (Exception Handling) - Listing 

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] bbx_outbound_route_flag_locked > bbx_outbound_route_name
				[+] ops opOpenQueueWallboard
				[+] bbx_eventlog_message


Proof of Concept:
=================
The client side input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without required application user account and with 
medium or high required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the (multiple) client side input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.
