Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130717-cucm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 July 17 16:00  UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) contains multiple vulnerabilities that could be used together to allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gather user credentials, escalate privileges, and execute commands to gain full control of the vulnerable system. A successful attack could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access, create or modify information in Cisco Unified CM. 

On June 6, 2013, a French security firm, Lexfo, delivered a public presentation on VoIP security that included a demonstration of multiple vulnerabilities used to compromise Cisco Unified CM. During the presentation, the researchers demonstrated a multistaged attack that chained a number of vulnerabilities Structured Query Language (SQL) resulted in a complete compromise of the Cisco Unified CM server. The attack chain used the following types of vulnerabilities:

	Blind Structured Query Language (SQL) injection
	Command injection
	Privilege escalation

Cisco PSIRT greatly appreciates the opportunity to work with researchers on security vulnerabilities and welcomes the opportunity to review and assist in product reports.

Cisco has released a Cisco Options Package (COP) file that addresses three of the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory. Cisco is currently investigating the remaining vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.
