	(Aegir) - Access	Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2044299

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-059
  * Project: Hostmaster (Aegir) [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2013-July-17
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This install profile and accompanying suite of modules enables you to
install, upgrade, deploy, and backup Drupal sites (among other things.)
The module doesn't sufficiently control access to running tasks on sites,
under the scenario where a user successfully guesses a sites' path in the
Aegir front-end.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be
authenticated and have a role with one or more permissions that allow the
creation of tasks.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Hostmaster 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.10.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Hostmaster
(Aegir) [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Hostmaster install profile for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to
    Hostmaster 6.x-1.10 [5]

Also see the Hostmaster (Aegir) [6] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY  
---------------------------------------------------------

  * Tim Lovelock [7]

-------- FIXED BY  
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Antoine Beaupr√© [8], the module's lead maintainer; and
  * Christopher Gervais [9], another of the module's maintainers.

------------------------------------------------------

  * Greg Knaddison [10] of the Drupal Security Team
