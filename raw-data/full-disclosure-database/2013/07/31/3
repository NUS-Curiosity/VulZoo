Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-061 - Flippy -
	Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2054701

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-061
  * Project: Flippy [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-July-31
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to generate previous/next links for content types.

The module doesn't sufficiently enforce node access when generating
previous/next links. A user may be presented with a link (including alias if
one is set) but will not be able to view the node content.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to access content.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Flippy 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Flippy [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Flippy module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Flippy 7.x-1.2 [5]

Also see the Flippy [6] project page.
