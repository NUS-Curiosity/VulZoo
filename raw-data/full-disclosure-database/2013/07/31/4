Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1.2

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. Today DAVOSET v.1.1.2 was
released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.1.2:

Use, don't abuse.

Among other improvements in new version, in 1.1.2 there was added support of XML requests for XXE vulnerabilities. So now you can use XML External Entities vulnerabilities at web sites for conducting DoS and DDoS attacks. Also there were added new services into full list of zombies.

Best wishes & regards,
