Dr. Bernstein puts a lot of effort into defending against timing
attacks and other side channels in his NaCl library. I'm not aware of
any other libraries which go to the same depths. On the downside, NaCl
is not easy to work with (for example, change compilers or
cross-compile for iOS or Android); its not really portable (lots of C
language violations); nor is it easy to get analysis tools on it.

Recently, he presented an OWASP talk that included the subject matter
(including lots of other practical crypto failures).

For DNSSEC fans, he beats the hell out of DNSSEC for its amplification
attacks and other info leaks.
