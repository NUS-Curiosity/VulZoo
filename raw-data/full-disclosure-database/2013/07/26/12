Peter Gutmann has a lot of fun with over-permissioned battery apps in
his book Engineering Security
(www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/book.pdf).

As you've learned, allowing naive users to give invasive apps too many
permissions is not perceived as a threat. Its a shame AOSP is still
making the same engineering mistakes from the 1980s and 1990s. Users
are not going to miraculously wake up tomorrow with additional
security-IQ points.
