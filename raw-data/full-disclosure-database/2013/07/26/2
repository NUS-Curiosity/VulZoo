Subject: Flush+Reload: a High Resolution, Low Noise,
	L3 Cache Side-Channel Attack

Just found this online.. might be of interest

Abstract: Flush+Reload  is a cache side-channel attack that 
monitors access to data in shared pages. In this paper we demonstrate 
how to use the  attack to extract private encryption keys from GnuPG. 
The high resolution and low noise of the Flush+Reload attack enables a 
spy program to recover over 98% of the bits of the private key in a 
single decryption or signing round. Unlike previous attacks, the attack 
targets the last level L3 cache. Consequently, the spy program and the 
victim do not need to share the execution core of the CPU. The attack is not limited to a traditional OS and can be used in a virtualised 
environment, where it can attack programs executing in a different VM.
