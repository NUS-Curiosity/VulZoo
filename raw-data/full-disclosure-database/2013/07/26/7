 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:201
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ruby
 Date    : July 26, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected in ruby:
 
 A flaw was found in Ruby&#039;s SSL client&#039;s hostname identity check
 when handling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL
 bytes. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to conduct
 man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers. Note that to exploit
 this issue, an attacker would need to obtain a carefully-crafted
 certificate signed by an authority that the client trusts
 (CVE-2013-4073).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
