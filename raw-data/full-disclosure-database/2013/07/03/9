Subject: Re: DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool

Hello Julius!

Looks like you haven't read my articles, which I referenced in my letter.
Such as Using of the sites for attacks on other sites - this is my 2010's
article based on my 2009's article DoS attacks via Abuse of Functionality
vulnerabilities. In new article I combined different attacks (which can be
used for attacks on other sites) and added new example of vulnerable sites
to draw attention to this problem.

Yes, it's brilliant. And not only GET requests - since DAVOSET v.1.0.8 the
tool also supports POST requests ;-).

My tool is designed to automate such attacks on other sites. If you want to
do the attacks manually (with using all those vulnerable sites, including
those in my lists of zombies), feel free to do it. Like to use them as
proxies (to hiddenly visit sites), or to send CSRF requests for different
attacks on those sites, or to make DoS attacks. Which are especially
effective when there are many sites combined together, i.e. to make DDoS
attacks, which are using not clients, but servers as zombies. Servers have
larger channels, so they are more effective weapon for conducting DDoS
attacks. And exactly for automating these things I've created my tool. Yes,
it can be used for attacking with only one zombie-server, but it's good with
making DDoS attacks with multiple-servers (it handles any amount of servers
very well). For understanding possibilities of DoS attacks via AoF
vulnerabilities it's needed to read those my 2009-2010's articles.

So you made a perl script to make GET requests on a list of URLs? Brilliant.

Hello participants of Mailing List.

If you haven't read my article (written in 2010 and last week I wrote about
it to WASC list) Advantages of attacks on sites with using other sites
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008846.html),
feel free to do it. In this article I reminded you about using of the sites
for attacks on other sites
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html),
DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool (DAVOSET)
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2010-July/006832.html),
sending spam via sites and creating spam-botnets
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2010-July/006863.html)
and wrote about advantages of attacks on sites with using other sites.

Last week I've published online my DDoS attacks via other sites execution
tool (http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/). It's tool for conducting
of DDoS attacks via Abuse of Functionality vulnerabilities on the sites,
which I've made in 2010. Description and changelog on English are presented
at my site. Where you can get my DAVOSET v.1.0.5 (made at 18.07.2010).

This is the last version of my DAVOSET. After that I've stopped its
development. But now I am planning to continue development of the software
and to release new versions (I'll release v.1.0.6 today).

For three years I was holding this tool privately, but now released it for
free access. So everyone can test Abuse of Functionality vulnerabilities at
multiple web sites - like Google's sites, W3C and many others, which were
informed by me many times during many years (I was informing admins of web
sites about such vulnerabilities since 2007), but ignored and don't want to
fix these holes for a long time, and for example Google continued to create
new services with Abuse of Functionality and Insufficient Anti-automation
vulnerabilities, which can be used for such DoS and DDoS attacks.

It must bring attention to the danger of these vulnerabilities (which I was
trying to do in my articles in 2010). Because in most cases owners of web
sites and web developers ignore and don't fix them. Which can be used for
DoS attacks as on other sites, as on the sites with Abuse of Functionality
vulnerabilities themselves, about which I wrote in my article Using of the
sites for attacks on other sites.
