Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1.1

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. Yesterday DAVOSET v.1.1.1 was
released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.1.1:

Use, don't abuse.

Besides improvements in new version, in 1.1.1 there were added a lot of new
zombie-services - 105 new services, most of them are web sites with
Googlemaps plugin for Joomla. Also I've improved work with services which
donâ€™t support "http://" for target site (this is made for Googlemaps). Last
week one man, who like DAVOSET, sent me large list of zombie-servers for my
tool (big thanks for him). In that list I've found a lot of web sites with
Googlemaps, which I checked and found multiple vulnerabilities in this
plugin, which I disclosed recently.

Best wishes & regards,
