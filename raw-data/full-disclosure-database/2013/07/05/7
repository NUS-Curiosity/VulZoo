Subject: Re: WordPress User Account Information Leak /
 Secunia Advisory SA23621

It seems crazy to me that WordPress is sensible enough to allow you to
change the default admin username to something other than "admin" - but
then so simply exposes that information to anyone that fancies scanning. I
ran wpscan last night across a couple of my installs and sure enough - my
renamed admin accounts show straight up. What a waste of time! :-/
