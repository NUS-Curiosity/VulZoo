Personally, I always tend to wonder how things like this come to be (like
specifically, for this particular case). The developer, was he stupid or
just lazy? Maybe he felt that they mistreated him and he did it
intentionally? Or I guess just as likely, the code could be extremely old,
when people were (somehow) even less security minded.

It doesn't really surprise me, but always always amazes me, how so many
people approach security as an after thought. It's like buying a brand new
house without the front door. Sure, it's great, looks awesome and will
serve your purpose - but you paid money for it to do that. Meanwhile,
everyone else gets to not only come in for free and use what you paid for,
they also get to take anything that their heart desires (and bonus: if
you're sleeping like a *log*, you'll never know). I've even seen people
install firewalls to try to secure their code. That's like installing an
alarm on the house mentioned above. Sure, if someone breaks a window -
you'll know. But why bother when they can just use the front door?

I've seen how easily (and unfortunately often) it can (and does) happen. A
good example isn't laziness or malice, but cheapness. I've run into more
people on freelancing sites than I'd like to admit who share the same
values as one another: it's cheaper to have something fixed than it is to
have it created. So they post a project that really should have a budget of
a few grand for $30 or $50. Just as you'd expect, they get an
inexperienced/careless developer most of the time who hacks together what
appears to be what they want. They pay, developer disappears, and they end
up with a really shitty product. In their minds though, that's not a
problem. Because now they can turn around and post the project for a few
hundred, hint that it's already been created and just needs a minor fix,
and can hire someone who's actually qualified to fix it. The first
developer doesn't care about the product and the second isn't being paid
nearly enough to worry about "extras" like security (especially when he
realizes he's been tricked and most of it needs to be rewritten - at which
point, not sanitizing input may become intentional).

So in the end, the buyer saves a little bit of money for a little while.
His customers, though, aren't so lucky. The same holds true here,
especially because: in addition to the issues you've already raised:</rant>

1) Information disclosure by accessing a nonexistent files:
http://hsn.eresourceplanner.com/fake.asp
2) XSS on two different pages:
Login.asp?UserID="><script>alert(12345);</script><a

And what appears to be several other issues.
