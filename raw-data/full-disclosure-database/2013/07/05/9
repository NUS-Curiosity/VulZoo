Subject: Re: WordPress User Account Information Leak /
 Secunia Advisory SA23621

There have been many heated debates within the community about this 
issue. Unfortunately, I think a different outcome is unlikely.

WordPress's position is (I think) that usernames aren't secret, and that 
therefore, username enumeration is a non-problem. I think this is 
extremely wrong, but it is what it is.

We solve this problem with a plugin that changes the login messages and 
ensures that invalid usernames will prepopulate the form, as well as 
valid ones.

We also look for [?|&]a=\d in the URL and remove any matches before the 
request hits apache, so that attackers can't run through ?a=1, ?a=2 etc 
looking for redirects to author pages (which include usernames in the URL_.
