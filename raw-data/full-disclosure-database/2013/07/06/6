Subject: DAVOSET v.1.0.9

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. On Friday, 05.07.2013, DAVOSET
v.1.0.9 was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.0.9:

Use, don't abuse.

Among other improvements in new version, in 1.0.9 there was added support of
CSRF tokens. And there was added new service into full lists of zombies
(exactly for requests with CSRF tokens). This is browsershots.org, I wrote
about vulnerabilities in it in 2010 and informed admins, which lamerly
ignored to fix vulnerabilities (only added token, which is easy bypassed as
I showed). One request to this service leads to 158 requests to target site.

Best wishes & regards,
