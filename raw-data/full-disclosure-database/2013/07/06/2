Subject: AOL Instant Messenger Binary File Planting PoC

I came across a binary file planting vulnerability in AOL Instant Messenger
(AIM) 8.0.1.5 on July 4th.  There is a problem where by their ad code is
not checked for validity, so you can inject whatever you want over the LAN
and force it to download a .exe without any warning and drop it in "My
Documents" on Windows XP and Windows 7.  At this time, 8.0.1.5 is so far
unpatched/unknown.

Affected:
AOL Instant Messenger <=8.0.1.5 (XP/7)

Working proof of concept code is attached.  Requires ettercap and msf.

Enjoy, and hope you had a happy 4th!!!

Marshall
