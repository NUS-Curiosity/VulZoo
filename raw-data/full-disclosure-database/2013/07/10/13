View online: https://drupal.org/node/2038801

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-056
  * Project: Stage File Proxy [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-July-10th
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module saves time and disk space by sending requests to your development
environment's files directory to the production environment and making a copy
of the production file in your development site.

An attacker could make repeated requests to the server, even over a long
period, which would degrade the performance of all file handling and
potentially prevent certain file operations.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Stage File Proxy 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Stage File
Proxy [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Stage File Proxy module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Stage
    File Proxy 7.x-1.4 [5]

Also see the Stage File Proxy [6] project page.
