View online: https://drupal.org/node/2038807

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-057
  * Project: TinyBox (Simple Splash) [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2013-July-10
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

TinyBox module uses TinyBox, a lightweight and standalone modal window
script. The main purpose of this module is to provide Splash Screen/Window as
simple as possible.

The module doesn't filter user-supplied text prior to display. The
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the
permission "administer tinybox."

--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * TinyBox 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed TinyBox
(Simple Splash) [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the TinyBox module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to TinyBox 7.x-2.2
    [5]
