Subject: Re: Abusing Windows 7 Recovery Process

My initial thoughts after adding the user and rebooting was that it was
only valid in the recovery console session or something as once i rebooted
it was gone...

Tried it again today in a different place and same deal. Reboot no new
user...

Anyone have this working after reboot?
Once you've inserted your payload with admin-or-better rights, it can be
anything from a rootkit that GP can't touch to a patched GP subsys that
doesn't apply AD policies. This isn't really a caveat.
