 Are you really that dumb or are you just pretending?

The crash you showed does not control eip. It's not even write access violation. Instead it's READ access violation. And you try to write into the register (not even arbitrary memory, hence even if read is successful you may or may not gain anything depending on further instructions).

Btw. Nice linkedin profile. You must be top-notch security expert.

Blya!
