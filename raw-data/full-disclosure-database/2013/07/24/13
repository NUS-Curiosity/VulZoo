Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-060 - Scald -
	Cross Site Scripting	(XSS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2049415

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-060
  * Project: Scald [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-July-24
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to handle media assets (atoms) in Drupal with a
Views-based library, drag and drop interface and manage content
attribution/licensing/distribution.

The module doesn't sufficiently filter atom properties such as the atom title
when outputting atoms, thereby exposing a Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to create atoms and the Scald Flash module or the
resource management feature (in the MEE submodule) must be enabled.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
