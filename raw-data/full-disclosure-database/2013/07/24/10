 vulnerabilities. (FUN)

Hey Maciej

Not too sure if you've tried any of the security type addresses as listed
by rfc2142

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt

4.  NETWORK OPERATIONS MAILBOX NAMES

   Operations addresses are intended to provide recourse for customers,
   providers and others who are experiencing difficulties with the
   organization's Internet service.

   MAILBOX        AREA                USAGE
   -----------    ----------------    ---------------------------
   ABUSE          Customer Relations  Inappropriate public behaviour
   NOC            Network Operations  Network infrastructure
   SECURITY       Network Security    Security bulletins or queries


perhaps give them a try?


Thanks and kind regards

Feighen
