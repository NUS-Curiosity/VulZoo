 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:198
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libxml2
 Date    : July 24, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in libxml2:
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2, a library
 providing support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files,
 performed string substitutions when entity values for external
 entity references replacement (--noent option) was requested /
 enabled during the XML file parsing. A remote attacker could provide
 a specially-crafted XML file containing an external entity expansion,
 when processed would lead to excessive CPU consumption (denial of
 service) (CVE-2013-0339). This a different flaw from CVE-2013-0338.
 
 parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.0, as used in Google Chrome before
 28.0.1500.71 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a document that ends
 abruptly, related to the lack of certain checks for the XML_PARSER_EOF
 state (CVE-2013-2877).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
