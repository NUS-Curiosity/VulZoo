Hello,

Thank you for writing to us. Although we would like to answer all the questions we receive, we can not do it now.

If you need to restore multiple files, follow these steps: https://www.dropbox.com/help/400

Please also check our help center to find answers to frequently asked questions: https://www.dropbox.com/help

Sorry for the inconvenience.
Dropbox team

So the only way is to post all vulnerabilities to FD ?
