+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) allows operations managers and system integrators to build customized video surveillance networks to meet their needs. Cisco VSM provides centralized configuration, management, display, and control of video from Cisco and third-party surveillance endpoints. Multiple security vulnerabilities exist in versions of Cisco VSM prior to 7.0.0, which may allow an attacker to gain full administrative privileges on the system.

More information on Cisco VSM can be found at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10818/index.html.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.
