... OMG!!! 9 years ago after l33t! ...


My main subjects are vulnerability research, linux
-kernel security research as grsec/pax spender
(greets to spender).


[History of The Stuff/Research]

During 2004~2005, 2010~2013, I did the research
for linux kernel security as like the LKM, linux
kernel exploit, ..., linux kernel rootkit research.
The linux kernel vuln researchers less four are
can research from 2008 and no the vuln research
before the year than kernel rootkit techniques.

The milw0rm moved to exploit-db as you know.
I don't have ANY RELATION with the Offensive
Security's operator kidz. The USENIX WOOT was
opened at 2007, about offensive security.

I released the samba dos exploit and I discovered
libtiff <= 3.9.5 Integer overflow bug and released
an article of linux kernel patches for linux kernel
security on ..., full-disclosure, packetstorm
exploit-db, the irc.

Before above stuffs, I released the yapbb exploit
that output of magic_quotes_gpc=on In php.conf
bypass project. AKA exploitation research.

...etc... XOOPS vulnerability ...

I did (vulnerability research) from 2001 within kore
an underground. I've got joined l33t's chans of
irc of efnet, overthewire from 2004 and shared the
exploit stuff that yapbb private exploit on the #phrack
of efnet at 2006 for l33ts and my LKM stuff at 2004
also favorite.

I've got joined these irc channels.
efnet #phrack overthewire #vortex #social

I use x86, mips, arm, ppc archs.
mips, arm, ppc are risc. IBM AIX, Cisco IOS, Mac OS X
uses PPC and MIPS can used by SGI IRIX, *BSD, SysV.

x90c known as a l33t by four phrack l33ts as follow mentioned.

2013           : I released libtiff security bug I discovered
 on full-disclosure and #phrack (greets to '@...ai')
                 (also greets to '@...fdead')
2013           : I released samba dos exploit (+9 years)
2011~2012      : - linux kernel security research
2010           : - linux kernel vuln research
                 - linux kernel exploitation research
                 - linux kernel rootkit research

... I leaved channel ...

2006        : - not near relation with these phrack l33ts.
2006         : l33t @#phrack
                 - I got the phrack @ from another phrack l33t (+6 years)
2006        : I got an IM Invitation of phrack l33t 'BSDaemon' to be a
friend
2006        : I shared yapbb private exploit on the efnet
2004        : - my syswatch_0.0.2 LKM
              - isec kernel exploit tests
              - c0de kernel patches
2004        : l33t (I joined #phrack @#vortex) (+4 years)
                 * I got the vortex @ from a phrack l33t THE 'rebel'
                 - I WAS NOT 'korean underground' kid from the year

...... End of korean underground kid ......

2001~2003: underground hacker team of korean hacker community activity
           only on the online not offline.
           * ANY RELATION with the kidz of korean underground.

[Research Works]

...

- i*(company) as a co-worker
    2012/10/04 ~ 2013/04/08 - exploitation research
    2010/02/01 ~ 2010/10/13 - vulnerability research
                            - exploitation research
    * ANY RELATION with the hacker.

(PM 07:10:05) <x90c> old dude.
(PM 07:13:23) <rebel> here i am having a perfectly adequate saturday
morning and you have to come remind me that i'm getting old :(
(PM 07:16:06) <x90c> I share the exploit for leets
(PM 07:16:14) <x90c> check it out!
(PM 07:16:24) <x90c> you may fun
(PM 07:17:23) <rebel> i like it, especially the comments ;)
(PM 07:18:50) <x90c> yep :-)

(AM 02:28:47) <skier_> x90c: i don't understand it, i guess, what are you
explaining here? http://www.x90c.org/articles/glibc/rtld_security.txt
(AM 02:29:57) <x90c> skier_: it's just an review for rtld security.
(AM 02:30:27) <x90c> not great

[05:48] <yokai> x90c_: so was that study lf yours x86 only? or did you
include other cpu archs?
[05:48] <yokai> or did you study other cpu archs rather.. you know
mips(4ke, 24k, etc), arm, whatnot
[05:56] <yokai> http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/
...
[18:07] <x90c> yokai: I use x86, mips, arm, other arch study also needed
right.

[09:08] <x90c_> It's an article of linu kernel patches.  check it out!
[09:08] <x90c_> Linux Kernel Patches For Linux Kernel Security
[09:08] <x90c_> - http://www.x90c.org/articles/linux_kernel_patches.txt
...
[09:50] <yokai> x90c is more active than the entire channel
[09:50] <yokai> ;|o|
[09:50] <yokai> :)
