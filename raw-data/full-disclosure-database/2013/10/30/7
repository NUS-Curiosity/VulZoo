	Sources - Access	Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2124241

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-084
  * Project: FileField Sources [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2013-Oct-30
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module expands on the FileField module by allowing you to select new or
existing files through additional means, such as re-using files with an
auto-complete textfield, attaching server-side files uploaded via FTP,
transferring file files from a remote server, pasting a file directly from
the clipboard, and selecting existing files through the IMCE file browser.

The module doesn't sufficiently check file access permissions when attaching
an existing file. Any existing file could be re-used and the user would then
be granted access to that file.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a
permission granting the ability to create content which has a file field
using the module.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------
