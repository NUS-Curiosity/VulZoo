an interesting discussion :)

"This is perhaps our last fundamental tradeoff before the Singularity
occurs: Do we, as a society, want the comfort and convenience of
increasingly technologic, invisible digital integration enough to pay
for those benefits with the liberties that must be given up to be
protected from the downsides of that integration?" -- dan


i would argue that there is an alternative in design and architecture,
mainly those which decentralize and protect end-to-end. however, there
is a cost attached to these efforts as well, which so far most opt-out
of paying...


best regards,
