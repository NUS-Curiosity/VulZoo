this, in the traditional sense, is what John calls a "COMSEC cover-up":
 http://cryptome.org/2013/10/nsa-hysteria-coverup.htm

meaning that the continual, most significant, and most likely to be
abused and widely are commercial services and collaborations and
products,
  where the product is your private information of any sort, that you
usually unwittingly but sometimes capriciously yield to un trustworthy
third parties with little constraint on secondary distribution for
money to further removed stranger parties...


note that fully decentralized, end-to-end secured, with properly
managed keying and sessions capable technologies are resistant to
these third-party weaknesses and vulnerabilities.


crypto and comms and computing technology should not be abandoned en
whole like the russians for their manual type writers, but the minimum
required operational safety of any information processing system needs
huge innovation to get from current systems to something effective and
usable...  hey look, it's more of those fun problems to solve again ;)
