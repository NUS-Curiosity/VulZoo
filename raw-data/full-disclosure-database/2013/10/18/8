the practical uses are not just authenticity and privacy, but also
censorship avoidance and other availability improvements; c.f.:

"Lightweight Obfuscated Datagram Protocol (LODP)"
  https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005334.html

"Elligator [...] introduces a new solution: an encoding for points on
a single curve as strings indistinguishable from uniform random
strings."

encryption for privacy of data at rest can almost be considered a
subset of the problem of encryption for privacy of communication as
above.


and all of the above hinge critically upon effective key management
and usability! which are the things you're most likely to screw up
inconspicuously and completely.
