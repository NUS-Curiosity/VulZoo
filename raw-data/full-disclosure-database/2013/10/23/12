	Persistent Compromise of Netgear Wireless Routers

Dont trust NetGear to provide any security, I had a home router from NetGear (which was shipped by a reputed ISP) and the admin panel was protected using http basic auth.

The attack u described might be like an advanced level, state of the art attack for them.
