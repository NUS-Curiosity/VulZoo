	Access bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2118717

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-081
  * Project: Spaces [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2013-10-23
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to make configuration options generally available
only at the sitewide level to be configurable and overridden by individual
"spaces" on a Drupal site.

The spaces submodule, Spaces OG, doesn't properly handle deleting of organic
group group spaces when the option to move to a new group is selected.
Instead of moving the content to a new group, the content is left orphaned,
and for deleted private groups, that content will then be viewable by anyone
with "access content" permission when the site's or content's access is
rebuilt.

The issue is mitigated by needing to be using the submodule spaces OG, and
needing the site users to be in the situation of deleting a group and using
that move option, and needing the content's access to be rebuilt.
