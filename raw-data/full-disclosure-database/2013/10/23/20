Equally interesting would be the first sucker^W person to
put this together. I consider the following:

1) Legacy systems that would break on an update
2) skidd^ People randumbly scanning and fixing #1
3) System would have to EXPLOIT vuln to fix it 

On 3, the monetization of POCs (0days) to pull it off, is
worth more at the end of the day than the system they're
looking to build.
