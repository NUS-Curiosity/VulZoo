Subject: darpa to automatically patch flaws


http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/22/darpa_sets_2_million_cash_prize_for_the_ultimate_vulnerability_scanner/
=====
The submitted vulnerability scanners must 
_automatically find and patch_ flaws in code in real-world conditions
=====

Would be interested to see how the warez work after being
automatically patched (though don't believe the Ponzi
scheme will be alive for long).
