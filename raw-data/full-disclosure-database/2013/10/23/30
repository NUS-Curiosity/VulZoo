  * Date: 2013-10-23
  * Security risk: Highly critical [2]

  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to create block entities a.k.a. beans.

The module did not sufficiently filter bean titles for dangerous html.

permission to create or edit beans.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Bean [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Bean module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Bean 7.x-1.5 [5]

Also see the Bean [6] project page.
