Subject: D-Link Security Contact?

I've been working on auditing my home D-Link router (yes, yes I know
everyone's been picking on them lately),
but I'd like to get into contact with their security personnel to
discuss some vulnerabilities that affect one of their
Canadian routers.

Does anyone have a way to reach out to security personnel directly that
will actually care about what I have to say?
I haven't heard back from any of their public addresses, and their
available contact form.

Cheers,

JM
