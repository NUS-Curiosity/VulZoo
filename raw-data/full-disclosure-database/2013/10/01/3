Valdis,

I knew time for trolling would come soon.

FYI attacks on tor are becoming public:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/01/tor_correlation_follows_the_breadcrumbs_back_to_the_users/

â€œAn adversary that provides no more bandwidth than some volunteers do today can deanonymize any given user within three months of regular Tor use with over 50 percent probability and within six months with over 80 percent probability."

I continue to suspect O(1) deanonymization is possible.

Your street cred social trick didn't work, sorry :)
