Subject: [Django] Cookie-based session storage session
	invalidation issue

FD,

I’m back!

Django versions 1.4 – 1.7 offer a cookie-based session storage option (not
the default this time) that is afflicted by the same issue I posted about
previously concerning Ruby on Rails:

If you obtain a user’s cookie, even if they log out, you can still log in
as them.

The short write-up is here, if needed:

Cheers,

G. S. McNamara
