Subject: backdoors in spamtitan

a few month ago backdoors in barracuda was found

https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/backdoors_built.html
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/24/barracuda_backdoor/

apparently their competitor spamtitan was quick making fun of them

http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/294951-reported-backdoors-on-barracuda-appliances

without considering they had their own backdoors

the security of the product is a fucking joke, containing everything from authentication bypass to root exploits. there is really no hope, the developers didnt even try. they can patch those specific vulnerabilities, but have no idea what theyre doing. i only scratched its surface.
