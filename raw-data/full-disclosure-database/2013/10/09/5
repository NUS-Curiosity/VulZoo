Package        : torque
Vulnerability  : authentication bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4319
Debian Bug     : 722306

John Fitzpatrick of MWR InfoSecurity discovered an authentication bypass
vulnerability in torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system.

The torque authentication model revolves around the use of privileged
ports. If a request is not made from a privileged port then it is
assumed not to be trusted or authenticated. It was found that pbs_mom
does not perform a check to ensure that connections are established
from a privileged port.

A user who can run jobs or login to a node running pbs_server or pbs_mom
can exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute code as root on the
cluster by submitting a command directly to a pbs_mom daemon
to queue and run a job.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.
