Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Firewall Services Module Software

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20131009-fwsm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 October 9 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) Software for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers is affected by the following vulnerabilities:

    Cisco FWSM Command Authorization Vulnerability
    SQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco FWSM Command Authorization Vulnerability may result in a complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the SQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

This advisory is available at the following link:

Note: The Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) may be affected by the SQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability. A separate Cisco Security Advisory has been published to disclose the vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco ASA. That advisory is available at:
