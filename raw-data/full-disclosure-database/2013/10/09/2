CVE-2013-2254: Apache Sling denial of service vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:  Apache Sling org.apache.sling.servlets.post.bundle
version 2.2.0 and 2.3.0

Description: With some combinations of access control settings and request
paths, the POST servlet in the Apache Sling org.apache.sling.servlets.post
bundle versions 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 can cause infinite loops, potentially
leading to denial of service attacks.

Mitigation: Users of those bundle versions should update to version 2.3.2
of the bundle (http://sling.apache.org/downloads.cgi)<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=680950&view=rev>
