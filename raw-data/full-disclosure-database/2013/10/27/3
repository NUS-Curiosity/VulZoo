I watched a larger part of this video from that point on.

Regarding the forget to re-sign a DNSSEC zone, I would like to 
point out that ISC bind 9.9 does support 'inline signing'. This 
has the advantage that the zone will be automatically signed upon 
reloading of it. Also bind will re-sign the zone as needed during 
run time.

Regarding the UDP amplification attack with spoofed source 
addresses, since version 9.9.4 ISC bind does have Response Rate 
Limiting (RRL) available. But a much better solution would be, if 
all ISPs and other network operators of IP ranges would protect 
their own networks in such a way that they do drop packets at 
their borders, when the source address is not from their own IP 
ranges. This would prevent not only the DNSSEC amplification 
attack, he was talking about, but also with other DNS requests 
and other UDP based public services (e.g. NTP).

Fabian
