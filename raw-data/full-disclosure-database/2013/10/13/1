Subject: Re: [funsec] Going beyond vulnerability rewards

This approach is similar to how they are developing Chromium/Chrome OS. The
code is out there fr manufacturers to test their hardware against, and when
people run into issues, the problem gets added to the database and everyone
contributes what they can to a solution.

An "add-on" project they are working on that many including me are
following is the integrated Tor client/code. It is getting close to doable,
but they are asking for external help on parts of it, mainly due to
resource limitations.
