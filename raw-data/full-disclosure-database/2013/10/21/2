Subject: Advantages of Stack Guard over Stack Shield

Hi,

I would like to know why nowadays Stack Guard is used everywhere (example:
ProPolice in GCC, /GS in Visual Studio) instead of Stack Shield.

Both the approaches (i.e. Stack Guard & Stack Shield) provide an equal
level of security.

Any specific advantages of Stack Guard over Stack Shield ?

Cheers,
Jaydeep
