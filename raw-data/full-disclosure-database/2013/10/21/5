Debian Bug     : 653963 698440 700226

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Rack, a modular Ruby
webserver interface. The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2011-5036

    Rack computes hash values for form parameters without restricting
    the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
    by sending many crafted parameters. 

CVE-2013-0184

    Vulnerability in Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-0263

    Rack::Session::Cookie allows remote attackers to guess the
    session cookie, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code via a
    timing attack involving am HMAC comparison function that does not
    run in constant time. 

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0-4+squeeze1.

The stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain the
librack-ruby package. They have already been addressed in version
1.4.1-2.1 of the ruby-rack package.

We recommend that you upgrade your librack-ruby packages.
