Subject: Re: [Django] Cookie-based session storage session
 invalidation issue

Here's the commit that added the warning 2 years ago to the 1.4 documentation:
https://github.com/django/django/commit/6205a348f084cbab8d2953accecfc04b9fc75543

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/http/sessions/#using-cookie-based-sessions

Let me quote for you:

"No freshness guarantee

Note also that while the MAC can guarantee the authenticity of the
data (that it was generated by your site, and not someone else), and
the integrity of the data (that it is all there and correct), it
cannot guarantee freshness i.e. that you are being sent back the last
thing you sent to the client. This means that for some uses of session
data, the cookie backend might open you up to replay attacks. Cookies
will only be detected as ‘stale’ if they are older than your
SESSION_COOKIE_AGE."

While I agree that this might be unexpected behavior, I think it is
not unreasonable to expect developers to read the large warning
callout collocated with the feature they are enabling. Clearly it is
too much to ask of security researchers, however, so that section was
made even larger and more explicit.
