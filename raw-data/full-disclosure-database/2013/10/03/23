ok, lame is too harsh; inaccurate.  as part of a larger campaign of
pwn, XSS can play part in a pandemic pounding of target host or
network.

better to say "routine XSS", which XSS certainly is.

 E.g.
"...we built a total of 181,238 unique exploit test cases,... these
[test cases] we were able to trigger our reporting function 69,987
times... [and] that the exploits triggered 8,163 unique
vulnerabilities."

i've read 2,261 threads discussing XSS on this list.
 do we really need to discuss the remaining thousands?
