Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
A vulnerability was found in the nsconfigd daemon (TCP port 3008 (SSL) and
3010). This daemon can be crashed by sending a specially crafted message.
No prior authentication is necessary. A watchdog daemon (pitboss) automatically
restarts nsconfigd after the first six crashes and then reboots the appliance.
By sending just a few packets the appliance can be kept in a constant reboot
loop resulting in total loss of availability. 


Proof of concept:
-----------------
The nsconfigd daemon can be crashed for six times using the following Python
script. Subsequently the appliance reboots.

Detailed proof of concept exploits have been removed for this vulnerability.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been verified to exist in Citrix NetScaler VPX (Build
70.7.nc), which was the most recent version at the time of discovery.
