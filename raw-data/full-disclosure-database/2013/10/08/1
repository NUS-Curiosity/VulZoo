Subject: How many .gov sites did the usa government
	ddosed/nearly defaced?

Just noticed http://www.nist.gov/ is not alive due to the
usa government.

Approximately how many .gov websites are in such a condition?

And the NSA is axing phds and mathematicians:

However, NSA Director Keith B. Alexander said that the agency had furloughed "over 960 Ph.D.s, over 4,000 computer scientists, [and] over a thousand mathematicians."[62]
