Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Apple AppStore
Product: Bluetooth U - Mobile Web Application 1.2.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local path traversal and file include vulnerability is detected in the Bluetooth U v1.2.0  iOS mobile application (Apple iOS - iPad & iPhone).
The path traversal allows remote attackers to unauthorized switch or access folder to access application, device or system information.

The web vulnerability allows to bypass the regular path to folder generate by exploitation of the `New Folder` add function. Remote attackers 
can create a directory by using a manipulated second path with a frame to load. The vulnerability can be exploited by requesting the mobile 
application with a manipulated path (folder) value parameter. The redirect will load the wrong path value and redirects the user to the local 
mobile application or device system path/file. The malicious context also executes in the DelegateData on deletes too.

Exploitation of the path/directory web vulnerability requires no user interaction and non privileged mobile web.application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in the unauthorized access of remote users to local application path or system/device files.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] New Folder - Index

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] chxItem & ChkItem


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The path/directory-traversl web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account and also 
without user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Note: root :)


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a restriction of the filename user input. Encode and parse the input and filter the 
index file name dir listing to prevent executions.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the path/directory traversal web vulnerability is estimated as high(+).
