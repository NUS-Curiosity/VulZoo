Subject: Re: Mavericks...less then a bargin?

Agreed the keychain is spooky...saving grace is that it's not required
for functionality, whereas syncing contacts/calendar it's required.

Perhaps even better for the government spooks is the keychain:

As Gutmann said, if it was MS, then headlines would be screaming
"Microsoft steals user's passwords".

It gets even better -  you did not even touch upon misuse. For those
who have not read Apple obscene Terms of Service, here's from a paper
decrying use of cloud services:

A layman’s analysis of License Agreements and Terms and Conditions
reveals how little security is afforded to your documents in cloud
storage and backup to the cloud. For those who don’t read them, one
popular platform has 142 separate documents covering Terms of
Conditions for its cloud alone.[1]  The documents discuss your rights
if the company (1) gives away your data, (2) shares you data with
partners, (3) looses your data, (4) provides your data to authorities
(sometimes without an order or warrant), (5) does not provide
reasonable skill or care, (6) commits willful misconduct or fraud, and
(7) acts with negligence or gross negligence. “Your rights” is
misleading since it is consent, and the document effectively states
you indemnify the company: “You agree to defend, indemnify and hold
[company], its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, contractors, and licensors harmless from
any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by a
third party.” [2]
