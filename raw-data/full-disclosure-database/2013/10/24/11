Subject: Re: Handling bad ISP's

Getting scanned doesn't phase me in the least..it's the nature of the
beast now.  Irresponsible ISP's do.  I keep my stuff clean and wired
tight...why can't they?  Heck I'd take an auto-response at this
point...something is better then nothing ;)  A good discussion though
all in all :)
