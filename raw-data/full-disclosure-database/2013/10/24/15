You're forgetting about certificate pinning which defeats MiTM if the
certificate is issued by an unauthorized CA.

For example, here at Twitter we have certificate pinning in all of our
clients to ensure SSL certificates are only signed by trusted CAs and as
well as Chrome.

Emerging standards like TACK and DANE will help greatly with this issue.
