Utilizing DNS just moves the key distribution problem around. Instead
of trusting a CA you're now trusting DNS. In either case, you're still
likely trusting someone (CA or DNS) external to your organization.

Dr. Bernstein has a good time with DNSSEC in his talks. See, for
example, Cryptography Worst Practices,
http://secappdev.org/lectures/144. The entire talk is good, but his
DNSSEC bashing occurs around 14:40 (min:sec).
