Subject: .NET Runtime packer PoC

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

I know there is already a huge ecosystem on runtime
packer/obfuscators, but for some pesky problem I was required to roll
my own to incorporate in a pipeline-like system.

Apart from the obvious idiocracy around runtime packing/obfuscating in
the .NET/Java world, I put it on Github to provide a starting point
for people to learn using high-level constructs how a runtime
packer/encryptor works, so people can learn what their common
weaknesses are, that they aren't mitigations to R/E and just for
reusability.

Code quality: crappy/hackerish
Supports: .NET 4.0/2.0
