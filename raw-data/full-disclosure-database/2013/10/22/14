 for port 80?

If you're really curious, why not just run Apache for a day or so and see
exactly what it's looking for, what it's user-agent is, etc? That'd likely
tell you way more than any of us can. For example, if it turns out to be
looking for /someobscuredir - then there's a good chance Gary is right.
Meanwhile, if it's only attempting to access generic paths (e.g. / or
robots.txt) - and nothing super specific, then it's likely closer to
Bobby's answer.
