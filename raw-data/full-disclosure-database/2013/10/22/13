	Persistent Compromise of Netgear Wireless Routers

I did a writeup of a neat authentication bypass bug I found[1] in Netgear's venerable WNDR3700v4 wireless router.  It gives you complete, unauthenticated access to the router's administrative interface.  Authentication is disabled persistently, surviving reboots.  Thought I'd share it:

Thanks!

[1] Jacob Holocomb if Independent Security Evaluators let me know he found a similar bug back in April this year in the WNDR4700.  Here's a link to that report:
