Subject: Web Attackers Blacklist


Cobbled together a script to scrape my logs, parse out web
based attackers (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc) and compile said list
for blacklisting. Script is pulling from 6 different web
servers for now. I may add more later depending on whether
or not I see a lot of usage.
