Stack Shield needs to manage two stacks (an ordinary stack and an extra 
stack for saved returned addresses). This is prone to break various things 
(multithreading, longjmp) and I am afraid a hypothetical implementation 
would have to be quite heavyweight and messy in order to avoid breaking 
them.
