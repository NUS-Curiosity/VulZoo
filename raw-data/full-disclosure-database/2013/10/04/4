There are no credentials by default, authentication is disabled for telnet/ssh/ftp allowing remote access to the device's storage. PHP can be uploaded to the webserver and executed.

	• ftp server allows writes to lighttp/php* directory.
	• telnet default authentication turned off.
	• ssh server default authentication turned off.
	• Anonymous SOCKS proxy & http/ftp proxy.
SSHD

larry$ ssh 192.168.0.29 -p 2222
$ id

up time: 19:42:02, idle time: 18:47:19, sleep time: 00:00:00 $

Telnet
