 rewarded with $12.50

If you are sending in an unsolicited vulnerability report, I think
it's fair to expect the vendor to fix the issue promptly and play
nice.

Beyond that, you are willfully making a gamble with your own time.
Nobody is forcing you to do that. If you are lucky, perhaps the vendor
will be impressed with your work and perhaps will contract you in the
future. Or, perhaps they will give you a hefty reward. Another
perfectly acceptable outcome is that they will just thank you and
maybe send you a t-shirt. A coupon to a corporate store seems a bit
impersonal, but you know, gift horse, mouth...

In the end, vulnerability reward programs have their pros and cons,
compared to building in-house talent, commissioning traditional
third-party security assessments, and so on; companies that favor one
approach over the other aren't necessarily incompetent or evil. And
you know, I'm saying this as a guy who recently bumped our own rewards
for XSS to as much as $7.5k...
