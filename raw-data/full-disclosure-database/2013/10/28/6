Subject: Mavericks...less then a bargin?

A warning (disclosure) to you Apple people....if you're planning to
sync your shiny iDevice with Mavericks, you will be FORCED to use
iCloud (syncing from your iDevice to your iPuter is now gone).  I
suspect this is one of the reasons why Mavericks was a "free" upgrade.
 Apple probably figured the $40 they'd get from the sale of the OS is
less then when they'd get with have your calendar and your contacts
within easy reach.  Per their policy:
