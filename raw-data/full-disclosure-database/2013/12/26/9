Subject: Vulnerabilities in plugins for WordPress,
	Joomla and Plone with Dewplayer

Hello list!

These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in 
plugins for WordPress, Joomla and Plone with Dewplayer. Earlier I wrote 
about vulnerabilities in Dewplayer 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Dec/192). This is media player, 
which is used at thousands web sites and in multiple web applications. There 
are near 422 000 web sites with dewplayer.swf in Google's index. And it's 
just one file name and there are other file names of this player (such as 
dewplayer-en.swf and others).

This flash media player is used in the next plugins: Dewplayer WordPress 
plugin, JosDewplayer and mosdewplayer for Joomla and collective.dewplayer 
for Plone. Also there can be other plugins with Dewplayer.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next web applications: Dewplayer WordPress plugin 1.2 and 
previous versions, JosDewplayer 2.0 and previous versions, all versions of 
mosdewplayer, collective.dewplayer 1.2 and previous versions.

Vulnerable are web applications which are using Dewplayer 2.2.2 and previous 
versions.

Affected vendors:
