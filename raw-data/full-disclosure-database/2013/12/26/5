Subject: [Wooyun] Safari for windows PhishingAlert bypass
	vuln

*Abstract:*
The PhishingAlert of Safari stops functioning in Windows systems if an
abnormal URL is being used.

*Details:*
There is a defense mechanism in Safari which recognizes URL deceits such as
http://www.baidu.com@...l.com. The phishing alert will be activated once
the HTTP URL that we want to access contains userinfo information.

(as the picture below shows)

> http://apple.com@...er.me/



*Proofs of concept:*
We discovered in our researches that if one or two “/” are being added
before the host name, then the PhishingAlert could be bypassed. (Password
of userinfo must be available)
