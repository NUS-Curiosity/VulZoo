	- Access bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2149791

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-097
   * Project: OG Features [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x
   * Date: 2013-December-04
   * Security risk: Not Critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to enable and disable bundles of functionality for
individual Organic groups [3]. In order to provide this functionality, this
module must override all menu callbacks available in the system, in order to
delegate access based on the current Organic group you are contextually in,
and the settings of the features for that group.

The module doesn't sufficiently override pages that have an access callback
explicitly set to FALSE, which indicates that no user (even admins) are able
to access the page. Since this module does not handle that condition
correctly, users will have access to those pages.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it's extremely rare that a
page in Drupal has it's access callback explicitly set to FALSE because that
would mean that no single user, including admins, would be able to access the
page.
