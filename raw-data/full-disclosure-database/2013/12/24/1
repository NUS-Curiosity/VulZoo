Package        : libcommons-fileupload-java
Vulnerability  : arbitrary file upload via deserialization
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2186
Debian Bug     : 726601

It was discovered that Apache Commons FileUpload, a package to make it
easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to servlets
and web applications, incorrectly handled file names with NULL bytes in
serialized instances. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized
instance of the DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a
server, could use this flaw to write arbitrary content to any location
on the server that is accessible to the user running the application
server process.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-2.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-2.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libcommons-fileupload-java packages.
