Subject: [Onapsis Research Labs] New SAP Security In-Depth
 issue: "Transport Management System: Highway to Production"

We are happy to announce a new issue of the Onapsis SAP Security In-Depth publication.

SAP Security In-Depth is a free publication led by Onapsis Research Labs with the purpose of providing practical
educational information about the current and future risks in this area, allowing all the different roles (financial
managers, information security managers, SAP administrators, auditors, consultants and others) to better understand the
complete set of risks their SAP systems can contain and the techniques and tools available to assess and mitigate those
risks.

In this edition: "Transport Management System: Highway to Production", by Pablo Muller and Juan Perez-Etchegoyen.
------
In all SAP implementations there are numerous reasons why organizations would need to make changes and updates; from
changes to legislation and compliance mandates to business growth and process evolution. The Transport Management System
(TMS) is the backbone for properly executing these changes across a landscape (Dev, QA, PROD, etc). If TMS is not
properly secured, a malicious attacker could initiate disruptive and negatively impactful changes to Productive systems.

We hope you enjoy this new issue!

Kindest regards,
