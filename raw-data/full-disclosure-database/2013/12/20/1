Hi Yuan,
Good find for the NtConnectPort() MaximumMessageLength overflow. LPC has had many bugs and issues when >256 bytes.
Can you tell me which LPC "RPC Control" PortName you found best to imitate as a server so as to trigger the stack overflow?

Is it one of these? http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-October/076830.html

Best
