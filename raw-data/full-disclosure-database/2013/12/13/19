Rather harsh don't you think? I'm all for OSS but I have expenses and
need to make money. Yes M$ makes money, but I think their ethical just
as much as any other company .. is IBM ethical? Is HP ethical? Is Dell
(the company) ethical? They all are to some degree. M$ has a HUGE
installed base of software and need more time to repair things because
of the time it takes to do regressive testing, that makes them slow, but
not necessarily unethical. Sure we'd love them to jump on every bug we
find, fix them fast and some people want to be paid for that bug as
well. I know they've pissed many people off over time, but I don't think
their any less ethical than any other for profit company, and if we have
no for $$$ companies, then who is going to pay our salaries?
