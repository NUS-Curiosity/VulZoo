Answers:
1. Whether you are right and there is a bug, lrt the vendor (M$) know; that is ethical. They will decide if to consider your finding as a bug. Your following steps depend on their opinion on the finding.
2. If you keep it for yourself - no problems. If you disclose on Internet before informing M$, there is certain risk, but first of all it is not ethical. If you sell it as an exploit, and it will be widely used as 0-day, then it might be a hunt for your head with some bounty (you are not relly breaking a law as I wrote below, but angry government may find something suitable for you) . So, you need to consider risks and how to hide your identity. If you found bug not breaking MS code and not accessing to a computer illegally, you do not break any formal law. Breaking MS code may be considered as a violation of their property rights, but MS guys should be really angry to pursue such case.
As you describe, you did not do anything illegal and releasing the finding is up to you, again - ethics.
3. Will make you a star, but not shining brings more risks.

Shortly - inform M$ first and wait what they said. If they do not agree - you are free to go.

I think I found a relatively small bug with Windows Server running DNS with recursion turned off, that still allows the server to be used for DDOS amplification attacks. There are a sizable number of these on the net, and I do not think operators realize that the server is not totally silent with recursion turned off. 
I want to put my findings here on the list, as well as on my blog but I am unsure if :

1. should I tell MS first?
2. being this is possibly my first bug as a researcher, will this get me into trouble (legal or otherwise)?
3. will this make me a rock star?

I have details on the bug, as well as remediation steps. I would not say I "discovered" it per se, as I found it while studying an attack on a network I protect, but I do not see it documented anywhere either.

What say you, Wise List Readers?
