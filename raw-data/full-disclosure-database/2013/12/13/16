 disclosure

Of course everyone has their opinion and is allowed to have one, mine is
more similar to Mikhail's, warn Microsoft, they may take a couple of
days to answer. If they ask for little time to evaluate, it's up to you.
If they ask for unreasonable time, and keep in mind they only patch
monthly, then it's up to you if you want to disclose, but I would warn
them of the date you will be disclosing.

>From the little you disclosed it sounds like they will consider it a low
priority and request a long delay in the disclosure.

Do you know if Bind reacts the same? There a MANY more Bind DNS servers
on the web than Microsoft ones.

If you sell it as an exploit, and it will be widely used as 0-day, then it might be a hunt for your head with some bounty (you are not relly breaking a law as I wrote below, but angry government may find something suitable for you) . So, you need to consider risks and how to hide your identity. If you found bug not breaking MS code and not accessing to a computer illegally, you do not break any formal law. Breaking MS code may be considered as a violation of their property rights, but MS guys should be really angry to pursue such case.
