If you sell it as an exploit, and it will be widely used as 0-day, then it might be a hunt for your head with some bounty (you are not relly breaking a law as I wrote below, but angry government may find something suitable for you) . So, you need to consider risks and how to hide your identity. If you found bug not breaking MS code and not accessing to a computer illegally, you do not break any formal law. Breaking MS code may be considered as a violation of their property rights, but MS guys should be really angry to pursue such case.
