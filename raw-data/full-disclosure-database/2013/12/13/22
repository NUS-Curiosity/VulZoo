 disclosure

Of course, all software companies would love for the disclosure to wait
for the fix to be released, and often, if the delay is considered
reasonable by the hacker in question who found the bug, then that's what
happens. I think it's only in the case where the company considers the
bug to be minor or non existent, and they are asking for a ridiculous
delay that many hackers will say, 'tough luck I'm disclosing on xx' and
he takes his chances that most of us agree with his decision. As Mikhail
said, if the hacker came across the bug without any illegal means then
he should be fine after the release (but IANAL).
