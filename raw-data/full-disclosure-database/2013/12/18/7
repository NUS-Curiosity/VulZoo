Subject: InfoSec Southwest 2014 CFP now open!

Hi computer enthusiasts!

I'm delighted to announce this year's call for papers for ISSW 2014 is
open now through 11:59:59 CST, February 1, 2014.

ISSW 2014 will be held in downtown Austin, Texas, USA, from Friday,
April 4 through Sunday, April 6th. Yes, this is well after SXSW, so
all the out-of-towner hipsters should be long gone. You'll still be
free to experience our usual complement of locally-raised hipsters.

Details on the CFP are here:

Once you've confirmed you've hit the requirements listed there, please
send your material to:

cfp@...osecsouthwest.com

Good luck!
