Microsoft Corporation
Product: Photo Story - Flash 2013 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a client side input cross site in flash component of Microsofts Website Application.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to execute malicious non-persistent script on client side.

The vulnerability is located in the flash photo-story module when processing the load 2 different manipulated xmlloc parameter via GET method.
The client-side script code will be executed in the flash web application layout as frame. During investigation it has been revealed 
that a remote attacker can manipulate both entry points  to inject his own html and java-script.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires no privilege application user account but low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent malware injects, persistent external 
redirects and manipulation of affected module- or application context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] photo-story

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] photostory3.swf

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] xmlloc


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client side cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with low privilege application 
user account and low or medium required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC: Generated Source Code

} // End of the function
$VERSION = "XXX_21118_0000";
var CONTROL_FILENAME = _root.controlloc;   <<<xml file being included without any validation
var XML_FILENAME = _root.xmlloc;           <<<xml file being included without any validation 
initPlayer();
buffer = 0.500000;
// [Action in Frame 3]

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a restriction and parse of the xmlloc GET parameter request.
Parse also the affected output listing in the main module of the online service.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).
