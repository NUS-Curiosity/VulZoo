I had something to do with Chrome, Safari, and Firefox disallowing
cross-domain drag-and-drop:

We have pinged Microsoft long time ago about this, too - and hopefully
this will be resolved on their end (at that rate, somewhere by year
2032).

But I wouldn't consider it a failing on part of the targeted website -
you'd need to put essentially everything behind XFO to fix this
problem on application level, which is not feasible for a good number
of websites (including FB, because they have a variety of gadgets that
are meant to be framed).

Well, honestly, that becomes a bit of a stretch - if there's a good
PoC you can put together for Facebook specifically, I suspect it may
convince them to fix this, though.
