Subject: Re: Clickjacking (?) on Facebook.com (Question)

What is your exact concern?

One should obviously not enter their Facebook credentials while the
address bar shows darksecurity.de; after all, instead of framing
Facebook, you could just create a fake login form that looks just like
theirs.

Clickjacking is a distinct concern, but generally only in cases where
a UI action with serious consequences (e.g., deleting your account,
sharing something with a stranger) can be accomplished in one or
several clicks. The pages you are framing don't seem to fall into this
category. It's worth noting that XFO doesn't fully eliminate the risk:

An interesting consequence of pages that show your login or other
personal information, and can be framed, is that they make phishing a
bit easier: you can cleverly arrange them to imply that the top-level
page knows who you are. But the gain here probably isn't dramatic.
