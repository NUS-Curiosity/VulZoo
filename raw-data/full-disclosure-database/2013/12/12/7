That page allows drag-and-drop of the user's name. If you can convince the user
to select his name with a triple-click and then do a drag-and-drop of that name to
some place outside the iframe, you can find out his name, so I'd say it's a privacy
leak.

Yeah, Chromium has protections against that, but they're not exactly
bulletproof â€“ they become useless as soon as there's a single page on the
victim domain that is framable and somehow lets the user publish data. This is
because Chromium allows drag-and-drop between two frames from the same domain
even if those two frames are inside another page and the drag-and-drop goes
"through" a page with different origin. Also, as far as I know, not all
webbrowsers have such protections.
