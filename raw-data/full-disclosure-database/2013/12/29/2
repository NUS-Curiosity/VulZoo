Subject: Re: Happy Holidays / Xmas Advisory

joernchen, your dedication to making it a happy holidays by helping this
project become secure is much appreciated.

Henri Salo cleverly created a github issue which quickly led to some work
being done on the issues reported.
https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/wiki/Fixing-security-vulnerabilities-(27th-Dec-2013)


Please continue bringing happiness to the holidays by grabbing the latest
source and make tickets in github for the next round of security flaws you
find (pull requests for any the fixes you write would be even better!)

Gage, Brandon and PsychoBilly we haven't updated the demo site yet (trying
to get keys to it's hosting location) but could you bring up an instance
with the latest code and take the time to dick around a bit more seeking
out more "duh" code?

Good work guys. Thanks.
