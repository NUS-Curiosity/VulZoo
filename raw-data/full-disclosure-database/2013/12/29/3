I've created [1] to ease discovery of new problematic code
combinations. Good use is to run it with e.g.

socat TCP4-LISTEN:1234,reuseaddr=1,fork=1
EXEC:./Virtual86RandomCode,nofork=1

And send random data via network:

tee TestInput < /dev/urandom | socat - TCP4:x.x.x.x:1234 > ProcessedBlocks

And watch your console or dmesg output (when your kernel did not lock
up completely)
