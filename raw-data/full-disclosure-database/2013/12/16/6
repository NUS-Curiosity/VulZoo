Package        : iceape

Security support for Iceape, the Debian-branded version of the Seamonkey
suite needed to be stopped before the end of the regular security
maintenance life cycle.

We recommend to migrate to Iceweasel for the web browser functionality
and to Icedove for the e-mail bits. Iceweasel and Icedove are based
on the same codebase and will continue to be supported with security
updates. Alternatively you can switch to the binaries provided by
Mozilla available at http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: http://www.debian.org/security/
