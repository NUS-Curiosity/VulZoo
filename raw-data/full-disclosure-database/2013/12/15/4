Allright.
After I chatted with a MS rep (I posted the transcript of the short conversation elsewhere in the thread), I got a response in the list from secure()microsoft. I sent the details to secure()microsoft of the bug and the mitigation steps.

Again, I am glad to read the variety of opinions on this issue. Hopefully the bug will be confirmed/fixed in a reasonable time and I will share the details with you once I get MS's take on it.
