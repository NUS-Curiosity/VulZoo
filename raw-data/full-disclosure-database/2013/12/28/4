Subject: vm86 syscall kernel-panic and some more goodies
	waiting to be analyzed

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

It seems that at least on 32-bit Debian-sid kernel in VirtualBox
guest, [1] triggers a kernel-panic. This simple POC does not allow
privilege escalation although there might be also some time-race
component involved, sometimes similar code seems to access
uninitialized memory or triggers NULL-dereferences. Therefore the
simple POC code could be extended for more extensive testing. See [2]
for more information.
