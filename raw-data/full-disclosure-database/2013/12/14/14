Subject: Re: <b>Where are you guys standing re: the (full)
 disclosure question?</b>

Q: 1. should I tell MS first?
A: Microsoft is just a big company - there are good guys(my good friend was
there), and there are bad guys(who think too much about money, etc). So,
it's up to you whether you email secure@ms. Another factor: it can take
months for a bug to be fixed(first MSRC checks it, then product team fixes
it, then release - all steps take a lot of time). Guninski "give them a few
seconds" - if you want to work with Microsoft, you got to be a little
patient.

Q: 2. being this is possibly my first bug as a researcher, will this get me
into trouble (legal or otherwise)?
A: No, publishing before fix will not get you into trouble. Guninski "if
they sue you" - they won't sue you(Guninski did it before on Microsoft
products, and he is fine).

Q: 3. will this make me a rock star?
A: Ah, this depends on the impact.
