Hi Pedro,
Well, it is customary, and actually it makes sense, to inform MS first. Give them time to analyse your findings, and give you a response. If they tell it is going to be fixed, wait with disclosure until it is fixed, at least.

I can't answer the legal question. I am not a lawyer, I do not know where in the world you are and, most importantly, I do not know what you did to research this.

And, it will not make you a rock star, you would have to play guitar for that.

Sincerely,
Jasper

There are a sizable number of these on the net, and I do not think operators realize that the server is not totally silent with recursion turned off.
