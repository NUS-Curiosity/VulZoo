I think I found a relatively small bug with Windows Server running DNS
with recursion turned off, that still allows the server to be used for
DDOS amplification attacks. There are a sizable number of these on the
net, and I do not think operators realize that the server is not
totally silent with recursion turned off. 
I want to put my findings here on the list, as well as on my blog but
I am unsure if :

1. should I tell MS first?
2. being this is possibly my first bug as a researcher, will this get
me into trouble (legal or otherwise)?
3. will this make me a rock star?

I have details on the bug, as well as remediation steps. I would not
say I "discovered" it per se, as I found it while studying an attack
on a network I protect, but I do not see it documented anywhere
either.

What say you, Wise List Readers?
