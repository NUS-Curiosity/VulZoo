Subject: E-mail Hacking - Hacker Highschool

Hi,

We just added the new Lesson 9: "Hacking E-mail" to the Hacker
Highschool website. That's our 7th lesson finished so far in the
version 2 series with 22 lessons planned.

We just released the new version of Lessons 1 and 2 in Spanish and the
first 3 are also available in Russian.

English Lessons available currently are:

Lesson 01 - Being a Hacker
Lesson 02 - Essential Commands
Lesson 03 - Ports and Protocols
Lesson 04 - Playing With Daemons
Lesson 05 - System Identification
Lesson 08 - Forensics

Hacker Highschool are lessons written specifically for teens to learn
hacking skills which focus on resourcefulness, problem solving,
networking, security, and critical thinking. Lessons are multi-level
with a “Feed Your Head” section for those who want advanced know-how
and a continuing story titled “Game Over” about a teen hacker puts the
lesson in a real-world context. The lessons are free for download and
have been translated into 6 additional languages.

updated.
