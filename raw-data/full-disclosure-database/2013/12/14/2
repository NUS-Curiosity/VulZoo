Whether you like Microsoft or not isn't the point, and it's a whole
other topic.

In the past, full disclosure benefited everybody and it was a way to
gain notoriety among the community.

It's taken years to get people to accept "responsible disclosure" (ie,
giving software companies time to fix the vulnerability before full
disclosure).

We know that the NSA, FBI, and CIA have asked software companies, like
Microsoft and Cisco, not to patch vulnerabilities. These agencies used
these vulnerabilities to their advantage to spy on others. OK, that's
what they do.

Ethics? Define it.
