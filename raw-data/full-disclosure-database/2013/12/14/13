INTRODUCTION


After 7 very successful editions here we are again, off  to the 8th
edition of the you Sh0t the Sheriff information security conference
and we are sending this out so you send us the coolest stuff you've
been working on.

The conference will happening on April, 14th, 2014 in a secret
location within the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This is your chance to
speak about the latest research you have been working on to the most
influential crowd in the Brazilian Information Security realm.


ABOUT THE CONFERENCE


you Sh0t the Sheriff is a very unique, one-day, event dedicated to
bringing cutting edge talks to the top-notch professionals of the
Braziliian Information Security Community.


The conference’s main goal is to bring the attendees to the current
state of the information security world by bringing the most relevant
topics from different Infosec segments of the market and providing an
environment ideal for networking and sharing ideas.


YSTS is a an exclusive, mostly invite-only security con. Getting a
talk accepted, will, not only get you to the event, but after you
successfully present your talk, you will receive a challenge-coin that
guarantees your entry to YSTS for as long as the conference exists.


Due to the great success of the previous years' editions, yes, we're
keeping the same

format:


* YSTS 8 will be held at an almost secret location only announced to whom

it may concern a couple of weeks before the con

* the venue will be, most likely, a very cool club or a bar
(seriously, look at the pictures)

* appropriate environment to network with great security folks from
Brazil and abroad

* since it’s a 1 day con with tons of talks and activities, we fill
everyone with coffee, food and booze



CONFERENCE FORMAT


Anything Information Security related is interesting for the
conference, which will help us create a cool and diverse line-up. We
strictly *do not* accept commercial/ product-related pitches. Keep in
mind though, this is a one-day conference, we receive a lot of
submissions, so your unique research with cool demos will surely stand
out to the other papers.

We do like shorter talks, so please submit your talks and remember
they must be 30 minutes long. (yes, we do strictly enforce that)


We’re also opened to some 15-minute talks, some of the smart people
around might not need 30 minutes to deliver a message, or it might be
a project that has been just kicked-off.

15 minutes might be your thing and that's nothing to be ashamed about.


you Sh0t the Sheriff is the perfect conference to release your new
projects, other people have released very cool research before they
presented it at the bigger cons later in the year. We also like that,
a lot.

And yes, we do prefer new hot-topics. "First-time" speakers are more
than welcome.

If you got good content to present, that's all that matters.
