Subject: [FD] Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part 82): INVALID/BOGUS
	AppLocker rules disable SAFER on Windows 11 22H2

Hi @ll,

in Windows 11 22H2. some imbeciles from Redmond added the following
(of course WRONG and INVALID) registry entries and keys which they
dare to ship to their billion world-wide users:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Srp\Gp]
"RuleCount"=dword:00000002
"LastWriteTime"=hex(b):01,00,00,00,00,00,00,00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Srp\Gp\DLL]

JFTR: the time stamp is 100ns past midnight on 1601-01-01;
      the rule count is wrong too, there are ZERO rules.

Although these entries are bogus and no rules are actually present,
they disable SAFER as documented, for example in
<https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2228450&seqNum=11>

FIX: remove these registry entries and/or keys to enable SAFER again!

stay tuned, and far away from the crap made in Redmond
Stefan
