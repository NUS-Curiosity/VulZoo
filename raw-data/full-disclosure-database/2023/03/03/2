Subject: [FD] SRP on Windows 11

The correction to:
Full Disclosure: Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part 82):
INVALID/BOGUS AppLocker rules disable SAFER on Windows 11 22H2
(seclists.org) <https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Feb/13>

The Kanthak correction to restore SRP functionality on Windows 11 ver.
22H2, works only when Smart App Control is OFF. If it is in Evaluate or ON
mode, then the invalid registry values are automatically restored after
restarting Windows.
To restore SRP on all SAC modes, one should not delete registry values but
simply set the "RuleCount" value to 0:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Srp\Gp]
"RuleCount"=dword:00000000


Windows restart is required.
