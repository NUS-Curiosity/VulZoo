Subject: [FD] Insecure python cgi documentation and tutorials are vulnerable
	to XSS.

Is there low hanging fruit for the following observation?

The documentation of the python cgi module is vulnerable to XSS
(cross site scripting)

https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html

```
form = cgi.FieldStorage()
print("<p>name:", form["name"].value)
print("<p>addr:", form["addr"].value)
```

First result on google for "tutorial python cgi"
is https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_cgi_programming.htm

And it is almost the same as the python doc.

I verified that setting ```name=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>```
will trigger dialog, demonstrating javascript is executed
on the cgi host.

I would expect that devs who read the docs or tutorials will write
vulnerable cgis.
