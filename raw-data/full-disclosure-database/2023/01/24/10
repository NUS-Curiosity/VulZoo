Subject: [FD] t2'23: Call For Papers 2023 (Helsinki, Finland)

Call For Papers 2023

Tired of your bosses suspecting conference trips to exotic locations being just a ploy to partake in Security Vacation Club? Prove them wrong by coming to Helsinki, Finland on May 4-5 2023! Guaranteed lack of sunburn, good potential for rain or slush. In case of great spring weather, though, no money back.

CFP and registration both open. Read further if still unsure.

Maui, Miami, Las Vegas, Tel Aviv or Wellington feel so much sunnier once you’ve experienced the lack of infinity pools in Northern Europe. Instead of pools and palms trees, we can offer you actual saunas and a high tech environment, which is a weird combination of demoscene, widespread Linux adoption, mobile Internet with uncapped flat rate data and a long history of IRC and imageboards.

What defines a conference? For t2 it has always been that intimate welcoming atmosphere of a small event, which makes both audience and speakers approachable. There are enough regulars to create the feeling of a community, but not too many that a first-comer would feel being left out. On the content side, we have always been and always will be a technical security conference, emphasizing the cutting edge, world class research. This is an event for the community. Our focus[1] is on technical excellence, not politics or player hating.

t2’23 offers you an audience with a taste for technical security presentations containing original content. This is your chance to showcase the latest research and lessons in EDR simulation and healthcheck spoofing, hardware insecurity, inferring information from interference, cloud-scale forensics or persistance automation, new vulnerability classes, AI exploitation, virtual machines inside parsers, elegant exploitation of old vulnerability classes, modern defense, dropping zero days during presentations, state of the art memory corruption mitigation bypasses, evasions, safe cracking, satellite and space security, remote vehicle access, or whatever research lights up the eyes of seasoned conference visitors. For the hackers by the hackers.

The advisory board will be reviewing submissions until 2023-03-17. Slide deck submission final deadline 2023-04-20 for accepted talks.

First come, first served. Submissions will not be returned.

Quick facts for speakers
+ presentation length 60-120 minutes, in English

Still not sure if this is for you? Check out the blast from the past[2].
