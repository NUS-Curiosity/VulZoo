~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Omnis Studio is a rapid application development tool for developing
cross-platform software applications.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"Omnis Studio is a powerful development environment that lets you deploy
apps to virtually any device, on any platform, including tablets,
smartphones, and desktop computers." [1]

Due to implementation issues, "always private" Omnis libraries can be
opened by the Omnis Studio browser.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Omnis Studio supports a feature for making Omnis libraries "always
private".

Making an Omnis library "always private" is supposed to be an
irreversible operation according to the Omnis Studio software.

However, during a security analysis of an application developed with
Omnis Studio using this feature, Matthias Deeg found out that it is
still possible to load "always private" Omnis libraries with the Omnis
Studio browser by simply bypassing a specific check.

This violates the expected behavior of an "irreversible operation".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

For demonstrating the described security issue, Matthias Deeg developed
a proof-of-concept software tool which allows loading private Omnis
libraries in the Omnis Studio browser.
