Author of Advisory:        Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Omnis Studio is a rapid application development tool for developing
cross-platform software applications.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"Omnis Studio is a powerful development environment that lets you deploy
apps to virtually any device, on any platform, including tablets,
smartphones, and desktop computers."[1]

Due to implementation issues, locked classes in Omnis libraries can be
unlocked and thus further analyzed and modified via the Omnis Studio
browser.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Omnis Studio supports an irreversible feature for locking classes within
Omnis libraries.

According to the Omnis Studio software, it should be no longer possible
to delete, view, change, copy, rename, duplicate, or print a locked
class.

However, during a security analysis of an application developed with
Omnis Studio using this feature, Matthias Deeg found out that it is
possible to unlock previously locked classes of Omnis libraries, for
instance by simply bypassing specific checks in Omnis Studio.

This allows for further analyzing and also deleting, viewing, changing,
copying, renaming, duplicating, or printing previously locked Omnis
classes.

This violates the expected behavior of an "irreversible operation".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

For demonstrating the described security issue, Matthias Deeg developed
a proof-of-concept software tool which allows unlocking locked classes
within Omnis libraries and further analyzing and modifying them within
Omnis Studio.
