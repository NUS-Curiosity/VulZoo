Subject: Re: [FD] [tool] tc - anonymous and cyphered chat over Tor circuits
 in PGP

I didnt see worst than this app to use for anonymity like this one:

- PGP is old bad stuff:

https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/OpenPGP#Issues_with_PGP

- RSA/DSA old as well and has tons of security issues like side channel 
and timing attacks..etc (the researches about them everywhere)

use Post-Quantum cryptography or at least ECC.

- C code is again old and insecure (memory issues..etc), should be 
replaced with Rust

so yeah nice idea but trash work.

Alternatively the concept already exist check Ricochet v2 (Ricochet 
Refresh):

Thx!
