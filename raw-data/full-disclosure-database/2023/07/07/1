Subject: [FD] [tool] tc - anonymous and cyphered chat over Tor circuits in
	PGP


Hello,

tc is a low-tech free software to chat anonymously and cyphered over
Tor circuits in PGP. Use it to protected your communication end-to-end
with RSA/DSA encryption and keep yourself anonymously reachable by
anyone who only know your .onion address and your public key. All this
and more in 2400 lines of C code that compile and run on BSD and Linux
systems with an IRC like GUI.

It's a minimal, easy to customize unix tool that I write to overcome
control, voyeurism and censorship avoiding platforms, logging and data
retention.

Good night and good luck,
