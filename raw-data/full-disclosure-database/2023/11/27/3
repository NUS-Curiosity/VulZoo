Subject: [FD] Survey on usage of security advisories

Dear list members,

we are looking for voluntary participants for our survey, which was 
developed in the context of a master thesis at the University of 
Erlangen-Nuremberg.

The goal of the survey is to determine potential difficulties that may 
occur when dealing with security advisories.
The focus of the study lies on the acquisition and maintenance of 
security advisories
as well as the decision making based on their content.

Participants should regularly encounter security advisories as part of 
their work.

The survey itself only takes about 10 minutes to complete.
All data will be anonymized before processing and no IP addresses or the 
like will be stored.

If you are interested, here is the survey link:

Thank you very much for your time!
