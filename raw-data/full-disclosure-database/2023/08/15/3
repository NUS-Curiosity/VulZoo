~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

AudioCodes VoIP phones are modern desk phones which are used for the
operation in enterprise environments.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"The AudioCodes 400HD series of IP phones is a range of easy-to-use,
feature-rich desktop devices for the service provider hosted services,
enterprise IP telephony and contact center markets. Based on the same
advanced, field-proven underlying technology as our other VoIP products,
AudioCodes high quality IP phones enable systems integrators and end
customers to build end-to-end VoIP solutions."

Due to insufficient firmware validation, an attacker can store
malicious firmware on AudioCodes IP phones.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

By analyzing the firmware image and update mechanism of AudioCodes IP
phones, it was identified that parsing and verification of the firmware
image is done by the ELF executable "flasher" which is executed from
the script "run_ramfs_for_upgrade.sh" located at the path
"/home/ipphone/scripts/".

When analyzing the software tool "flasher", SySS found out that the
validation of firmware images only consists of simple checksum checks for
different firmware components.

Thus, by knowing how to calculate and where to store the required checksums
for the "flasher" tool, an attacker is able to store malicious firmware on
AudioCodes IP phones.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

An AudioCodes IP phone's firmware image file contains an image header
followed by different sections, e.g.:

     1. Firmware image header
     2. bootloader.img
     3. rootfs.ext4
     4. phone.img
     5. section.map
     6. flasher
     7. release
     8. end.section

Each section starts with the 4 magic bytes "0xBB 0xBB 0xBB 0xBB"
followed by a 4-byte section header size field ("0x60 0x00 0x00 x00")
and other metadata like length fields and a checksum at the offset
0x50. This checksum is calculated by adding up all bytes of the section
data starting at the section offset 0x60.

As a proof of concept, a manipulated firmware image file was created in
which an additional user with root privileges was added in the
"rootfs.ext4" section. After recalculating the checksum and updating
the section header with its checksum, the manipulated firmware image
could be successfully uploaded and installed on an AudioCodes IP phone.

To automate this task, a simple Python script has been developed to
deal with AudioCodes IP phone firmware images.

The following output exemplarily shows how a modified firmware image
for the AudioCodes IP phone C450HD was updated with correct checksums:

#> python3 audiocodes-firmware-tool.py -i AudioCodes_UCC450HD_3.4.6.604.1.img -u
