Subject: [FD] [KIS-2023-08] SugarCRM <= 12.2.0 Two SQL Injection
	Vulnerabilities

----------------------------------------------------
SugarCRM <= 12.2.0 Two SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

https://www.sugarcrm.com


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 12.2.0 and prior versions.
Version 12.0.2 and prior versions.
Version 11.0.5 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

1) User input passed through the “metrics” parameter to the 
“/Forecasts/metrics”
REST API endpoint is not properly sanitized before being used to 
construct a SQL
query. This can be exploited by malicious users to e.g. read sensitive 
data from
the database through in-band SQL Injection attacks.

2) User input passed through the “placeholder_fields” parameter to the 
e.g.
“/Notes/{recordID}/link/history” REST API endpoint is not properly 
sanitized before
being used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by malicious 
users to
e.g. read sensitive data from the database through in-band SQL Injection 
attacks.
