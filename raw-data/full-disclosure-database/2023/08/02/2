Subject: [FD] RansomLord v1 / Anti-Ransomware Exploit Tool

RansomLord is a proof-of-concept tool that automates the creation of PE
files, used to compromise Ransomware pre-encryption.

Lang: C

SHA256: b0dfa2377d7100949de276660118bbf21fa4e56a4a196db15f5fb344a5da33ee

RansomLord generated PE files are saved to disk in the x32 or x64
directorys where the program is run from.

Goal is to exploit code execution flaws inherent in certain strains of
Ransomware

[Malvuln history]
In May 2022, I publicly disclosed a novel strategy to successfully defeat
Ransomware. Using a well known attacker technique (DLL hijack) to terminate
malware pre-encryption. The first malware to be successfully exploited was
from the group Lockbit MVID-2022-0572. Followed by Conti, REvil, BlackBasta
and CryptoLocker proving many are vulnerable. RansomLord v1 intercepts and
terminates malware tested from 33 different threat groups. Clop, Play,
Royal, BlackCat (alphv), Yanluowang, DarkSide, Nokoyawa etc...

[Generating exploits]
The -g flag lists Ransomware to exploit based on the selected Ransomware
group. It will output a 32 or 64-bit DLL appropriately named based on the
family selected.

[Strategy]
The created DLL exploit file logic is simple, we check if the current
directory is C:\Windows\System32. If not we grab our own process ID (PID)
and terminate ourselves and the Malware pre-encryption as we now control
code execution flow.

[Event Log IOC]
The -e flag sets up a custom Windows Event source in the Windows registry.
Events are written to 'Windows Logs\Application' as 'RansomLord' event ID 1
Malware name and full process path are also included in the general
information.

[DLL Map]
The -m flag displays Ransomware groups, DLL required and architecture x32
or 64-bit.

[Trophy Room]
The -t flag lists old Ransomware advisorys from 2022 with Malware
vulnerability id.

[Warning]
The Ransomware familys and or samples listed do NOT guarantee a successful
outcome. Many factors can ruin success: different variants, OS versions,
Malware location etc. Therefore, proceed with caution as mileage may vary,
good luck.

[Test Environment]
Testing was done in a Windows 10 Virtual Machine and Win-7 embedded OS
Thin-client.

[About]
The -a flag general information, contact and disclaimer. Using this program
and or its DLL files, you accept all risk and the full disclaimer. By John
