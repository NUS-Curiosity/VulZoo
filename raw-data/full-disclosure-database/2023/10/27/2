Subject: [FD] LKX-2023-001 VinChin VMWare Backup

VinChin Backup & Recovery is an all-in-one backup solution for virtual infrastructures supporting VMWare, KVM, Xen Server, Hyper-V, OpenStack and more. The product also supports AWS, Azure and other cloud providers as backup storage.

VinChin has failed to acknowledge the various requests over a month period, we are thus disclosing the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2023-45499 - VinChin VMWare Backup 5.0 to 7.0
During our research we discovered an HTTP API exposed by VinChin Backup. This API can be accessed using hard-coded credentials.

CVE-2023-45498 - VinChin VMWare Backup 5.0 to 7.0
While exploring the various functionalities exposed by the API a particular endpoint was found vulnerable to improper input sanitization. A specially crafted payload results in remote code execution allowing the attacker to execute code with the permissions of the web server.
