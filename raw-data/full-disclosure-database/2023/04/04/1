Subject: [FD] FedEx Ship Manager (FSM) v3704 Insecure Use of .NET Remoting

Vulnerable Software Download URL:
https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/ship-manager/software.html#tab-4

FSM 3704 (and some earlier versions) use .NET Remoting in a way that can
lead to unauthenticated remote code execution attacks as SYSTEM. Tools that
can successfully attack affected services are freely available.
Administrators should block or otherwise limit access to TCP ports opened
by services installed by this software wherever possible.
