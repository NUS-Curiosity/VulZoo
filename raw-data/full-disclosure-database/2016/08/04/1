Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
FortiManager appliances allow you to centrally manage any number of Fortinet devices, from several to thousands, including FortiGate®, FortiWiFi™, 
FortiCarrier™, FortiMail™ and FortiAnalyzer™ appliances and virtual appliances, as well as FortiClient™ endpoint security agents. You can further 
simplify control and management of large deployments by grouping devices and agents into administrative domains (ADOMs).

The FortiManager family of management appliances provides centralized policy-based provisioning, device configuration, and update management for 
FortiGate, FortiWiFi, and FortiMail appliances, and FortiClient end-point security agents, plus end-to-end network monitoring and device control. 
FortiManager delivers a lower TCO for Fortinet implementations by minimizing both initial deployment costs and ongoing operating expenses. Control 
administrative access and simplify policy deployment using role-based administration to define user privileges for specific management domains and 
functions, and aggregating collections of Fortinet appliances and agents into independent management domains. In addition, by locally hosting security 
content updates for managed devices and agents, FortiManager appliances minimize Web filtering rating request response time and maximize network protection.

FortiAnalyzer Network Security Logging, Analysis, and Reporting Appliances securely aggregate log data from Fortinet Security Appliances. 
A comprehensive suite of easily customable reports allows you to quickly analyze and visualize network threats, inefficiencies and usage. 
FortiAnalyzer is one of several versatile Fortinet Management Products that provide a diversity of deployment types, growth flexibility, 
advanced customization through APIs and simple licensing.

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Fortinet FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer appliance web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script codes to client-side browser requests of the affected vulnerable web-application context module.

The vulnerability is located in the `tabs` and `&url` values of the `tabs.htm` file. Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script codes to the client-side 
of the vulnerable docroot module. The request method to inject is GET and the attack vector is located on the client-side of the appliance web-application. the issue 
affects the fortimanagaer and the fortianalyzer appliance web-application model series.

The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0. 
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability results in non-persistent phishing, session hijacking, non-persistent external redirect to malicious sources and client-side manipulation of affected 
or connected web module context.
