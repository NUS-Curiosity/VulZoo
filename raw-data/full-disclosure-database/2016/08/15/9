Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the Peter's Login
Redirect WordPress Plugin. This issue allows an attacker to perform a
wide variety of actions, such as stealing Administrators' session
tokens, or performing arbitrary actions on their behalf. In addition the
Plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery, which allows an
attacker to change any setting of this plugin. In order to exploit this
issue, the attacker has to lure/force a logged on WordPress
Administrator into opening a malicious website.
