Subject: [FD] Stored XSS in Advanced Custom Fields: Table Field allows
	authenticated users to do almost anything an admin user can
	(WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Advanced Custom Fields: Table Field
Version: 1.1.12
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields-table-field/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/xss-in-advanced-custom-fields-table-field-could-allow-authenticated-users-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-user-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4.9 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Stored XSS in Advanced Custom Fields: Table Field allows authenticated users to do almost anything an admin user can

Vulnerability
================
This plugin allows users (who have permission to edit posts) to inject JavaScript into pages within /wp-admin/. This means a user can exceed their privileges by creating a script that causes an admin’s browser to perform an action, such as creating a new admin user, deleting all posts, etc.

Proof of concept
================

Add a new ACF field group
Add a new table-type field to that field group
Create a new post/page, wherever the field group is set to display
Enter “<script>alert(1)</script>” into a field and save the post
Visit the page again, and the injected JavaScript will be executed

Tested with ACF PRO v5. Not tested with v4.

Mitigations
================
Update to version 1.1.13 or later.
