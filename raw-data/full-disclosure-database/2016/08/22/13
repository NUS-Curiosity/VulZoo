Vulnerability Status: Fixed in version 2.2.3 (oc-sa-2016-016)

Description
===================================================
The ownCloud Windows Desktop client (up to version 2.2.2) is prone to an arbitrary code injection vulnerability leading to code execution in other user's Windows sessions.
The issue is that QT extensions are loaded from C:\usr\i686-w64-mingw32\sys-root\mingw\lib\qt5\plugins.
As any authenticated user on Windows is allowed to create new folders within C:, the expected folder structure can be created.
That means that any local attacker can create a malicious QT extensions that gets automatically loaded on the next launch of the ownCloud Desktop client in any local Windows session.

PoC
===================================================
1.) Download the modified QT platform's library qwindow.dll: https://bogner.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/qwindows.dll_.zip
2.) Place it into C:\usr\i686-w64-mingw32\sys-root\mingw\lib\qt5\plugins\platforms 
3.) Start the ownCloud Desktop Client: The "malicious" code is executed and a message box is opened
