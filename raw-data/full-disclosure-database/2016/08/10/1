"Line (styled "LINE") is a proprietary application for instant communications on
electronic devices such as smartphones, tablet computers and personal computers.
Line users exchange texts, images, video and audio, and conduct free VoIP
conversations and video conferences.

months and 200 million users only six months later. Line became Japan's largest
social network in 2013. In October 2014 Line announced that it had attracted

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends not to use this software until a thorough security
review has been performed by security professionals and all identified
issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
SEC Consult reported two security flaws that existed in the LINE messenger platform
to the LINE Security Bug Bounty Program.

1. Authorization Bypass
By abusing the authorization bypass vulnerability, an attacker was
able to gain unauthorized access to other user's confidential information.

2. Server-side request forgery
By abusing server-side request forgery issues, an attacker can make arbitrary
requests on behalf of the affected server and execute code remotely.

Further detailed information cannot be published as per LINE
bounty program policy. The severity rating has been excluded too.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
PoC has been removed due to the request from the vendor according to their
bounty program policy.
