Subject: [FD] end of useable crypto in browsers?

Hi,

This is not a security vulnerability in itself, "just" a trend
undermining the trust architecture of the whole internet :)

I think it is very important, and wonder why I don't see any discussion
of it. If this is not the right forum to discuss it, please direct me to
the right place.

The problem is:

Browser developers are dropping support for X509 key generation.
Yes, <keygen> have its problems. But window.crypto - which is meant to
replace it - have no way to save keys in the browser's keystore.

Instead of going to some cross-browser and cross-OS support for key
management, we are now in a state where there are browser/OS
combinations (stable chrome with non-windows OS), where there is no way
to generate and store a key to be later used for ssl authentication.

Looking at the related bug reports it seems that browser developers do
not even understand the problem this creates.

Any ideas on how to make them understand the scale of the doom we are
facing right now?
