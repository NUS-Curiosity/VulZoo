Subject: [FD] Monsta Box WebFTP 1.8.2 and below arbitrary file read and path
 traversal vulnerabilities

Application
-----------
"MONSTA Box is a lightweight open-source file manager you can install on
your website or server * to easily manage your files through any browser."
(Description from the official website http://www.monstahq.com/)


Vulnerability
-------------
The Monsta Box WebFTP  application supports file templates when creating
new files. The template parameter is part of the HTTP request so it is a
user input and it was not sanitized correctly. By sending a HTTP request
with modified template parameter it was possible to traverse the
template directory and read arbitrary files (in context of the Monsta
Box WebFTP application).


PoC
---
A proof of concept request/response to read the config.php file of the
Monsta Box installation (note the template parameter of the HTTP request):
