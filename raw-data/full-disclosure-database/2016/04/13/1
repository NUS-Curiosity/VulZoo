Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Webline Infosoft Pvt. Ltd.
Product: Webline - Content Management System (Web-Application) 2016 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql-injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Webline Content Management System (2016Q2) web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers and privileged user accounts
to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-server or dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `pgID` and `newsID`values of the
`details.php` file GET method request. Remote attackers are able to
execute own
malicious sql commands via pgID value to compromise the web-server or
connected database management system. The issue is a classic
remote sql injection vulnerability. The request method to execute is GET
and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the
active web-service.

The security risk of the sql-injection vulnerability is estimated as
medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.4.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no
user interaction and a low privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database
management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
                [+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] details.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] pgID
                [+] newsID


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql-injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers without privileged web-application user account or user
interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

http://localhost:8080/details.php?pgID=sb_-8'+union+select+@@version,2--+


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by usage of a secure prepared statement
in the details.php file GET method request.
Disallow usage of special chars and disallow invalid inputs to prevent
further sql or script code injection attacks.
Encode and parse the pgID value in the details.php file GET method
request to patch the issue finally.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql-injection web vulnerability in the
web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.4)
