The only TLS client certificate authentication I see on a regular basis
is for CertFP use for IRC nickserv authentication and OpenVPN. Trying to
use a browser to perform either of these actions would be awkward at best.

What application or service do you know of that uses TLS client
authentication that requires browser integration? If you can demonstrate
users who will be affected they may be more amenable to your claims. (I
suspect the browser authors already know how many services use TLS client
authentication from their own telemetry systems. What may be harder to
gauge via telemetry is how important it is to the users.)

Thanks
