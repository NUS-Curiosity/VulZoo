The Event

Balkan Computer Congress is an annual three days gathering of the

first part of the program has been envisaged to be a set of
presentations, workshops and lectures on the current topics regarding
privacy, technology, software development, free software &
socio-political issues. Hands-on projects and hacking have been planned
for the second part of the program.

The Location:
Novi Sad is the centre of Vojvodina, northern province of Serbia, famous
for its multicultural history and active artistic and technological

Novi Sad offers inexpensive prices for lodging and dining, compared to
the neighbouring EU. If you’re in Novi Sad or nearby during these dates,
this is the place you want to be!
