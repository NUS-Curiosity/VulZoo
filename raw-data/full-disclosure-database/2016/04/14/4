to put it simply: No.

The real problem is that no one is using it. Yes, it is pretty secure, 
but its too much trouble for most users (try to log in from your phone) 
and also a baseless PITA for most server operators. It's also not good 
for business (you need to be able to restore the certificate easily, 
have multiple devices, all your servers need https ...). To make matters 
worse many browser don't even bother supporting it (looking at you, 
internet explorer^W^Wedge).

To be fully honest, I'd prefer to keep it. Yes, browser support is bad 
and hardly anyone uses it, but it doesn't hurt anyone and at least there 
are/were some users (i.e. StartSSL). But to truly convince them, you'd 
probably need
a) support from at least a major browser. If the other "cool kids" don't 
do it, good luck getting this through.
b) an example of the "doom" we're facing, because neither them nor me 
sees it. The web would hardly be less secure, same as if we'd drop SQRL: 
Yes, it's pretty secure as far as I can tell, but who is using it and 
would therefore be less secure anyway?

Here's a related discussion:

A great many of today's security technologies are "secure" only because 
no-one has ever bothered attacking them.
