Subject: [FD] Daily Edition theme for WordPress

Hello!

In October I wrote you about vulnerability in the plugin for WordPress,
which was 100% repeat of my vulnerability, which I disclosed in 2010. And
here is another case, now with theme for WordPress.

Concerning this advisory about Daily Edition at security mailing lists:
https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/130753/WordPress-Daily-Edition-Theme-1.6.2-Path-Disclosure.html
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Mar/57

Wang Jing disclosed few vulnerabilities in TimThumb from 2011. Like this
FPD. I already disclosed this hole at beginning of 2011 and informed
developers of TimThumb, which fixed these holes that time.

Maybe he missed all those my advisories about TimThumb and hundreds of WP
themes with it, as he wrote about the same vulnerabilities in the same theme
after four years. And I remind you a year after, since you published it.

I wrote advisory about this and many other vulnerabilities in TimThumb and
hundreds of themes in multiple security lists. Here it is at Full Disclosure
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Apr/227. The same at Packet Storm
and other lists.

Best wishes & regards,
