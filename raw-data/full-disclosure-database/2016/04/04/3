Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
FortiManager appliances allow you to centrally manage any number of
Fortinet devices, from several to thousands, including FortiGate®,
FortiWiFi™,
FortiCarrier™, FortiMail™ and FortiAnalyzer™ appliances and virtual
appliances, as well as FortiClient™ endpoint security agents. You can
further
simplify control and management of large deployments by grouping devices
and agents into administrative domains (ADOMs).

The FortiManager family of management appliances provides centralized
policy-based provisioning, device configuration, and update management for
FortiGate, FortiWiFi, and FortiMail appliances, and FortiClient
end-point security agents, plus end-to-end network monitoring and device
control.
FortiManager delivers a lower TCO for Fortinet implementations by
minimizing both initial deployment costs and ongoing operating expenses.
Control
administrative access and simplify policy deployment using role-based
administration to define user privileges for specific management domains
and
functions, and aggregating collections of Fortinet appliances and agents
into independent management domains. In addition, by locally hosting
security
content updates for managed devices and agents, FortiManager appliances
minimize Web filtering rating request response time and maximize network
protection.

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability and filter bypass issue
has been discovered in the official Fotinet FortiManager and
FortiAnalyzer appliance product series.
The application-side web vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject
own malicious script codes to the application-side of the affected
modules context.

The vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the ` Layout
Header [Header Image]` module. Remote attackers with low privileged
web-application user accounts
are able to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of
the affected ` Advanced Settings - Advanced Settings - Layout Header`
module. The request method
to inject is POST and the issue is located on the application-side of
the fortimanager/fortianalyzer appliance web-application.

The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web
vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 3.7.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires no
privileged web-application user account and low or medium user
interaction. Successful exploitation
of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing, session hijacking,
persistent external redirect to malicious sources and application-side
manipulation of affected
or connected web module context.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by
local low privileged web-application user accounts and low user
interaction (click).
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login to the Fortinet FortiManager appliance web-application
2. Open the following module Reports > Reports > Client Reputation >
Advanced Settings > Advanced Settings > Layout Header
3. Scroll to the layout header section
4. Start a session tamper to intercept the http protocol communication
5. Choose a random file and perform the upload
6. Change with the live session tamper the filename value of the logo to
a script code payload
7. Wait since the upload has been performed and click next to the upload
input field
8. The script code executes were the filename is normally visible next
to the upload via submit
9. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!

Note: There could be other sections that are affected after the inject
were the logo image is displayed finally!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
2016-03-24: Vendor Fix/Patch (Fortinet Developer Team)

The fix is available in the customer area. Customers can install it
manually or my the automated mechanism of the appliance application.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web
vulnerability in the filename value of the logo upload function is
estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.7)
