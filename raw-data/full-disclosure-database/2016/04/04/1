2016-04-01:    Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Wordpress Scoreme Theme web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script
codes on the client-side of the affected web-application.

The vulnerability is located in the `s` value of the `index.php` file.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script
codes to the client-side of the affected web-application. The request
method to inject is GET and the attack vector is client-side.

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as
medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0.
Exploitation of the non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability
requires low privileged web-application user account and low user
interaction.
Successful exploitation results in session hijacking, persistent
phishings attacks, persistent external redirect and malware loads or
persistent
manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
                [+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] index.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] s


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without a low
privileged or restricted user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

PoC: Example
http://localhost:8080/wordpress/?s=[CLIENT SIDE CROSS SITE SCRIPTING
VULNERABILITY!]

PoC: Exploitation
http://localhost:8080/wordpress/?s="/><script>alert(/XSS By 0x3a/);</script>


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the
vulnerable `s` value in the index.php GET method request.
Disallow usage of special chars and filter to prevent client-side script
code injection attacks against the web-application module.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side cross site scripting web
vulnerabilities in the wordpress plugin are estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.0)
