Subject: [FD] Daily Edition theme for WordPress

Hello!

Recently I wrote you about Daily Edition theme for WordPress. Earlier I
wrote about FPD vulnerability, but mentioned second one (AFU). The two
vulnerabilities from all, which I disclosed in 2011 in TimThumb.

Concerning this advisory about Daily Edition at security mailing lists:
https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/130720/WordPress-Daily-Edition-1.6.2-File-Upload.html
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Mar/35

Wang Jing disclosed few vulnerabilities in TimThumb from 2011. Like this
AFU. I already disclosed previous FPD and this AFU in 2011 and informed
developers of TimThumb, which fixed these holes that time.

Maybe he missed all those my advisories about TimThumb and hundreds of WP
themes with it, as he wrote about the same vulnerabilities in the same theme
after four years. And I remind you a year after, since you published it.

I wrote advisory about multiple vulnerabilities in TimThumb and hundreds of
themes in multiple security lists. Here it is at Full Disclosure
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Apr/227. And here is my advisory for
IL, XSS, FPD, AoF, DoS, AFU vulnerabilities in Daily Edition Mouss theme for
WordPress http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jan/85. The same
advisories at Packet Storm and other lists. I not only wrote you in April
2011 the advisory about TimThumb and multiple WP themes with it, but in
January 2013 I wrote you separate letter about modification of this theme
(which had the same vulnerabilities).

So both of these Wang's advisories is just repeat of my old advisories. For
PacketStorm's argument, that his advisories are about single theme, unlike
my first advisory - in January 2013 I wrote about only this single theme.
