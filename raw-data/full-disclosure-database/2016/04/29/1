Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-04-29: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
CactusThemes 
Product: Truemag Theme (Wordpress) - Theme (Web-Application) 2016 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Wordpress Truemag Theme web-application.
The non-persistent vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code to client-side application to browser requests.

The client-side cross site vulnerability is located in the `s` value of the page module GET method request. Remote attackers are able to inject 
own malicious script codes to the client-side of the online service web-application to compromise user session information or data. The request 
method to execute is GET and the attack vector is non-persistent. 

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.3.
Exploitation of the non-persistent web vulnerability requires no privileged web application user account and low user interaction (click link). 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing, non-persistent external redirects, 
non-persistent load of malicious script codes or non-persistent web module context manipulation.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Service(s):
				[+] Truemag Theme (Wordpress)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] /wp-contact/theme/truemag

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] s


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability in the vulnerbale `s` value is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.3)
