# GreHack 2016 - Call For Paper

* website: http://grehack.fr
* online version: http://grehack.fr/data/cfp.txt


## What's GreHack?

GreHack is an international security conference which takes place in Grenoble (France). It aims to bring together academics, industry, governments, students and hackers to discuss new advances in computer and information security research. This year will be the fourth edition. As always, conferences will take place during the day, and you will be able to test your hacking skills with the Capture The Flag contest that will hold during the night.

Keywords: reverse, hardware, crypto, exploit, network, food, drinks, goodies, rumps, and a lot more.


## Topics of the conference

* Applied Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
* Digital Forensics
* Disclosure and Ethics
* Embedded Security (health devices, IoT, SCADA, home/personal devices...)
* Exploit Automation
* **Hardware Vulnerabilities**
* Malware Creation, Analysis and Prevention
* Mobile Security
* Network Security, Intrusion Detection and Prevention
* Penetration Testing
* **Reverse Engineering** and Obfuscation
* Security and Privacy in Cloud, P2P Networks
* Vulnerability Discovery / Analysis
* Web Application Security

We encourage original and groundbreaking submissions, demonstrations, release of a new open source/non-commercial tool, and interaction with the audience.

**This year, we particularly encourage works related to reverse-engineering and hardware exploits, especially on old school
technologies (e.g. Minitel).** See submission formats for more details.


## Important Dates

* Submission deadline           July 1st, 2016
* Author notification           August 31st, 2016
* Program publication           September 15th, 2016
* Camera-ready version          October 1st, 2016
* Conference                    November 18th, 2016


## Submission Formats

GreHack 2016 will consider the following formats of submissions:

1. **Research Papers** presenting either:
        * mature and novel research results
        * or experimental approaches
2. **Minitel/Blue-box Papers**. This less formal paper is adapted to workarounds that one can experiment on any kind of thing/technology, but that could not be presented as a formal research paper.

For both, the total length should range from 4 to 10 pages.

* Papers can be submitted here: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=grehack2016
* We advise authors to use the following template for submissions: https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0
* Total length includes the bibliography and any appendices. GreHack does not require anonymized submissions, thus authors and affiliations must be mentioned.
* Submissions accepted by the Program Committee will be presented at GreHack 2016. Presentations will last 30 minutes each, including questions.
* For accepted papers, at least one of the authors must attend the conference and present the paper.
* Full access to the conference will be granted for one of the authors of each accepted paper.
* Further questions on the submission process may be sent to the organization chair at chair@...hack.fr<mailto:chair@...hack.fr>
