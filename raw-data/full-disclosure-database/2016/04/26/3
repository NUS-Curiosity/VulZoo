Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discoverd in the official Sophos XG Firewall (SF01V) appliance web-application.
The security issue allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes on the application-side of the affected service module.

The vulnerability is located in the `Protection  - Web Protection - Web Content Filter - General Configuration - Override Default Denied Message` module. 
Remote attackers and low privileged web-application user accounts are able to inject own malicious script code context as notification value of the 
Blocked Access Request. The data of the POST method request in the nody of message text, executes without a secure encoding or a restriction in the 
body of message in the web-application appliance. The persistent execution of the script code occurs in [Default Denied Message] that gets send by 
the appliances directly to users.

The security risk of the persistent validation vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects to malicious source and 
persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Protection  - Web Protection - Web Content Filter - General Configuration - Override Default Denied Message

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] message body


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
Persistent Web Vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. goes to : Protection  > Web Protection > Web Content Filter> General Configuration
2. Choose the Override Default Denied Message input field 
3. Message HTML Input: [POC]
Note: '><iframe src="http://vulnerability-lab.com" onload=alert(document.cookie)<
4. After saving all users get it as default message of blocked requests as notification message
5. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability! 


PoC:

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable input field context.
Encode all inputs and restrict the input by disallowing the usage of special chars.
Parse also the outgoing values for the user notification by the appliance service itself to prevent malicious attack scenarios.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web vulnerability in the sophos xg firewall appliance web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.5)
