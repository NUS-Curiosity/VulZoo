Product: Oracle Discoverer Viewer Business Intelligence - Software 2016 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Low


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An open redirect web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Oracle Discoverer Viewer for Business Intelligence software.
The bug allows remote attackers to execute external urls by the internal web-application requests via client-side.

The vulnerability is located in the `customUrl` parameter of the vulnerable `exit` module. The vulnerability allows an remote attacker 
to prepare client-side malicious urls to external sources. The request method to execute is GET and the vulnerability is located on 
the application-side of the software. The vulnerability is a classic open redirect web vulnerability.

The security risk of the open redirect web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires no privileged user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in client-side redirects to malicious sources or client-side phishing.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] exit

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] customUrl


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The open redirect web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and with medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

PoC:
127.0.0.1:8080/path/to/app/exit?event=exit&clientType=viewer&customUrl=http://[EVIL-URL-INPUT!].com


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction of the `customUrl` parameter in the `exit` module of the software.
Disallow to request not whitelisted webpages in  the `customURL` value and include a tag filter to prevent as well.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the open redirect web vulnerability in the Oracle Discoverer Viewer Business Intelligence software is estimated as low. (CVSS 2.8)
