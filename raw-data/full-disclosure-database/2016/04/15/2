I don't. But even if you roll your own CA, you'll have a hard time 
avoiding someone with a wildcard CA (updater, every other page you open, 
...). Also, to use <keygen> you need to have a secure connection 
beforehand (or use http, which would make every MITM happy). Now it is 
possible to work around this, too, but then you may as well use fully 
encrypted channel.

The actual point of the paragraph is that this won't kill our protection 
from the big companies. Those are probably even the ones using it the 
most.


Greetings,
Sebastian
