Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Robosoft
Product: Robo Gallery - Wordpress Plugin (Web-Application) 2.0.14


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote php code execution vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Robo Gallery v2.0.14 Wordpress Plugin web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own malicious php
commands to compromise the web-application or connected dbms.

The vulnerability is located in teh `function` value of the
`rbs_gallery_ajax.php` file GET method request. Remote attackers are able
to execute own codes by usage of the vulnerable function value in the
`rbs_gallery_ajax.php` file. The request method to execute is
GET and the attack vector of the issue is located to the server-side.
The function is not secure parsed or encoded next to the module
context execute. Thus finally results in a php code execution because of
the wrong used parse context in the rbs_gallery_ajax.php file.

The security risk of the code execution vulnerability is estimated as
high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.9.
Exploitation of the php code execution vulnerability requires no
privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in computer system,
web-server or database management system -compromise.

Request Method(s):
                [+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] ./wp-content/plugins/robo-gallery/includes/

Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] rbs_gallery_ajax.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] function


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote code execution vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers without privileged web-application user account or user
interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================

vulnerable functions value in the  rbs_gallery_ajax.php file GET method
request.
Disallow to include code that executes in the followup GET/POST method
request. Deny script code tags and filter them by disallow the usage of
special chars.
