Product: Content Management System 2016 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql-injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Negin Group content management system 2016 Q2.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers and privileged user accounts to execute own sql commands to compromise the dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `v` value of the `view_page_one.php` file GET method request. Remote attackers are able 
to execute own malicious sql commands via `v` value to compromise the web-server or connected database management system. 
The issue is a classic remote sql injection vulnerability. The request method to execute is GET and the attack vector is 
located on the application-side of the content management system.

The vulnerable `v` value in the `view_page_one.php` file GET method allows an attacker also to inject client-side script code for xss exploitation.
The attack vector is non-persistent on the client-side and the request method to exploit the issue is GET.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.1.
Exploitation of the sql injection vulnerability requires no user interaction and a low privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] view_page_one.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] v


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql-injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by usage of a prepared statement in the vulnerable view_page_one.php file GET method request.
Encode and parse the vulnerable `v` value to filter malicious injected script codes. Restrict the input and disallow the usage of special chars.
Escape as far as required the entries and use entities to secure the code-line error.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql-injection web vulnerability and client-side cross site vulnerability are estimated as high. (CVSS 7.1)
