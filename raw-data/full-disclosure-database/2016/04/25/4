Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
The Cyberoam Central Console (CCC) appliances enable Enterprises and MSSPs to centrally manage Cyberoam network security appliances deployed 
across branch offices or customer offices. Providing flexibility of hardware and virtual platforms, CCC appliances simplify centralized security 
management, reduce administrative overhead and aid compliance reporting for distributed enterprises and MSSPs as required for their growing networks.

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discoverd in the offical Cyberoam Central Console v02.03.1 appliance web-application. 
The security issue allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes on the application-side of the vulnerable service module.

The vulnerability is located in `header` and `footer` input fields of the `Policy Configuration - System - configuration - Captive Portal - General Settings` module. 
Remote attackers and low privileged or restricted web-application user accounts are able to inject own malicious script code in main functionality code of login page 
`Captive Portal`. The data of the POST method request in the body of message text, executes without a secure encoding or a restriction on input in the web-application 
appliance. The persistent execution of the script code occurs in [Page Title,Login page Header , Login page Footer] that gets shown by the appliances directly to users. 

The security risk of the application-side cross site vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privilege web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious source 
and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Policy Configuration - System - configuration - Captive Portal
				
Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] WebClientPortalPreview.html

Vulnerable Inputs(s):
				[+] Page Title
				[+] Login page Header
				[+] Login page footer

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] header
				[+] footer


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
Persistent Web Vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

1. Open the cyberoam central console appliance web-application login page
2. Login to the appliance
3. Open the following module ... Policy Configuration > System > configuration > Captive Portal > General Settings
Note: The vulnerable inputs are Page Title , Login page Header and the Login page Footer 
4. Now inject to the regular input fields your script code payload to test the validation procedure 
PoC: Payload ... "><iframe src=http://vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert(document.cookie) < 
5. After the inject open the following document to execute the payload with application-side attack vector > [WebClientPortalPreview.html]
6. Successful reproduce of the application-side web vulnerability!


PoC: WebClientPortalPreview.html
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr><td id="loginpagemessage" align="center" height="50px;" valign="middle">"&gt;<img src="X" onerror="alert(&quot;XSS&quot;);"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
...
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr><td id="loginpagefooter" align="center" height="50px;" valign="middle">"&gt;<img src="X" onerror="alert(&quot;XSS&quot;);"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable title, header and footer input fields.
Restrict the input and disallow usage of special chars, escape the context. Encode also the output listing that in the preview file of the web-application to prevent attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web vulnerabilities in the official cyberoam central console application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.4)
