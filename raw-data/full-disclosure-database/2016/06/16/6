Advisory Details:

Depth Security discovered a vulnerability in Solarwinds Virtualization Manager appliance. 
This attack requires a user to have an operating system shell with superuser privilges on the vulnerable appliance.

1) Use of a weak encryption algorithm in Solarwinds Virtualization Manager: CVE-2016-5709

The vulnerability exists due to the use of a weak encryption algorithm in the /etc/shadow file.
A local attacker in possession of a superuser operating system shell can easily crack the passwords of other system users.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Solarwinds has released a hotfix to remediate this vulnerability on existing installations. 

This flaw as well as several others have been corrected and that release has been put into manufacturing for new appliances.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proof of Concept:

An attacker can dump the contents of the /etc/shadow file using the following command:

cat /etc/passwd

The output of this command can then be used with many popular password cracking programs to obtain the cleartext passwords of other operating system users.
