Subject: [FD] Papouch TME Temperature & Humidity Thermometers - Multiple
	Vulnerabilities

+++++
*Vulnerable Products*
1. Papouch TME Ethernet thermometer
2. Papouch TME multi: Temperature and humidity via Ethernet

*All versions affected*

*TME - Ethernet Thermometer*

*TME multi: Temperature and humidity via Ethernet*
http://www.papouch.com/en/shop/product/tme-multi-temperature-humidity-via-ethernet/


*Vulnerability Details*

*1. Weak Credentials Management*

Device have three security levels â€“ user (temperature viewing) and
administrator (configuration), superadmin (sensor calibration). Each level
has own password.

*Issue*
According to device manual, Superadmin password cannot be cleared. The
default password is 1234. This level allows you to access all settings
including sensor calibration.

-> The application does not allow/enforce a mandatory, password change from
default to strong password values.


*2. Authentication Issues & Sensitive Information Leakage*

By default, password authentication is not enabled on Telnet access. Telnet
service runs on TCP 9999. Telnet to 9999t drops in setup mode and gives
access to device configuration.

Configuration reveals administrative password in clear-text without any
authentication. Anyone can then use this password to gain administrative
access to the device.

-> Telnet access must have authentication enabled by default, a mandatory
password change must be enforced, and any login passwords and SNMP
community strings must be hidden/masked/censured.

*3. Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery*

In Device Management portal, there is no CSRF Token generated per page and
/ or per (sensitive) function. Successful exploitation of this
vulnerability can allow silent execution of unauthorized actions on the
device such as configuration parameter changes, and saving modified
configuration.

*Overall Impact*
AFAIK, these products are typically used for monitoring temperatures in
Data Center, Fuel Tanks, Heating system monitoring, AC failure monitoring,
or performing Food / grain storage temperature monitoring etc. Therefore,
impact due to device compromise can be severe depending upon the utility &
environment where they are deployed.
