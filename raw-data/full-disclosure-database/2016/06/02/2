Technical Details
===========
Windows has the function *SendInput()*
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/pt-br/library/windows/desktop/ms646310%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>
to
simulate a keystroke. This function accepts as argument an array of INPUT
structures. The INPUT structures can be either a mouse or a keyboard event.
The keyboard event structure has a member called wVk which can be any key
on the keyboard.

*SendInput()
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/pt-br/library/windows/desktop/ms646310%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>*played
an important role when writing the code for allow access to bypassing
Windows firewall. How does it work?

Firstly, the programm it finds a window with title 'Windows Security Alert'
using the function *GetWindowText()*
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/pt-br/library/windows/desktop/ms633520%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>.
Secondly, it calls* SendInput()
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/pt-br/library/windows/desktop/ms646310%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>
function *with
TAB and ENTER keys to choose button 'allow access'. As simple as that
