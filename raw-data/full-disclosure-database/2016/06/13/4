I.   Impact

If the SW Update software is installed on a Windows system, any
authenticated
user can escalate privileges to become the SYSTEM user by placing a crafted
DLL file in the SW Update Service directory and triggering or waiting
for the
next system reboot.
________________________________________________________________________________

II.  Vulnerability Details

Samsung consumer computers come with a preinstalled software called SW
Update.
This software is used to install and update all the necessary drivers and
software.

The SW Update software installs a Windows service called SWUpdateService
which
is running as SYSTEM. The service binary SWMAgent.exe is located in the
directory "C:\ProgramData\Samsung\SW Update Service\".

The ACLs set on this directory allow any authenticated user to create
new files
as can be seen by the FILE_WRITE_DATA access right below:

C:\>cacls "c:\Programdata\Samsung\SW Update Service"
c:\Programdata\Samsung\SW Update Service NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(ID)F
                                        
BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(ID)F
                                         CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(ID)F
                                         BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(ID)R
                                         BUILTIN\Users:(CI)(ID)(special
access:)
                                                       FILE_WRITE_DATA
                                                       FILE_APPEND_DATA
                                                       FILE_WRITE_EA
                                                       FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES

When the service is started it tries to load several non-existing DLL files
from the service directory such as MSIMG32.dll, UxTheme.dll or USERENV.dll.

A user can place a malicious DLL file with one of the expected names into
that directory and wait until the service is restarted. The service can not
be restarted by normal users but an attacker could just reboot the system or
wait for the next reboot to happen.

Afterwards his malicious DLL file would be loaded by the service which is
running with SYSTEM privileges which would give the attacker full control
over the machine.

III. Mitigation

To mitigate the issue the ACL on the service directory should be adjusted to
prevent normal users from writing to this directory or install the official
update to version 2.2.7.24.
