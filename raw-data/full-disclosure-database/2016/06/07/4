Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Our mission is creating immersive and inclusive experiences that inspire lifelong learning, stimulating development of essential life skills and supporting 
educators in guiding and nurturing student passions. We empower students and educators to create and share in entirely new ways, to teach and learn through 
exploration, to adapt to individual learning needs, so they can make, design, invent and build with technology.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Core Research Team discovered a code execution and cross site scripting vulnerability in the microsoft education online service web-application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-06-07: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Microsoft Corp.
Product: Education - Online Service (Web-Application) 2016 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent cross site scripting web vulnerabilities and a code execution bug has been discovered in the microsoft education web-application.
The persistent web vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the affected module or function.
The code execution vulnerability allows remote attacker to execute arbitrary codes to compromise the affected web-server, dbms or computer system.

Several stored cross site scripting web vulnerabilities are located in a pretty vulnerable domain: education.microsoft.com
It seems like they are all caused by the same bad secured input screen, as you will see in the proof of concepts that I prepared.

For the stored XSS I used simple img tags, and one javascript attribute in a href as seen in the proof of concept which I provided.

I also found a remote code execution vulnerability which seems to be caused by bad upload validation. I checked this for the video module, 
and was able to upload PHP files, which I could then locate on the server by viewing the source of the video module. I did check the image 
module for the same vulnerability, and was able to upload arbitrary files, but was not able to locate the executable PHP file.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
In the video below I show both the RCE and cross site scripting vulnerabilities.

In this video, I show only the RCE vulnerability

Note: If any more information is needed, I will be happy to provide it!


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the code execution and cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the microsoft education service are estimated as high. (CVSS 8.6)
