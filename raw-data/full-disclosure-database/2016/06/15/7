N/A

Vulnerability Details:
=====================

Siklu EtherHaul radios have a built-in, hidden root account, with an
unchangeable password that is the same across all devices. This account is
accessible via both ssh and the device’s web interface and grants access to
the underlying embedded Linux shell on the device, allowing full control
over it. See source above for details on how the password was found.

Affected versions:
-EtherHaul EH-1200F/FX/TX, EH-2200F/FX, EH-600T/TL < 6.9.0
-EtherHaul EH-1200/TL ALL VERSIONS

Impact:
The remote attacker has full control over the device, including shell
access. This can lead to packet sniffing and tampering, denial of service,
and even damage to the device ("bricking").
