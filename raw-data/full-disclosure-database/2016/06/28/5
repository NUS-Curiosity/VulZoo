Concrete5 <= 5.7.3.1 Multiple Cross-Site Request Forgeries Vulnerabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://www.concrete5.org/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 5.7.3.1 and probably other versions.


[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

Concrete5 implements a Synchronizer Token Pattern in order to provide anti-CSRF capabilities.
However, the application fails to properly use this feature in every block or dashboard page
which makes a system state change, such as settings modification. As a result, the application
is vulnerable to some Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks:

1) File Manager - Delete: an attacker might force an authenticated user to delete files from
the File Manager by tricking the victim into browsing to a specially crafted web page.

2) Public Registration Settings: an attacker might force an authenticated user to change the
Public Registration Settings by tricking the victim into browsing to a specially crafted web page.

3) Public Profiles Settings: an attacker might force an authenticated user to change the Public
Profiles Settings by tricking the victim into browsing to a specially crafted web page.

4) Authentication Types Settings: an attacker might force an authenticated user to enable or
disable an authentication type, or change its settings by tricking the victim into browsing
to a specially crafted web page.

5) Community Points: an attacker might force an authenticated user to assign points to arbitrary
users, or add, delete, and edit Community Points Actions by tricking the victim into browsing to
a specially crafted web page.

6) Translation Site Interface: an attacker might force an authenticated user to save arbitrary
translation strings by tricking the victim into browsing to a specially crafted web page.

7) Add / Remove Group: an attacker might force an authenticated user to add/remove an arbitrary
user to/from a group by tricking the victim into browsing to a specially crafted web page.

8) Community Connect: an attacker might force an authenticated user to change tokens used to
connect to the marketplace by tricking the victim into browsing to a specially crafted web page.
