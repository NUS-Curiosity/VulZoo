Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Mutualaid CMS v4.3.1 content management system.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `id - nid` parameter of the `article.php` file GET method request. Remote attackers are able 
to execute sql commands by injection of malicious statements via GET method request. The vulnerability is located on the 
application-side and the request method to inject/execute is GET. The security vulnerability is a classic order by sql injection 
in the `id` or `nid` value. 

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.6.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] article.php
