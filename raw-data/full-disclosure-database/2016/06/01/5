Subject: [FD] Keystone Assembler Engine is out!

Greetings,

We are very excited to announce the first public release of Keystone
Engine, the multi-arch, multi-platform, multi-bindings assembler framework
you are all longing for!

Keystone Engine offers some unparalleled features:

- Multi-architecture, with support for Arm, Arm64 (AArch64/Armv8), Hexagon,
Mips, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ & X86 (include 16/32/64bit).
- Clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.
- Implemented in C/C++ languages, with 5 bindings for Python, NodeJS, Ruby,
Go & Rust available.
- Native support for Windows & *nix (with Mac OSX, Linux, *BSD & Solaris
confirmed).
- Thread-safe by design.
- Open source - with a dual license.

For further information, see our website at http://www.keystone-engine.org
See existing tools built on top of Keystone at

Keystone is a very young project, but we do hope that it will live a long
life. The community support will be critical for our little open source
framework!

We would like show our gratitude to all the Indiegogo supporters, who
financially contributed to the development of Keystone!
We will never forget all testers for incredible bug reports & code
contributions during the beta phase!
Without the invaluable helps of community, our project would not have gone
this far!

Huge thanks go to LLVM project, which Keystone is based on, and extends
much further in its special area. Without the almighty LLVM, Keystone would
not be existent!

Keystone aims to lay the ground for innovative works. We look forward to
seeing many advanced research & development in the security area built on
this framework. Let the fun begin!

Thanks,
Quynh
