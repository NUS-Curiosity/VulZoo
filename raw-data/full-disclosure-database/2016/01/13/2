Subject: [FD] EasyDNNnews Reflected XSS

Details
=======

Product: EasyDNNnews
Vulnerability: Reflected XSS
Author: Peter Lapp, lappsec () gmail com
CVE: None
Vulnerable Versions: <7.5
Fixed Version: 7.5


Summary
=======

>From the vendor's website: "EasyDNNnews is a very powerful DotNetNuke
module that enables non-technical users to publish and manage articles,
news, press releases, stories and editorials."

During an engagement it was discovered that reflected XSS could be achieved
in two locations by appending a bogus GET parameter that contained
JavaScript in the parameter name. After alerting EasyDNNsolutions of the
vulnerability, they informed me that one of the vulnerabilities had already
been fixed and the other would be fixed in an upcoming release.

and the other will be in the next release, which was 7.5.
