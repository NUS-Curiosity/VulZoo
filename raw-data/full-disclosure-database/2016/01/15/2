Subject: [FD] [TOOL] The Metabrik Platform

Hi list,

I would like to introduce you to The Metabrik Platform, please find a 
complete description below.

For the impatient, you can see it in action at the following link:
http://www.metabrik.org/blog/2016/01/09/malware-analysis-with-vm-instrumentation-wmi-winexe-volatility-and-metabrik/

The Metabrik Platform bind togother a classic Shell with a Perl 
interpreter as a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) and a ton of small Briks. 
Briks are reusable components each performing a specific task. You chain 
Briks together using Perl variables, they are used to pass output of a 
Brik Command as input for another Brik Command.

By chaining Briks together, you easily create new powerful tools, just 
like the UNIX pipe.
Today, there is more than 170 Briks available.

Metabrik goals:

- Glue the Perl language with a shell
- Give a standardised API to write reusable Briks
- Self-documented Briks to make them easy to use
- Only 4 main shell commands to remember: use, set, get, run

Metabrik features:

- Completion on Brik names, Commands and Attributes
- Completion on file manipulation
- Completion on Perl variable names
- Command history and recalling
- Customization support with a .rc file
- Scripting support
- Multiple Brik repositories support

Metabrik helps you to concentrate on scenarios instead of wasting your 
time searching how to use a program.
You just have to reuse available Briks to perform your everyday job.

Briks also share the same syntax so you donâ€™t have to scratch your head 
each time you use yet-another-tool, and they also feature integrated 
help.
