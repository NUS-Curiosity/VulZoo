Description
================
By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability along with Cross Site
Request forgery will gives an easy access to an attacker for hijacking a
logged in user’s session by stealing cookies. This means that the malicious
hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session
of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

Technical Details
================

   1. Logon into any wordpress application (attacker)
   2. Click to “Add new cronjob” in Crony Cronjob Manager Version 0.4.4
   Plugin and capture the request in intercepting proxy.
   3. Now, Generate a CSRF Request with attacker logged in account.
   4. Modify the request with the code you required to get executed in
   victim’s browser.
   5. Enter the value for the name variable with “XSS&CSRF” and add any
   scripts, malicious code or payload.
   6. Here, its <script>alert(‘Vulnerable2CSRF&XSS’)</script> which an
   attacker wants to get executed in victim’s browser and sends the link to
   victim.
   7. Now, once the victim opens the link in the user logged in browser.
   Then, immediately the added XSS payload will be executed whenever we review
   it.
