Subject: [FD] [CORE-2016-0001] - Intel Driver Update Utility MiTM

1. Advisory Information

Title: Intel Driver Update Utility MiTM
Advisory ID: CORE-2016-0001
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/intel-driver-update-utility-mitm
Date published: 2016-01-19
Date of last update: 2016-01-14
Vendors contacted: Intel
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information [CWE-319]
Impact: Information leak
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2016-1493



3. Vulnerability Description

The Intel Driver Update Utility [1] is a tool that analyzes the system drivers on your computer. The utility reports if any new drivers are available, and provides the download files for the driver updates so you can install them quickly and easily.

Intel [2] Driver Update Utility is prone to a Men in The Middle attack which could result in integrity corruption of the transferred data, information leak and consequently code execution.

4. Vulnerable Packages

Intel Driver Update Utility 2.2.0.5
Other products and versions might be affected too, but they were not tested.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Intel released a new version of Intel Driver Update Utility [3] that solves the issue.

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by a member from Core Security Research Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core Security Advisories Team.



7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1. Clear text Transmission of Update Information

[CVE-2016-1493] Once the application starts searching for driver updates many HTTP requests like the one below can be seen:

 
GET http://storefront.download.protexis.net/IDDAPI/Prod/productfamily/desktopboard/driver/getbyhardwaresignature/ven_8086&dev_010a/a08/190.xml HTTP/1.1
Host: storefront.download.protexis.net
       
The URL path of the HTTP requests is easy to understand, the hardware ID is part of the path. This ID can be found on the device manager. In the XML file that is received from the server, there's a tag 'File_Url' that has the URL of the file that is going to be downloaded and executed by the application.

 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Drivers xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns="http://tempuri.org/GetDrivers.xsd">

    <File_Url>http://downloadmirror.intel.com/24696/a08/win64_152823.zip</File_Url>
    <HardwareSignature>VEN_8086&amp;DEV_010A</HardwareSignature>
    <IsComponent>true</IsComponent>
    <Languages>

        <Driver_Name>Intel® HD Graphics Driver for Windows* 7/8/8.1 64-bit</Driver_Name>
        <Driver_Details>Installs the Intel® HD Graphics Driver for Windows* 7/8/8.1 64-bit version 15.28.23.64.4101 (9.17.10.4101)</Driver_Details>
      </Language>
    </Languages>
    <Installer_Result_Key>SOFTWARE\Intel\GFX</Installer_Result_Key>
    <Installer_Version_Key>SOFTWARE\Intel\GFX</Installer_Version_Key>
    <Installer_Reboot_Flag>deferred</Installer_Reboot_Flag>
    <Installer_Cmd_Line>-s -overwrite</Installer_Cmd_Line>
  </Driver>
</Drivers>
       
Once the application ends the search process, it shows the user the available drivers updates. After downloading the drivers the user clicks on the 'Install' button and the binaries are executed. The only verification founded was on the VerifyDownloadURL method of the DriverManager class. This is doing a domain verification, that can be easily bypassed if the attacker is performing an ARP poisoning attack combined with DNS spoofing.
