Description
================
Attacker uses leaks or flaws in the authentication or session management
functions (e.g., exposed accounts, passwords, session IDs) to impersonate
users. Developers frequently build custom authentication and session
management schemes, but building these correctly is hard. As a result,
these custom schemes frequently have flaws in areas such as logout,
password management, timeouts, remember me, secret question, account
update, etc.

Technical Details
================
*Authentication Bypass:*

Try Accessing the URL which the normal user have no longer access without
credentials with auth token value as* “ok” *and HTTP Basic Authentication
header with password value

*Improper Session Management:*

Create a fake Session ID and submit the request to the server with the
credentials. Whereas, you can see that the session id has no change even
after getting logged in and during logout process.

Fix
================
Regenerate the session-id of the end user during login and logout process.
Invalidate all the initialized session variables during logout process.
Check for unauthenticated access to all the pages inside login.
Remove Basic HTTP Authentication and Implement any other authentication
technique.
