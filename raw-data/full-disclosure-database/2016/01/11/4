Description
================
Using this flaw, an attacker can cause victims to change any data the
victim is allowed to change or perform any function the victim is
authorized to use.

Technical Details
================
Created a forged request changing the value of any variable, here it is
*:InternetGatewayDevice.X_TWSZ-COM_URL_Filter.BlackList.1.URL *variable in
the URL http://router-ip/cgi-bin/webproc and sent it to victim forcing
him/her to click on the malicious link generated by an attacker with
different session allows an attacker to change the settings of the victim’s
router.

*Note:* Similarly, we can manipulate any request and can force victim to
access the link generated by the attacker to make changes to the router
settings without victim’s knowledge.
