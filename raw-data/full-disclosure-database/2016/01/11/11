Once you can fool the user to plug the USB device, you don't need
anything else. The device may appear as
1. A mass storage, and
2. A keyboard or any other HID, and
3. Some unknown hardware

Once the W-ndows enumerates this hardware, it will try to find and
automatically install drivers for it. With a mass storage and a
keyboard it will succeed, thus immediately bringing them to use,
and unknown hardware would bring up a "search for drivers" dialog,
where the attacker may (after some delay) send keystrokes to choose
"search removable devices for drivers". Obviously, the mass storage
part of the USB device would contain suitable .inf file pointing to
malicious binaries.

The USB device capable of performing such attack may be as simple
as ATtiny85 + 25Q64 chips (both are available in a 3*4 mm SOP8),
with a total cost of 1 EUR. The 25Q64 offers 8 Mbyte of storage,
which is well enough for almost anything.
