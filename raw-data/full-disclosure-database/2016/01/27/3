Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
2.9


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
To take advantage of its size and location on your wrist, Apple Watch was designed with its own unique operating system — watchOS. 
With watchOS 2, we’ve refined it. There are more faces to choose from. Faster, more powerful apps. Enhanced communication options. 
And innovative new ways to make your Apple Watch your own.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Apple
Product: Watch OS - Apple Watch 2.0 & 2.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Low


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A Denial of Service Vulnerability has been discovered in the official Apple (Apple Watch) WatchOS v2.1 & v2.2.
The vulnerability allows to crash the mobile operating of apple by interaction with an default mobile application.

Local attackers with restricted accounts are able to include a new `Alarm`. The input field of the alarm function 
is not correctly encoding the context. Thus results in an unexpected error with the alert handler of watchOS.
After including a malicious loop as input, the attacker is able to save the context and the watchOS crashs temporarily.

The security risk of the denial of service vulnerability is estimated as low with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.9. 
Exploitation of the denial of service software vulnerability requires a low privileged or restricted user account without user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a permanent crash of the watchOS each time the alert is executed.

Vulnerable OS:
			[+] Watch OS

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Add Alarm (Add Alert - Clock)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with physical access or restricted access to the watchOS.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open your phone Clock / goto Alarm
2. Add alarm / set time [for example two minutes later]
3. click label /  input 5000 x “0"
4. Save
5. Lock Your phone and wait for alarm
6. When the alarm clock rings / Watch Crashed 


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the denial of service vulnerability in the apple watch with iOS v9.x is estimated as low. (CVSS 2.9)
