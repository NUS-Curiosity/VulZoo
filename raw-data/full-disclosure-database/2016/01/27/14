Hash: SHA512

#Title: Eclipse Birt Report Viewer <= v4.5.0 Persistent XSS
#Vendor homepage: http://www.eclipse.org
#Discovered by: Multiple parties reported to vendor. (first in 2008!)
#Vulnerability: Presistent XSS when viewing report containing javascript


Description:
This vulnerability has been present in the Eclipse BIRT Report Viewer for
8 years at least.  It has survived at least two full revisions and the bug
tickets notifying the vendor of the issue have not been assigned or moved
out of New status.

When previewing a generated report, the report viewer fails to sanitize
the report data pulled and will execute javascript and other code. This
could allow an attacker with access to the database the ability to add
persistent malicious code to report data.The vendor has been notified by
multiple parties, but there has been no activity on the issue, based on
other similar bug tickets on the issue tracker. Please refer to the
eclipse bug tracker page tickets below for additional information. This
has been an issue since version 2.2.2 at least:
