LEADTOOLS ActiveX control multiple DLL side loading vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yorick Koster, September 2015

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple DLL side loading vulnerabilities were found in the LEADTOOLS
ActiveX control. These issues can be exploited by loading various COM
components as an embedded OLE object. When instantiating the object
Windows will try to load the DLL LTANN11N.DLL from the current working
directory. If an attacker convinces the user to open a specially crafted
(Office) document from a directory also containing the attacker's DLL
file, it is possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the target user. This can potentially result in the attacker taking
complete control of the affected system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Affected versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was successfully verified on the HP Color LaserJet CM2320 MFP
drivers version 3.1 (CM2320series-win7-full-solution-AM-EMEA1-v3.1.exe).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is currently no fix available, HP reports: "Unfortunately, the
driver software for these devices can no longer be updated. The devices
have ended support life and the engineering resources are no longer
available to provide any firmware updates.  We do understand the issue,
and current drivers are no longer vulnerable to the OLE side load
issue".
