Issue

The Dell SecureWorks iOS application (version 2.0.6 and below) does
not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to a
secure site.

Impact

An attacker who can perform a man in the middle attack may present a
bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Usernames, passwords and sensitive information could be captured by an
attacker without the user's knowledge.
