         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  Setting the sip.conf timert1 value to a value higher than    
                 1245 can cause an integer overflow and result in large       
                 retransmit timeout times. These large timeout values hold    
                 system file descriptors hostage and can cause the system to  
                 run out of file descriptors.                                 

    Resolution  Setting the sip.conf timert1 value to 1245 or lower will not  
                exhibit the vulnerability. The default timert1 value is 500.  
                Asterisk has been patched to detect the integer overflow and  
                calculate the previous retransmission timer value.
