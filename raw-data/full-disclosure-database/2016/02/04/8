Subject: [FD] Equibase.com HTML Injection/Possible Reflected XSS

Vulnerability Type:
HTML Injection (Possible XSS)

Title:
Equibase.com HTML Injection

Site Description:

Equibase.com is the official source for horse racing results, mobile
racing data, statistics as well as all other horse racing and
thoroughbred racing information.


Details:

The page http://www.equibase.com/profiles/results.cfm has a parameter
called type (e.g.
http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse) that has a
limited set of valid values.  The input for this parameter is render
unmodified in the output. This allows for reflected HTML injection and
content spoofing such as:

http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=%3Ch1%3E%3Cb%3EAn%20error%20occured.%20%20Please%20visit%20www.badguysite.com%20and%20log%20in%20to%20your%20equibase%20account%20to%20continue.%3C/b%3E%3C/h1%3E


Various other HTML tags were accepted and rendered.  Some limited
filtering did appear to be in place for XSS mitigation, as basic XSS
attacks did not work.  Since this was not a sanctioned test by the
site owner, extensive reflected XSS testing in this parameter was not
tested but based on observation the filtering in place did not appear
to be sufficient to stop an advanced reflected XSS attack.

Vulnerability Severity:  Medium

Vendor Interaction:

Vendor notified on 1/17 with full report. No response received.
