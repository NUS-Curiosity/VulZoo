         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  The Asterisk HTTP server currently has a default             
                 configuration which allows the BEAST vulnerability to be     
                 exploited if the TLS functionality is enabled. This can      
                 allow a man-in-the-middle attack to decrypt data passing     
                 through it.                                                  

    Resolution  Additional configuration options have been added to Asterisk  
                which allow configuration of the HTTP server to not be        
                susceptible to the BEAST vulnerability. These include         
                options to confirm the permitted ciphers, to control what     
                TLS protocols are allowed, and to use server cipher           
                preference order instead of client preference order. The      
                default configuration has also been changed for the HTTP      
                server to use a configuration which is not susceptible to     
                the BEAST vulnerability.
