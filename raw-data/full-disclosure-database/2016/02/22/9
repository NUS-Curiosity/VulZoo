Author: Jakub Palaczynski
Date: 22. February 2016
CVE: CVE-2016-2511

Affected software:
==================

WebSVN 2.3.3
Older versions are probably also vulnerable.

Description:
============

WebSVN offers a view onto your subversion repositories that's been designed
to reflect the Subversion methodology. You can view the log of any file or
directory and see a list of all the files changed, added or deleted in any
given revision. You can also view the differences between two versions of a
file so as to see exactly what was changed in a particular revision.[1]


Vulnerability:
**************

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting:
===============================

Proof of Concept:
http://host/websvn/log.php?path=%00"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>

Fix:
It is adviced to change following line in include/setup.php file:
$path = !empty($_REQUEST['path']) ? $_REQUEST['path'] : null;
to:
$path = !empty($_REQUEST['path']) ? escape($_REQUEST['path']) : null;

"escape" function that is used to patch vulnerability was written by the
author and can be found in include/command.php file.
