An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered an application-side cross site scripting vulnerability in the official Oxwell v1.8.1 Forums.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-02-22:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Oxwall Software
Product: Oxwall Forums (Web-Application) 1.8.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent Cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official Oxwall social network web Application software
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script code to the application-side of the affected application module.

The vulnerability is located in `Forums of users` module. Remote attackers with low privilege web-application user accounts are able to 
inject own malicious script code via POST method request to the application-side. The injection points are the `Forum name` and `Description` 
parameters in the add POST method request. The vulnerability is located to the application-side of the vulnerable web-application and the 
request method to inject is POST.

The security risk of the application-side input web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5. 
Exploitation of the persistent validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious sources 
and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Forums of users

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Forum name (group-name)

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable groupname and description input fields. 
Restrict the input and disallow usage of special chars.
Filter and setup a secure exception handling that prevents the persistent execution in the output location.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of application-side cross site scripting web vulnerability in oxwall web application software is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.5)
