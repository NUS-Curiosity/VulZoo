Hi Benedikt,

The Netgear website [1] shows that a new version of the firmware was
released 2 days after your FD post - version 1.4.0.6.

The release notes [2] for the new version don't refer to these
security issues in any way (instead they mention three fairly
minor-sounding bugs fixed).  Have you had a chance to test the new
version yet, and if so can you say whether - despite Netgear's stated
stance of WONTFIX - any of the security issues you report here are
fixed by it ?

[ I was thinking about buying one of these ProSafe Plus switches, but
perhaps won't if their support attitude is so poor :-) ]

Thanks,
Nick Boyce
