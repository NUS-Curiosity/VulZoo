Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Core Research Team discovered a remote denial of service vulnerability in the official Soso Transfer mobile iOS web-application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-02-02:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Elite Tracy
Product: Soso Transfer - iOS (Web-Application) 1.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote denial of service web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Soso Transfer mobile iOS web-application.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash or to shutdown the application by include of invalid values.

The vulnerability is located in the `path` value of the `show id` module. Remote attackers are able to request the show path with invalid ids. 
Thus results in a permanent shutdown of the mobile iOS web-application. The attacker injects only a low amount of invalid values to the path location 
to crash the mobile web-application permanently. The request method to attack is GET and the attack vector of the issue is located on the client-side 
of the application. The issue is a classic denial of service issue that is exploited by an invalid value context as an application parameter.

The security risk of the denial of service vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0. 
Exploitation of the denial of service web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the application web vulnerability results in permanent application crashs or stable shutdowns.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] ./show/

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] path as id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The denial of service web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers in the local wifi network without privileged user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction of the show modules path id value. 
Disallow invalid values and use an own exception-handling to prevent denial of service issues via client-side GET parameter requests.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the denial of service web vulnerability in the wifi web-server interface application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.0)
