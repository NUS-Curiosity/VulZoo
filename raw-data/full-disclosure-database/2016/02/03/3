The Vulnerability Laboratory Core Research Team discovered multiple vulnerability in the official File Manager PRO iOS mobile web-application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-02-03:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
RTC Hubs Limited
Product: File Manager PRO - iOS (Web-Application) 1.3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official File Manager PRO iOS mobile web-application.
The file include vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests to compromise the mobile web-application.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `Upload File` module. Attackers are able to inject own files with malicious 
`filename` values in the `upload` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local file/path include execution occcurs in 
the index file dir listing and sub folders of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to inject the local file include requests by usage of the 
`wifi interface` in connection with the vulnerable file upload POST method request. Injects are also possible via local app file sync function. 
Local attackers are also able to exploit the filename issue in combination with persistent injected script code to execute different malicious 
attack requests.

The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.1. 
Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the local file include vulnerability results in mobile application compromise or connected device component compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload File

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:56963/)


1.2
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the official File Manager PRO iOS mobile web-application.
The arbitrary file upload issue allows remote attackers to upload files with multiple extensions to bypass the web-server or system validation.

The vulnerability is located in the `Upload File` module. Remote attackers are able to upload a php or js web-shells by renaming the file with 
multiple extensions to bypass the file restriction mechanism. The attacker uploads for example a web-shell with the following name and extension 
`image.jpg.gif.js.php.jpg`. After the upload the attacker needs to open the file in the web application. He deletes the .jpg & . gif file 
extension and can access the application file with elevated access rights. 

The security risk of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.3.
Exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized file and device access because of a compromise after the upload of web-shells.


Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload File

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename (multiple extensions)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:56963/)
