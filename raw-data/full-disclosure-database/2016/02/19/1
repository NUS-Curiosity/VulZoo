Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official ifixit online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable modules context.

The vulnerability is located in the `title name` value of the `guides` and `prerequisite guides` search modules. Remote attackers with low privileged 
web-application user accounts are able to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the affected POST/GET method request. The attack 
vector of the vulnerability is located on the application-side and the request method to inject is POST. The execution of the inserted payload occurs 
in the search module were the `guides` and `prerequisite guides` becomes available with keyword.

The security risk of the filter bypass and persistent validation vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user accountand low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects to malicious source and 
persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] `guides`
				[+] `prerequisite guides`

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] title name (Guide)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Search Guide


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent cross site vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. I create  Guide with title name as script code payload 
Note: Payload - Samir"><img src="c" onerror=alert(document.domain)>
2. Now the attacker needs to create new Guide page
3. After the adding procedure he clicks to  the details
4. In the List any prerequisite guides in the searching i write Samir and i get the title about the last Guide page
5. Samir"><img src="c" onerror=alert(document.domain)>  Now the code XSS executes via payload metatag
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent cross site scripting vulnerability!
