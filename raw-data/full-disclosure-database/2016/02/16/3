who are new to security to the most seasoned practitioners in the security
industry. Introductory talks are welcome.

Topics of interest include:

* Tools for data collection and visualization
* Interesting or innovative uses of Honeypots
* Presenting security metrics to the board/leadership
* Justifying hacking/security tools in the corporate world
* Security awareness program success and failure stories
* Enterprise defense using open source tools (e.g., Yara, Cuckoo Sandbox)

* Getting multi-vendor tools working together
* Tool/task automation and optimization
* New and innovative ways of using old tools
* Incident response process and procedures

The Wall of Sheep will not accept product or vendor related pitches. If
your talk is a thinly-veiled advertisement for a product or service your
company is offering, please do not apply!

All accepted talks will be announced, recorded, and published by DEF CON
Communications, Inc.  Please see our YouTube channel for all Speaker
Workshops from last year:

Saturday, May 21st at 11:59 PM.  The list of workshops will be finalized
and published on Wednesday, June 1st.

Abstract:
Your abstract will be used for the website and printed materials. Summarize
what your presentation will cover. Attendees will read this to get an idea
of what they should know before your presentation, and what they will learn
after. Use this to inform about how technical your talk is. This abstract
is the primary way people will be drawn to your session. CFP reviews like
to see what tools will be used and what materials you suggest to read in
advance to get the most out of your presentation.

Equipment Needs & Special Requests:
The Wall of Sheep will provide 1 projector feed, and microphones. If you
need to use multiple outputs for a demo, please mention this below.

Speaker's Bio(s):
This text will be used for the website and printed materials and should be
written in the third person. Cover any professional history that is
relevant to the presentation, including past jobs, tools that you have
written, etc. Let people know who you are and why you are qualified to
speak on your topic. Presentations that are submitted without biographies
will not be considered.

Detailed Outline:
You must provide a detailed outline containing the main points and
navigation through your talk.  Show how you intend to begin, where you
intend to lead the audience and how you plan to get there. The outline may
be provided in a separate attachment and may be as simple as a text file or
as detailed as a "bare bones" presentation. The better your outline then
the better we are able to best review your presentation against other
submissions (and the higher chance you have of being accepted).  SUBMISSION
NOTE: Presentations that are submitted without abstracts, outlines, or
speaker bios (e.g., that have only PDFs, PPTs, or white papers attached or
only point to a URL) will not be considered.

Supporting File(s):

concept, etc. should be sent along with this email to
cfp2016[at]wallofsheep[dot]com. Note that additional files that may help in
the selection process should be included. We are not asking for a complete
