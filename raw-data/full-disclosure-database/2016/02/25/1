Introduction:

-------------

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is an enterprise-grade web content management
solution for building

websites, mobile apps and forms [1].

 

Security Analysts of Compass Security Schweiz AG [3] discovered a stored
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

vulnerability, which allows executing JavaScript code in a victim's context,
potentially resulting

in a number of different attack scenarios. For instance, the identified
vulnerability could be used

by a malicious AEM user to publish content in the name of another AEM user.

 

 

Affected Versions:

------------------

AEM 6.1.0

 

 

Technical Description:

----------------------

Authenticated users in AEM, having permissions to create new folders, may
place malicious JavaScript

code into a folder's title field. Once such a folder gets deleted, the
injected code is executed in

the context of the user deleting the folder. The vulnerability arises due to
improper output

encoding of folder titles in the Deletion popup dialog.

 

Amongst others, this stored XSS vulnerability could potentially be leveraged
by a low-privileged AEM

user to escalate its privileges. For example, a user having content
management permissions only

could create a folder, which when deleted by another, higher privileged AEM
user, could assign him

administrative privileges. Other type of XSS-related attacks - such as for
instance redirecting

other AEM users to websites abusing browser vulnerabilities to gain local
access - might be

possible.

 

 

Hotfix:

-------

Adobe has released a security hotfix (8651) [4] to address this issue.
