Affected Product(s):
====================
Hanlin Wang
Product: HD Video Player PRO - iOS (Web-Application) [Wifi] 2.5


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the HD Video Player v2.5 iOS mobile web-application (wifi).
The file include vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system specific path 
commands to compromise the mobile web-application.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `file uploader` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own files with 
malicious `filename` values in the `file upload` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local file/path 
include execution occcurs in the index file dir listing and sub folders of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to inject the 
lfi payload by usage of the wifi interface or local file sync function. Attackers are also able to exploit the filename issue in 
combination with persistent injected script code to execute different malicious attack requests. The attack vector is located on 
the application-side of the wifi service and the request method to inject is POST. 

The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4. 
Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the local file include vulnerability results in mobile application compromise or connected device component compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] File Uploader

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8083/ or http://localhost:20000)


1.2
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the HD Video Player v2.5 iOS mobile web-application (wifi).
The arbitrary file upload issue allows remote attackers to upload files with multiple extensions to bypass the system validation and compromise the web-server.

The vulnerability is located in the filename value of the `file uploader` module. Remote attackers are able to upload a php or js web-shell by a rename of the 
filename with multiple extensions in the upload POST method request. The attacker uploads for example a web-shell with the following name and extension 
`pentest.png.html.php.js.aspx.html.png`. After the upload the attacker needs to open the file in the wifi web-application interface. He deletes the .png file 
extension and can access the webshell with elevated access rights to execute. 

The security risk of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.3.
Exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability results in unauthorized file access (aap/device) and compromise of http web-server.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename  (multiple extensions)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8083/ or http://localhost:20000)
