Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple client-side web vulnerabilities has been discovered  in the official Wordpress Good News Themes wordpress web-application.
The client-side validation issue allows remote attacker to inject client-side script codes to compromise browser to application requests.

The vulnerability is located in the `s` value of the `Good News themes` module. Remote attackers are able to inject client-side script code 
to the vulnerable index GET method request. The `s` value is wrong encoded and not filtered by the regular validation. The attack vector of 
the issue is client-side and the request method to execute is GET.

The security risk of the client-side vulnerabilities is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0. 
Exploitation of the security vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing, non-persistent external redirects, 
non-persistent load of malicious script codes or non-persistent web module context manipulation.

Request Method(s):
                                [+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                [+] EGood News - Themes

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                                [+] s


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and with low user interaction (click|link).
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable `s` value. 
Restrict the input and disallow usage of special chars in the parameter GET method request to prevent an execution of client-side script codes.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability in the good news themes is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.0)
