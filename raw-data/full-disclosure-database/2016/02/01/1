Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A GET cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Netlife Photosuite Pro Content Management System.
A vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script codes on the client-side of the affected web-application.

The vulnerability is located in the `message` value of the `sections/prophoto/key.php` file. Remote attackers are able to inject own 
malicious script codes to the client-side of the affected web-application. The request method to inject is GET and the attack 
vector is client-side. The attacker inject the payload in the message value to execute the code in key.php.

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.3. 
Exploitation of the non-persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability requires no web-application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in session hijacking, persistent phishings attacks, persistent external redirect and malware loads or persistent 
manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
					[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] sections/prophoto/

Vulnerable File(s):
					[+] key.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] message


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The cross site scripting web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without a web-application user account or user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable `message` value in the affected key.php file GET method request.
Filter the input and restrict it by disallowing usage of special chars or script code tags to prevent client-side injection attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability in Netlife Photosuite Pro web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.3)
