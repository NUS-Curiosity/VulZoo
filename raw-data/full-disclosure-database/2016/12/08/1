         CVE Name       

    Description  If an SDP offer or answer is received with the Opus codec    
                 and with the format parameters separated using a space the   
                 code responsible for parsing will recursively call itself    
                 until it crashes. This occurs as the code does not properly  
                 handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT       
                 require the endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk.    
                 This also does not require the endpoint to be                
                 authenticated. If guest is enabled for chan_sip or           
                 anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still      
                 processed and the crash occurs.                              

    Resolution  The code has been updated to properly handle spaces           
                separating parameters in the fmtp line. Upgrade to a          
                released version with the fix incorporated or apply patch.
