Subject: [FD] Hotlinking Vulnerability in Glype (All Versions)

A vulnerability exists in the hotlinking feature of Glype on all versions
that allow the bypass and makes possible to link directly to proxified
files or develop aplications that integrate direct linking into the url.
This was found while trying to build a DDOS tool that take advantage of
installed copies of Glype worldwide. Since it wasn't possible to develop a
fast tool using common libraries such as jQuery this note was been
released. Tested on version 1.4.4 but affects all version based on the
Proof Of Concept.

For people that doesn't know what is Glype, Glype is the stable and fastest
php script to act as a web proxy. If you have blocked access to a site and
you want to access it, using a site with Glype installed can bypass that
restriction. Glype by default has hotlinking active to prevent linking to
banned pages or to save bandwidth on the servers.

At this point since Glype owner is probably broke, Glype servers
administrator are striving for advertising revenue, Glype users aren't tech
savy or they were using VPNs i'm not disclosing anymore details. $$$

=============================================================================

This release note has only the purpose of reaching a wider audience.
So do not spam my inbox or request the POC or request for comments or ask
me for anything related to this vulnerability.
