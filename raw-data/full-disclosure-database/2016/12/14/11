Subject: [FD] Reflected XSS in MailChimp for WordPress could allow an
	attacker to do almost anything an admin user can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: MailChimp for WordPress
Version: 3.1.5,4.0.10
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/reflected-xss-in-mailchimp-for-wordpress-could-allow-an-attacker-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-user-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in MailChimp for WordPress could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin user can

Vulnerability
================
If an attacker can trick a logged-in admin user into visiting a particular URL, they can execute JavaScript in the user’s browser which can perform almost any action that the user can.

Proof of concept
================
Assuming you have the site running on http://localhost/ with the plugin activated, visit this URL in a browser without reflected XSS mitigation measures (i.e. Firefox):
http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mailchimp-for-wp-integrations&integration=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

Mitigations
================
Update to version 4.0.11 or later.
