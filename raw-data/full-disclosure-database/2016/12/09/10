Subject: [FD] Broken access control on bluemix containers

# Date : 09/12/2016
# Author : Oscar Martinez
# Tested on:cf version 6.22.1+6b7af9c-2016-09-24 / Docker version 1.12.3,
build 6b644ec / API endpoint:   https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version:
2.54.0)
API endpoint:   https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.54.0)
# Vendor : IBM
# Software : bluemix https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/

# Vulnerability Description:
It is assumed that a user with auditor role should not be able to create or
delete containers.
reference:
https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/admin/users_roles.html
But, a user with auditor role CAN create or delete containers using the cli
CF.

1. Connect to bluemix using the cli CF with the user with "auditor" role.
1.1 cf login [-sso]
1.2 cf ic init
2. Show the images
2.1 cf ic images
3. Create the container
3.1 cf ic run --name broken_access_666 -p 8080 -m 512
registry.ng.bluemix.net/[your site]/[your image]
example:
cf ic run --name broken_access_666 -p 8080 -m 512
registry.ng.bluemix.net/mysite/tomcat
4. Delete your container
cf ic stop [your container]
cf ic rm [your container]
example:
cf ic stop broken_access_666
cf ic rm broken_access_666
