Subject: [FD] CVE-2013-1309:

Since November I have been releasing details on all vulnerabilities I
found that I have not released before. This is the twenty-seventh entry
in the series. This information is available in more detail on my blog
at http://blog.skylined.nl/20161207001.html. There you can find a repro
that triggered this issue in addition to the information below.

Today's release is not very interesting, because it was one of the first
bugs I found and reported to the ZDI back in 2012, before I had
developed the tools and skills to properly analyze MSIE bugs. This
report is therefore very scarce in information.

If you find this information useful, and would like to help me make time
to continue releasing this kind of information, you can make a donation
in bitcoin to 183yyxa9s1s1f7JBp­PHPmz­Q346y91Rx5DX.

MSIE 9 MSHTML CDispNode::InsertSiblingNode use-after-free
=========================================================
(MS13-037, CVE-2013-1309)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruption
vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate
this vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential
impact or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9
  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted web-page. JavaScript does not appear to be required for an
  attacker to triggering the vulnerable code path.

Details
-------
This bug was found back when I had very little knowledge and tools to do
analysis on use-after-free bugs, so I have no details to share. The ZDI
did do a more thorough analysis and provide some details in their
advisory at http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-13-083/.

Time-line
---------
* 1 November 2012: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
* 2 November 2012: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.
* 19 November 2012: This vulnerability was acquired by ZDI.
* 4 February 2013: This vulnerability was disclosed to Microsoft by ZDI.
* 29 May 2013: Microsoft addresses this vulnerability in MS13-037.
* 7 December 2016: Details of this vulnerability are released.

Cheers,
