Subject: [FD] Nagios Core < 4.2.4 Root Privilege Escalation [CVE-2016-9566]

Vulnerability:
Nagios Core < 4.2.4  Root Privilege Escalation
CVE-2016-9566

Discovered by: Dawid Golunski (@dawid_golunski)
https://legalhackers.com

Severity: High

Nagios Core daemon in versions below 4.2.4 was found to perform unsafe
operations when handling the log file. This could be exploited by
malicious local attackers to escalate their privileges from 'nagios'
system user,
or from a user belonging to 'nagios' group, to root.
The exploit could enable the attackers to fully compromise the system on which a
vulnerable Nagios version was installed.

To obtain the necessary level of access (nagios user/group), the
attackers could potentially use another Nagios vulnerability -
CVE-2016-9565.
