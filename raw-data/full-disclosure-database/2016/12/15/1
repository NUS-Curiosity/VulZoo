series. This information is available in more detail on my blog at
http://blog.skylined.nl/20161214001.html. There you can find a repro

MSIE 9 IEFRAME CMarkup..RemovePointerPos use-after-free
=======================================================
(MS13-055, CVE-2013-3143)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability
in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this
vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact
or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
* **Microsoft Internet Explorer 9**

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker
  from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Details
-------
This bug was found back when I had very little knowledge and tools to do
analysis on use-after-free bugs, so I have no details to share. ZDI
revealed that this was a use-after-free vulnerability, though their
advisory (at http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-13-163/)
mentions an iframe, which is not in the repro I provided.

Time-line
---------
* Sometime in November 2012: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
* 11 November 2012: This vulnerability was submitted to EIP.
* 10 December 2012: This vulnerability was rejected by EIP.
* 12 December 2012: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.
* 25 January 2013: This vulnerability was acquired by ZDI.
* 15 February 2013: This vulnerability was disclosed to Microsoft by
  ZDI.
* 26 July 2013: This vulnerability was address by Microsoft in MS13-055.
* 14 December 2016: Details of this vulnerability are released.

Cheers,
