Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.2.9

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 30th of November DAVOSET v.1.2.9
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

In new version there were added support of XXE vulnerability in AfterLogic
WebMail Pro and XXE vulnerability in Oracle BI Publisher. And removed
non-working services from full list of zombies.

In total there are 155 zombie-services in the list.
