We mostly work on BlackArch Linux for our personal use. We share it in
the hopes that you will contribute by reporting bugs and sharing tools
and ideas.


We have a relaxed project structure. We welcome pull requests of all
sizes through any means, including Github[0] and email[1].


Also see our Twitter account[2] and IRC channel[3]. Although BlackArch
is the primary topic in the channel, we also have pleasant
conversations about other things. Come join us. It's a happy place.

Our initiative depends on donations in order to be able to pay the
server infrastructure and our expences. Therefore we ask for voluntary
donations.
