Subject: [FD] Reflected XSS in Social Pug – Easy Social Share Buttons could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin user can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Social Pug - Easy Social Share Buttons
Version: 1.1.2,1.2.5
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/social-pug/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/reflected-xss-in-social-pug-easy-social-share-buttons-could-allow-an-attacker-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-user-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in Social Pug – Easy Social Share Buttons could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin user can

Vulnerability
================
This plugin takes input from $_GET and puts it directly into HTML without escaping it. This means that anybody who is able to convince an admin user to click on a link would be able to take control of their browser on that domain name and delete posts, add new admin users, etc..

Proof of concept
================
Log in as an admin user with this plugin activated, using a browser without reflected XSS prevention (i.e. Firefox). Visit this URL:
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=dpsp-toolkit&settings-updated=1&dpsp_message_id=0&dpsp_message_class=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

Mitigations
================
Update to version 1.2.6 or later.
