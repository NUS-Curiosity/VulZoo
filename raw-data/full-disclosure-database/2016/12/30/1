Subject: [FD] Executable installers are vulnerable^WEVIL (case 42):
	SoftMaker's FreeOffice installer allows escalation of privilege

Hi @ll,

the installers of SoftMaker's FreeOffice 2016, "freeoffice2016.exe",
available from <http://www.softmaker.net/down/freeoffice2016.exe>,
and its predecessor FreeOffice 2010, "freeofficewindows.exe",
available from <http://www.softmaker.net/down/freeofficewindows.exe>,
are (surprise.-) vulnerable!


1. They load CABINET.DLL, MSI.DLL, VERSION.DLL and WINSPOOL.DRV from
   their "application directory" instead of Windows' "system directory"
   %SystemRoot%\System32\, resulting in "arbitrary code execution".

   For this well-known vulnerability see
   <https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html>,
   <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html>,
   <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html>
   <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2269637.aspx>,
   <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff919712.aspx> and
   <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx> plus
   <https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2008/09/carpet-bombing-and-directory-poisoning.html>,
   <http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2012/02/downloads-folder-binary-planting.html>,
   <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/134> and
   <http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2014/05/13/load-library-safely.aspx>:

   The "application directory" is typically the user's "Downloads"
   folder, where an attacker can place these DLLs for example per
   "drive-by download".

   Thanks to the embedded application manifest which specifies
   "requireAdministrator" the executable installer can only be run
   with administrative privileges, resulting in "arbitrary code
   execution" WITH "elevation of privilege".


2. The installer creates an UNPROTECTED directory "%TEMP%\<GUID>\",
   writable by the unprivileged user, to extracts the files uinst.exe,
   SETUP_1.CAB and SETUP_2.CAB, then extracts an .MSI from the .CABs
   and calls "MSIEXEC.EXE /i ...MSI" to finally install FreeOffice.

   Thanks to the unprotected directory an attacker can modify the
   extracted files and is able to gain SYSTEM privilege.

   For this well-known vulnerability see
   <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html> and
   <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html>


The installers are built using dotNetinstaller from dblock.org.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!


Mitigations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Don't use executable installers! NEVER!

  See <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Nov/101> and
  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Dec/86> plus
  <http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/!execute.html> alias
  <https://skanthak.homepage.t-online.de/!execute.html> for more
  information.

* Practice STRICT privilege separation: NEVER use the so-called
  "protected" administrator account(s) created during Windows
  setup.

* Add an ACE "(D;OIIO;WP;;;WD)" to the ACL of every "%USERPROFILE%";
  use <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374928.aspx> to
  decode it to "deny execution of files in this directory for
  everyone, inheritable to all files in all subdirectories".


stay tuned
