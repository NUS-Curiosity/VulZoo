That is correct.

That is wrong. CBC mode allows attacks such as "Sweet32"
(https://sweet32.info/), which is not possible with CTR mode.

Correct again, but too simple minded. Any encryption without integrity
protection does not provide confidentiality against an active attacker.
Using the wrong mode with a block cipher can render authentication
irrelevant in attacks on confidentiality.

That is sound advice. In addition, broken ciphers, modes, and protocols
still implemented for backwards compatibility should not be used.

Thanks,
