Subject: [FD] XSS in tooltip plugin of Zurb Foundation 5

XSS vulnerabilty in the tooltip plugin of Zurb Foundation 5.x
=============================================================

URL to this advisory: https://nop.li/foundation5tooltipxss

Vendor
======

Product
=======
(Taken from http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/)
Foundation is the most advanced, responsive front-end framework in the 
world. The framework is mobile
friendly and ready for you to customize it any way you want to use it.

Vulnerability Type
==================
Cross-Site-Scripting Vulnerability

CVE Reference
=============
N/A

Vulnerability Details
=====================
The Foundation framework provides an easy way to insert tooltips into 
your code. The corresponding plugin
for this is *foundation.tooltip.js*. Unfortunately the plugin takes 
HTML-encoded code from the title
parameter and returns it as actual HTML, allowing an attacker to inject 
dynamic HTML/JS into an
application, if the application allows to inject user input into title 
fields of a tooltip'ed SPAN
entity. Even if the user input is correctly encoded, before adding it to 
the tooltip'ed SPAN, the
Foundation Tooltip JavaScript will re-decode it and inject the actul 
HTML code.

Example code
============
This code snippet shows a simple HTML page with encoded HTML in a 
tooltip, utilizing the Foundation
JS plugin.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" name="viewport">
		<title>Foundation 5 Tooltip XSS example</title>
		<script src="/foundation/js/vendor/modernizr.js"></script>
		<link href="/css/vpnauth.css" rel="stylesheet">
		<link href="/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
	</head>
	<body>
		<span data-tooltip data-options="hover_delay: 50;" class="has-tip" 
title="&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;Oh crap! 
XSS'ed&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;">This is a tooltip'ed SPAN</span>
		<!-- Begin Foundation JavaScript includes //-->
		<script src="/foundation/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
		<script src="/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.js"></script>
		<script 
src="/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tooltip.js"></script>
		<script>//<![CDATA[
			$(document).foundation();
		//]]></script>		<!-- End Foundation JavaScript includes //-->
	</body>
</html>

When opened in a browser, the encoded HTML from the title-parameter in 
line 12 will be grabbed by the
tooltip plugin and re-decoded to plain HTML in the output, causing the 
JavaScript to be injected into
the page. A JavaScript alert window will pop up.

Quick fix/Workaround
====================
The problem lies in line 197 of *foundation.tooltip.js*:

var $tip = $(tip_template(this.selector($target), 
$('<div></div>').html($target.attr('title')).html())),
	classes = this.inheritable_classes($target);

The title attribute is read and provided as HTML without any 
sanitization. As a quick fix, one could
use the .text() function of jQuery to sanitize the read value from the 
title attribute. This might
not be a full fix for the issue, but at least worked in my examples.

Here is a diff for quick patching:
