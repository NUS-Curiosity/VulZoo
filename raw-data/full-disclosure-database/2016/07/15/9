Subject: [FD] x-originating-ip: [25.162.68.132]

Would be interesting to know why my 'x-originating-ip' is [25.162.68.132] while using Office 365 OWA...

EspeciallyÂ when it belongs to UK Ministry of Defence.

I hope that FD don't filter and remove my 'x-originating-ip' now... otherwise i think you would be able to see it..

Snip from my own test e-mails to external mail address.
