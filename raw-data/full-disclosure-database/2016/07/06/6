I have gone ahead and just pushed my fuzzing results to Github. These were found with American Fuzzy Lop.

While Mozilla lists information leaks as viable for a bug bounty [1], unless it straight up crashes Thunderbird (which heap over reads may or may not do depending on the surrounding memory), it doesn’t seem they will care much and will mark your bugs as sec-low which is not valid for the bug bounty.

ASan reports are in the min_crashes folder with .asan extension. Some of the ical files in the raw_queue and raw_crashes were generated using the commented out code in the icaltestparser.c file, which will result in some use-after-frees as well (some of it in the icaltestparser code actually, but not all).

You actually can’t compile Thunderbird with ASan at the moment, and haven’t been able to for some time as far as I can tell. I have spent days trying to make this work to no avail. Without this, there won’t be a clean reproduction to crash Thunderbird most likely.
