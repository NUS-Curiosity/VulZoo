Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Micron content management system 2016 Q2.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The web vulnerability is located in the `cat_id` parameter of the `mainbooks.php` file GET method request. Remote attackers 
are able to execute sql commands by injection of malicious statements via GET method request. The vulnerability is located on 
the application-side and the attack vector is non-persistent. The security vulnerability is a classic order by sql injection 
in the `cat_id` parameter.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.9.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] mainbooks.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] cat_id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
