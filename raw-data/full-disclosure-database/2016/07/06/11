Subject: [FD] CIMA DocuClass ECM - Multiple Vulnerabilities

*CIMA DocuClass Enterprise Content Management - Multiple Vulnerabilities*

DocuClass is a modular and scalable enterprise content management (ECM)
solution that allows organizations to streamline internal operations by
significantly improving the way they manage their information within a
business process.


*Vendor Response*: None


*Vulnerability Findings*

1. *SQL Injection* [Post Auth]


DocuClass web application contains a SQL injection vulnerability.


CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command
('SQL Injection')


DocuClass web application contains a SQL injection vulnerability due to the
application failing to validate user input. Multiple parameters are
vulnerable.


*Vulnerable URLs & parameters:*

A. POST request - /dcrpcserver.php [parameter - uid]

B. GET request -

/e-forms/dcformsserver.exe?action=createimagepdf&documentid=1408648&userid=755

[parameter - userid]


*Impact*

An unauthenticated attacker can read or modify data in the application
database, execute code, and compromise the host system.


2. *Access Control Flaws*


DocuClass web application does not enforce strict access control.


*Impact*

An unauthenticated user can access stored documents by directly calling the
document url.


PoC:

3. *Cross-Site Scripting*


DocuClass web application lacks strong input validation, and multiple urls
& parameters are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (CWE-79) attacks.


*Impact*

An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary scripts/code in the context of
the user's browser.


4. *Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery*


The application does not have a CSRF Token generated per page and / or per
(sensitive) function.


*Impact*

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow silent execution of
unauthorized actions in the application such as configuration changes,
(potentially) deleting stored documents, running reports, changing
passwords, filling disk space via repeated duplicate copying of documents,
etc.
