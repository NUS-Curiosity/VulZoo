Subject: [FD] KeepNote 0.7.8 Remote Command Execution

# Title : KeepNote 0.7.8 Remote Command Execution
# Date : 29/09/2016
# Author : R-73eN
# Twitter : https://twitter.com/r_73en
# Tested on : KeepNote 0.7.8 (Kali Linux , and Windows 7)
# Software : http://keepnote.org/index.shtml#download
# Vendor : ~
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# When the KeepNote imports a backup which is actuallt a tar.gz file
doesn't checks for " ../ " characters
# which makes it possible to do a path traversal and write anywhere in the
system(where the user has writing permissions).
# This simple POC will write to the /home/root/.bashrc the file test.txt to
get command execution when the bash is run.
# There are a lot of ways but i choose this just for demostration purposes
and its supposed we run the keepnote application
# as root (default in kali linux which this bug is tested).
