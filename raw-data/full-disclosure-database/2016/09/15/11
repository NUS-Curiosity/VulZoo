Subject: [FD] Multiple vulnerabilities in ASUS RT-N10

Hello list!

There are multiple vulnerabilities in ASUS Wireless Router RT-N10. There are
Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting and URL Redirector Abuse
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next models: ASUS RT-N10, RT-N10E, RT-N10LX and RT-N10U
with different versions of firmware. I checked in RT-N10 with firmware
version 1.9.2.7.

Asus ignored vulnerabilities in RT-G32, RT-N15 and RT-N10, which I sent them
during 2015. At 03.12.2015 I informed Asus about vulnerabilities in RT-N15
with mentioning about similar ones in RT-N10.

Code Execution (OS Commanding) (WASC-31):

In section System Command it's possible to execute system commands. The code
also can be executed via CSRF attack.

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/apply.cgi?current_page=javascript:alert(document.cookie) (in old
browsers)

http://site/apply.cgi?current_page=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onload=alert%28document.cookie%29%3E

URL Redirector Abuse (WASC-38):

http://site/apply.cgi?current_page=http://google.com

I found this and other routers in 2014-2015 to take control over terrorists
in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansks regions of Ukraine. Read in the list
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2016-September/010823.html).

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/8322/).
