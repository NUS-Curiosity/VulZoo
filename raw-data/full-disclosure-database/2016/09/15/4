Installation note:

This update is available through iTunes and Software Update on your

application, or in the Apple Downloads site. Make sure you have an
Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes
from www.apple.com/itunes/

iTunes and Software Update on the device will automatically check
Apple's update server on its weekly schedule. When an update is
detected, it is downloaded and the option to be installed is
presented to the user when the iOS device is docked. We recommend
applying the update immediately if possible. Selecting Don't Install
will present the option the next time you connect your iOS device.

The automatic update process may take up to a week depending on the
day that iTunes or the device checks for updates. You may manually
obtain the update via the Check for Updates button within iTunes, or
the Software Update on your device.

To check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:

* Navigate to Settings
* Select General
* Select About. The version after applying this update
will be "10.0.1".

Information will also be posted to the Apple Security Updates
web site: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222
