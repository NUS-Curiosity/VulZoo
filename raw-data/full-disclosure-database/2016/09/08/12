         CVE Name       

    Description  Asterisk can be crashed remotely by sending an ACK to it     
                 from an endpoint username that Asterisk does not recognize.  
                 Most SIP request types result in an "artificial" endpoint    
                 being looked up, but ACKs bypass this lookup. The resulting  
                 NULL pointer results in a crash when attempting to           
                 determine if ACLs should be applied.                         
                                                                              
                 This issue was introduced in the Asterisk 13.10 release and  
                 only affects that release.                                   
                                                                              
                 This issue only affects users using the PJSIP stack with     
                 Asterisk. Those users that use chan_sip are unaffected.      

    Resolution  ACKs now result in an artificial endpoint being looked up     
                just like other SIP request types.
