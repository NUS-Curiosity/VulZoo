Abdullah Hussam has reported via HackerOne that
www/delivery/asyncspc.php was vulnerable to the fairly new Reflected
File Download (RFD) web attack vector that enables attackers to gain
complete control over a victim's machine by virtually downloading a
file from a trusted domain.

Vulnerability 2 - Special Element Injection
========================================================================
CVE-ID: TBA
CWE-ID: CWE-75
CVSSv2: 2.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVSSv3 Vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C

CVSSv3 Temporal Score: 2.7
========================================================================

Joel Noguera has reported via HackerOne that usernames weren't properly
sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially,
control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical
usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such
characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a
browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user
spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users
within Revive Adserver.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 3 - Reflected XSS
========================================================================
CVE-ID: TBA
CWE-ID: CWE-79
CVSSv2: 4 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

CVSSv3 Vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
CVSSv3 Base Score: 4.2
CVSSv3 Temporal Score: 3.7
========================================================================

The HackerOne user pavanw3b has reported that the Revive Adserver web
installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the
dbHost, dbUser and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that
the window for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow
and it is very unlikely that such an attack could be actually effective.
