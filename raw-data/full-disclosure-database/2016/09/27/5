Subject: [FD] Welcome Faraday 2.1! Collaborative Penetration Test &
 Vulnerability Management Platform

After a long sprint we are proud to present Faraday v2.1:

Faraday is the Integrated Multiuser Risk Environment you were looking
for! It maps and leverages all the knowledge you generate in real
time, letting you track and understand your audits. Our dashboard for
CISOs and managers uncovers the impact and risk being assessed by the
audit in real-time without the need for a single email. Developed with
a specialized set of functionalities that help users improve their own
work, the main purpose is to re-use the available tools in the
community taking advantage of them in a collaborative way! Check out
the Faraday project in Github.

This sprint was mostly spent refactoring the Faraday Client, and it
really payed off! Now it supports massive workspaces with over 200k
hosts.

We also want to announce the launch of Faraday's brand new forum!
There you can discuss any and all things related to Faraday. Bug
reports, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!
