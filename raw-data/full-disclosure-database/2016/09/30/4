Authors of Advisory: Matthias Deeg and Gerhard Klostermeier (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

PERIDUO-710W is a wireless desktop set consisting of a mouse and a
keyboard.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"PERIDUO can create flexible, convenient and wireless working
environment with its design. PERIDUO offers a reliable 2.4GHz high
frequency penetration, low interference, and omni-directional signal
transmissions with 10Meters meters [sic] receiving distance."

Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated mouse data communication, the
wireless desktop set PERIDUO-710W is prone to mouse spoofing attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found out that the mouse of the wireless desktop set
PERIDUO-710W is prone to spoofing attacks, as the mouse data
communication is unencrypted and unauthenticated.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted mouse data packets of the 2.4
GHz radio communication sent by the mouse to the receiver (USB dongle)
in order to learn the used protocol. By knowing the used mouse data
protocol, it is possible to spoof mouse actions like mouse movements or
mouse clicks by sending forged data packets.

Thus, an attacker is able to remotely control the mouse pointer of a
target system that is operated with the wireless desktop set
PERIDUO-710W. If the graphical user interface of the victim's system
is unlocked, an attacker can for example send a list of mouse actions
that start the virtual on-screen keyboard of the operating system and
execute arbitrary commands in the context of the currently logged in
user, for instance a download and execute attack vector.

As the attacker may not have an unobstructed view to the target system's
screen and may not know the used operating system, the screen resolution,
or the current mouse settings, this kind mouse spoofing attack is based
on heuristics. But concerning an unlocked and unattended system, an
attacker can simply try different attack vectors for different target
system configurations sequentially.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH could successfully perform mouse spoofing attacks against
a target system operated with the wireless desktop set PERIDUO-710W
using an in-house developed software tool in combination with the USB
radio dongle Crazyradio PA (see [3]).

A proof-of-concept mouse spoofing attack resulting in remote code
execution using the SySS software tool Radioactive Mouse is demonstrated
in a video (see [4]).

Solution:

The SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for this reported security
vulnerability.
