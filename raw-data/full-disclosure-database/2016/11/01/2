Subject: [FD] Vulnerabilities in D-Link DIR-300

Hello list!

There are Abuse of Functionality, Brute Force and Cross-Site Request Forgery
vulnerabilities in D-Link DIR-300.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: D-Link DIR-300NRUB5, Firmware 1.2.94. All
previous versions also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

Admin's login is persistent: admin. Which simplify BF and CSRF attacks.

Brute Force (WASC-11):

http://site

No protection from BF attacks. If there is no Path Traversal vulnerability
in this device to get admin's password, then it's possible to pick it up.

Even I found DIR-300 with firmware version from 2009, where there was a
captcha (that can be turned on/off in the settings), but there was no
captcha in new firmware.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (WASC-09):

Change admin's password:

http://site/index.cgi?v2=y&rq=y&res_config_action=3&res_config_id=69&res_struct_size=1&res_buf=password|

------------
Timeline:
------------

2015.04.24 - announced at my site about vulnerabilities in DIR-300.
2015-2016 - informed developers about multiple vulnerabilities in this and 
other D-Link devices.
2016.08.27 - disclosed at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/7722/).
