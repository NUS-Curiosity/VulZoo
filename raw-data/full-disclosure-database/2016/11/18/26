Subject: [FD] Unserialization vulnerability in Relevanssi Premium could
	allow admins to execute arbitrary code (in some
	circumstances) (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Relevanssi Premium
Version: v1.14.4
Homepage: https://www.relevanssi.com/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/unserialization-vulnerability-in-relevanssi-premium-could-allow-admins-to-execute-arbitrary-code-in-some-circumstances/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 9 (High; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Description
================
Unserialization vulnerability in Relevanssi Premium could allow admins to execute arbitrary code (in some circumstances)

Vulnerability
================



If logged in as an admin on any site you can go to settings, Relevanssi Premium, import or export options. This is a text field that accepts a serialised PHP object. It is possible to submit a string that contains an evil encoded object that executes arbitrary code (if there are classes available with particular methods such as __destruct).




Proof of concept
================
Achieving arbitrary code execution depends on which classes are available (i.e. which plugins and themes are installed and active). It won’t be possible in all situations.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.14.6.1 or later.
