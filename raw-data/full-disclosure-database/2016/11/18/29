Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Huawei
Product: Flybox - Router (Web-Application) B660 3G/4G


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote auth bypass vulnerability has been discovered in the official Huawei Flybox B660 3g/4g router product series.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers to compromise any Huawei Flybox B660 
Admin Panel using a new a bypass method.

The vulnerability is located in the `./htmlcode/html/` modules and `indexdefault.asp ` file of 
localhost path URL. Remote attackers are able to compromise any Huawei Flybox B660  admin panel
via unauthenticated GET method request. 

The security risk of the issue is estimated as critical with a cvss count of 7.4. (CVSS 7.4)
Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires no privileged account or user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in compromise of the huawei flybox device.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /htmlcode/html/

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] indexdefault.asp


Software version of the modem:
1066.12.15.01.200

Hardware version of the modem:
WLB3TCLU

Name of the device:
B660

Hardware version of the router:
WL1B660I001

Software version of the router:
1066.11.15.02.110sp01


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

After buying a Flybox Huawei B660, the company setup a password for you like: "admin", "12345" or "55555"
We figured out that when you lose your password, you can perform to connect multiple times by using the plain passwords above.
After the third request the connection will be refused by an exception message, by intercepting the request and passing the error 
it is possible to bypass the authentication mechanism of the 3g/4g router device. The problem in Flybox Huawei B660 is the following, 
there is no test if the password false or true. If an attacker tries the false password of many times on requests they redirect you 
after the bypass of the error to change your password permanently.
