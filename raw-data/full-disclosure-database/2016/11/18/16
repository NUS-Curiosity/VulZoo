2. Overview

Jaws is a content management system written in PHP. In version 1.1.1, it is
vulnerable to code execution as it allows the upload of files with a dangerous
type.

An account with extended privileges is required.

3. Details

CVSS: High 9.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

The file manager forbids the uploading of most PHP and htaccess files by
checking the extension of uploaded files and renaming files when required.

However, the check can be bypassed by an attacker as the file extension .pht -
which is treated as PHP file by default Apache installations - is not filtered.

An account with access to the file manager is required.

This issue was not fixed by the vendor.
