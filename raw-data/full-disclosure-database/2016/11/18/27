Subject: [FD] SQL injection and unserialization vulnerability in Relevanssi
	Premium could allow admins to execute arbitrary code (in some
	circumstances) (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Relevanssi Premium
Version: v1.14.4
Homepage: https://www.relevanssi.com/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/sql-injection-and-unserialization-vulnerability-in-relevanssi-premium-could-allow-admins-to-execute-arbitrary-code-in-some-circumstances/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 9 (High; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Description
================
SQL injection and unserialization vulnerability in Relevanssi Premium could allow admins to execute arbitrary code (in some circumstances)

Vulnerability
================



Relevanssi has a search function on the admin side that is not visible in the user interface, however the code is there and can be called. This functionality contains an sql injection, and this sql injection can be exploited to pass user controlled values into an unserialization call and run arbitrary code (if there are classes available with particular methods such as __destruct).



If a logged in admin user is tricked into going to an attacker controlled website, JavaScript could be written to make the admins browser submit the above request, without their knowledge (see 2.3 Social engineering, p.18). Alternatively this attack can be exploited by an attacker with Admin privileges.







Proof of concept
================
Achieving arbitrary code execution depends on which classes are available (i.e. which plugins and themes are installed and active). It won’t be possible in all situations.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.14.6.1 or later.
