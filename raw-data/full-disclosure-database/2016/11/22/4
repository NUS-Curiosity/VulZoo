Subject: [FD] [x33fcon] Call for Papers (and Trainers)

Howdy all!
 
We have just opened call for papers and trainers for new security event, called
x33fcon (pronounced /ˈziːf-kɒn/) taking place in Poland between April 24-28,
2017.
 
Yet another security con? Nope.
 
The idea behind x33fcon is to focus on a very specific need of the security
industry: collaboration between blue and red teams (sometimes referred to as
purple teaming). We know from our professional experience how hard it can be to
build a solid bridge between those who assess security and those who guard the
castle. Many misconceptions and misunderstandings arise between these two
groups.

We want to change that. Rather than continue to think about security from either
an offensive or defensive perspective, our goal is to encourage security
professionals to consider both perspectives while working more closely together.
Both blue and red teams provide unique capabilities to an organization, but the
collaboration between the two yields the best results.

x33fcon is an event that brings both groups together, and everyone from both
sides of the fence are invited to gather, share ideas and discuss thoughts on
security.

 - red/blue collaboration (purple teaming)
