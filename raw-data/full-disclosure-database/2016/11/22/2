Subject: [FD] PHDays VII Call for Papers: How to Stand Up at the Standoff

November 15 marks the start of the call for papers for Positive Hack Days VII, an international digital security forum that will be held at the World Trade Center in Moscow, Russia, on May 23-24, 2017. Potential presenters must apply by sending an application form (https://cfp.phdays.com/en/phd7/cfp/open_soon) before January 30, 2017. Both established experts and up-and-coming specialists are encouraged to apply.

At the event, we plan to emphasize the threats and opportunities for building a safer Internet of Things. The theme of the prior forum-The Standoff-has taken on a life of its own with some unexpected twists. Cyberwarfare now threatens the everyday objects around us and hackers can use smart cars, smart home sensors, video cameras, and even children's toys to their advantage.

More than just a place for discussing security issues, PHDays is a space for building solutions. We urge speakers to share specific advice and tactics for mitigating security threats. We welcome both real-world experience and original research in all imaginable areas of security: defense, offense, smart devices, social networks, physical security, social engineering... If you have something to say, we hope to hear it at PHDays VII.

For information on topics and guidelines, see the Call for Papers page at www.phdays.com/call_for_papers. Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply early. Early-bird applicants leave time for the program committee to provide recommendations, which increases the likelihood of their presentation making the final cut.
