anywhere in the system.
# Vulnerability Replication
# 1. Create a special crafted zip file with the python script attached.
# 2. The script will create a zip file named xvdf_fusebundle.zip with a
filename test.bat (this can be changed) and will write this file to the
root directory C:\

the script will get executed or you can write a malicious dll to a program
directory or
#    system32 directory which will get loaded and we gain remote command
execution.
# 4. Open avira free antivirus
