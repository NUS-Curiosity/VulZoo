Hi,

I am submitting this CFP on behalf of EuskalHack. Tables are shown in
Markdown format.

Thanks,

**Introduction**

EuskalHack Security Congress is the first Ethical Hacking association in
Euskadi, with the aim of promoting the community and culture in digital
security to anyone who may be interested.

This exclusive conference is shaping up to be the most relevant in the
Basque Country, with an estimated 125 attendees for the first edition.

The participants include specialised companies, state security
organisations, professionals, hobbyists and students in the area of
security and Information Technology.

**Estimated date and location**

The estimated date for the conference is the 18th of June 2016 in the city
of Donostia - San Sebastian.

**Participate as a speaker**

We want to open the doors to all those who wish to be part of this first
edition of the EuskalHack Security Congress in one of the various
categories of talks and workshops we offer, whether professionals, students
or hobbyists.

We are interested in original content, giving preference to innovative
research and materials, for example:

- Communication hacking: GSM, SDR, 3G, Fiber Optics, Satellite Links
- Robots, Drones, Mobile Devices, Virtual Reality, Raspberry Pi
- Critical infrastructure and industrial security
- Practical attacks and virtual environments
- Cryptography, steganography, anti-forensics methods
- Open Source software development
- Programming, Debugging and Exploitation
- Malware in general, APTs, Bypassing
- Corporate security and intelligence
- Cloud (in)security
- Data Mining
- Hacktivism

**Language and Internationalisation**

At EuskalHack we value linguistic diversity and internationalisation, this
is why we envisage talks mainly being presented in Spanish, Basque and
English.

Therefore, please let us know what language you plan to use for your slides
and orally.

Note: We positively value bilingual options which can be understood by the
maximum number of attendees as possible.

**Talks and Workshops**

We will have several spaces over the course of the event, which will
include talks and workshops concurrently, taking three different types of
approaches:

| **NUMBER** | **1** | **2** | **3** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TYPE** | Dynamic exhibitions | Standard talks | Specific workshops |
| **DURATION** | 20 minutes | 50 minutes | 120 minutes |

Once all of the proposals have been received the total number of
presentations for each type will be determined, taking into consideration
aspects such as technological diversity and public assistance.

**Receipt of proposals**

found on the following links:
