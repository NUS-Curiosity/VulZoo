Thanks Benedikt.

Now that end hosts have been thoroughly analysed by vendors and
researchers alike, perhaps networking equipment is the new frontier
(cf: operating systems vs applications).  The dire state of the
quality of the software embedded in comms hardware, for both home and
business use, is emerging from the fog to become the elephant in the
room.  We seem to be caught between the rock of sheer incompetence and
the hard place of possible government agency influence (Juniper ...).

I wonder whether Netgear will be next (after Asus) to be slapped by
the US Federal Trade Commission for foisting badly conceived and
implemented CPE products on hapless and unsuspecting consumers ....
