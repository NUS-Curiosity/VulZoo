Panda SM Manager iOS Application - MITM SSL Certificate Vulnerability
--
http://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Panda-Security-SM-Manager.html

Overview

"Panda Systems Management is the new way to manage and monitor IT systems."

"Inventory, monitoring, management, remote control and reporting...
All from a single Web-based console"

(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/panda-sm-manager/id672205099)

Issue

The Panda SM Manager iOS application (version 2.0.10 and below) does
not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to a
secure site.

Impact

An attacker who can perform a man in the middle attack may present a
bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Usernames, passwords and sensitive information could be captured by an
attacker without the user's knowledge.
