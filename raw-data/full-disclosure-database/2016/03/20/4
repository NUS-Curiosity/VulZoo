Technical details
=============
This firmware might reside in Netgear's own firmware as well, but was found
on Bezeq firmware (custom). Issues:
1. HTTP Authorization bypass: by supplying "ess_" in the URL, authorization
is not validated.
2. Command injection: the ping utility allows an attacker to run arbitrary
command via the "system" API, by injecting either a pipe or backticks.
3. CSRF exposure.
4. Possible memory corruption: the basic authorization username is copied
via unsafe strcpy to a global variable.
