Well, they're trying to ensure they're doing their due diligence with
respect to responsible disclosure before they make a public
disclosure.

It sounds like they got a response from a confirmed idiot working at
Gigabyte. They're asking for other contact info to ascertain whether
idiocy is Gigabyte's official company policy, or if they just
contacted the wrong helpdesk drugdeon.
