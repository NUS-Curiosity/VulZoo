Subject: [FD] Releasing Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) v0.9

Hey Folks,

I just released a new version of Mobile Security Framework, an open source
framework capable of performing end to end security testing of mobile
applications.

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an all-in-one open source mobile
application (Android/iOS) automated pen-testing framework capable of
performing static and dynamic analysis. It can be used for effective and
fast security analysis of Android and iOS Applications and supports both
binaries (APK & IPA) and zipped source code. MobSF can also do Web API
Security testing with it's API Fuzzer that performs Information Gathering,
analyze Security Headers, identify Mobile API specific vulnerabilities like
XXE, SSRF, Path Traversal, IDOR, and other logical issues related to
Session Management and API Rate Limiting.

Lots of new Features including:

* Improved and Responsive UI
* Live Device/VM ScreenCast on Dynamic Analyzer view
* Dynamic SSL Testing
* Exported Activity Tester and PoC Generation
* All new REST API Fuzzer for Security Testing backend servers of Hybrid
Mobile Apps
* Custom VM and Android Device Support for MobSF Dynamic Analysis
* Updated Static Analyzer rule set.
* Recent Scan View
* Improved Web Proxy, Error Handling and Dynamic Analyzer logic.
* Anti Emulator Check Bypass.
