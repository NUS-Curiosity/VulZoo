Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official ChitaSoft web-application(2016Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `id`, `cat1`, `fid` or `news` values of the `profile.php`, `pages.php`,`product.php`, 
`shopsearch.php` & `news.php` files. Remote attackers are able to execute sql commands by injection of malicious statements via 
GET method request. The vulnerability is located on the application-side and the request method to inject/execute is GET. The 
security vulnerability is a classic order by sql injection in the `id` value. 

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.9.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] profile.php
				[+] pages.php
				[+] product.php
				[+] shopsearch.php
				[+] news.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
