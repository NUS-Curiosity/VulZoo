According to RFC 2142 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt), MAILBOX
NAMES FOR COMMON SERVICES, ROLES AND FUNCTIONS, you should be able to
use:

   secure@...abyte.com
   security@...abyte.com

I also rummage the WHOIS data and use the Administrative and Technical contacts:

   $ whois gigabyte.com | grep '@'
   Registrant Email: domains@...caria.com
   Admin Email: domains@...caria.com
   Tech Email: domains@...caria.com
   Registrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@...caria.com

WHOIS data must be correct. Its an ICANN contractual obligation.

Jeff
