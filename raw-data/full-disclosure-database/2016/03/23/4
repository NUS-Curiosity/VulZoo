Summary
========
The Facebook social networking service includes a mobile application called Messenger that allows users to send private messages to their Facebook contacts. Although the application uses HTTPS to communicate with the backend servers, insufficient validation (only when the device is configured to use a proxy) of the certificates returned by these servers leaves the application open to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
