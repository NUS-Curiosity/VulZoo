Subject: [FD] HTTPS Only 3.1 (Detailed Analysis, Browser Security,
 Open Source, Python)

To secure browser which is very fragile, the approach of HTTPS Only 3.1 is exceptionally simple:
1. Only HTTPS URLs(no other protocols)
2. Whitelist of domains(anything outside of whitelist is blocked)

Now, let's look at threats:
1. Man in the middle - it's fixed.
2. Phishing always requires the browser to load attacker's website, so it's permanently dead here.
3. Drive-by Download - dead(if applied strictly, unable to download the executable)
4. Clickjacking - dead(attacker's web page is unreachable)
5. Address Spoofing - dead too(just unable to load the fake content)
6. XSS - almost dead(for attacker, the XSS vulnerability has to be GET, because POST requires attacker's HTML)
7. CSRF - almost dead(for attacker, the CSRF vulnerability has to be GET, and modern web applications simply don't do important things in GET, because it can be bookmarked etc, too dangerous)
