Subject: [FD] New Security Tool: Enteletaor - Broker & MQ Injection tool

 
Dear colleagues,

Please, allow us to introduce Enteletaor -> https://github.com/cr0hn/enteletaor  

Enteletaor is a Message Queue & Broker Injection tool that implements attacks to: Redis, RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ.  

Some of the actions you can do:  

- Listing remote tasks.  
- Read remote task content.
- Disconnect remote clients from Redis server (even the admin)
- Inject tasks into remote processes.
- Make a scan to discover open brokers.

Currently supported brokers are:  

- RabbitMQ (or AMQP compatible).  
- ZeroMQ.
- Redis.

See documentation for more information:  

http://enteletaor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/  

Please, feel free to start using it and we would be thankful for any type  
of feedback.  

Best regards, 

---
