Content Management System.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-03-23: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the
Patron Info System web-application (2016 Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to
compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerabilities are located in the `news_id` value of the `news.php`
and `online_notice_board.php` files. Remote attackers are able to
execute sql commands by injection of malicious statements via GET method
request. The vulnerability is located on the application-side and
the request method to inject/execute is GET. The security vulnerability
is a classic order by sql injection bug in the `news_id` value.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as
high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.4.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no
user interaction or privileged web-application user accounts.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database
management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
                [+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] news.php
                [+] online_notice_board.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] news_id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote
attackers without privileged web-application user account or user
interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The sql injection vulnerability can be patched by usage of a prepared
statement and entities in the news_id GET method request. Escape the entry.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerabilities in the
web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.4)
