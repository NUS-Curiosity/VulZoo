Subject: [FD] Open Vulnerablity ID tracker instead of CVE. Maybe

Hello List,

I`m growing a bit tired of the way MITRE assigns CVEs (or just ignores you)
so instead, I thought some unmoderated list would be easier to manage. I
opted out to keep the same format as CVE with exception of first three
letters.

https://www.freeovi.com

Its completly unmoderated generator so feel free to use it and suggest
improvements.

Thanks
