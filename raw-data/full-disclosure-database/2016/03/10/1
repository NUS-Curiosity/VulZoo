Subject: [FD] Security contact @ Gigabyte

Hi list,

I'd like to know if anyone here know someone working on security at
Gigabyte (http://www.gigabyte.com/), since we are trying to responsibly
report a high risk security flaw we found.

We opened a ticket asking to be contacted by their security team, and the
answer we got was:

"Thanks for your interest, but we already have a security team for our
websites. Regards, GIGABYTE" (sigh)

So, if any of you knows someone in there, please let us know.

Thanks!

Gus.-
