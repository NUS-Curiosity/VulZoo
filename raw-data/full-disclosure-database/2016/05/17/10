Subject: Re: [FD] Skype Phishing Attack

Hey all,

I don't think "pop up a full featured window on the client" is your 
everyday phishing attack. This is easily exploited even for experienced 
users, since this is definitely not what you'd expect to originate from 
Skype (and for example Steam tends to annoy you with login popups 
sometimes, i.e. when changing your IP).

So yes, we don't need your average phishing attack, but this is surely a 
vulnerability and the publication hopefully forces M$ to do something 
about it.
