Subject: [FD] t2'16: Call For Papers 2016 (Helsinki, Finland)

#
# t2'16 - Call For Papers (Helsinki, Finland) - October 27 - 28, 2016
#

If you are tired of any of the following:
1) conferences where coffee service equals one coupon (= cup) per day,
2) conferences with crazy-ass lines making world's busiest transit hubs seem
   like a pleasurable life experience,
3) conferences showcasing talks indistinguishable from sponsored content, or
4) conferences which overcharge and underdeliver, please continue reading.

t2 has throughout its history offered speakers and guests an intimate
atmosphere where ideas can be exchanged with fellow hax0rs. We take pride in
treating speakers as guests of honor - presenting a talk at t2 and visiting
Helsinki is something we want you to both remember and enjoy.

Finland is a country, which has pioneered things such as the first web browser
with a GUI[1], has no embassy in New Zealand and has introduced the world some
minor tech stuff such as Linux and SMS. In case your bucket list contains BDSM
with complete strangers, just submit a paper, come to Helsinki and ask for
Finnish sauna [2].

While Helsinki cannot offer you sunshine, resorts or palm trees, we can
compensate that with cold weather, eternal winter, darkness, and snow if you're
lucky. According to the latest OECD statistics[3], Finland has as many metal
bands as France has wine producers, but more metal subgenres than there are
wine regions.

t2'16 offers you an audience with a taste for technical security presentations
containing original content. This is your chance to showcase the latest
research and lessons in offensive offense, enterprise compromise, ambiguous
APT-attribution, nation state lulz, anti-anti-anti-forensics, blacklisted
research, crafting digital munitions, defense strategy and tactics that
actually work, tampering anti-tamper units, competitive barbecue and/or doping
in professional sports. Topics outside the listed categories are accepted as
long as you promise to share love and happiness.

The advisory board will be reviewing submissions until 2016-07-01.
First come, first served. Submissions will not be returned.

ps. If you are one of those dedicated hardcore t2 visitors and want to ensure
    your place in the audience even before speakers are announced..
    The registration is now open!
