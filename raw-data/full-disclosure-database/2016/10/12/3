Subject: [FD] New OpenSSL double-free and invalid free vulnerabilities in
	X509 parsing

These vulnerabilities were found in the latest OpenSSL (1.1.0b).
Triggering these vulnerabilities is not trivial -- they rely on memory
shortages (malloc/realloc failures) or failing to acquire a thread
lock while the X509 data is being parsed. Possibly exploitation can be
achieved by exploiting a memory leak/accumulation (such as the
recently discovered CVE-2016-6304). Proof of concepts and more
extensive commentary at the link below.
