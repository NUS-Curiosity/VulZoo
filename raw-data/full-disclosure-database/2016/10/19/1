Subject: [FD] CVE-2016-8600 dotCMS - CAPTCHA bypass by reusing valid code

Title: CVE-2016-8600 dotCMS - CAPTCHA bypass by reusing valid code
Credit: Elar Lang / https://security.elarlang.eu
Vulnerability: CAPTCHA bypass by re-using last loaded valid CAPTCHA code
Vulnerable version: before 3.6.0
CVE: CVE-2016-8600
Vendor/Product: dotCMS (http://dotcms.com/)


# Background and description

It's possible to re-use valid CAPTCHA code in dotCMS framework.

Last loaded CAPTCHA code is stored in session and CAPTCHA code is
renewed only when you reload image /Captcha.jpg from server. But if
you don't reload it, you can use previous valid CAPTCHA code till your
session is alive.

Problem was first announced with CRLF/Email Header Injection:

* link2: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/May/69


# Preconditions

Attacker must first fill manually valid CAPTCHA code.

No other pre-conditions - no authentication or authorization needed.


# Proof-of-Concept

You need to detect from a dotCMS server:
* valid CAPTCHA by loading /Captcha.jpg
* your session id (JSESSIONID) value

If some form asks CAPTCHA, you can use those 2 values for sending valid data.

Proof-of-Concept with a detailed description is available at:
