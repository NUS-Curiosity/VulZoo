Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Realestate v3.00.50 content management system.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes on the client-side of the vulnerable module or service.

A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the search engine. The web vulnerability could allows an attacker 
to execute javascript in the web-browser of the user or administrator to compromise session credentials. The injection point of the  
vulnerability is in the `Add` function with the `property_name`, `property_price` and `post_code` parameters. The execution point 
occurs in the the search module of the content management system. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector of the 
issue is located to the client-side of the web-application.

The security risk of the web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.1. 
Exploitation of the client-side vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in non-persistent phishing, session hijacking, non-persistent external redirect 
to malicious sources and client-side manipulation of affected or connected web module context.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Add (Input)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] property_name
[+] post_code
[+] property_price


Proof of Concept (PoC):
