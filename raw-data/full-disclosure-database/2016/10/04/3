Technical Details & Description:
================================
The FaceDancer allows a computer (or "host") to masquerade as a USB "device" to communicate with other Hosts. One USB ports connects to the 
victim (or host) the other connects to a development machine. Python can then be used to send USB commands in real time.This allows passive 
monitoring and injecting it into the USB bus.
 
Think of this as doing the same thing the Bus Pirate does for SPI and i2c, except that it’s doing it on the USB protocol itself. This way you 
can feel your way through all of the road-bumps of developing a new device (or testing an exploit) without the need to continually compile 
and flash your hardware.
 
Our Vulnerability Lab Team has developed a pluggable case for FaceDancer with cutomized STL files configuration downloadable and can be modified 
with desired configuration. The USB protocol requires that anything with USB  declare itself as either a "device" or "host". "Hosts" are computers 
and other "big" things. "Devices" are iPod, iPads, USB thumb drives and other "small" accessory-like things. (If you are familiar with USB OTG 
cables, then you probably understand a bit about this already. If you ever want a USB "host" to pretend to be a USB "device", you need special 
hardware. The FaceDancer 2 is that specific called hardware to use for thus typ of interaction on security tests. Vulnerability Laboratory core 
research team has added more functionality to Facedancer with a new secure case to easly manage the device during an active pentest.
