Product: Aura Video Converter - Software 1.6.3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local dll injection vulnerability has been discovered in the official Aura Video Converter v1.6.3 software.
The issue allows local attackers to inject code to vulnerable dynamic link libraries to compromise the process 
or to gain higher system access privileges. Thus allows a local attacker to compromise the system process of the
affected software to followup with manipulations.

Manual steps to reproduce the local vulnerability ...
1. Compile dll
2. Rename the dynamic link library to nvcuvenc.dll 
3. Copy nvcuvenc.dll to C:Program FilesAura4YouAura Video ConverterAuraVideoConv.exe
4. Launch AuraVideoConv.exe
5. Now the MessageBox executes!
