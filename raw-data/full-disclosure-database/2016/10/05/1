2016-10-05:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
CMCM
Product: Clean Master - Software (Client) 1.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue in the official Clean Master v1.0 software client. The issue allows authorized 
but unprivileged local users to execute arbitrary code with system privileges on the active system. The attack vector of the issue is local.

The security risk of the software vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.4. 
Exploitation of the software vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account with restricted access and without user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in system process compromise and further manipulation or exploitation to compromise the 
local computer operating system.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The issue can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account or network access and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
