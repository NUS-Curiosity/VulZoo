Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):

Product: Flash Operator Panel 2 - User Control Panel (Web-Application) CentOS 2.31.03, Debian 2.31.03 & RPI-ARM 2.30.03


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A script code inject and cross site web vulnerability has been discovered in the Flash Operator Panel v2.31.03.
The issue allows an attacker to inject own malicious script code to the application-side of the vulnerable module.

The vulnerability is located in all the csv file contact input parameters. Remote attackers are able to generate a malicious 
csv contact file with malicious included script code to manipulate the contacts module on import. The attack requires the 
exchange of the contacts csv file during the import/export. The encode of the import and export is insecure performed, thus 
results in a persistent execution in the contacts module of the fop2 user control panel. The request method to inject is POST 
and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the web-application. The execute occurs each time the admin visits 
the main contacts module via settings.

The security risk of the issue is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.6. 
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, session hijacking, persistent 
external redirect to malicious sources and persistent manipulation of affected or connected web module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Modul(s):
				[+] Contacts - Import CSV

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id
				[+] firstname
				[+] lastname
				[+] company
				[+] address
				[+] phone1
				[+] phone2
				[+] email
				[+] picture


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The script code inject web vulnerability can be exploited by the local import function of the web-application with local user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the contact context parameters on import.
Filter and parse as well the output location were the execution point occurs and disallow special chars to prevent the execute.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the csv file contacts script code inject vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.6)
