Subject: Re: [FD] Critical Vulnerability in Ubiquiti UniFi

The impression I get from Tim Pham's emails is that the 'Unify Manager' is doing some behind-the-scenes tunnelling, and bringing the Mongo interface from the server to the client (Eg, Mac or Windows device) and you are then able to connect to localhost (on the client) which tunnels through to the server.

However, after much searching, I am unable to locate this application. Googling insinuates that it is this (unreleased) software - https://www.ubnt.com/enterprise/software/

Subject: Re: [FD] Critical Vulnerability in Ubiquiti UniFi

I attempted private contact with Tim Pham and via email 12+ hours ago, but received no response since then.

I've spent some time trying to reproduce the reported vulnerability and have had no success. It certainly doesn't help that the steps to reproduce it are so poorly described or documented.
Without better documentation of the exploit, it seems impossible to determine if the report is just mis-informed, blatantly false, or if perhaps there's some step/process I don't understand or am missing.

In every attempt I've made the binding of MongoBD to 127.0.0.1 is effective and non-local connection attempts are refused, as one would expect.
A swift response from Prosec Networks [prosec-networks.com] would be most helpful.
