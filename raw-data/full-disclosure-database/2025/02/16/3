# Exploit Title: Netgear Router Administrative Web Interface Lacks
Transport Encryption By Default
# Date: 02-13-2025
# Exploit Author: Ryan Delaney
# Author Contact: ryan.delaney@...sp.org
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.netgear.com
# Version: Netgear C7800 Router, F/W 6.01.07, possibly others
# Tested on: Netgear C7800 Router, F/W 6.01.07
# CVE: CVE-2022-41545

The administrative web interface of a Netgear C7800 Router running firmware
version 6.01.07 (and possibly others) authenticates users via basic
authentication, with an HTTP header containing a base64 value of the
plaintext username and password. Because the web server also does not
utilize transport security by default, this renders the administrative
credentials vulnerable to eavesdropping by an adversary during every
authenticated request made by a client to the router over a WLAN, or a LAN,
should the adversary be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
