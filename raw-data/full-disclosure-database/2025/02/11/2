CloudAware Security Advisory

CVE-2024-55447: Potential PII leak and incorrect access control in 
Paxton Net2 software


========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
Insecure backend database in the Paxton Net2 software.
Possible leaking of PII incorrect access control.
Access cards can be cloned without physical access to the original card.
Audit log integrity compromised.
No physical access to computer running Paxton Net2 is required.

========================================================================
Product
========================================================================
* Paxton Net2Â  (all current versions)

========================================================================
Detailed description
========================================================================
By exploiting MSSQL single user mode it is possible to gain 
administrator rights to the Net2 database.
In this database plaintext PIN codes for building entrance can be found 
and changed. It is also possible to add
users to the system and enable/disable users in the system. By reading 
tables in the MSSQL table PII is leaked.
Apart from the PII in plaintext in the database, card data is also 
stored unencrypted in the database.
Using the data in the database cards can be cloned without having the 
original card if a Mifare or multi-protocol
reader is used for building entrance.
The above vulnerabilities are also relevant for the integrity of the 
audit logs in Paxton Net2 software. These audit
logs should never be used as forensic data. Not only is it possible 
cards are cloned, but audit log data can be
manipulated directly in the database tables.
In order to gain access local access to the computer running Net2 is 
necessary, but this can also be over a network
using e.g. Anydesk which makes physical access not necessary.
The vendor has not acknowledged the vulnerability after contact. There 
is no fix planned.

========================================================================
Solution
========================================================================
As the vendor has not acknowledged the vulnerability there is no 
effective remediation for this vulnerability.
The most effective measure at this moment is closely monitoring who has 
local access to the machine running the Net2
software.

========================================================================
Mitigation
========================================================================
There is no known effective mitigation. Limiting who has local access to 
the machine running the Net2 software seems
the most effective measure. Card cloning can be mitigated by not using
