Subject: [FD] ChatGPT AI finds "security concern" (XSS) in DeepSeek's code

Summary:  On 2025-02-09 ChatGPT AI found "security concern" (XSS) in
DeepSeek's AI python code.

Background:

Consider the simple coding question (Q):

Write Python CGI which takes as an argument NAME and outputs: "Hello NAME".

First page and results on google for "python CGI" return for me
tutorials, which are flawed and textbook examples of the cross site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This is a "knowledge chain attack"
which applies to training AI bots.

Timeline:
2023: ChatGPT writes textbook vulnerable code for (Q) [1]
2025-01-28:  DeepSeek fails (Q) too the same way

2025-02-09:  We gave to ChatGPT the buggy DeepSeek's solution for
review of python code and ChatGPT wrote:

===
Security Concern: HTML Injection

The script directly inserts user input into the response without
sanitization, making it vulnerable to HTML injection (e.g., someone
could pass ?NAME=<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>).
===

Observe that the review includes exploit too, and the current standard
term XSS is not used ("HTML injection" was in the 90's).

ChatGPT gave the improved code:
# Get the query parameters
form = cgi.FieldStorage()

# Extract and sanitize the 'NAME' parameter
name = html.escape(form.getvalue('NAME', 'World'))

While correct from security point of view, this code breaks special
characters in input for general web apps AFAICT.

AI bots training each other appear scary for me.

Related rant:

This might be a joke:

Humans built a super AI and the first question was: "Is there god?".
The answer was: "Since now there is". (In Bulgarian: Хората направили
супер изкуствен интелект и първият въпрос бил: "Има ли бог".
Отговорът: "Вече има")

From Wikipeia on Singularity [2]

The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a
hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth
becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable
consequences for human civilization.
