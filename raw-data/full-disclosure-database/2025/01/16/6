  When using the ListCategories AMI action, it was possible to traverse
  upwards through the directories to files outside of the configured
  configuration directory. This action is now restricted to the configured
  directory and an error will now be returned if the specified file is
  outside of this limitation.

  Resolves: #GHSA-33x6-fj46-6rfh

  UserNote: The ListCategories AMI action now restricts files to the
  configured configuration directory.
