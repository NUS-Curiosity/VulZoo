Subject: [FD] Call for Papers: RAID 2015

Dear colleagues,

I would like to announce the following CFP.
Please kindly consider submitting to this conference.

This year's RAID will take in marvelous Kyoto, Japan.

-----------------------------------------
RAID 2015
Kyoto, Japan, November 2-4, 2015
http://www.raid2015.org/

Call for Papers
---------------
The 18th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and
Defenses
(RAID 2015) aims at bringing together leading researchers and practitioners
from
academia, government, and industry to discuss novel research contributions
related to any area of computer and information security.

Papers on all topics related to intrusion detection and prevention are
within
scope, including papers on:

Malware and botnet analysis, detection, and mitigation
Smartphone and other embedded systems security
Network & active defenses
Web application security
New attacks against computers and networks
Denial-of-Service Attacks
Insider attack detection
Formal models, analysis, and standards
Deception systems and honeypots
Vulnerability analysis
Secure software development
Machine learning for security
Computer security visualization techniques
Network exfiltration
Online money laundering and underground economy
Hardware vulnerabilities
Binary analysis and reverse engineering
Digital forensics
Security and Privacy
Intrusion detection and prevention

Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We
encourage papers that bridge research in different communities. We also
welcome
experience papers that clearly articulate lessons learnt and papers that
refute
prior published results.

Submission Guideline
--------------------
Reviewing will be double-blind, meaning the authors' identities will be
hidden
from the reviewers. There will not be a response/rebuttal phase. RAID 2015
will
follow policies for plagiarism, submission confidentiality, reviewer
anonymity,
and prior and concurrent paper submission that mirror those of the ACM (see
http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/).

RAID 2015 invites two types of submissions:

1. *Full papers* papers presenting mature and novel research results. Papers
accepted by the Program Committee will be presented at RAID 2015 and
included in
the Symposium's proceedings published by Springer in its Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series. Each paper must include an abstract and a list of
keywords, and must not exceed 20 pages in total length, formatted in
LNCS-style
and including the bibliography and any appendices. If needed, we will grant
accepted papers upto 2 additional pages to address the reviewers' comments
adequately.
*Note*: unlike in previous years, the RAID 2015 review procedure is *double
blind*. All papers should be appropriately anonymized. In other words:
leave the
author names off the paper, refer to your own prior work in the third
person, do
not give the paper a title that corresponds to a publicly available
technical
report, etc. Papers that are not anonymized will not be reviewed.

2. *Poster abstracts* describing works in progress, or innovative ideas not
mature enough to be presented as a full paper. The poster track will
provide an
opportunity to present early-stage work and receive feedback from the
community,
especially on thought-provoking or controversial work, approaches, or ideas
from
students. We also welcome submissions of posters corresponding to papers
presented at RAID-affiliated workshops. Posters are submitted for review in
the
form of an extended abstract that has to be formatted in LNCS-style and not
exceed 1 page in length, with a PDF draft of the proposed poster included as
page 2 of the submission. In addition, poster titles should always start
with
the phrase "Poster Abstract:". Accepted posters will be presented at the
symposium in a separate session. Authors of accepted full papers are also
encouraged to submit and present posters of their paper in the poster
session.
*The board where posters will be fastened is in portrait mode; height:
1,60m,
width: 1,20m.*

For accepted papers, at least one of the authors must attend the conference
to
present the paper. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that
has
already been published elsewhere or is submitted in parallel to a journal
or to
any other conference or workshop with proceedings. Simultaneous submission
of
the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work,
and
plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific and
technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on
the
recommendation of the program chair, take action against authors who have
committed them. Further questions on the submission process may be sent to
the
program chairs.

Authors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might meet these
guidelines, or with specific questions about the guidelines, are welcome to
contact the program committee co-chairs: raid2015-chairs [at] few.vu.nl.
