Subject: [FD] Safari Address Spoofing (How We Got It)

Proof of concept:
http://www.deusen.co.uk/items/iwhere.9500182225526788/
It works on fully patched versions of iOS and OS X.
How it works:
Just keep trying to load the web page of target domain.

How We Got It:
Safari changes address bar to new URL,
BEFORE new content is loaded.

We like it. We read it.

Kind Regards,
