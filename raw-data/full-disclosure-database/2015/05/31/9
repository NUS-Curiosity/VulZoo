Subject: [FD] XML Injection vulnerability in multiple Hikvision IP cameras
	and DVR

Hello list!

There is XML Injection vulnerability in multiple Hikvision IP cameras and 
DVR. Earlier I wrote about Abuse of Functionality and Brute Force 
vulnerabilities in multiple Hikvision IP cameras and DVR 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Mar/161).

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

Hikvision
http://www.hikvision.com

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next models with different versions of firmware: 
Hikvision DS-2CD2412F-IW, DS-2CD2412F-I, DS-7204HWI-SH, DS-2CD2412F-IW, 
DS-2CD2012-I, DS-2CD2232-I5, DS-7108HWI-SH, DS-2CD7153-E, DS-2CD2132-I, 
DS-2DF5284-A. Since summer I found multiple models of Hikvision cameras and 
regularly find new cameras with similar vulnerabilities.

Hikvision fixed XML Injection in firmware for DVR/NVR in V3.2.0 and for IPC 
in V5.2.0.

Details:

XML Injection (WASC-23):

http://site/ISAPI/%3C/requestURL%3E%3Clink%3Ehttp://site%3C/link%3E%3CrequestURL%3E/

It can be used for XML Injection and XSS attacks.

I found this and other web cameras during summer to watch terrorists 
activities in Donetsk and Lugansks regions of Ukraine and also I took under 
control web cameras in Russia 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2015-May/009101.html).

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/7640/).
