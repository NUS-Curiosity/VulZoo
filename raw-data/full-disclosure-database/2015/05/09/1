Subject: [FD] Capstone disassembly framework 3.0.3 is out!

Greetings,

Version 3.0.3 of Capstone disassembly framework if officially out!

I would like to dedicate this release to Prof. Yoshiyasu Takefuji, my
former advisor, who is turning 60 years old this year 2015!

For those who do not know, Capstone is an open source multi-arch,
multi-platform disassembly engine. Find more about our project at

- Some bug fixes for X86, Arm & Sparc.
- Fixed some issues for Python & Cython bindings.
- Support to embed Capstone into Mac OS X kernel extensions.
- Fixed compilation issue with older C compilers such as GCC 4.6.
