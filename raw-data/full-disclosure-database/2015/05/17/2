Subject: [FD] ftpmap 0.5 Release Announcement

Heiy list!

I am happy to announce FTP-Map 0.5.

since 2002 the project was dead, until now (:
i&#39;m continue the development, I started FTP-Map 0.5 from scratch with extra code from FTP-Map 0.4

some new features:
1. anonymous login check.
2. ftpmap_detect_version_by_banner (If it&#39;s not work will still have fingerprints (: )
3. ftpmap_findexploit() - find exploit for the FTP Server  in exploit-db.
4. brute force for weak passwords.

I hope the community will contribute code/ideas for this project.

Source code of FTP-Map 0.5:

Thanks!
