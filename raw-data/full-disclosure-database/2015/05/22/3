(favored) or Hungarian. For speakers only speaking Hungarian, a
professional translator will on the fly translate it to English.

As a speaker you can have either a 20-minutes or 40-minutes slot to present
your topic.

[ == Hello workshop == ]

We all know there is a huge difference between observing and achieving.
Real knowledge grows from popping your first shell. Thus in order to help

   SQL injections


A hello workshop has the following requirements:

   -

   participants should acquire a definite and useful piece of knowledge;
   -

   participants bring their own equipment you should calculate with the
   diversity;
   -

   a workshop will not have more than 16 attendees;
   -

   it should fit into 20 plus 20 minutes (observing then executing) from
   preparation to take-aways;
   -

   one workshop will be held approx. 3 times during the two days
