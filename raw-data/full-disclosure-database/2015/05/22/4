Subject: [FD]  0day Mailbird XSS

I created inquiry about this issue to their support and got two replies:

Leonardo Santoso, May 11, 12:50:
We are investigating this issue right now, I'll let you know once we know more
about it. Thank you for notifying us about it.

Leonardo Santoso, May 21, 17:50: This issue should be fix in the latest version,
please update your Mailbird.

Latest version after downloading the application is 2.0.16.0 dated as May 15,
which is still vulnerable to this cross-site scripting vulnerability. Nothing in
changelog about this case.

Mitigation: use different application :)
