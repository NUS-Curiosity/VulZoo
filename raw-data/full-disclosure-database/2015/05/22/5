Subject: [FD]  Hue 3.7.1 Local Privilege Escalation

Hue project responded in two different messages:

"""
This is not changed, the Hue project provides this command as a helper,                                                               
this is up to the packaging distribution to change the permissions of/move                                                            
the files accordingly.                        
"""

"""
Actually, the root privilege was only needed in Hue 2 when using the Shell                                                            
app, there is no Shell app anymore since Hue 3 so indeed we should remove                                                             
the part warning about not being run as root
