Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 5

Part 5 is up. In this and the next several parts we start analyzing
the structure of Netgear R6200 firmware updates. We switch over to the
HTTP daemon because it's less broken and a little easier to analyze
than upnpd.

The overall goal is to reverse engineer the firmware format so we can
generate a malicious firmware image to use when exploiting the
SetFirmware SOAP action described in parts 1-4.

Binary patching, emulating with QEMU, and debugging with IDA Pro are
recommended for the next several installments. Here is some
recommended reading to help get that set up:
- Remote Debugging with QEMU and IDA Pro

- Patching, Emulating, and Debugging a Netgear Embedded Web Server

If you missed my post to Full Disclosure where I introduced the
series, here's that:

As always I welcome feedback via email or Twitter. I'm @zcutlip.

I hope you enjoy it.

Cheers!
Zach
