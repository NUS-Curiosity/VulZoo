Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a persistent input validation vulnerability in the official iClassSchedule v1.6 iOS & Android mobile web-application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-05-13: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Tel.Net srl
Product: iClassSchedule - iOS & Android Mobile Web Application 1.6 iOS and 4.6 Android


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side validation vulnerability has been discovered in the official iClassSchedule v1.6 iOS & Android mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject own script code as payload to the application-side of the vulnerable service function or module.

The vulnerability is located in the `Aula (name input)` values of the vulnerable `iClass Calender` module. Local attackers are able to manipulate 
the `Aula name` input to compromise the `Calender Index` module. The execution point of the script code occurs on the application-side in the 
listing module by the manipulated name context field. The Apple iOS and Google Android mobile application versions are affected by the vulnerability.

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.4.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires a privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities result in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] Aula

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] name

Affected Module(s):
					[+] iClass Calender Events Context (App Index)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with physical device access and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

1. Install the mobile application to your iOS or Android device
2. Open the application and add a new entry to the iclass calender index
3. Inject to the Aula name value your own script code (payload) for testings
4. Save the entry and move back to the iclass calender index of the app
5. The code executes because of the wrong encoding in the calender itself.
Note: Export and Exchange of malicious context is possible!
6. Successful reproduce of the security vulnerability!


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable name value in the iclass calender module.
Restrict the name input and disallow usage of special chars to prevent persistent cross site scripting attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the name value is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.4)
