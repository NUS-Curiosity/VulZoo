*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
phpwind web application has a computer cyber security bug problem. It can
be exploited by Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards (URL Redirection)
attacks. This could allow a user to create a specially crafted URL, that if
clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site to
an arbitrary web site of the attacker's choosing. Such attacks are useful
as the crafted URL initially appear to be a web page of a trusted site.
This could be leveraged to direct an unsuspecting user to a web page
containing attacks that target client side software such as a web browser
or document rendering programs.

Several other similar products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by
some other bug hunter researchers before. phpwind has patched some of them.
The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion
of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers,
news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other
security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to
decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The full disclosure
movement has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their
products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them.
Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!
It also publishes suggestions, advisories, solutions details related to
Open Redirect vulnerabilities and cyber intelligence recommendations.


*(2.1) *The first programming code flaw occurs at "&url" parameter in
"/goto.php?" page.
