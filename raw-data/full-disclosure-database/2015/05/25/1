*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
SITEFACT web application has a computer cyber security bug problem. It can
be exploited by XSS attacks. This may allow a remote attacker to create a
specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a
user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser
and the server.

Several other similar products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by
some other bug hunter researchers before. SITEFACT has patched some of
them. The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed
discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as
tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs
from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers'
right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The full
disclosure movement has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure
their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide
them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated
here! It also publishes suggestions, advisories, solutions details related
to XSS vulnerabilities and cyber intelligence recommendations.
