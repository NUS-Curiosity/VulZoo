Subject: [FD] SAP vulnerabilities highlighted in many reports such as HP
 Cyber Risk Report 2015

Recently, HP published their yearly Cyber Risk Report 2015 
(http://info.hpenterprisesecurity.com/LP_460192_Cross_CyberriskFullReport_0315_gate 
).  Having many typical things spotlighted in this report such as 
growing number of ATM and IOT Security buzz you can find everywhere, 
ERPScan found some parts which are relevant to business application 
security. We have prepared deep article from this research, add all 
details and also collected information from different sources about 
growing number of SAP vulnerabilities and recent initiatives in helping 
SAP users to avoid issues (new security guidelines).
