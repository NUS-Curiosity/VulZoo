*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
MT.VERNON MEDIA web application has a computer security bug problem. It can
be exploited by stored HTML Injection attacks. Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) injection, also sometimes referred to as virtual defacement, is an
attack on a user made possible by an injection vulnerability in a web
application. When an application does not properly handle user supplied
data, an attacker can supply valid HTML, typically via a parameter value,
and inject their own content into the page. This attack is typically used
in conjunction with some form of social engineering, as the attack is
exploiting a code-based vulnerability and a user's trust.

Several other MT.VERNON MEDIA products 0-day vulnerabilities have been
found by some other bug hunter researchers before. MT.VERNON MEDIA has
patched some of them. BugScan is the first community-based scanner,
experienced five code refactoring. It has redefined the concept of the
scanner provides sources for the latest info-sec news, tools, and
advisories. It also publishs suggestions, advisories, solutions details
related to HTML vulnerabilities.


*(2.1) *The first programming code flaw occurs at "&category" parameter in
"gallery.php?" page.
