Subject: [FD] pydio vulnerabilities

Does anyone have any info on the two pydio vulnerabilities announced today?

They have been given CVE-2015-3431 and CVE-2015-3432 but a search on mitre
just says those are reserved.

There is no information or explanation about what the issues are.

Thanks for any info anyone has.
