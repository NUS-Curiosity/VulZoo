Subject: Re: [FD] KL-001-2015-002 : Piriform CCleaner Wiped Filename Recovery

Maybe I missed something, but why is this a vulnerability? This behavior is
directly caused by NTFS. The way information is stored in the MFT and in a
INDEX_ALLOCATION (for large directories) will cause this problem to any
secure delete program.

IIRC, if your file is located in a large directory, the records (mainly the
FILENAME attribute) for this directory are not hold in a resident attribute
(INDEX_ROOT - 0x90) in the MFT, they are hold in a non-resident attribute
(INDEX_ALLOCATION - 0xA0) somewhere on some cluster(s) on the disk. Those
records are organized into B-trees. Meaning that any modification to a
filename will result in a rebalancing of the B-Tree. This can leave the
original filename (complete or partial) in between records in the index on
the disk because INDEX can have free spaces in them.

Even SDelete from System Internal can't handle this (taken from
Microsoft[1]) :

*The reason that SDelete does not securely delete file names when cleaning
disk free space is that deleting them would require direct manipulation of
directory structures. Directory structures can have free space containing
deleted file names, but the free directory space is not available for
allocation to other files. Hence, SDelete has no way of allocating this
free space so that it can securely overwrite it.*


Am I wrong?
