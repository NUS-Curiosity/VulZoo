Subject: [FD] New release of,STONIX OS hardening tool

STONIX is an operating system configuration hardening tool for Unix and Unix
like (e.g. Linux) operating systems. This tool implements a hybrid of
guidance from NSA, DISA STIGs, USGCB and the CIS. To as great of a degree as
possible each guidance element for each platform is evaluated on the other
platforms for applicability and applied if possible.
   
Repository at: https://github.com/CSD-Public/stonix

The STONIX program is a modular codebase implemented in Python (currently
using the 2.x dialect, a port to Python 3.0 is in future planning). Python
was selected due to it being part of the default install on all target
platforms. The program is primarily a command-line utility but there is a
robust GUI built in. The GUI is implemented in PyQt. Many platform packages
will not express a dependency on PyQt due to the GUI's optional nature.
   
At the present time (revision 0.8.16) the following platforms are used for
development and test: Red Hat Enterprise Linux v6 and v7. Fedora Linux v20 &
21. OpenSuSE 12.2. Debian (stable). Ubuntu 14.04. CentOS v7. Apple OS X v10.9
and v 10.10. Close derivatives of these Operating Systems should be well
supported, more distant cousins less so.

STONIX uses a Major.Minor.Release versioning scheme.
   
At present STONIX is in an Alpha, not feature complete stage. Every attempt
is made to ensure that the code is production ready, but the features are not
yet complete and there will be functionality changes in future revisions.

When reporting issues in STONIX please fully document the specific
functionality that is causing a problem. We will likely need sample
configuration files that cause the section of STONIX to have issues. A copy
of the debug output is also very valuable.
   
Report your issue via the STONIX github issue tracker.

We encourage reporting, and hope to attract contributors.

Regards,
-Roy Nielsen
