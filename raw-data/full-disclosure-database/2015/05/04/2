Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Cisco
Product: Newsroom - Web Application (Online Service) 2015 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Cisco Newsroom online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions data by client-side manipulated cross site requests.

The vulnerability is located in the `articleId` value of the cisco newsroom service module. Remote attackers are able to inject own script codes to the 
vulnerable GET method request of thenewsroom module.  The attack vector of the vulnerability is located on the client-side of the newsroom service web-application. 
The request method to inject the script code on client-side is `GET`. The injection point of the issue is the vulnerable `articleId` value in the newsroom and 
the script code execution point is located in the exception-handling module page. The exception-handling displays the input without secure encoding which results 
in the client-side script code execution.

The security risk of the non-persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.4.
Exploitation of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability requires low user interaction (click) and no privileged application user account. 
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects and non-persistent manipulation 
of affected or connected service modules.

Request Method(s):
						[+] GET

Vulnerable Service(s):
						[+] Cisco Newsroom

Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] Newsroom

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] articleId

Affected Section(s):
						[+] Exception-handling (Cisco Newsroom Webserver)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account and with low or medium user interaction.
