| IPsec-Tools is vulnerable to a 0-day exploit that I made available yesterday. It is a null dereference crash in racoon in gssapi.c. It requires HAVE_GSSAPI to be set, which is a configuration option. The impact is a denial of service against the IKE daemon. Because IPsec is critical infrastructure and this attack requires two UDP packets, it deserves a medium rating. This denial of service violates the premise that IPsec's security is built upon. More information about the impact can be found on my website linked below.

| If you're running IPsec-Tools, replace it sensibly as soon as possible. The reason this exploit is being released without patch on full disclosure is because the authors have apparently abandoned the software.

| The vulnerability:
| 
| racoon/gssapi.c:205:static int gssapi_init(struct ph1handle *iph1)
| 
| 	if (iph1->rmconf->proposal->gssid != NULL) {
| 
| The exploit is available on my website:
| https://www.altsci.com/ipsec/ipsec-tools-sa.html

The fix is trivial and does not seem to affect the preshared key
authentication method. Looks to me like a simple DoS attack that
does not have any additional impact.
