While we finally did get CVE-2000-0854 the overdue attention, we apparently
didn't promote this enough:

(presented at Source Boston in 2012). So now you'll have to do it - good
luck :)

BTW, Stefan, soon you'll be able to create your own patches for these, and
many other bugs, with http://0patch.com. You're welcome.

Cheers,
Mitja
