Product: Western Union - Web Application (Locations) 2015 Q4


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A POST inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Western Union Union online service web-application.
A vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script codes on the client-side of the affected web-application.

The vulnerability is located in the `page` value of the `location_search.php` file. Remote attackers are able to inject own 
malicious script codes to the client-side of the affected web-application. The request method to inject is POST and the attack 
vector is client-side. The attacker inject the payload in the page value to execute the code in the results page of the location 
search module. 

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.2. 
Exploitation of the non-persistent web vulnerability requires a no privilege web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in session hijacking, persistent phishings attacks, persistent external redirect and malware loads or persistent 
manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
					[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] Location Search

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] page

Affected Domain(s):
					[+] location_search.php


Proof of Concept (PoC):
