Remote


Severity Level:

Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side POST inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the Wordpress Content Text Slider v6.8 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the online-service.

The vulnerability is located in the `page` value parameter of the `options-general.php` file. Remote attackers are able to inject 
via POST method request to the `Title` or `Message/Content` input fields. After that the attacker is able to execute the code by 
usage of the insert details button. The execution of the malicious injected script code occurs in the `All popups` module when 
processing to request manually. An attacker is able to steal the admin cookie by usage of a moderator account. The attack vector 
is persistent on the application-side and the request method to inject is POST.

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires no privilege web-application user account and only low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in persistent phishing, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.
