Subject: [FD] Back to 28: Grub2 Authentication Bypass 0-Day [CVE-2015-8370]

Hi everyone,

A vulnerability in Grub2 (Back to 28) has been found. Versions from 1.98
(December, 2009) to 2.02 (December, 2015) are affected. The vulnerability can be 
exploited under certain circumstances, allowing local attackers to bypass any 
kind of authentication (plain or hashed passwords). And so, the attacker may 
take control of the computer.

Regards,
Hector Marco & Ismael Ripoll.
