Subject: [FD] Executable installers are vulnerable^WEVIL (case 11): Nmap
	<7.01 and Nmap-WinPcap <4.13

Hi @ll,

the executable installers of Nmap-7.00 and prior versions (see
<https://nmap.org/download.html>) as well as WinPcap-Nmap-4.12 and
prior versions (included in nmap-7.00-win32.zip and prior versions)
are built with the vulnerable Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
(NSIS) (see <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Dec/32> for
details).


These executable installers are vulnerable and allow arbitrary
(remote) code execution and escalation of privilege via the well-
known attacks already published in the advisory regarding NSIS and
the advisory <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Nov/101> titled
Mitigations for "carpet bombing" alias "directory poisoning" attacks against executable installers.


Nmap-7.01 and WinPcap-Nmap-4.13 have been released and fix these
vulnerabilities.


stay tuned
Stefan Kanthak
