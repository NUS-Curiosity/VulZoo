Subject: [FD] [CFP] Speak About Your Cyberwar at PHDays VI


​Positive Hack Days VI, the international forum on practical information security, opens Call For Papers (http://www.phdays.com/call_for_papers/​). Our international program comittee  (http://www.phdays.com/program/review-board/) consisting of very competent and experienced experts will consider every application, whether from a novice or a recognized expert in information security, and select the best proposals.

Now, more than ever before, cybersecurity specialists are being asked to stop sitting on the fence and choose a side — competitive intelligence vs DLP systems; security system developers  vs targeted cyberattacks; cryptographers vs reverse engineers; hackers vs security operations centers. A new concept (http://www.phdays.com/press/news/43550/) of PHDays VI is designed to show what the current vibe is in information security.

We want researchers to speak about the real dangerous threats and possible consequences. We also expect developers and integrators to give real answers to these threats rather than  to talk about empowering security technologies. Come and share your experience at PHDays VI in Moscow, May 17 and 18, 2016. 

Your topic can revolve around any modern infosec field: new targeted attacks against SCADA, new threats to medical equipment, vulnerabilities of online  government services, unusual techniques to protect mobile apps, antisocial engineering in social networks, or what psychological constitution SOC experts have. In addition, this year, we are planning to discuss IS software design, development tools, and SSDL  principles.

Our key criteria is that your research should be unique and offer a fresh perspective on hacking, modern information technologies, and the role they play in our lives.

If you have something interesting or surprising to share, but none of the formats are suitable for your participation, please apply anyway and be sure we will consider your work. 

The first stage of CFP ends  on January 31, 2016. Apply now — the number of final reports is limited.

In 2015, the forum brought together 3,500 participants. In 2016, it is expected to see 4,000 attendees: information security leaders, CIO and CISO of the  world's largest companies, top managers of giant banks, industrial and oil and gas producing enterprises, telecoms, and IT vendors, representatives from different government departments. 

Positive Hack Days featured a variety of distinguished participants including Bruce Schneier (the legendary cryptography expert), Whitfield Diffie (one of the inventors of asymmetric  cryptography), Mohd Noor Amin (IMPACT, UN), Natalya Kasperskaya (CEO of InfoWatch), Travis Goodspeed (a reverse engineer and wireless enthusiast from the U.S.), Tao Wan (the founder of China Eagle Union), Nick Galbreath (Vice-President of IPONWEB), Mushtaq  Ahmed (Emirates Airline), Marc Heuse (the developer of Hydra, Amap, and THC-IPV6), Karsten Nohl (a specialist in GSM engineering), Donato Ferrante and Luigi Auriemma (famous SCADA experts from Italy), and Alexander Peslyak (the creator of the password cracking  tool John the Ripper).
