Subject: [FD] Executable installers are vulnerable^WEVIL (case 10): McAfee
	Security Scan Plus, WebAdvisor and CloudAV (Beta)

Hi @ll,

several McAfee "security" products, most notably their Security Scan
Plus (see <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/226> for a
previous advisory) which Adobe pushes to unsuspecting users of Adobe
Reader and Flash Player, are offered as executable installers built
with the vulnerable Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) (see
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Dec/32> for details).


These executable installers are vulnerable and allow arbitrary
(remote) code execution and escalation of privilege via the well-
known attacks already published in the advisory regarding NSIS and
the advisory <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Nov/101> titled
Mitigations for "carpet bombing" alias "directory poisoning" attacks against executable installers


For details specific to Intel's/McAfee's products and their
vulnerabilities see Intel's Security Bulletin published today:
<https://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?lc=1033&id=TS102462>


stay tuned
Stefan Kanthak
