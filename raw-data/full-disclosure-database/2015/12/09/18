2. Overview

CVSS

Medium 4.3 AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description

There is a persistent XSS vulnerability when leaving comments. It requires the
admin to hover over a link to trigger the injected code.

This issue can lead to the injection of JavaScript keyloggers, or the bypassing
of CSRF protection. In this case, this may lead to code execution.

The issue has been partially fixed in version 2.6.0. However, it was still
possible to inject a style attribute, making XSS in older browsers possible.
This has been fixed in version 2.6.1.

3. Proof of Concept


1. Create a comment, as comment text use:
    comment" onmouseover=alert(1) foo="
2. In the sidebar, hover over the comment to trigger the XSS.

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 2.6.1:

http://redaxscript.com/files/releases/redaxscript_2.6.1_full.zip

Please note that a newer version might already be available.
