2. Vulnerability Description

CVSS

Medium 4.3 AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description

There is at least one XSS vulnerability in the installation script of Geeklog.

Geeklog recommends to delete the install directory and displays warnings in the
admin area if this is not the case. However, deleting the install directory is
not mandatory, so it should be assumed that not all users will delete it.

3. Proof of Concept


http://localhost/geeklog-2.1.0/public_html/admin/install/bigdump.php?foffset=1&start=1&fn=te<script>alert(1)</script>st.sql

$_REQUEST['site_url'], $_REQUEST['site_admin_url'], and $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']
may be vulnerable as well, but the attacker would need a valid sql backup file
to trigger them.

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 2.1.1b3:

https://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/visit.php/1156

Please note that a newer version might already be available.
