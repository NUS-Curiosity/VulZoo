INTRODUCTION

This is the celebratory 10th edition of the well-known information security
conference “you Sh0t the Sheriff”
and we are sending this CFP out so you share with us the coolest stuff
you've been working on.

The conference will be happening on June, 13th in a secret location within
the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
This is a great opportunity for you to speak about the latest research you
have been working on to the
most influential crowd in the Brazilian Information Security realm.

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE

you Sh0t the Sheriff is a very unique, one-day, event dedicated to bringing
cutting edge talks to the top-notch
professionals of the Braziliian Information Security Community.

The conference’s main goal is to bring the attendees to the current state
of the information security world by
bringing the most relevant topics from different Infosec segments of the
market and providing an
environment that is ideal for both networking and idea sharing.

YSTS is a an exclusive, mostly invite-only security con.
Getting a talk accepted, will, not only get you to the event, but after you
successfully present your talk, you will receive a challenge-coin that
guarantees your entry to YSTS for as long as the conference exists.

Due to the great success of the previous years' editions, yes, we're
keeping the good old usual format:

* YSTS 10 will be held at an almost secret location only announced to whom
it may concern a couple of weeks before the con

* the venue will be, most likely, a very cool club or a bar
(seriously, look at the pictures)

* appropriate environment to network with great security folks from
Brazil and abroad

* since it is a one-day con with tons of talks and activities, we make sure
we fill everyone with coffee, food and booze

CONFERENCE FORMAT

Anything Information Security related is interesting for the conference,
which will help us create a cool and diverse line-up.
We strictly *do not* accept commercial/ product-related pitches.
Keep in mind though, this is a one-day conference, we receive a lot of
submissions, so your unique research with cool demos and any other
possible twist you can throw in to keep the audience engaged will surely
stand out to the other papers.

Just in case you need some ideas, some of the topics in security that could
be interesting to us:

* Mobile Devices & BY0D - Bring your 0wn3d Device

* Real Social Networking Threats

* Embedded Systems

* Everything in Offensive Security

* "the" Cloud

* Inside Jobs Detection/ Techniques

* Big Data

* Small Data

* Tiny Data (the type that breaks big things)

* Internet of all the things you can break

* Career & Management topics

* (cool and useful) Information Security Policies

* Privacy in the Digital World

* Messing with Network Protocols

* RF Stuff

* Mobile Payments

* Authentication

* Incident Response Stories and Policies

* Information Warfare

* Malware/ Botnets

* DDoS Evolution or Stories (or solution, if you have one)

* Secure Programming

* Hacker Culture

* Application Security

* Virtualization

* DataBase Security

* Cryptography

* System Weaknesses

* Infrastructure and Critical Systems

* Reverse Engineering

* Social Reverse Engineering

* Reversing Social Engineering

* Caipirinha and Feijoada Hacks

* and everything else information security related that our attendees
would enjoy, the coolest/ different/ most creative submissions win,
keep that in mind!

We do like shorter talks, so please submit your talks and remember
they must be 30 minutes long. (yes, we do strictly enforce that)

We are also opened to some 15-minute talks, some of the smart people
around might not need 30 minutes to deliver a message, or it might be
a project that has been just kicked-off.

15 minutes might be your thing and that's nothing to be ashamed about.

you Sh0t the Sheriff is the perfect conference to release your new
projects, other people have released very cool research before they
presented it at the bigger cons later in the year. We also like that,
a lot.

And yes, we do prefer new hot-topics. "First-time" speakers are more
than welcome.

If you’ve got good content to present, that's all that matters.
