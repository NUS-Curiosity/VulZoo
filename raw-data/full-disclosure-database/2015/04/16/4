Subject: Re: [FD] several issues in SQLite (+ catching up on several other
 bugs)

Hi,

Nice work.

I took the latest release and ran the fuzzer again (without all the
dictionary and special testcase stuff, may re-do that later).

Uncovered two more issues, one in the statement parser causing an
off-by-one read with the 2 byte input ".\":
https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/e018f4bf1f27f783

And one in the parser of the database binary format itself:
https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/f71053cf658b3260
(not sure if there is any plausible attack scenario)

Both "only" invalid memory reads, so likely nothing to worry. Just
a motivation for others to fuzz again, there may be more to find.

Thanks also to Richard for fixing both issues very quickly.

cu,
