 videowhisper-video-conference-integration wordpress plugin v4.91.8

Hello Folks,

You can get php execution by using the file extension .phtml for both of these advisories. I'm currently updating the advisories and the vendor.

Try using an uncommon extension not defined in /etc/mime.types.

$ grep "#app" /etc/mime.types 
#application/vnd.ms-pki.stl							stl
#application/x-httpd-eruby			rhtml
#application/x-httpd-php			phtml pht php
#application/x-httpd-php-source			phps
#application/x-httpd-php3			php3
#application/x-httpd-php3-preprocessed		php3p
#application/x-httpd-php4			php4
#application/x-httpd-php5			php5
