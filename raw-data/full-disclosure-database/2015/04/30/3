Subject: [FD] Mysterious CVE-2008-568 (Solaris)

It appears to me that CVE-2008-568 is rather hard to find information
about, outside the public exploit [1] and advisory [2] issued by the
team that found it. It's unknown to CVE sites probably because it's only
referenced by 3 digits instead of 4. The patch README [3] doesn't seem
to reference this issue at all. Does anyone know if it has a different
CVE number or what happened here?
