SevenIT
Product: SevDesk - iOS Mobile Web Application (API) 1.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SEVENIT Software GmbH sevDesk v1.1 iOS mobile web-application (api).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers or low privileged user account to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable 
web-application module or service.

The security vulnerability is located in the `firstname` values of the main sevDesk `Dasboard` application module & api. Remote attackers are able to inject 
own script codes to the mobile dashboard through the api by manipulation of the registration information in the client.

The execution of the script code occurs after the inject on the application-side in the main mobile dashboard status list. If the test user account apply for 
any changes in the account profile the activity becomes visible. In the context were the information and details becomes visible is the location were the 
execution of the persistent injected script code takes place. The attack vector is persistent and the request method to inject the code is POST. 

The security risk of the persistent script code inject web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.2. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged sevdesk user account with restricted access and low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects to malicious source and persistent 
manipulation of affected or connected application modules (api).

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] sevDesk v1.1 iOS

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Registration to SevDesk

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] firstname (display name)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Dasboard Index Status List

2. Register an new account 
3. Include as name value your own malicious script code payload
4. Save the settings and open the Dasboard status listing

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent mobile web vulnerability in the api is estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.2)
