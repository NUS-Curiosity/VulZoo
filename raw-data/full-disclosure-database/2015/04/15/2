*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
NetCat web application has a security bug problem. It can be exploited by
Directory Traversal - Local File Include (LFI) attacks. A local file
inclusion (LFI) flaw is due to the script not properly sanitizing user
input, specifically path traversal style attacks (e.g. '../../') supplied
to the parameters. With a specially crafted request, a remote attacker can
include arbitrary files from the targeted host or from a remote host . This
may allow disclosing file contents or executing files like PHP scripts.
Such attacks are limited due to the script only calling files already on
the target host.

Several other NetCat products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by some
other bug hunter researchers before. NetCat has patched some of them. Gmane
(pronounced "mane") is an e-mail to news gateway. It allows users to access
electronic mailing lists as if they were Usenet newsgroups, and also
through a variety of web interfaces. Gmane is an archive; it never expires
messages (unless explicitly requested by users). Gmane also supports
importing list postings made prior to a list's inclusion on the service. It
has published suggestions, advisories, solutions related to Directory
Traversal vulnerabilities.
