*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
Webs ID web application has a security bug problem. It can be exploited by
XSS attacks. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted
request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.

Several other Webs ID products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by
some other bug hunter researchers before. Webs has patched some of them.
Gmane (pronounced "mane") is an e-mail to news gateway. It allows users to
access electronic mailing lists as if they were Usenet newsgroups, and also
through a variety of web interfaces. Gmane is an archive; it never expires
messages (unless explicitly requested by users). Gmane also supports
importing list postings made prior to a list's inclusion on the service. It
has published suggestions, advisories, solutions related to XSS
vulnerabilities.
