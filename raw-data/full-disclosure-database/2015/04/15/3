*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
NetCat web application has a security bug problem. It can be exploited by
HTML Injection attacks. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) injection, also
sometimes referred to as virtual defacement, is an attack on a user made
possible by an injection vulnerability in a web application. When an
application does not properly handle user supplied data, an attacker can
supply valid HTML, typically via a parameter value, and inject their own
content into the page. This attack is typically used in conjunction with
some form of social engineering, as the attack is exploiting a code-based
vulnerability and a user's trust.

Several NetCat products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by some other
bug hunter researchers before. NetCat has patched some of them. Web
Security Watch is an aggregator of security reports coming from various
sources. It aims to provide a single point of tracking for all publicly
disclosed security issues that matter. "Its unique tagging system enables
you to see a relevant set of tags associated with each security alert for a
quick overview of the affected products. What's more, you can now subscribe
to an RSS feed containing the specific tags that you are interested in -
you will then only receive alerts related to those tags." It has published
suggestions, advisories, solutions details related to HTML vulnerabilities.
