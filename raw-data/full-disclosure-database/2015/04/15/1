*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
Opoint Media Intelligence web application has a security bug problem. It
can be exploited by Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards (URL Redirection)
attacks. This could allow a user to create a specially crafted URL, that if
clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site to
an arbitrary web site of the attacker's choosing. Such attacks are useful
as the crafted URL initially appear to be a web page of a trusted site.
This could be leveraged to direct an unsuspecting user to a web page
containing attacks that target client side software such as a web browser
or document rendering programs.

Other Opoint products 0day vulnerabilities have been found by some other
bug hunter researchers before. Opoint has patched some of them. Web
Security Watch is an aggregator of security reports coming from various
sources. It aims to provide a single point of tracking for all publicly
disclosed security issues that matter. "Its unique tagging system enables
you to see a relevant set of tags associated with each security alert for a
quick overview of the affected products. What's more, you can now subscribe
to an RSS feed containing the specific tags that you are interested in -
you will then only receive alerts related to those tags." It has published
