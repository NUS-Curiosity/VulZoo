Subject: [FD] New tool: smalisca - Static Code Analysis tool for Smali files

Hi,

Today, nullsecurity released a new tool: smalisca.

[ DESCRIPTION ]

Static Code Analysis tool for Smali files.

If you ever have looked at Android applications you know to appreciate
the ability of analyzing your target at the most advanced level. Dynamic
programm analysis will give you a pretty good overview of your
applications activities and general behaviour. However sometimes you’ll
want to just analyze your application *without* running it. You’ll want
to have a look at its components, analyze how they interact and how data
is tainted from one point to another.

This is was the major factor driving the development of /smalisca/.
There are indeed some good reasons for a /static code analysis/ before
the /dynamic/ one. Before interacting with the application I like to
know how the application has been build, if there is any API and
generate all sort of /call flow graphs/. In fact graphs have been very
important to me since they /visualize/ things. Instead of jumping from
file to file, from class to class, I just look at the graphs.

While graph building has been an important reason for me to code such a
tool, /smalisca/ has some other neat *features* you should read about.
