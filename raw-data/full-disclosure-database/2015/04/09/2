                  title: Network Solutions Webmail - A tale about
chained web vulnerabilities
                case id: CM-2015-01
                product: Network Solutions Webmail
     vulnerability type: Multiple
               severity: Low to High
                  found: 2015-01-16

[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]

While reviewing the Network Solutions webmail, I identified various security
issues ranging from low to high severity. Some of them, chained together, could
allow an attacker to arbitrary change the password of any e-mail accounts
hosted on the service provider. All things considered – the volume of customers
managed by the company and the kind of data affected by vulnerabilities –
customer's data is put at risk and these issues must be addressed immediately.
Below a summary of the key findings:
- Weak password change mechanism
- Password complexity requirement not enforced
- Ability to reset a mailbox password to an arbitrary value
- Ability to enumerate and identify valid mailbox ID and corresponding e-mail
  address
- Improper input validation (reflected XSS)
- End-user forced to execute unwanted action (CSRF)
