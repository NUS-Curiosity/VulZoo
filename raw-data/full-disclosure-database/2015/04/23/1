Subject: [FD] Magento Unauthenticated RCE

RCE on the most popular eCommerce (/shopping cart) platform out there - we have been urging admins to patch for a while now.
This one is as serious as it gets, auth bypass + SQLi + RFI converted to LFI. Props to our own Netanel Rubin for the top research.
Check Point was awarded with a $20k USD bounty for this report, which we have decided to donate to charity.
