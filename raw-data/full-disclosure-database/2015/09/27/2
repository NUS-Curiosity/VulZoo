Subject: [FD] Apport kernel_crashdump symlink vulnerability exploitation

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello List,

Here [1] is a short write-up of the Ubuntu Apport kernel_crashdump
symlink vulnerabilities fixed today including some POCs.

While symlink exploitation itself is not really exiting, the creation
of a suitable payload is more interesting: logfile data has to be
crafted, so that after splitting in chunks, compression and base64
encoding, the result string must resemble a path to an
attacker-controllable executable. See [1] to read more.
