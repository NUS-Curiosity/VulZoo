Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Hiteshi Technologies
Product: UDID+ - iOS Mobile Web Application 1.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official UDID v1.0 iOS mobile web-application.
The security web vulnerability allows to inject malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable iOS mobile app.

The vulnerability is located in the `Send UDID via Email` encoding. The application encodes the input of the device cell name with 
wrong conditions. Thus results in an application-side script code execution issue in the Send UDID via Email module. The attackers 
changes by restricted physical device access the device cell name to compromise the application output in the Send UDID via Email module.

The security risk of the application-side input web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.6. 
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low privilege ios device account with restricted access and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Vulnerable Module(s)
				[+] Send UDID via Email
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s)
				[+] device cell name (cid)

Affected Module(s)
				[+] UDID Device Information (Mail)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side mail encoding web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted physical device access without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Change the cid of the ios device via settings to a script code payload (test)
2. Open the vulnerable application
3. Click the Send UDID via Email button
4. Push the email button
5. The function includes the device values with wrong encoding to the email
6. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!
