Overview

"Webroot SecureAnywhere Business – Mobile Protection provides
essential security for iPhones and iPads and includes lost device

or stolen. The Webroot mobile device security console provides central

Issue

The Webroot SecureAnywhere Business – Mobile Protection iOS
application (version 1.10.316 and below) does not validate the SSL
certificate it receives when connecting to a secure site.

Impact

An attacker who can perform a man in the middle attack may present a
bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Usernames, passwords and sensitive information could be captured by an
attacker without the user's knowledge.

be addressed in an upcoming version
August 3, 2015 - Asked Webroot for a timeline to provide an updated version
August 31, 2015 - Webroot released version 1.11 which resolves this
vulnerability
