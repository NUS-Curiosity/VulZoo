Subject: [FD] CSRF in Watu PRO allows unauthenticated attackers to delete
	quizzes (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Watu PRO
Version: 4.8.8.4
Homepage: http://calendarscripts.info/watupro/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/csrf-in-watu-pro-allows-unauthenticated-attackers-to-delete-quizzes/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4.3 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF in Watu PRO allows unauthenticated attackers to delete quizzes

Vulnerability
================
An attacker able to convince an admin to visit a link of their choosing is able to delete quizzes.

Proof of concept
================
Assuming there is a quiz with ID 1, the following link will delete it when visited by a logged-in admin:
http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=watupro_exams&action=delete&quiz=1

Mitigations
================
This issue has been discussed with the author, who disagrees that there is an exploitable issue. We maintain that the above proof of concept demonstrates this issue. Nonetheless, the author has told us that they have made changes to address the problem in version 4.9.0.8 of this plugin. We have not verified these changes, so our recommendation is to upgrade to version 4.9.0.8 or later, and ideally conduct your own security assessment of this plugin.
