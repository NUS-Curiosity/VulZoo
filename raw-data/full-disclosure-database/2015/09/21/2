Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 12

Part 12 of Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code is up. In this part,
we encounter one last implementation bug in the Netgear R6200 UPnP
daemon that threatens our hopes of exploitation: an invalid free()
just after exploitation but before reboot. I walk you through an
investigation of malloc() and free() to understand the crash. I also
describe workaround to avoid the crash and reboot into our stage 1
payload.

Here's a link to part 12:

If you missed my post to Full Disclosure where I introduced the
series, here's that:

As always I welcome feedback via email or Twitter. I'm @zcutlip.

I hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
Zach
