Subject: [FD] NetRipper - Smart traffic sniffing for penetration testers

Dear list,

I am pleased to announce you NetRipper, a tool recently released at Defcon 23.

NetRipper is a post exploitation tool targeting Windows systems which uses API hooking in order to intercept network traffic and encryption related functions from a low privileged user, being able to capture both plain-text traffic and encrypted traffic before encryption/after decryption. 

You can find the more information, source code, binaries, Metasploit module and presentation slides on GitHub:

Regards,
Ionut
