We mostly work on BlackArch Linux for our personal use. We share it in
the
hopes that you will contribute by reporting bugs and sharing tools and
ideas.


We have a relaxed project structure. We welcome pull requests of all
sizes
through any means, including Github[0] and email[1].



Also see our Twitter account[2] and IRC channel[3]. Although BlackArch is
