client-side application to browser requests. The request method to inject is GET and the attack vector is located on the client-side of the online-service.

The security risk of the client-side  cross site web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.5. 
Exploitation of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability requires no privilege web application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects and non-persistent manipulation 
of affected or connected service modules.
