Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Ubiquiti Network
Product: Ubnt Community - Web Application (Online Service) 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Ubiquiti Networks Community online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to inject own script code to the application-side of the affected application module.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `gallery page album upload` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own files 
with malicious `filename` value in the `album upload` POST method request to compromise the ubnt web-application. Remote attackers are also able 
to exploit the filename issue in combination with persistent injected script codes to execute different malicious attack requests. The attack vector 
is located on the application-side of the ubnt service and the request method to inject is POST. 

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.2. 
Exploitation of the application-side validation web vulnerability requires no user interaction and only a low privileged web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability results in the ubnt community web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] gallerypage (upload)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename (Album)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] confirmationpage


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account and with low user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable filename value in the album add module.
Restrict the input and encode the filename to prevent further script code injection attack that runs through the application-side.
Disallow special chars and implement a secure exception to prevent the execution itself.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side album filename input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.2)
