Subject: [FD] Open source tool for applying Google Chrome security updates

The Problem
If you are a network administrator, keeping browser updated is the first thing to do for security. Chrome is a very good browser, but it's a little bit complicated to answer this simple question: what is the version of the latest stable Chrome? And for people in places such as China(no Google services), updating Chrome is not an easy task.

The Solution
The official blog of Chrome Releases contains a lot of information. Code of this project extracts the version number from the official blog, downloads offline installers from the official website if it's a new version, and checks whether visitor's Chrome is exactly the same.

Security
The best part of this project - users do not need to download and run software to be checked. This project does not even contain JavaScript.
