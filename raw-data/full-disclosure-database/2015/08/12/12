Subject: [FD] Reflected XSS in iframe allows unauthenticated users to do
	almost anything an admin can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: iframe
Version: 3.0
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/reflected-xss-in-iframe-allows-unauthenticated-users-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in iframe allows unauthenticated users to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
If the “get_params_from_url” option is used in the iframe shortcode, the page/post it’s on is opened up to a reflected XSS attack.

Proof of concept
================
Paste the following into a post:
[iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4qsGTXLnmKs\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" get_params_from_url=\"1\"]
Visit the post in a browser that doesn’t attempt to mitigate XSS attacks (i.e. Firefox) and add some extra parameters:
http://localhost/2015/07/31/iframe/?a=%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(`hello%20world`)%3C/script%3E

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 4.0 or later
If this is not possible, ensure that the ‘get_params_from_url’ argument is never used in the shortcode.
