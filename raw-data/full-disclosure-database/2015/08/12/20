Ah yes - sorry about that. Should indeed be 2015-08-10

Iâ€™ve corrected in our published advisory: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/xss-in-google-analytics-by-yoast-premium-by-privileged-users/ <https://security.dxw.com/advisories/xss-in-google-analytics-by-yoast-premium-by-privileged-users/>

Thanks for letting me know
