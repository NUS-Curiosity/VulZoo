Subject: [FD] Stored XSS in iframe allows less privileged users to do almost
	anything an admin can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: iframe
Version: 3.0
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/stored-xss-in-iframe-allows-less-privileged-users-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Stored XSS in iframe allows less privileged users to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
Users without the unfiltered_html capability are able to insert arbitrary HTML into pages and thus exceed the privileges they were granted.

Proof of concept
================
Insert the following into a post:
[iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4qsGTXLnmKs\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" onload=\"alert(1)\"]

Mitigations
================
Disable the plugin until a new version is released that fixes this bug.
The vendor has released version 4.0 in which onload is disabled, but the other ‘event’ attributes are still permitted, including onpageshow. A number of these event attributes could be used to execute this attack, so this issue is not resolved.
