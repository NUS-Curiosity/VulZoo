Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Exploitation Technique:

Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An auth bypass session vulnerability has been discovered in the official LinuxOptic 2009 content management system.
The session vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized access the administrator panel or the web user interface.

The vulnerability is located in the session credentials request of the home.php file. The file allows direct requests of administrators 
without secure session credential check. Thus results in a session auth bypass issue that can finally lead to a full application compromise.
The vulnerability is a classic auth bypass session issue in the admin panel of the content management system. The request method to bypass 
is GET and the attack vector of the issue is on the application-side of the service.

The security risk of the auth bypass vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.1. 
Exploitation of the auth bypass session web vulnerability requires no privilege application user account or user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized access to the admin panel, defacement, web-application and dbms compromise.

Request Method(s):
    [+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s)
    [+] Login (Session)
