*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
Winmail Server web application has a computer security problem. Hackers can
exploit it by reflected XSS cyber attacks. This may allow a remote attacker
to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script
code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between
their browser and the server.

Several other similar products 0-day vulnerabilities have been found by
some other bug hunter researchers before. Winmail Server has patched some
of them. "scip AG was founded in 2002. We are driven by innovation,
sustainability, transparency, and enjoyment of our work. We are completely
self-funded and are thus in the comfortable position to provide completely
independent and neutral services. Our staff consists of highly specialized
experts who focus on the topic information security and continuously

similar XSS bugs, such as scipID 26980.

fact, CVE-2005-3692 mentions that "&retid" parameter in "badlogin.php" page
is vulnerable to XSS attacks. But it does not mention "&lid" parameter".
The scipID of the bug is 26980. Bugtraq (SecurityFocus) ID is 15493. OSVDB
