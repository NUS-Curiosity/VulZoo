WordPress Newsletter Plug-in  has a web application security bug problem.
It can be exploited by URL Redirection (Open Redirect) attacks.

*(2.1) *The vulnerability occurs at "do.php?" page with "&nr" parameter.
The redirected page is encoded with Base64 encoding scheme. So encode the
malicious redirection URL with Base64 first.

"Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that
represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a
radix-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific MIME
content transfer encoding." (Wikipedia)

For more information of Base64, one can check cryptography or coding books
for detail.
