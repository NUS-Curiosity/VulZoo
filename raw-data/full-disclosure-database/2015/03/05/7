Subject: [FD] Java 8u40 released: why?

I notice that Java (JDK, JRE) update 8u40 has been released.
Though
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
says "this release includes important security fixes", the release notes
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u40-relnotes-2389089.html
says the "security baseline" is 1.8.0_31 (unchanged).
I do not notice any major "useability" issues fixed.
So: why this out-of-band release?

Thanks, Paul
