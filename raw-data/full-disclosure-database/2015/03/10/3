Subject: Re: [FD] Java 8u40 released: why?

Nick,

Nowhere in the quoted text or my comments did it say it was a forced option, only that it “appeared” in the update; this thread started with questions as to whether there was any actual changes with the version bump, and I was offering a possibility.

So you did not notice the explanation that this would happen, right  
there on the "continue the install" permission dialog?  

The one we can see a screenshot of at, say:  

https://grahamcluley.com/2015/03/oracle-java-mac/  

Your description rather strongly implies that you have no choice in  
getting the Ask toolbar, which is untrue.  

I understand that Mac users will likely not be _accustomed_ to such  
permissions for _additional_ software, over and above the actual  
software that they thought they were installing, being requested, BUT  
unlike your description above and Ed Bott's at ZDNet (referenced in  
another post in this thread), the user is actually given the choice to  
not install the extra offer.  

Of course, questions as to the desirability of the option being  
pre-selected, and the possibly less than fully transparent directions  
about the necessity of the offer are much the same with the Mac version  
and the Windows version, whose permission dialog you can see here:
