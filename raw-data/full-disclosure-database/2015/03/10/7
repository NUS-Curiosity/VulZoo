*Product Introduction:*
"Daily Edition WordPress Theme developed by wootheme team and Daily Edition
is a clean, spacious newspaper/magazine theme designed by Liam McKay. With
loads of home page modules to enable/disable and a unique java script-based
featured scroller and video player the theme oozes sophistication"

"The Daily Edition theme offers users many options, controlled from the
widgets area and the theme options page – it makes both the themes
appearance and functions flexible. From The Daily Edition 3 option pages
you can for example add your Twitter and Google analytics code, some custom
CSS and footer content – and in the widgets area you find a practical ads
management."

"Unique Features
These are some of the more unique features that you will find within the
theme:
    A neat javascript home page featured slider, with thumbnail previews of
previous/next slides on hover over the dots.
    A “talking points” home page that can display posts according to tags,
in order of most commented to least commented. A great way to highlight
posts gathering dust in the archives.
    A customizable home page layout with options to specify how many full
width blog posts and how many “box” posts you would like to display.
    A javascript home page video player with thumbnail hover effect.
    16 delicious colour schemes to choose from!"







*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
WordPress Daily Edition Theme has a web application security bug problem.
It can be exploited by information leakage attacks - Full Path Disclosure
(FPD). This may allow a remote attacker to disclose the software's
installation path. While such information is relatively low risk, it is
often useful in carrying out additional, more focused attacks.


*(2.1) *The code flaw occurs at "thumb.php?" page with "src" parameters.
