-About OpenKM
OpenKM is a Free/Libre document management system that provides a web
interface for managing arbitrary files. OpenKM includes a content
repository, Lucene indexing, and jBPM workflow. The OpenKM system was
developed using Java technology.
In 2005 two developers involved in open source technologies and expertise
with some commercial document management solutions (Sharepoint, Documentum,
Hummingbird, among others) like Excalibur search engine or Kofax OCR engine
decided to start an open source project based on high level technologies to
build a document management system that they decided to call OpenKM.

-Impact: Remote Admin or Users Full Account Takeover with no interaction.

-Attack Scenario:
1. User#1 "Attacker" : Creates a task with a vulnerable name and assign it
to another User/Admin "Targeted Victim".
2. User#2 "Victim" : Got Exploited with the vulnerable Task made by the
Attacker "User#1" since the Task notification will automatically appears to
the assigned user side "Victim" also the notification popup displays the
vulnerable task name and the victim will be exploited with no interactions.

because it will work remotely against users even with the same scenario
