Unfortunately for Apple and for Mac users in general, Mac users are 
going to have to learn that the main security issue on Windows exists in 
OSX too: The user. The only real thing that has kept OSX safe from 
user-installed malware until now is the relative obscurity of OSX; as 
OSX gains enough market share to be worth malware author's time, we'll 
see more and more malware, ranging from bundleware that replaces user 
preference with a particular corporate interest, right up to full on 
trojans.
