Hello Fellow Cyber Security Enthusiasts!

============= 
== WAHCKon == 
=============
What is WAHCKon?

WAHCKon(West Australian Hackers Conference) is a Perth based 
Hacker conference that launched in 2013. We cover a wide range of
topics focusing on Information security and Hacker subculture 
as well as locksports, activism and related areas. We attract a highly 
diverse set of people, and we are focused on bringing the community 
together. 

We are proud to announce that we've made our FinalT selection of
speakers for WAHCKon[2]. Please check the awesome lineup of talks
here: http://wahckon.org.au/talks.html

===================== 
== WAHCKon[2] 2015 == 
=====================

This year, WAHCKon is taking place on the 2nd and 3rd of May 2015.
The conference will be held at the Empyrean function centre
In Northbridge, Perth (Australia). Our training will be held on the
30th of April and 1st of May 2015.

============= 
== Tickets == 
=============

Tickets are still available in all categories at very reasonable
prices. We're talking $30 for concession, $50 full price or a very
reasonable $300 if you want to roll with the VIPs (this is a good
option if your work is funding your ticket, $300 is less than a
standard ticket to most conferences!). VIPs will get access to fancy
chairs. These seats are so close to the stage you'll be able to 
analyse the micro-expressions of the speakers in order to detect 
their deceit! You can talk about it with your fellow VIPs at our
exclusive VIP PARTY!

You can purchase your tickets here: https://wahckon.eventbrite.com.au/

============== 
== Training == 
==============

Oh did somebody say TRAINING? YES! It was us! For the first time
WAHCKon is facilitating a selection of training courses. We have a
lineup of trainers who will be providing instruction on a range of
topics. You can purchase tickets to training right now! But please
keep in mind places are very limited. You'll also be doing a good
thing! As for every training slot sold, another will be provided free
of charge to a struggling hacker who wouldn't otherwise be able to
attend.

You can find more information on all of these here:
http://wahckon.org.au/training.html 

=========== 
== Venue == 
===========

We have a new venue! WAHCKon[2] will be held at the Empyrean function
centre in Northbridge. If you've already purchased a ticket it will
likely have our previous venue listed, make sure to head to the
Empyrean if you want to attend WAHCKon and not some other unaffiliated
event.

We will be updating our venue page with further information about the
venue over the coming weeks: http://wahckon.org.au/venue.html

============= 
== Goodbye ==

This is the end of the email.
