-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hello List,

I've improved the code and made most of the source-code parameters
also configurable via the command line.

I've also added the row-hammer assembly code itself.

The problem:

* The page fixation code is tested and seems to be 100% reliable and
quite fast.
* The row-hammer code is completely untested as I have no 64-bit
hardware affected by rowhammer. Hence the statistics optimization code
is incomplete.

WARNING: THE CODE IS UNTESTED AND LIKELY TO BE HARMFULL. STILL I WOULD
REQUIRE THE STATS DATA TO GET COMPLETELY SAFE 100% SUCCESS ESCALATION.
WOULD SOMEONE AWARE OF THE RISK BE WILLING TO ASSIST IN TESTING?
