Hi,

to just let you know: There is a new OpenSSL version upcoming in about
two days with some fixed security issues with the severity "high":

"The OpenSSL project team would like to announce the forthcoming release
of OpenSSL versions 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf.

These releases will be made available on 19th March. They will fix a
number of security defects. The highest severity defect fixed by these
releases is classified as "high" severity."
