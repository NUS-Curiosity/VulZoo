Subject: [FD] Regarding how can I request a CVE number?

Hi Guys,

I discovered several Vuls and have reported them to the vendors, so I'd like to request the CVE for them.(The vendor did not want to request CVE)

I ever sent some emails to cve-assign@...re.org for applying for CVE.
But so far still nobody replys them. I dont know what happend about this email box.
Is my email recognised as spam? Or do I need write the email content in a special format?

So please, can somebody here help me?
Thanks

Best wishes,
XZ
