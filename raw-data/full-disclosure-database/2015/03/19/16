slides and we'll cover up to $500 in costs for your trip to Las Vegas.

category*

Breaking Ground – Ground Breaking Information Security research and
conversations on the “Next Big Thing”. Interactively discussing your
research with our participants and getting feedback, input and opinion. No
preaching from the podium at a passive audience.

Common Ground – Other topics of interest to the security community. e.g.,
Lock-picking, hardware hacking, mental health/burnout, Law, Privacy,
Regulations, Risk, Crypto, Activism, etc. Again, interactive discussions
with your peers and fellow researchers. Not passive lectures “at” an
audience.

Underground – OTR talks on subjects best discussed AFK. No press, no
recording, no streaming, no names. Just you and your peers, behind closed
doors. Think about it.

Ground Truth - This  track is focused on innovative computer science and
mathematics applied to security. Topics of interest include machine
learning, natural language processing, Big Data technologies, cryptography,
compression, data structures, zero knowledge proofs or just about anything
academically publishable that usually baffles review committees for other
conferences.

Above The Ground Plane – The team that brings you the Wireless Village at
DEFCON and the Wireless Capture the Flag contests at multiple conferences
throughout the year is organizing a new speaking track for BSidesLV. The
Above The Ground Plane track will consist of any and all forms of exciting
hacks and unusual uses of wireless technology. Think you have something new
and exciting, spread your spectrum and come share it. Trust us, you ohm it
to yourself.

Training Ground – Workshops and classes to give our participants hands-on
experience and in-depth knowledge. We accept proposals for 1/2 day,
full-day and 2-day workshops.
We don't charge for workshops, nor do we pay for them, although we may
cover circuit boards.
