Subject: Re: [FD] Regarding how can I request a CVE number?

I've encountered a similar issue earlier this year.

I'm in the same boat with regards to wondering whether there was a
problem with content / submission - despite following the supplied
guidelines - or whether the delay in response is due to workload and
prioritization.

Initially I had responses to requests for CVE assignments from Mitre
after around 12 days. However, after replying with the requested
information it went dark, and I haven't heard back since. I've sent a
few follow-ups, but I've just passed the two month mark with no
response, dismissal or assignment.

Just chiming in with my recent experience as I'd definitely be
interested in hearing whether this is more wide spread, or whether
there have been changes to the 'cve-assign' process?

Regards,
Peter Adkins
