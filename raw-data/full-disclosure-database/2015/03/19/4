Subject: Re: [FD] Regarding how can I request a CVE number?

Hi XZ,

I managed to get a number of CVEs last year, but towards the end of the
year they simply stopped replying, so I've given up. Whether they stopped
replying due to work load, or whether my submissions were not up to their
requirements I'm not sure.

If you find out any more, I'd be interested in knowing why they've stopped
assigning CVEs to certain submission sources.

Kind regards,
James H
