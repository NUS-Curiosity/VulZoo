manages the relationships between content items for you (e.g. keeping track
of where they fit into the site hierarchy). Finally, it ensures that each
content item is connected to the right style sheet when it comes to be
published. Some CMSs also provide facilities to track the status of content
items through editorial processes and workflows."
