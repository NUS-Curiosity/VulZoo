Hash: SHA1

Hello list,

I guess this must be common knowledge somehow already, but although hidden in plain sight, it did not make it do me yet. So [1] is just a very quick, dirty and incomplete writeup of thoughts how to use dmesg to

* Get knowledge about e.g. kernel task structure address
* Bypass ALSR in forking applications
* Get logging information from outside a chroot jail
* Get additional network information from iptables LOG target
