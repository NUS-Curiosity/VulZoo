*Product Introduction Overview:*
"Today, some libraries want to enhance their online presence in ways that
go beyond the traditional OPAC and the "library portal" model to better
integrate the latest Web functionality. With WebPAC Pro, libraries will be
able to take advantage of the latest Web technologies and engage Web-savvy
users more effectively than ever before. WebPAC Pro is a complete update of
the Web OPAC interface"

"WebPAC Pro breaks through the functional and design limitations of the
traditional online catalog. Its solid technology framework supports tools
for patron access such as Spell Check; integrated Really Simple Syndication
(RSS) feeds; a suite of products for seamless Campus Computing; and deep
control over information content and presentation with Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS). WebPAC Pro is also a platform for participation when
integrated with Innovative's Patron Ratings features and Community Reviews
product. What's more, with WebPAC Pro's RightResult™ search technology, the
most relevant materials display at the top so patrons get to the specific
items or topics they want to explore immediately. WebPAC Pro can also
interconnect with Innovative's discovery services platform, Encore. And for
elegant access through Blackberry® Storm™ or iPhone™, the AirPAC provides
catalog searching, item requesting, and more."





*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
WebPAC Pro web application has a security bug problem. It can be exploited
by Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards (URL Redirection) attacks. This could
allow a user to create a specially crafted URL, that if clicked, would
redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site to an arbitrary web
site of the attacker's choosing. Such attacks are useful as the crafted URL
initially appear to be a web page of a trusted site. This could be
leveraged to direct an unsuspecting user to a web page containing attacks
that target client side software such as a web browser or document
rendering programs.

Other Innovative Interfaces products vulnerabilities have been found by
some other bug hunter researchers before. Innovative has patched some of
them. NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based
vulnerability management data (This data enables automation of
vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance (e.g.
FISMA)). It has published suggestions, advisories, solutions related to
Innovative vulnerabilities.

*(2.1) *The first code programming flaw occurs at "showres?" page with
"&url" parameter.
