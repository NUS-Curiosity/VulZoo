*Product Introduction Overview:*
"724CMS is a content management system (CMS) that has customers spread in
Canada, Japan, Korean, the United States, European and many others. It
allows publishing, editing and modifying content, organizing, deleting as
well as maintenance from a central interface. Meanwhile, 724CMS provides
procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment."

"A CMS helps you create and store content in a shared repository. It then
manages the relationships between content items for you (e.g. keeping track
of where they fit into the site hierarchy). Finally, it ensures that each
content item is connected to the right style sheet when it comes to be
published. Some CMSs also provide facilities to track the status of content
items through editorial processes and workflows."






*(2) Vulnerability Details:*
724CMS web application has a security bug problem. It can be exploited by
Directory Traversal - Local File Include (LFI) attacks. A local file
inclusion (LFI) flaw is due to the script not properly sanitizing user
input, specifically path traversal style attacks (e.g. '../../') supplied
to the parameters. With a specially crafted request, a remote attacker can
include arbitrary files from the targeted host or from a remote host . This
may allow disclosing file contents or executing files like PHP scripts.
Such attacks are limited due to the script only calling files already on
the target host.

Several 724CMS products vulnerabilities have been found by some other bug
hunter researchers before. 724CMS has patched some of them. The MITRE
Corporation is a not-for-profit company that operates multiple federally
funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), which provide innovative,
practical solutions for some of our nation's most critical challenges in
defense and intelligence, aviation, civil systems, homeland security, the
judiciary, healthcare, and cybersecurity. It has published suggestions,
advisories, solutions details related to 724CMS vulnerabilities.


*(2.1) *The first cipher programming flaw occurs at "/section.php" page
with "&Module" parameter.
