Damn - that's disappointing :-/
I see you're right - there's a lot of activity:

This post:

explains that ECC is only going to correct single bit fails, and
likely crash the machine on double-bit fails, but that multi-bit fails
(which the Google tool achieves) may evade the ECC and achieve the
goal.

I'm off to find some machines to test.
