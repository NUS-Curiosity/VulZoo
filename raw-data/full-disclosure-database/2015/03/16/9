*Product Introduction Overview:*
"724CMS is a content management system (CMS) that has customers spread in
Canada, Japan, Korean, the United States, European and many others. It
allows publishing, editing and modifying content, organizing, deleting as
well as maintenance from a central interface. Meanwhile, 724CMS provides
procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment."

"A CMS helps you create and store content in a shared repository. It then
manages the relationships between content items for you (e.g. keeping track
of where they fit into the site hierarchy). Finally, it ensures that each
content item is connected to the right style sheet when it comes to be
published. Some CMSs also provide facilities to track the status of content
items through editorial processes and workflows."
