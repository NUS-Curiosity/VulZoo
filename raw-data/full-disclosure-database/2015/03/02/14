Subject: [FD] Tor Browser 4.0.3 with websockets enabled by default?

Hello,

      I am seeing that Tor Browser 4.0.3 apparently has the configuration
of websocket of Firefox enabled (true) by default .... I think that this is
something that should have  been corrected a long time ago (Tor bug 5741).
I think that this is a configuration bug. Am I wrong ?
