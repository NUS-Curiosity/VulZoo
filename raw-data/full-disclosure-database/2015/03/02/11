Subject: [FD] 0x08 SEC-T 2015: Call For Papers annoucement

The SEC-T Organizers are pleased to announce the start of the 2015
SEC-T 0x08 Call For Papers.

The rules are pretty much the same as every year so save the deadline
date and get cracking. ;) The SEC-T conference is an information
security conference strongly rooted in the technical realm. Talks on
technical subjects with no applicability to information security are
admissible as long as they are cool! Some topics we find interesting
are:

- Interesting or new vulnerability research
- Novel defensive technology or architecture
- Neat hardware hacks and funny broken products
- Analysis of protocols and/or wireless modes

Speaker slots are either 30 minutes (smalltalks) or 60 minutes (talks)
long so please indicate length of your presentation in your
submission. 60 minute talks are preferred but we don’t mind seeing
that you submit for both if you can. 60 minute talks should make room
for a 10 min QnA at the end and 30 minute talk might not have time for
a QnA. Talks that actively engage the audience to participate are
preferred. Every submission will be considered and we will judge each
proposal by its content and not the name attached. Proposals must
include the following:

- A description of the talk contents (all the WUTs)
- What attendees will learn from it (if they understand it)
- Reference videos or reviews of previous talks if available. (maybe
you can make one with your phone)
- The location you will be traveling from (City and Country/Planet)
- Information about additional needs for your talk if any. (Furniture,
Computers, a Blowtorch, FMRIs, human bodies etc.)
- Original Paper (optional) For a chance to win the €1000 best paper
submission competition. Paper must be original and to be
published/released at the time of your talk.

The paper, talk and material must be presented in English and you must
be able to hold your talk on the 17:th or 18:th of September 2015 at
the conference venue in Stockholm, Sweden.
If your talk is accepted, the SEC-T conference will arrange or help
you arrange and pay for travels between your location and the venue as
well as provide you with accommodations during the conference.
The speakers are also eligible for two separate €1000 prices; one for
best submitted paper and one for most popular talk given at SEC-T
2015.

The deadline for submissions and participation in the contest for best
submitted paper is August 1:st 2015, if you have a really good excuse
you may get an extension (settled by popular opinion). The SEC-T
speakers committee will vote on and accept incoming presentations and
announce speakers that are accepted continuously during the call for
papers period so submitting your abstract early is encouraged.

Send in your submissions to: cfp@...-t.org

Sincerely,
The SEC-T Organizers
