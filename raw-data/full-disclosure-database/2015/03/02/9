Subject: Re: [FD] Reflected File Download in AOL Search Website

It seems was fixed.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 01 Mar 2015 22:21:31 GMT
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=autocomplete.txt
Content-Type: application/x-suggestions+json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Language: en-US
Content-Length: 34
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=69
Connection: Keep-Alive

["iramar\%22%7C%7Ccalc%7C%7C", []]


They inclued the header "Content-Disposition: attachment;
filename=autocomplete.txt" and starting encondig the body response.
I reported this security issue last year at least five times but no answer.
So start to think in the AOL users and how they could be affected with this
security issue.
I could not measure what could be worse live quiet with the problem or take
a risk to disclosure. Now I'm sure that specific problem was solved. :)
