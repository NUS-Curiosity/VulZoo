Subject: [FD] New release: UFONet v0.6 - "Galactic OFFensive!"

Hi lists,

I am glad to present a new release of this tool.

http://ufonet.03c8.net
 
UFONet abuses OSI Layer 7-HTTP to create/manage 'zombies' and to conduct
different attacks using; GET/POST, multithreading, proxies, origin
spoofing methods, cache evasion techniques, etc.

 New options added are:

  * HTTP POST 'Open Redirect' (CWE-601) Web Abuse
  * External check 'is target up?'
  * Different search engines for dorking 'zombies'
  * Massive dorking search option (searh using all engines)
  * Reverse checking to verify if 'zombies' are 100% vulnerable
  * Server socket to share 'zombies' using P2P (upload/download)
  * Geomapping and metadata
  * Visualization data
  * Etc...
