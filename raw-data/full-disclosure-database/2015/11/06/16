The first BloomCON Forensics and Security conference will be held February
5-6, 2016 in Bloomsburg, PA (USA).  We are
now officially accepting presentation and workshop submissions for the
event.  We will have two speaking and one workshop tracks.  We are looking
for talks of 25 or 50 minutes in length and 2-hr or 4-hr workshops.


If you have something you would like to share please send;
  - your name or handle/alias
  - the presentation name/title
  - a brief topic abstract (1-2 paragraphs)
  - what kind of thing you are submitting from the following list 25-minute
talk, 50-minute talk, 2-hr workshop, 4-hr workshop
  - a brief bio
    (100% optional item, but if your talk is chosen it
    saves the time and trouble of asking for it later)

  ....via e-mail to:

  * NOTE: All submissions are due BY January 1, 2016.  However we may be
making
  some early selections from amongst the submissions, so please submit your
  stuff early.

If you present at the BloomCON, you will receive;
  - free BloomCON admission for you and three adult guests
  - whatever speaker swag we can muster with our limited budget
  - transportation to/from IPT or AVP and Bloomsburg, PA if required
  - minimal fame, glory, and possibly even notoriety
  - bragging rights for speaking at the first iteration of BloomCON

Please be aware that we are unable to sponsor travel and accommodations as
this is the first time we are holding this conference.  That said, your
company (if any) will be listed as a bronze sponsor in all event materials
and will be permitted a booth at the event.
