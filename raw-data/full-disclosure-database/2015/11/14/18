2. Vulnerability Description

CVSS

Medium 5.1 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

Description

The only protection against CSRF is a referer check. This check can be disabled
by a user with the rights to edit settings, thus making the application
vulnerable to CSRF.

A user may choose to disable referer checks, because when they are enabled,
external links or direct entry/bookmarks to specific pages in the backend do
not work, which severely limits the usability of the application

3. Solution

This issue has not been fixed by the vendor.
