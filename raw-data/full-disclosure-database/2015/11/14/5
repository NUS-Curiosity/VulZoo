2. Vulnerability Description

There are multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the dialog.php file. This allows an
attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the browser of a
victim if the victim clicks on an attacker supplied link or visits an attacker
controlled website. With this, it is possible to bypass CSRF protection and
thus do anything the victim can do, inject a JavaScript keylogger, or perform
phishing attacks.
