Subject: Re: [FD] LiteCart 1.3.2: Multiple XSS

Hi,

These vulnerabilities are similar, as both of them are issues with the
query parameter of the search.

However, the issue in version 1.1.2.1 exploits this line:

      <?php if ($_GET['query']) { ?>
    <h1 class="title"><?php echo
sprintf(language::translate('title_search_results_for_s', 'Search
Results for &quot;%s&quot;'), $_GET['query']); ?></h1>
    <?php } ?>

This issue was fixed in version 1.2 by passing the query parameter to
htmlspecialchars before passing it to sprintf.

The issue in version 1.3.2 is that the query parameter is also echoed
unencoded inside the title tag, which is why the POC contains </title>.

Best
