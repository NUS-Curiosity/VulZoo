Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 14

Part 14 of Broken, Abandoned and Forgotten Code is up. In this final
part, we finish discussing post-exploitation. This is really the most
open-ended phase of exploitation, and I discuss a number of creative
things you can do with your target, once compromised. For this post, I
keep it simple with a reverse-TCP root shell. I discuss building the
stage 2 firmware, then flattening it, so the stage 1 firmware can
download and flash it.

Also, this part has 100% more ponies.

Here's part 14 for your reading pleasure.

If you've only joined in recently, here's the very beginning from back in April.

I hope you've enjoyed following along even half as much as I've
enjoyed writing and sharing it.

As always I welcome feedback via email or Twitter. I'm @zcutlip.

Cheers,
Zach
