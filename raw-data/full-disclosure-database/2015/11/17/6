Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Murgent Content Management System 2015-Q4.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `id` value of the `index.php` and `view-event.php` file. Remote attackers are able to execute 
own sql commands by manipulation of the GET method request with the vulnerable id parameter. The request method to inject the sql 
command is GET and the issue is located on the application-side of the online-service. The sql vulnerability allows remote attackers 
to compromise the database management system that is connected to the web-application.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.2.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
						[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
						[+] index.php
						[+] view-event.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] action > preview &id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
