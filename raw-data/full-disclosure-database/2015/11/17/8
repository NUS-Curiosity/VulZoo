2. Vulnerability Summary

A remote attacker is able to send a crafted email with a payload that
redirects the user to a target url as soon as he opens the email.
3. Technical Details

The vulnerability can be confirmed by sending a HTML email with the
following content:

<meta http-equiv=”refresh” content=”0;URL=’http://www.maliciousurl.com’” />

Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to redirect a user to
a malicious website, allowing hooking the browser with malicious
JavaScript, launching phishing attacks, explore intent-based URI or browser
vulnerabilities.

   - Confirmed on versions up until 7.0.

5. Solution

   - Users from Android Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.3) upwards, should migrate
   the accounts from the AOSP Email App to the Gmail App, since the Gmail App
   version 5.0+ is supported.
   - Users with previous Android versions should upgrade to Ice Cream
   Sandwich or above where possible or use a different email client.

low.**Because

   backport policy posted in the “Notifying Partners” section of
   https://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/overview/updates-resources.html
