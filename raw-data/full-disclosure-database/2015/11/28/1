[ CONTACT ]



We mostly work on BlackArch Linux for our personal use. We share it in
the
hopes that you will contribute by reporting bugs and sharing tools and
ideas.

We have a relaxed project structure. We welcome pull requests of all
sizes
through any means, including Github[0] and email[1].

Also see our Twitter account[2] and IRC channel[3]. Although BlackArch is
the
primary topic in the channel, we also have pleasant conversations about
other
things. Come join us. It's a happy place. And, sometimes, we will drop a
0day
there with no warning (does Kali share 0days with you? Do they even have
0days?).

We wish to thank all of BlackArch's users, mirrors, and supporters. Thanks
for
your help.
