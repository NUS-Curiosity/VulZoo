Subject: [FD] Call For Papers - BSidesCharm (Baltimore, MD)

We are pleased to announce the second annual BSidesCharm to be held at the
Baltimore, MD Convention Center on 23-24 Apr 2016! We have just opened our
Call For Papers and are eagerly accepting submissions.


This area is the hot bed for large defense contractors, niche security
companies, as well as cyber-security related universities, and is
guaranteed to have an awesome audience. Just up the road from the NSA, Fort
Meade, and the current US Cyber Command, it is also the area for Tenable,
SourceFire, Cisco Talos, ZeroFox, and numerous other security companies,
and a certain blimp that flew away. And last year we sold-out within two
weeks!


Full details for the conference is found at the following page:

If you have any great ideas for talks, showing off new tools, or presenting
new findings, we have openings for 20 minute and 50 minute presentations,
as well as 4 hour and 8 hour workshops.

The Call For Papers is open until 30 Jan 2016, and can be found at the
