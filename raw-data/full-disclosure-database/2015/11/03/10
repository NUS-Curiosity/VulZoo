Subject: [FD] Winehat Security Conference

Hi all,
if nobody has already posted it, I would like to link this new security
event, witch is going to be held in Italy but all in English, bringing
together the Italian culture (food, wine, culture) and the InfoSec world.

It will be held in Turin on November 7th and 8th in the Italian Association
of Sommeliers of Piedmont.

The agenda is looking good with speakers from Europe and USA:Dean Sysman,
Philippe Langlois, Michele "antisnatchor" Orru', Matteo Mazzeri, GentilKiwi
and Raoul Chiesa, who seems to be one of the organizers.

The event will be totally free, otherwise I wouldn't have linked it!

Lorenzo.
