Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.2.6

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 30th of October DAVOSET v.1.2.6
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

In new version there was added support of comments in the lists. Also there
were added XXE Injection in NetIQ Access
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Jun/103) to the list and added
support of XML requests via GET (e.g. for NetIQ Access). And removed
non-working services from full list of zombies.

In total there are 155 zombie-services in the list.

Best wishes & regards,
