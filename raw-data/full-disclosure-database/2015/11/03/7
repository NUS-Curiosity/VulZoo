"The Daily Telegraph is a British daily morning English-language broadsheet
newspaper, published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed
throughout the United Kingdom and internationally. The newspaper was
founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in June 1855 as The Daily Telegraph and
Courier, and since 2004 has been owned by David and Frederick Barclay. It
had a daily circulation of 523,048 in March 2014, down from 552,065 in
early 2013. In comparison, The Times had an average daily circulation of

Sunday Telegraph, that was started in 1961, which had circulation of
418,670 as of March 2014. The two printed papers currently are run
separately with different editorial staff, but there is cross-usage of
stories. News articles published in either, plus online Telegraph articles,
may also be published on the Telegraph Media Group's www.telegraph.co.uk
website, all under The Telegraph title." (From Wikipedia)

The vulnerability can be attacked without user login. Tests were performed
on Firefox (37.02) in Ubuntu (14.04) and IE (8.0. 7601) in Windows 7. The
bugs found by using CSXDS.




*(2) XSS Description:*
The description of XSS is: "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type
of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign
and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web
application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side
script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed
are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a
user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it."
