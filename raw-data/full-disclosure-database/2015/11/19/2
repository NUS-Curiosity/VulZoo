Subject: [FD] [CFP] No Big Thing Conference #2 San Francisco, December 5 2015

Dear hackers, dear friends, dear community,

Please find below the Call For Paper for the NBT2 Conference.
The conference will happein in San Francisco on December 5 2015, at the
Salesforce Rincon Caf√© (121 Spear Street, San Francisco, CA 94105).

Appology for the cross postings. Help us spread the word :)

As usual with great, small, non profit conferences, DIY and self
motivation is the rule. The party is the people : come play with us :)

Note: Our budget is low (ransom of independance !). We shall try to
accomodate everybody needing a stay in San Francisco (eg: on the floor
of my appartment), expect to have to make it to SF by your own means.
You're hackers, shouldn't be a big deal right ? :)

Kindest regards,

j-
