Subject: [FD] [KIS-2015-08] ATutor <= 2.2 (edit_marks.php) PHP Code
	Injection Vulnerability

---------------------------------------------------------------
ATutor <= 2.2 (edit_marks.php) PHP Code Injection Vulnerability
---------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.atutor.ca/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 2.2 and prior versions. 	


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /mods/_standard/gradebook/edit_marks.php script:

54.	if (isset($_GET['asc']))
55.	{
56.	    $order = 'asc';
57.	    $order_col = $addslashes($_GET['asc']);
58.	}
59.	else if (isset($_GET['desc'])) {
60.	    $order = 'desc';
61.	    $order_col = $addslashes($_GET['desc']);

[...]

185.	if ((isset($_GET["asc"]) || isset($_GET["desc"])) && $order_col <> "name")
186.	{
187.	    $sort = '$grades['.$order_col.'], SORT_'.strtoupper($order).', $selected_students ...
188.	
189.	    foreach($selected_tests as $test)
190.	    {
191.	        if ($test["gradebook_test_id"] <> $order_col)
192.	            $sort .= ', $grades['.$test["gradebook_test_id"].'], SORT_'.strtoupper($order);
193.	    }
194.	    $sort='array_multisort('.$sort.');';
195.	    eval($sort);
196.	}

User input passed through the "asc" or "desc" GET parameters is not properly sanitized before being used in a
call to the "eval()" function at line 195. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with the "AT_PRIV_GRADEBOOK" privilege.
