Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-10-12: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Freemake
Product: Freemake Video Downloader - Software (Windows) 3.7.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A code execution web vulnerability has been discovered in the official FreemakeVideo Converter v4.1.7 software.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious codes by interaction with a vulnerable software input field.

The security vulnerability is present in the `paste url` module of the software. The download module does not filter the file type .php and 
thus finally allows an attacker to execute for example the calculator. The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers without interaction.
The severity of the issue is high and the bug can be exploited because of a misconfigured file validation mechanism.

The security risk of the code execution vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.8.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the software
vulnerability results in system compromise by a classic url code execution.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Download

Vulnerable Input(s):
			[+] paste url

Affected Module(s):
			[+] .php


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The code execution vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Launch your browser and paste your malicious link in your url input field (Do not process to open your link yet!)
2. Run Freemake VideoDownloader.exe
3. Click paste url
4. The php code executes successful after usage of the url paste
5. Successful reproduce of the code execution vulnerability!
