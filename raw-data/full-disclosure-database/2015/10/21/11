Subject: [FD] Simple PHP static code analysis for security researchers

Hello,

I've just launched http://php-grinder.com where you can scan PHP projects
for potential vulnerabilities.

I hope you find it useful.

P.S. Underlying tool recently (before web-ui) discovered more than 100
vulnerable plugins (reported, confirmed and patched) in wordpress top 1000
list with more than 4.000.000 active installations in total. Details will
be revealed soon.

Marcin "redeemer" Probola
