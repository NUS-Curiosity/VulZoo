Perhaps it's my ignorance talking, but I just don't see how:

"Run this EXE that might contain bad stuff" is worse than:

"Install this .msi as Admin that might contain bad stuff" or "install this
RPM as root that might contain bad stuff" or "install this .pkg as root
that might contain bad stuff."

The vulnerability is installing things when you don't know what they are or
where they came from, not the particular form in which they're packaged. If
it's got a GUI, clicking on its packages is going to prompt you to escalate
privileges and install them.

If I'm missing something, drop some knowledge on me and I'll install it.
Even if it's not signed. :)
