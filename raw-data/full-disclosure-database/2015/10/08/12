Subject: Re: [FD] DDos Attack To Drop The Internet

This used to be a problem, 10+ years ago, since then there has been a lot of work done to protect larger DNS services (root servers in particular) against DDoS:

Subject: [FD] DDos Attack To Drop The Internet

If you were to have a botnet which were to flood random DNS queries for domains that did not exist to the list of DNS servers hosted on http://public-dns.tk/nameservers-all.txt then the root dns servers and the tld dns servers would be overwhelmed without any way to filter the packets, if they were to filter the packets of the DNS servers, they themselves would be turning off DNS, hence they can not do that... If the botnet only hits the DNS servers on the list a few times, filtering those packets would be insignificant. This attack should in essence turn off DNS for the world, hence, turning off the internet as the public knows it today.
