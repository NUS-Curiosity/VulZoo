Subject: [FD] DDos Attack To Drop The Internet

If you were to have a botnet which were to flood random DNS queries
for domains that did not exist to the list of DNS servers hosted on
http://public-dns.tk/nameservers-all.txt then the root dns servers and
the tld dns servers would be overwhelmed without any way to filter the
packets, if they were to filter the packets of the DNS servers, they
themselves would be turning off DNS, hence they can not do that... If
the botnet only hits the DNS servers on the list a few times,
filtering those packets would be insignificant. This attack should in
essence turn off DNS for the world, hence, turning off the internet as
the public knows it today.
