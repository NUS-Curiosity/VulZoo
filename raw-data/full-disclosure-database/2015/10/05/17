JFTR: <iframe src="url"> is HTML, not JavaScript.

      JavaScript is also not necessary to redirect to the download
      page of some morons who still expect their unsuspecting users
      to download and RUN an *.EXE to install their soft^Wcrapware:
      1. <META HTTP-Equiv="refresh" content="5; URL="..."> exists;
      2. Windows' native package format is *.MSI!
