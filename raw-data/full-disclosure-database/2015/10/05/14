Subject: Re: [FD] Watch your Downloads: the risk of the "auto-download"
 feature on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome

Haifei Li, changing the default behavior to open a window asking the
user where to save the file would change nothing.  A "normal user"
would just click the "save" button to save the file in the default
folder.  I also don't think it should be the browser's responsibility
to look for potential malicious DLLs in that directory.  This "normal
user" may not even use the browser to execute this executable file so
they never even see this warning.

If you really want to pursue this problem, I think the OS (MS Windows)
is where you should be looking for a solution.

MS Windows has an "Open File - Security Warning" window before
executing untrusted files.  Again, a "normal user" just clicks "Run"
on that window without reading the warning, but this could be expanded
to also warn about potential malicious DLLs.  Example Image:

As long as a "normal user" is given enough privileges to
destroy/infect/... their OS, they will continue to be careless.  You
will never be able to protect these people from themselves.

With default settings, the file will be downloaded to your "Downloads" folder ("C:\Users\<username>\Downloads").

The attacker may just place a malicious DLL with a specific name into the "Downloads" folder when the victim visits a webpage he/she controls. In future, when the victim tries to download/install good programs (executables) from legitimate websites - of course, the good executable will be downloaded, and will be launched from the "Downloads" folder as well - then the installation/execution progress could be hijacked.

Anyway, the "application directory" is the very first place in the search order when searching/loading for a dll (yoy may want to check this paper I released years ago). So, probably, most of dlls even the system dlls could be hijacked when you place a same-named dll in the executable’s directory, and that's not for the situation that the searching dll is not in anywhere of your system.

I’d also doubt that even a normal user notices a strange dll in his/her "Downloads" folder, does he/she will really delete it immediately? DLLs won’t be executed by themselves anyway, right?

Then, when the user tries to install Adobe Reader from the official adobe.com website, the installation process of Adobe Reader will be hijacked - the modified “VERSION.DLL” will be loaded and my shellcode will be executed.

Other shellcode, for example, running notepad.exe, will be run out of the App Container sandbox and give the attacker control of your system. #BringTheLovelyCalcBackMicrosoft!
