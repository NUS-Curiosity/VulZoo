Subject: [FD] Tool: Race condition chaser on windows

I released a tool to help you exploit race conditions on the filesystem 
on windows here:

https://github.com/realalexandergeorgiev/tempracer

It helped me escalate to local admin in multiple environments, because 
not being administrator seemed highly illogical.

Live long and prosper
