Subject: [FD] Vulnerabilities in HP LaserJet

Hello list!

There are Information Leakage and Insufficient Authorization vulnerabilities 
in HP LaserJet. Vulnerabilities are in control panel of HP network MFP and 
printers. Earlier I informed HP about it.

You can read articles in BBC 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Dec/98) and Global Voices 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2014-December/009067.html) 
about my attacks on network printers of terrorists in Eastern Ukraine and in 
Russia.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are HP network MFP and printers with firmware 20130415 and 
previous versions. Such as in LaserJet 400 MFP M425dn and HP LaserJet M1522n 
MFP.

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site/info_deviceStatus.html

There is access without authorization to information about all settings of 
the printer (read only, but it's possible to find printers with possibility 
to change settings).

Insufficient Authorization (WASC-02):

In section "Print Information Pages" it's possible to print test documents 
without authorization. Thus without login and password it's possible to 
waste paper and cartridge of the printer.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/7589/).
