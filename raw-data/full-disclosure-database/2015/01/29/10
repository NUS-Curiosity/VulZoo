Kaseya Browser Android Path Traversal
Affected Versions: Kaseya Browser 7.0 Android
PDF: http://www.security-assessment.com/files/documents/advisory/Kaseya_Browser_Android_Path_Traversal.pdf

+-------------+
| Description |
+-------------+
This advisory details a vulnerability found within Kaseya Browser Android
application. A path traversal vulnerability was discovered within an exported
content provider, resulting in the disclosure of arbitrary files, including
internal application files.

+--------------+
| Exploitation |
+--------------+
The Kaseya Browser Android application exposes a content provider that is
vulnerable to path traversal. This allows any other application installed on
the device to read arbitrary files using the Kaseya Browser applicationâ€™s
permissions. This can be done by reading from the com.roverapps.retriever
content provider as follows:

content://com.roverapps.retriever/../../../../../sdcard/<file>
content://com.roverapps.retriever/../databases/suitestorage.db
