| Description |
+-------------+

Two critical vulnerabilities were identified in the RemoteSupportManager server.

1.	RELAYFTP Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and SYSTEM Remote Code Execution

The Remote Support Manager RELAYFTP subsystem ships with anonymous file access enabled.
A malicious attacker may leverage this to upload files to the machine running Remote 
Support Manager without having to provide any authentication. By placing the uploaded
files within the RSM web root, arbitrary code execution can be achieved. Code executed
in this manner runs under the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM user.

2.	Download.aspx Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read

The Remote Support Manager webroot includes a Download.aspx script that is accessible
without authentication. A malicious user may leverage this to download arbitrary files
from the machine running Remote Support Manager.

1.	RELAYFTP Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload and SYSTEM Remote Code Execution

Verifying the vulnerability exists is achievable using telnet.

 cartel@...tyfresh ~/code/exploits $ telnet XXXXXXXXXXXX 2000
 Trying XXXXXXXXXXXXXX...
 Connected to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 Escape character is '^]'.

Retrieving and uploading files is done with the EPSV command. When EPSV is issued, the
number between the pipes (5 in this instance) is the data client identifier to be used
in the next command.

Creating a new connection with RELAYFTP, followed by the data client number, associates
it with that client, as shown below:

 -rw-r--r--     2 0      0        1201 Feb 07 09:52 Login.aspx
 
Uploading a file is a matter of issuing the STOR command with the pipe separated
arguments of filename and file length, as shown below:

 EPSV
 229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||15|)
 STOR hello.txt|6
 150 Creating data client for STOR
 
Data sent after a RELAYFTP command associated with the STOR data client will be
written to the associated file.

 Connected to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 RELAYFTP15
 hello

By uploading an .aspx file in this manner, it is possible to gain arbitrary code
execution on the RSM server. A proof of concept exploit automating this is attached
to this advisory.

2. Arbitrary File Download 
 
The download.aspx file in the RSMWeb '/pages/' folder may be used to download 
arbitrary files without authentication. The filename to download is provided as the
"file=" argument as in the following sample URL:

 http://192.168.XXX.XXX:2000/pages/download.aspx?file=download.aspx

By utilising directory traversal it is possible to download files from any folder on
the C:\ filesystem as shown in the following example URL:

 http://192.168.XXX.XXX:2000/Pages/download.aspx?file=..\web.config
