==========================
Vulnerability Description:
==========================

The CMS e107 v. 1.0.4 has a reflecting XSS vulnerability in its
administrative backend which can be exploited by bypassing an XSS filter.

==================
Technical Details:

The filemanager functionality of CMS e107 v. 1.0.4 has a reflecting XSS

By appending specially crafted HTML and/or JavaScript-code, an attacker
could exploit this vulnerability.

http://{TARGET}/e107_admin/filemanager.php?e107_files/%3C%73%63%72%69%70%74%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(34,
88, 83, 83,
