Subject: [FD] [Tool] SPARTA 1.0 BETA

SPARTA is a python GUI application which simplifies network
infrastructure penetration testing by aiding the penetration tester in
the scanning and enumeration phase. It allows the tester to save time by
having point-and-click access to his toolkit and by displaying all tool
output in a convenient way. If little time is spent setting up commands
and tools, more time can be spent focusing on analysing results.

Features:
– Run nmap from SPARTA or import nmap XML output.
– Transparent staged nmap: get results quickly and achieve thorough
coverage.
– Configurable context menu for each service. You can configure what to
run on discovered services. Any tool that can be run from a terminal,
can be run from SPARTA.
– You can run any script or tool on a service across all the hosts in
scope, just with a click of the mouse.
– Define automated tasks for services (ie. Run nikto on every HTTP
service, or sslscan on every ssl service).
– Default credentials check for most common services. Of course, this
can also be configured to run automatically.
– Identify password reuse on the tested infrastructure. If any
usernames/passwords are found by Hydra they are stored in internal
wordlists which can then be used on other targets in the same network
(breaking news: sysadmins reuse passwords).
– Ability to mark hosts that you have already worked on so that you
don’t waste time looking at them again.
– Website screenshot taker so that you don’t waste time on less
interesting web servers.
