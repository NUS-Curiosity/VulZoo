         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  Asterisk may be configured to only allow specific audio or   
                 video codecs to be used when communicating with a            
                 particular endpoint. When an endpoint sends an SDP offer     
                 that only lists codecs not allowed by Asterisk, the offer    
                 is rejected. However, in this case, RTP ports that are       
                 allocated in the process are not reclaimed.                  
                                                                              
                 This issue only affects the PJSIP channel driver in          
                 Asterisk. Users of the chan_sip channel driver are not       
                 affected.                                                    
                                                                              
                 As the resources are allocated after authentication, this    
                 issue only affects communications with authenticated         
                 endpoints.                                                   

    Resolution  The reported leak has been patched.
