Subject: Re: [FD] full name disclosure information leak in google drive

> When you sign up for a Google account and create a profile

when they say "create a profile" they're referring to google plus. the  
302 on https://profiles.google.com should be a solid indicator of  
that. this vulnerability is capable of targeting non-g+ users, and  
that's the point.

here is an example of google acknowledging that names are personal  
information: http://i.imgur.com/VHLfcC2.png
