Corel Software DLL Hijacking



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Corel Software DLL Hijacking
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0001
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/corel-software-dll-hijacking
Date published: 2015-01-12
Date of last update: 2015-01-06
Vendors contacted: Corel
Release mode: User release



2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Uncontrolled Search Path Element [CWE-427]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2014-8393, CVE-2014-8394, CVE-2014-8395, CVE-2014-8396,
CVE-2014-8397, CVE-2014-8398



3. *Vulnerability Description*


Corel [1] has developed a wide range of products that includes graphics, painting, 
photo, video and office software.(CorelDRAW,Corel Photo-Paint, Corel PaintShop Pro, Corel CAD,
Corel Painter, Corel PDF Fusion, Corel VideoStudio and Corel FastFlick among others)
    


When a file associated with the Corel software is opened, the directory of that document
is first used to locate DLLs, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands
by inserting malicious DLLs into the same directory as the document.
    


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Corel DRAW X7 [2]
   . Corel Photo-Paint X7 [3]
   . Corel PaintShop Pro X7 [7]
   . Corel CAD 2014 [4]
   . Corel Painter 2015 [5]
   . Corel PDF Fusion [6]
   . Corel VideoStudio PRO X7 [8]
   . Corel FastFlick [9]

Other versions could be affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*


Given that this is a client-side vulnerability, affected users should avoid opening untrusted
files whose extensions are associated with Corel software and contain any of the DLL files detailed below.
      


6. *Credits*


This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Marcos Accossatto from Core Security
Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquin Rodriguez
Varela from Core Advisories Team.
    


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

[CVE-2014-8393] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file
associated with any of the following Corel applications is executed (CorelDRAW X7, Corel
 Photo-Paint X7, Corel PaintShop Pro X7, Corel Painter 2015 or Corel PDF Fusion). The 
affected application should not be running for the vulnerability to work. The Corel 
software looks for a DLL file called "wintab32.dll" and does not control its path, therefore
 allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with the same name inside the folder where the 
associated file is. The DLL is executed within the context of the application.
    

[CVE-2014-8394] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file
associated with Corel CAD 2014 is executed. Corel CAD 2014 should not be running before
the associated file is executed for the vulnerability to work.
Corel CAD looks for a DLL file called "FxManagedCommands_3.08_9.tx" or "TD_Mgd_3.08_9.dll"
and does not control their path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with the
same name of either DLL inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is
executed within the context of the application.
    

[CVE-2014-8395] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with
Corel Painter 2015 is executed. Corel Painter 2015 should not be running before the associated
file is executed for the vulnerability to work. Corel Painter looks for a DLL file called 
"wacommt.dll" and does not control its path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file 
with the same name inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is executed within
the context of the application.
    

[CVE-2014-8396] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with 
Corel PDF Fusion is executed. Corel PDF Fusion should not be running before the associated 
file is executed for the vulnerability to work. Corel PDF Fusion looks for a DLL file called
"quserex.dll" and does not control its path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file 
with the same name inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is executed within
the context of the application.
    

[CVE-2014-8397] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with 
Corel VideoStudio PRO X7 or Corel FastFlix is executed. Corel Video Studio or Corel FastFlix
should not be running before the associated file is executed for the vulnerability to work. 
Corel PDF Fusion looks for a DLL file called "u32ZLib.dll" and does not control its path, 
therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with the same name inside the folder where the
associated file is. The DLL is executed within the context of the application.
    

[CVE-2014-8398] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with 
Corel FastFlick is executed. Corel FastFlick should not be running before the associated file
is executed for the vulnerability to work. Corel FastFlick looks for DLL files called "igfxcmrt32.dll",
"ipl.dll", "MSPStyleLib.dll", "uFioUtil.dll", "uhDSPlay.dll", "uipl.dll", "uvipl.dll", "VC1DecDll.dll" or
"VC1DecDll_SSE3.dll" and does not control their path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with
the same name of any of those DLLs inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is executed 
within the context of the application.
