Subject: [FD] Wordpress Photo Gallery 1.2.7 unauthenticated SQL injection

Wordpress Photo Gallery Unauthenticated SQL injection

Version 1.2.7 and likely prior of the Photo Gallery plugin (almost 500,000
downloads to date) are vulnerable to an unauthenticated boolean-based and
time-based blind SQL injection.



Vulnerable version:
https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/photo-gallery.1.2.7.zip



Within the following GET request, the order_by parameter, specifically, is
vulnerable.



GET
/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?tag_id=0&action=GalleryBox&current_view=0&image_id=1&gallery_id=1&theme_id=1&thumb_width=180&thumb_height=90&open_with_fullscreen=0&open_with_autoplay=0&image_width=800&image_height=500&image_effect=fade&sort_by=order&order_by=asc&enable_image_filmstrip=1&image_filmstrip_height=70&enable_image_ctrl_btn=1&enable_image_fullscreen=1&popup_enable_info=1&popup_info_always_show=0&popup_info_full_width=0&popup_hit_counter=0&popup_enable_rate=0&slideshow_interval=5&enable_comment_social=1&enable_image_facebook=1&enable_image_twitter=1&enable_image_google=1&enable_image_pinterest=0&enable_image_tumblr=0&watermark_type=none&current_url=p=1

One thing to note is that the characters < and > are filtered to &lt; and
&gt;, respectively, so exploitation requires the use of the BETWEEN keyword
(see â€“tamper=between in sqlmap). It also requires that at least one gallery
have been created with at least one image. The module will attempt to
bruteforce a sufficient gallery ID if none is provided.



Attached is a small example module that will enumerate the tables and the
length of the values within the users table. A more weaponized version that
supports pulling the actual values and storing them is available on
ExploitHub (https://exploithub.com/catalog/product/view/id/571/).



Demo run of weaponized version:
