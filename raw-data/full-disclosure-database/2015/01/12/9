Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official BlitzBasic Blitz Content Management System (CMS).
The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject sql commands by usage of a vulnerable value to compromise the application dbms.

The sql injection vulnerability is located in the `id` value of the vulnerable `view_pic.php` application file. Remote attackers 
are able to inject own sql commands by usage of vulnerable id value in the `view_pic.php` file. A successful attack requires to 
manipulate a GET method request with vulnerable `id` value to inject own sql commands. The injection is a basic order by sql injection 
that allows to compromise the web-application and connected dbms. The attack vector of the issue is located on the application-side 
and the request method to inject own sql commands is GET.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.3.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability result in web-application and database management system compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Community

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] view_pic.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerability `id` value in the view_pic.php file.
Use a prepared statement to fix the issues fully and setup a own exception that prevents sql injection attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerability in the community post file is estimated as critical. (CVSS 8.3)
