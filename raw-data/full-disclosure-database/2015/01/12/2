"The Kindle Post keeps Kindle customers up-to-date on the latest Kindle
news and information and passes along fun reading recommendations, author
interviews, and more."

http://www.omnivoracious.com
"Omnivoracious is a blog run by the books editors at Amazon.com. We aim to
share our passion for the written word through news, reviews, interviews,
and more. This is our space to talk books and publishing frankly and we
welcome participation through comments. Please visit often or add us to

*Vulnerabilities Description:*
Amazon has a security problem. Both Amazon itself and its websites are
vulnerable to different kind of attacks.

When a user is redirected from amazon to another site, amazon will check a
variable named "token". Every redirected website will be given one token.
This idea is OK. However, all URLs related to the redirected website use
the same token. This means if the authenticated site itself has Open
Redirect vulnerabilities. Then victims can be redirected to any site from
Amazon.

The vulnerabilities can be attacked without user login. Tests were
performed on Safari 6.1.6 in Mac OS X 10.7.5, IE 8 in Windows 7, Chromium
(version 37.0.2062.120) in Ubuntu 12.04 (281580) (64-bit).

Use a website for the following tests. The website is "
