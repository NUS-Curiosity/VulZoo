You can use the "forgot password" feature on a google account to find
out someone's full name.

Test it out for yourself:

https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery/
Select "I don't know my password"
Enter bonsaiviking@...il.com (or another gmail address)

On the next screen you will be shown the persons full name and account
avatar. In this case "Daniel Miller".
