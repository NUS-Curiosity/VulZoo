REcon is a computer security conference with a focus on reverse
engineering and advanced exploitation techniques.  It is held annually
in Montreal, Canada.

The conference offers a single track of presentations over the span
of three days along with technical training sessions held before
the presentation dates.  Technical training varies in length between
two and four days.

REcon 2015 is almost upon us.  As with years past, it will offer a
great lineup of trainings, talks from some of the top reversers in the
world, and a lot of fun.

Attendees help define the event. They have always been, and will always
be, those looking to learn something new, share ideas, and unwind in a
welcoming environment. With the release of this CFP, we are happy to
announce registration is now open.

We are now inviting speakers to submit proposals for this year's talks.
Some guidelines for talks are:

 - 30 or 60 minute presentations 
 - We are open to proposals for workshops that would occur alongside
   talks
 - There will be time for five to ten minute informal lightning talks
   during the REcon party
