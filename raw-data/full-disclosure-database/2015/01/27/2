3. Problem Description 

   a. VMware ESXi, Workstation, Player, and Fusion host privilege
      escalation vulnerability

      VMware ESXi, Workstation, Player and Fusion contain an arbitrary 
      file write issue. Exploitation this issue may allow for privilege
      escalation on the host. 

      The vulnerability does not allow for privilege escalation from 
      the guest Operating System to the host or vice-versa. This means
      that host memory can not be manipulated from the Guest Operating
      System.

      Mitigation
      
      For ESXi to be affected, permissions must have been added to ESXi
      (or a vCenter Server managing it) for a virtual machine 
      administrator role or greater.

      VMware would like to thank Shanon Olsson for reporting this issue to
      us through JPCERT.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the identifier CVE-2014-8370 to this issue. 

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is 
      available.

      ESXi           5.0        ESXi      ESXi500-201405101-SG

   b. VMware Workstation, Player, and Fusion Denial of Service 
      vulnerability

      VMware Workstation, Player, and Fusion contain an input validation 
      issue in the Host Guest File System (HGFS). This issue may allow
      for a Denial of Service of the Guest Operating system. 

      VMware would like to thank Peter Kamensky from Digital Security for 
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the identifier CVE-2015-1043 to this issue. 

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is 
      available.

      VMware         Product    Running   Replace with/
      Product        Version    on        Apply Patch
      =============  =======    =======   =================
      Workstation    11.x       any       not affected

      Fusion         7.x        any       7.0.1
      Fusion         6.x        any       6.0.5

   c. VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Player Denial of Service 
      vulnerability

      VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Player contain an input
      validation issue in VMware Authorization process (vmware-authd).
      This issue may allow for a Denial of Service of the host. On 
      VMware ESXi and on Workstation running on Linux the Denial of
      Service would be partial.

      VMware would like to thank Dmitry Yudin @ret5et for reporting
      this issue to us through HP's Zero Day Initiative.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the identifier CVE-2015-1044 to this issue.

   d. Update to VMware vCenter Server and ESXi for OpenSSL 1.0.1 
      and 0.9.8 package

      The OpenSSL library is updated to version 1.0.1j or 0.9.8zc
      to resolve multiple security issues.
