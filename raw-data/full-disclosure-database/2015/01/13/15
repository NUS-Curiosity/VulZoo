Product: Datacard MF180 (Telecom MF180 Modem) - Software  PCW_TNZNZLMF180V1.0.0B02


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local privilege escalation vulnerability has been discovered in the official ZTE Datacard ZTE Datacard MF180 PCW_TNZNZLMF180V1.0.0B02 (Telecom MF180 Modem).
The local security vulnerability allows an attackers to gain higher access privileges by execution of arbitrary codes.

The application is vulnerable to an elevation of privileges vulnerability which can be used by a simple user that can change
the executable file with a binary of choice. The vulnerability exist due to the improper permissions, with the `F` flag (full)
for the `Everyone`(Tout le monde:F) and `Users` group, for the all binary file. The files are installed in the `Ucell Internet`
directory which has the Everyone group assigned to it with full permissions making every single file inside vulnerable to change
by any user on the affected machine. After you replace the binary with your rootkit, on reboot you get SYSTEM privileges.

The security risk of the local privilege escalation vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) 
count of 6.0. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a local privileged systen user account without user for interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the privilege escalation web vulnerability results in software- or system compromise.

The second discovered issue is a dll hijacking vulnerability in the mms_dll_r.dll. The issue allows local attackers 
with process privileges to inject own code to the affected libraries.

The third discovered vulnerability is a denial of service bug that affects the local process. Local attackers are able to manipulate the 
networkCfg.xml to crash the application with a runtime error that results in a unhandled exception.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted account privileges and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

1.2 Path Subversion Arbitrary DLL Injection Code Execution (mms_dll_r.dll)

    ZTE Modems is prone to a flaw in the way it loads dynamic-link libraries (mms_dll_r.dll). The program uses a fixed path
    to look for specific files or libraries. This path includes directories that may not be trusted or under user control.
    By placing a custom version of the file or library in the path, the program will load it before the legitimate version.
    This allows a local attacker to inject custom code that will be run with the privilege of the program or user executing
    the program.This attack can be leveraged remotely in some cases by placing the malicious file or library on a network
    share or extracted archive downloaded from a remote source. This can be done by tricking a user into opening
    an unspecified file from the local file system or a USB drive in some cases

        #include <windows.h>

        BOOL WINAPI DllMain (
                    HANDLE    hinstDLL,
                    DWORD     fdwReason,
                    LPVOID    lpvReserved)

        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        owned();
        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
                case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
                case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;

        return TRUE;

1.3 PoC Local DoS Crash Exploit

First go to C:\program files\Internet Mobile\NetworkCfg.xml (Network configuration) and write "A" * 3000 in <ConfigFileName>"A" x 3000</ConfigFileName>. 
Save it open the program. Now, the poc will crash the software ...


Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the local privilege escalation vulnerability in the path directory is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.0)

1.2
The security risk of the dll injection softwarevulnerability in the mms_dll_r.dll is estimated as medium. (CVSS 5.6)

1.3
The local denial of service vulnerability in the xml configuration file of the software is estimated as medium. (CVSS 2.2)
