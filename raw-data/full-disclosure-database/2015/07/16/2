SAP <http://www.sap.com/>has released the monthly critical patch update 
for July 2015. This patch update closes a lot of vulnerabilities in SAP 
products, some of them belong in the SAP HANA security area. The most 
popular vulnerability is Missing Authorization Check. This month, one 
critical vulnerability found by ERPScan researcher Alexander Polyakov 
was closed.

*Issues that were patched with the help of ERPScan*


Below are the details of SAP vulnerabilities that were found by ERPScan 
<http://www.erpscan.com/> researchers.


  * A Missing Authorization Check vulnerability in SAP XML Data

    Security Note 1945215
    <https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1945215>. An attacker can

Some of our readers and clients asked us to categorize the most critical 
SAP vulnerabilities to patch them first. Companies providing SAP 
Security Audit, SAP Security Assessment, or SAP Penetration Testing 
services can include these vulnerabilities in their checklists. The most 
critical vulnerabilities of this update can be patched by the following 
SAP Security Notes:


  * 2180049 <https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2180049>: SAP ASE
    XPServer has a Missing Authorization Check vulnerability (CVSS Base
    Score: 9.3). An attacker can use Missing Authorization Checks to
