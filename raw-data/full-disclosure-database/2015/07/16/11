Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 11

Part 11 of Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code is up! In this part,
we regenerate the SquashFS filesystem for our exploit firmware. We
have to shrink the firmware image down to 4MB from nearly 9MB to avoid
crashing the R6200's UPnP daemon. We also add one more field to the
firmware header that, if absent, will cause the bootloader to hang.

Here's a link to part 11:

If you missed my post to Full Disclosure where I introduced the
series, here's that:

As always I welcome feedback via email or Twitter. I'm @zcutlip.

I hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
Zach
