Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 10

Part 10 of Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code is up! In this part
we hunt for a UART connection inside the Netgear R6200 router.

When we start developing our minimized bootstrap firmware as well as
the custom, stage 2 firmware in later parts, it will take many
iterations to get it right. During that process it will be essential
to recover a bricked router from a non-functional firmware update. The
UART connection makes it possible to restore a working firmware.

Here's a link to part 10:

If you missed my post to Full Disclosure where I introduced the
series, here's that:

As always I welcome feedback via email or Twitter. I'm @zcutlip.

I hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
Zach
