I think they called it DOS because the chrome.exe process starts to consume
system memory out of control.

In my example (Win7 Chrome 43.0.2357.130) it ended up consuming 4GB+ of
memory before it finally gave up 3 minutes or so later and issued an error
message in both windows.

Potentially, with multiple such frames being launched one could make it
crash.

That's beside the point though as the URL spoofing is clearly there.
