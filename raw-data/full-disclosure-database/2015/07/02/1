"Looks like a fork bomb"
Thanks for testing!
The number of "setTimeout" does NOT need to be increasing forever.
OK, I admit - we are lazy(it works and we don't touch it anymore)
:-)

"it worked on the desktop version of Opera"
Wow! Thanks for letting us know.
Here is the screenshot of Opera

And Chrome

(A number is displayed in Chrome's address bar,
not the same as Opera)

"PoC did not work"
Hey! The trick here is timing:
Please modify those numbers in code - make them smaller.

"Is it reproducible with HTTPS?"
Yes, we just tried this URL
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
It works.
In fact, it works BETTER against HTTPS,
because HTTPS is slower, so timing is easier.

"they show the new URL while still displaying old content"
Exactly, that's the cause of this bug.

In the end, allow me to repeat:
No user interaction on the fake page.
But, anyone can do
"BBB Accredited Business"
"PayPal Partner"
etc.

Kind Regards,

PS
We love clever tricks.
