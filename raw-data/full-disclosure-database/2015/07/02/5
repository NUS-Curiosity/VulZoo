Subject: Re: [FD] Google Chrome Address Spoofing (Request For Comment)

Can you perform any actions on the page once the URL is replaced, or is it
non responsive? (asking because PoC did not work on my Chrome 43.0.2357.130
(64-bit) on OSX). If it is non responsive then the impact is very limited.
Worst thing I can think of is showing "your account is suspended, please
contact technical support on 0800-555-555" and then using the trust user
puts in the URL for phone phishing. If it is responsive, then it's indeed
pretty bad.

Cheers!
