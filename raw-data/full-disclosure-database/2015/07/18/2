Subject: Re: [FD] weblogin software cross site request


: Dork: intitle:weblogin intext:"This page will redirect you to:"

A single site runs this 'WebLogin'.

: Product:WebLogin

What is the vendor URL? Or there is none, because this is a site-specific 
issue for lanl.gov. Worse, it has pretty aggressive filtering and will not 
render script tags, HTML tags, and requires the http:// element it seems.

So this is a site specific issue, with no real value or merit, and doesn't 
apply to anyone else in the world?

Really?
