Subject: [FD] Reflected XSS in GD bbPress Attachments allows an attacker to
	do almost anything an admin can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: GD bbPress Attachments
Version: 2.1
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/gd-bbpress-attachments/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/reflected-xss-in-gd-bbpress-attachments-allows-an-attacker-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in GD bbPress Attachments allows an attacker to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
This plugin outputs the value of $_GET[‘tab’] without escaping (see forms/panels.php lines 3 and 39). An attacker could easily construct an URL which performs virtually any action an admin is able to perform, including creating/deleting users/posts, injecting malicious HTML into user-facing pages, or editing PHP files (if that feature hasn’t been disabled).

Proof of concept
================
Visit the following URL in a browser with no reflected XSS protection (i.e. Firefox or older versions of IE):
http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=forum&page=gdbbpress_attachments&tab=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 2.3 or later
