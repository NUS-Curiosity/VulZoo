	allows attackers to include arbitrary PHP files (WordPress plugin)

Details

Software: GD bbPress Attachments
Version: 2.1
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/gd-bbpress-attachments/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/local-file-include-vulnerability-in-gd-bbpress-attachments-allows-attackers-to-include-arbitrary-php-files/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4.3 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

Description
================
Local File Include vulnerability in GD bbPress Attachments allows attackers to include arbitrary PHP files

Vulnerability
================
An attacker who is an admin can easily include any .php file on the server.
An attacker who can get an admin to follow a link they control will also be able to include that PHP file. It is easy to make these links very convincing.
They could exploit this to attempt to exhaust the server’s resources by including the file that includes the arbitrary file in an infinite loop.
If they’re additionally able to upload arbitrary PHP files (via an admin account or some other vulnerability) they’ll be able to run arbitrary code on the server.
