Not new.
You can type it in the Skype application, and press control-shift-enter,
and it will send the HTML.
e.g., I can put into the chatbox

<a
href="http://jaanuskp.blogspot.com.au/2015/07/fake-links-in-skype.html">google.com</a>
hold down control and shift, and then press enter. It will appear as
google.com, and be clickable to your blog.
