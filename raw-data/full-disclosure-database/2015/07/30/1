Subject: [FD] Assessing The Computer Network Operation (CNO) Capabilities of
 the Islamic Republic of Iran - Report

Hello,

01. Who's who on Iran's Cyber Warfare Scene - the most comprehensive
analysis of Iran's cyber warface scene, ever performed
02. Where do they go to school? - in-depth analysis of Iran's academic
incubators of the next generation of cyber warriors
03. Who's buying them books? - in-depth geopolitically relevant
analysis of Iran's cyber warfare doctrine
04. How do they own and compromise? - complimentary copies of hacking
tools, E-zines, academic papers, SNA (Social Network Analysis) of
Iran's Hacking Scene

An excerpt from the Executive Summary:
"Today's growing cyber warfare arms race, prompts for systematic,
structured, and multidisciplinary enriched processes to be utilized,
in order to anticipate/neutralize and properly attribute an
adversary's strategic, tactical and operational Computer Network
Operation (CNO) capabilities, so that an adequate response can be
formulated and executed on the basis of a factual research answering
some of the most relevant questions in the 'fifth domain' of warfare -
who are our adversaries, what are they up to, when are they going to
launch an attack against us, how exactly are they going to launch it,
and what are they going to target first?

This qualitative analysis (45 pages) seeks to assess the Computer
Network Operations (CNO) of Islamic Republic of Iran, through the
prism of the adversary's understanding of Tactics, Techniques and
Procedures (TTP), a structured and geopolitically relevant, enriched
OSINT assessment of their operations, consisting of interpreted
hacking literature, videos and custom made hacking tools, extensive
SNA (Social Network Analysis) of the country's Hacking Ecosystem,
real-life personalization of the key individuals behind the groups
(personally identifiable photos, personal emails, phone numbers,
Blogs, Web Sites, Social Networking accounts etc.). It's purpose is to
ultimately empower decision/policy makers, as well as intelligence
analysts, with recommendations for countering Islamic Republic of
Iran's growing understanding and application of CNO tactics and
strategies."
