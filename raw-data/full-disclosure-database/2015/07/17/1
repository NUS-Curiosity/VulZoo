Release Date:
=============
2015-07-06


Vulnerability Laboratory ID (VL-ID):
====================================
1542


Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
5.7


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
UDID+ is a simple tool that displays the Unique Device Identifier (UDID) and other information of your iOS device. It works on iPod touches, 
iPhones and iPads allows you to either email the UDID to someone, or to copy it. The UDID is used by developers so they can add your device 
to their Ad Hoc distribution profiles. This allows them to create a special version of their apps that can be run on your device outside of 
the normal App Store distribution channels. Ad Hoc distribution is perfect for beta testing as well as for small in-house projects with an 
limited distribution group, of up to 100 devices.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Core Research Team discovered an application-side command inject web vulnerability in the official UDID+ v2.5 iOS mobile web-application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-07-06:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
EMonster Inc.
Product: UDID+ - iOS Mobile Web Application 2.5


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local command inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official UDID+ v2.5 iOS mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows to inject malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable iOS mobile app.

The vulnerability is located in the device name value of the send by mail function. Local attackers are able to 
manipulate the name value of the device to compromise the mail function of the udid+ mobile app. The html encoding 
is broken in the send by mail export function. Local attackers are able to manipulate the device name id to compromise 
the application internal validation via send by email. The attack vector of the vulnerability is server-side and the 
injection point is the device name information settings.

The security risk of the local commandpath inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability 
scoring system) count of 5.7. Exploitation of the commandpath inject vulnerability requires a low privilege androidios 
device account with restricted access and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in 
unauthorized execution of system specific commands and unauthorized path value requests to compromise the mobile iOS 
application and connected device components.

Vulnerable Module(s)
				[+] Device - Settings - Information
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s)
				[+] device cell name (cid)

Affected Module(s)
				[+] UDID+ - Mail


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side validation web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privilege or restricted device user account and without user interaction.
