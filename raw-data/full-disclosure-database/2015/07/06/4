Subject: [FD] Auditing folders ACLs with Powershell

Hi all,

I would like to present a powershell script that helps you to check/audit
the compliance of the applied folder permissions to the shared folders
hosted by a file server according to the need-to-know defined in your
security policy.

This script allows to export the differences from the baseline (security
policy) so that you can further analyze that.

In these two posts you will find the details about the script and output:

I hope this helps,

Darío
