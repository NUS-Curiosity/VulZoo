Subject: [FD] Stored XSS in Plotly allows less privileged users to insert
	arbitrary JavaScript into posts (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Plotly
Version: 1.0.2
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-plotly/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/stored-xss-in-plotly-allows-less-privileged-users-to-insert-arbitrary-javascript-into-posts/
CVE: CVE-2015-5484
CVSS: 6.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
Stored XSS in Plotly allows less privileged users to insert arbitrary JavaScript into posts

Vulnerability
================
This plugin allows users who do not have the unfiltered_html capability to insert JavaScript into posts/pages which gets executed by the browsers of other users.
On single sites, only Administrators have the unfiltered_html capability, and on multisite, only Super Admins have this capability. This means that e.g. malicious Admins on a multisite, or malicious Editors would be able to perform XSS attacks against other site users and visitors.

Proof of concept
================

Create a new post as a user (without the unfiltered_html capability)
Switch to text mode
Place this link on a line by itself: https://plot.ly/~a/’onerror=’alert(1)’>
View the post


Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.0.3 or later.
N.B. If all accounts are trusted, or all accounts have the unfiltered_html capability, then there is no issue.
