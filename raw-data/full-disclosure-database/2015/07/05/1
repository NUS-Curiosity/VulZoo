Subject: Re: [FD] Google HTTP Live Headers v1.0.6 - Client Side Cross Site
 Scripting Web Vulnerability

Hi,

Quick question with regards to your disclosure - why are you attributing
the ownership/authorship of HTTP Live Headers to Google? The website you
linked seems to clearly says it's developed by eSolutions Nordic AB
("offered by https://www.esolutions.se").

Also, if you found a vulnerability in eSolutions' HTTP Live Headers, why do
you include information about "Google's Chrome Web Store" in the "Product &
Service Introduction"?

And last question - did you notify eSolutions about the bug?

Cheers,
Gynvael
