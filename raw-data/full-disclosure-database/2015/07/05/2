Subject: [FD] Multiple vulnerabilities in Vulcan theme for WordPress + WAF
	bypass

Hello list!

Let's back to vulnerabilities, which I disclosed in April 2011, which can be 
used for DDoS attacks on other sites, e.g. with my DAVOSET 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Jun/111). In addition to hundreds 
of themes, which I wrote about in previous years, here is another theme for 
WordPress, which still didn't fix all holes and there are many sites with 
old version of theme (+ WAF bypass).

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in Vulcan theme for 
WordPress. This is commercial theme for WP.

These are Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse of 
Functionality, Denial of Service and Arbitrary File Upload vulnerabilities.

In 2011 I wrote about Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse of 
Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities in TimThumb and multiple 
themes for WordPress (http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Apr/227), and 
later also was disclosed Arbitrary File Uploading vulnerability.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of Vulcan theme for WordPress (in last versions 
there were fixed only vulnerabilities in TimThumb, but there are still FPD 
in other php-files).

Since version TimThumb 2.8 all vulnerabilities are fixed (in timthumb.php). 
But AoF and DoS holes are fixed by disabling external hosts by default. If 
to change settings (to allow individual or all external hosts), which is 
allowed by software, then it's possible to conduct attacks on other sites. 
E.g. with using of DAVOSET.

WAF bypass:

At many sites unfixed version of TimThumb in theme is used, but they protect 
themselves using WAF (such as ModSecurity). Note, that WAF doesn't protect 
against FPD holes in this theme and TimThumb, and in some cases it doesn't 
protect against AoF and DoS.
