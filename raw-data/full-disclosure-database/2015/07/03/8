Since AV is utterly useless: who cares that AV doesnt work?!
Those who rely on such snake-oil are lost anyway.

To quote Eva Chen of Trend Micro
<http://www.zdnet.com/trend-micro-antivirus-industry-lied-for-20-years-3039440184/>

| Eva Chen, chief executive of Trend Micro, has strong views about how
| effective the antivirus industry has been over the past 20 years.
|
| According to Chen, the security industry has over-hyped how effective
| its products are - and so has been misleading customers - for years.
|
| Chen believes that no single company can offer adequate protection
| against the sheer volume of new viruses that are being churned out
| by cybercriminals. According to the security industry, five and a
| half million new samples were detected in 2007.

But Windows cant execute files from within ZIP files, it needs to extract
them first, into a directory writable by the respective user.

But NO user needs to be able to execute files stored in her user profile:
Windows works properly if you add the following NTFS ACE to (all) your
user profile(s): "(D;OIIO;WP;;;WD)" meaning "deny execute access on all
files in this folder and its subfolders for everybody".

As alternative and better solution use software restriction policies alias
SAFER for the same purpose and allow execution only in %SystemRoot% and
below and %ProgramFiles% and below.

Problem solved!

See above: AV is useless, it doesnt work as advertised and will almost
always fail to detect current malware, so you need a better and reliable
protection anyway.

You dont need to install anything, just use what Windows already offers.

If you need assistance with the setup of SAFER rules take a look at
<http://mechbgon.com/srp>, or use the ready-to-run scripts provided
on <http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/SAFER.html>
