Subject: Re: [FD] Microsoft Office - OLE Packager allows code execution in
 all Office versions,
 with macros disabled and high security templates applied

All - it is probably bad form to respond to my own post, but I've seen some
folk dismiss this out of hand on social media so I wanted to provide two
VERY QUICK proof of concept examples.  These were just put together in 10
minutes.

http://owned.lab6.com/~gossi/research/public/packager/

There's an RTF and .docx version.

You should be able to email these to colleagues.  The "Sales Invoice" file
is a .js file executed in Windows Scripting Host, which causes your PC to
lock (as in, Ctrl+Alt+Delete lock - nothing malicious).  It should work
even if you have application whitelisting setup, by using Rundll32.

Both examples have 0 out of 53 engine detection on Virustotal, and pass
undetected through Cuckoo and Palo-Alto sandboxing, and endpoint security
tools I've tried.  The RTF should pass through most of the leading cloud
mail gateways.
