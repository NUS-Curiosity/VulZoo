Subject: [FD] Admin-only local file inclusion and arbitrary code execution
	in Subscribe to Comments 2.1.2 (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Subscribe to Comments
Version: 2.1.2
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-comments/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/admin-only-local-file-inclusion-and-arbitrary-code-execution-in-subscribe-to-comments-2-1-2/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 8 (High; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
Admin-only local file inclusion and arbitrary code execution in Subscribe to Comments 2.1.2

Vulnerability
================
Administrators can perform Local File include attacks, which is a privilege escalation on systems where the administrator doesn’t have control over the server.
If administrators can upload PHP files (or any file which can contain “<?php …”), they can also perform arbitrary code execution by the same method.

Proof of concept
================

http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=stc-options
Set “Path to header” to “/etc/passwd”
Check “Use custom style for Subscription Manager”
“Update Options”
https://localhost/?wp-subscription-manager=1


Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 2.3 or later
