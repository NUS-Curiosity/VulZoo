What you have found is not a bug in Apache Tomcat but a number of users
who have enabled directory listings for their sites.

Every version of Apache Tomcat for as long as I can remember (and
certainly every release of all currently supported versions) has shipped
with directory listings disabled.

If a user enables directory listings then it is up to them to secure it
in an appropriate manner for their site. It is perfectly possible that
for some sites having directory listings enabled does not present any
security risk.
