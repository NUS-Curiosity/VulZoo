3. Problem Description 

   a. VMware Workstation and Horizon Client memory manipulation issues

      VMware Workstation and Horizon Client TPView.ddl and TPInt.dll 
      incorrectly handle memory allocation. On Workstation, this may
      allow a guest to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on 
      the Windows OS that runs Workstation. In the case of a Horizon 
      Client, this may allow a View desktop to execute code or perform 
      a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon Client.

      VMware would like to thank Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google 
      Security Team for reporting these issues to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
      has assigned the identifiers CVE-2012-0897 and CVE-2015-2336 
      (TPView.dll Code Execution), CVE-2015-2338 and CVE-2015-2339 
      (TPview.dll DoS), CVE-2015-2337 (TPInt.dll Code Execution), and 
      CVE-2015-2340 (TPInt.dll DoS) to these issues.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to 
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is 
      available.

   b. VMware Workstation, Player, and Fusion Denial of Service
      vulnerability

      VMware Workstation, Player, and Fusion contain an input 
      validation issue on an RPC command. This issue may allow 
      for a Denial of Service of the Guest Operating System (32-bit) or 
      a Denial of Service of the Host Operating System (64-bit). 

      VMware would like to thank Peter Kamensky from Digital
      Security for reporting this issue to us.
