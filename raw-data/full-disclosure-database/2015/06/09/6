Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Intermission

We're about halfway through the Broken, Abandoned series
(http://shadow-file.blogspot.com/2015/04/abandoned-part-01.html). I
wrote up a short summary of what we've covered up to now and where we
can expect to go from here.

Stay tuned for Part 8!

Cheers,
Zach
