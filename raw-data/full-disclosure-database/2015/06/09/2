We look forward to your ideas and solutions to the cross-discipline
research on privacy and information retrieval.  The submissions should be
abount but not limited to the following research areas:
    - Privacy-related information retrieval models
    - Privacy in social media, micro blog, and people search
    - Evaluation for privacy-preserving IR
    - Leak of sensitive information in natural languages
    - Privacy in location-based services, recommender systems, and other IR
works on mobile app
    - Privacy preserving IR work for healthcare and other domains.

Potential topics for group discussion:
   - Protecting User Privacy in Search, Recommendation and Beyond: much
damage can be caused as users can be identified in AOL query log data and
Neflix log data, it is important to develop effective and efficient
solutions to protect users' privacy in information retrieval applications.
    - Dataset Distribution and Evaluation: How does privacy affect IR test
dataset distribution and evaluation? Forinstance, web query logs and
medical records could not be shared without privacy concerns to the public
or the researchers. How to anonymize the datasets and make sure that they
can be shared with a certain degree ofprivacy guarantee while at the same
time preserves the utility of the data?
    - Information Exposure Detection: new information retrieval and natural
language processing technologies
​​
are needed to quickly identify components and/or at tributes of a user's
online public profile that may reduce the user's privacy, and warn one's
vulnerability on the Web.
    - Novel Information Retrieval Techniques for Information
Privacy/Security Application: new information retrieval, evaluation, or
machine learning techniques need to be designed that fit the practice of
applications in information privacy and security.
    - Private Information Retrieval Techniques for Enabling Location
Privacy in Location-Based Services: data about a user's location and
historical movements can potentially be gathered by a third party who takes
away the information without the awareness of the service providers and the
users, how location-based services and recommender systems interact with
Location Obfuscation techniques and other Privacy-Enhancing Technologies.
