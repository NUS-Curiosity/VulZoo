Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 8

After a brief intermission last week, the Broken, Abandoned series is
back with part 8. In this part, we switch back to analyzing the
Netgear R6200 upnpd, since that's the ultimate focus of this series.
The mystery firmware header gets a name. Also the buffer overflow
discussed in part 5 is back, this time without authentication.

Here's the link to part 8:

For those interested in getting caught up, here's a link to last
week's intermission, offering a summary of where we've been and where
we're going:

If you missed my post to Full Disclosure where I introduced the
series, here's that:

As always I welcome feedback via email or Twitter. I'm @zcutlip.

I hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
Zach
