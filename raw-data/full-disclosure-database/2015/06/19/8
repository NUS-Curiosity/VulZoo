Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting 
this data? Our security researchers and user community. If you find a site that isn`t following our policies, or a vulnerability 
inside our system, please tell us right away.

====================
Ebay Inc.
Product: Magento - Connect Web Application 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site request forgery vulnerability vulnerability has been discovered in the official Magento Commerce web-application.
The vulnerability allows to execute unauthorized client-side application functions without secure validation or session token protection mechanism.

Th vulnerability is located in the `create messages` input of the `magento-connect/message/message/create/` module. Remote attackers with low privilege 
user accounts are able to delete internal magento messages of other users without authorization. The attacker can for example intercept the session to 
delete all exisiting messages. The type of issue was disclosed to the phpbb board some years ago.

The security risk of the cross site request forgery vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.5. 
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege web-application user account and low user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability 
results in unauthorized delete or add of magento connect service panel messages.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] magento-connect/message/message/create/


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site request forgery web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account and with medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login to magento connect
2. Open the send message module
3. Switch to the code review and watch the vulnerable source
4. Follow the steps in the video to recreate the csrf attack!
Note: Tamper the session to intercept the url in a browser
5. Successful reproduce of the security vulnerability!
