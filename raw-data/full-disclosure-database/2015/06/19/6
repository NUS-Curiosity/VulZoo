Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting 
this data? Our security researchers and user community. If you find a site that isn`t following our policies, or a vulnerability 
inside our system, please tell us right away.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Ebay Inc.
Product: Magento - Premium Themes 2015 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Magento Commerce Premium Theme front-end web-application.
The non-persistent xss vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script code to the application-side of the vulnerable online-service module.

The vulnerability is located in the `general_front` values of the `/css/theme.less.php` front-end template file. Remote attackers are able to inject own 
script codes to client-side application requests. The attack vector is non persistent and the request method to inject/execute is GET. The vulnerable 
source is located in the magento premium theme and the stable release.

The security risk of the cross site web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0. 
Exploitation of the cross site scripting web vulnerability requires no privileged web application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects and 
non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected service modules.

Request Method(s):
							[+] GET
							
Vulnerable Module(s):
							[+] css/less
							
Vulnerable File(s):
							[+] theme.less.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
							[+] general_front


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account and with low user interaction(click).

Encode and parse the vulnerable file parameters to prevent client-side script code injection attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability in the frontend is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.0)
