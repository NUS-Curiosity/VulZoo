Beckhoff IPC diagnostics < 1.8 : Authentication bypass
======================================================

CVE number: CVE-2015-4051
Permalink: http://www.thesecurityfactory.be/permalink/beckhoff-authentication-bypass.html
Vendor advisory: http://ftp.beckhoff.com/download/document/IndustPC/Advisory-2015-001.pdf

-- Info --


Beckhoff IPC diagnostics is support software that is preinstalled on all Beckhoff Industrial PCís (and PLCís) that are running an embedded Microsoft Windows operating system. The software enables various system diagnostics options, as well the possibility to alter various settings.

-- Affected version --

IPC Diagnostics < Version 1.8

-- Vulnerability details --

Due to a lack of authentication when making a call to /upnpisapi, an unauthenticated attacker is able to perform a variety of actions on the system by sending a specially crafted packet. These actions include rebooting the device or injecting a new user that has admin access rights on both the underlaying embedded Windows and webserver. Further access can be obtained on the system by connecting to SMB / FTP / telnet / Ö using the injected user.
