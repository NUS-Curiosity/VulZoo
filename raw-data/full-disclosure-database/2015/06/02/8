Another simple one is:

    <a href="http://www.evil.com" target="_blank" title="http://good.com"
        style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Login <strong>HERE</strong></a>

The browsers will hide "evil.com", and display "good.com" as a tool
tip when you hover the mouse.

The browser makers will tell you the user is not supposed to make
security decisions based on tool tips (no shit). Phishing is the
number one attacker, and the browsers' answer is user education on
tool tips!
