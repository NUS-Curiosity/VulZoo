Call for Papers for 3rd Balkan Computer Congress – BalCCon2k15

11|12|13 September 2015, Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia, Europe, Earth,
Milky Way

https://balccon.org

=========
The Event
=========

Balkan Computer Congress has been conceptualized as a three days
gathering of the international hacker community in the organization of
LUGoNS – Linux Users Group of Novi Sad and Wau Holland foundation from
Hamburg and Berlin. The first part of the program has been envisaged to
be a set of presentations, workshops and lectures on the current topics
regarding privacy, technology, software development, free software &
socio-political issues. Hands-on projects and hacking have been planned
for the second part of the program. We admire and tend to find a role
model in the large scale conferences such as Chaos Communication
Congress, organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC).

========
Our Goal
========

Our goal is to gather all the communities from the region, continent and
the World in an effort to hack, play, learn, pass knowledge and exchange
experience. BalCCon aims to become the central hacker community in South
East Balkan, as well as to provide an opportunity for all people in this
part of Europe to connect and to cooperate. Having said that, we would
like to invite you to make and send us proposals for talks, lectures and
workshops on all topics of relevance. Topics of interest include but are
not limited to:

- - Free Software
- - Electronics & Microcontrollers – things like Arduino’s, ARM, Raspberry
Pi, etc.
- - Hardware / Embedded Reverse Engineering
- - Mobile Communications (LTE/3G/GPRS/HSDPA etc.)
- - RFID, Bluetooth and NFC
