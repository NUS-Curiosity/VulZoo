Subject: Re: [FD] Safari Address Spoofing (How We Got It)

Great blog, Michal!

If you change "http://1.2.3.4/" in your Safari code:
some URL in the real world(for example, dailymail.co.uk).
Your code won't work(page of target domain is simply loaded).

The trick here is: "keep trying to load".

Kind Regards,
