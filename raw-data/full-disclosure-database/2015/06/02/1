**What is SOURCE?**

SOURCE Conference brings security experts and business professionals
together in an intimate and personal environment to discuss the security
industry’s most important issues, technologies, and business trends. SOURCE
places the technical excellence and expertise found at top hacker
conferences in an executive environment where business professionals can
gain insight into the security industry’s most important issues,
technologies, and business trends.

**Who Attends SOURCE?**

SOURCE is designed for top security professionals, advanced IT
professionals, senior and top-level executives, company chief officers
(e.g. CTOs, CISOs), faculty and students from colleges and universities,
members of management and business communities who are looking to connect
with security and technology experts.

**The SOURCE Experience**

SOURCE Dublin attendees experience two full days of world-class sessions
taught by top business and security experts. SOURCE prides itself on
providing an intimate environment where attendees can ask questions,
participate in discussions, and interact with other delegates and speakers.

SOURCE Dublin offers three primary tracks:

coding practices, reverse engineering, new software releases and technology
demonstrations

disclosure, and economics

countermeasures, testing, mobile application security, security testing,
penetration testing, code analysis, process, metrics, etc.

However, we often mix in some talks that we feel are relevant to our
audience, but don’t necessarily fit anywhere else.  Preference typically
goes to talks that fit the tracks, but if you have something compelling &
relevant that doesn’t quite fit elsewhere, feel free to submit it anyway.
