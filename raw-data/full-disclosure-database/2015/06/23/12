Subject: [FD] New version: smalisca - Static Code Analysis tool for Smali
	files

Hi,

We released a version 0.2 of smalisca.

[ DESCRIPTION ]

A static code analysis tool for Smali files.

If you ever have looked at Android applications you know to appreciate
the ability of analyzing your target at the most advanced level. Dynamic
programm analysis will give you a pretty good overview of your
applications activities and general behaviour. However sometimes you’ll
want to just analyze your
application without running it. You’ll want to have a look at its
components, analyze how they interact and how data is tainted from one
point to another.
