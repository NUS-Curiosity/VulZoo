Subject: [FD] Haka v0.3.0 release

Hey list,

A new version (0.3.0) of Haka is available at haka-security.org.

The new release adds a stream-based asm instruction disassembler module
based on Capstone engine. This enables to detect obfuscated shellcode at
network level for instance.

The new version improves also logging performance and fixes various bugs.
Thanks for all users who have reported these bugs.

As a remainder, Haka is an open source security oriented language that
allows to:

* write fine-grained security rules and setup complex mitigation scenarios.
* write text-based and binary-based protocol dissectors.

Haka language is embedded into a modular framework allowing end-users to
apply protocol dissection and security rule evaluation on live captured
traffic.
