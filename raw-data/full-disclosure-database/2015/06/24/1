Hi List,

FYI - This is a post for the n00bs in the audience.  If you already know
how to chain together gadgets to form a ROP chain and get a shell, this
post is not for you.

I know there are some on the list who could benefit by a better
understanding of ROP so:

The target binary/VM as well as some other info is available from the
VulnHub page:
