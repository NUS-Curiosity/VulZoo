Subject: [FD] Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 9

Part 9 of Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code is up! In this part,
we fill out the ambit firmware header enough to satisfy upnpd's loose
validation and have it write the image to flash. Additionally, we have
to binary patch upnpd to get it to play nicely in QEMU, since there's
no physical flash memory in the emulator.

Here's the link to part 9:

Here was a mid-term summary post a couple of weeks ago to help
newcomers get caught up.

If you missed my post to Full Disclosure where I introduced the
series, here's that:

As always I welcome feedback via email or Twitter. I'm @zcutlip.

I hope you enjoy it!

Cheers,
Zach
