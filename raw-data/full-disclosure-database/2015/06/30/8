Hello participants of Mailing List.

I've made next update of the software. DAVOSET v.1.2.5 was released - DDoS
attacks via other sites execution tool (http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

In new version there was added support of cache bypass at web sites. Also
there were added new services into full list of zombies and removed
non-working services from full list of zombies.

In total there are 160 zombie-services in the list.
