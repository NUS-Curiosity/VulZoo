Subject: [FD] Recomendation: Flaw in K9 Web Protection 4.4.268

A flaw exist in K9 Web Protection version 4.4.268 that allow any user to bypass the K9 Web Protection filter by using proxies.
Proxies are well known to bypass ISP filters as well any parental block aplication such as K9 Web Protection.
For this test we have run 638 listed proxies and 25 could bypass the "Proxy Avoidance" category because they were incorrectly categorized.
