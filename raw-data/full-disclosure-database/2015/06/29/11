Summary:

The CollabNet Subversion Edge management frontend login page password field has
autocomplete enabled. This may allow an attacker to retrieve a stored password
from the browsers key store.

Fix proposal:

Set the autocomplete=off attribute for password fields. Provide an option in the
configuration file to configure this feature.

Vendor fix:

There is now a boolean flag in <data>/conf/security.properties which allow these
organizations to activate autocomplete="off".
