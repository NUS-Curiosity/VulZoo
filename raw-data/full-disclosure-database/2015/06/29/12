Summary:

It might be possible for a web page controlled by an attacker to load the
content of this response within an iframe on the attacker's page. The
application's response does not set a suitable X-Frame-Options header in order
to prevent framing attacks.

Fix proposal:

To effectively prevent framing attacks, the application should return a response
header with the name X-Frame-Options and the value DENY to prevent framing
altogether, or the value SAMEORIGIN to allow framing only by pages on the same
origin as the response itself.

Vendor fix:

X-Frame-Options is set by default to DENY. It is configurable.
