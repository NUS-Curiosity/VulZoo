Summary:

The CollabNet Subversion Edge Management Frontend does not protect against brute
forcing accounts. An attacker has infinite tries to guess a valid user password.

Fix proposal:

Implement user specific time penalities or lock outs after a certain amount of
failed logins and provide configuration options for that feature.

Vendor fix:

Invalid logins now cause an exponential increase in response time. The rate of
increase and maximum is configurable with the default settings of 1 minute wait
time after 15 invalid logins in 5 minutes.
