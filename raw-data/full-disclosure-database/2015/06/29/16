Summary:

The web application does not restrict users to be logged in only one and does
not provide a configuration options to configure this feature for admins and/or
user accounts.

Fix proposal:

Implement a single login session restriction configuration option for the web
CollabNet web applications. Notify the user if another person has logged in
from another location.

Vendor comment:

This is the only item we decided was not worth the effort. I've not actually
seen this restriction on any webapp I've ever used.
