Subject: Re: [FD] Major Internet Explorer Vulnerability - NOT Patched

So here's a possibly stupid question: is this entirely an IE flaw, or is 
it tied to the use of Cloudflare by the targeted site as well as the 
attacking site?

I ask because:

1 - I tried to reproduce the attack in a number of ways without using 
CloudFlare, and was unsuccessful.
2 - Since I don't have access to a CloudFlare account, I used Burp to do 
a find/replace for proxied response headers and bodies on 
"www.dailymail.co.uk" and then "dailymail.co.uk" with a target domain 
which does not use Cloudflare, then accessed the Deusen demo page. The 
injection attempt failed.
3 - I then used Burp in the same way, but replaced 
"www.dailymail.co.uk"/"dailymail.co.uk" with a target domain which 
*does* use CloudFlare, and the injection attempt succeeded.

If this is true, am I correct in thinking that while this definitely 
involves a vulnerability in IE, it also depends at least on targeting 
website owners who use JavaScript hosted on shared domains (CloudFlare, 
in this case), which is inherently riskier than hosting it all on one's 
own domain due to the way cross-domain security works in modern browsers?

I don't have time to to a teardown on CloudFlare.JS, but does this also 
depend on some sort of code vulnerability in that file?

Even if one or both of those caveats are true, it's a very impressive 
exploit, but I'd like to make sure the label "universal" is actually 
justified.

Sorry if this has already been discussed elsewhere. I couldn't find 
anything when I looked.
