Subject: Re: [FD] Major Internet Explorer Vulnerability - NOT Patched

Hi David,

Nice one…great find!  And thanks Joey for confirming the bypass of HTTP-to-HTTPS restrictions.

I can confirm that this also affects Spartan Browser (Experimental enabled in about:flags in Internet Explorer 11).

I can also confirm that IE 10 is affected.

IE 9 appears to not be vulnerable. Screenshots below.

Regards,
Zaakiy Siddiqui


IE 11 Spartan - vulnerable (Windows 10)

IE 10 - vulnerable (Windows 7)
