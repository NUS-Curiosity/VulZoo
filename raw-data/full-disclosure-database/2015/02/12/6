Subject: Re: [FD] Major Internet Explorer Vulnerability - NOT Patched

Hi Joey,

 

In my research I found out that the 'x-frame-options' solution doesn't
protect against session hijacking via session cookie theft. It is very
important that you also need to add 'HttpOnly' flags on all cookies.

 

I've published an overview of my research, additional mitigations and
supporting evidence in a web log article:

ross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-fully-patched-internet-explorer-10-and-
11

 

Kind regards,

 

Sijmen Ruwhof

Hi David,

 

"nice" is an understatement here.

 

I've done some testing with this one and, while there *are* quirks, it most

definitely works. It even bypasses standard HTTP-to-HTTPS restrictions.

 

As long as the page(s) being framed don't contain X-Frame-Options headers

(with `deny` or `same-origin` values), it executes successfully. Pending

the payload being injected, most Content Security Policies are also

bypassed (by injecting HTML instead of JavaScript, that is).

 

It looks like, through this method, all viable XSS tactics are open!

 

Nice find!

 

Has this been reported to Microsoft outside (or within) this thread?
