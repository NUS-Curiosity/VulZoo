Subject: Re: [FD] Suspicious URL:Re: Major Internet Explorer Vulnerability -
	NOT Patched

I love "Suspicious URL".
It reminds me the microsoft KB article speaking of "Malicious Hyperlink"

"The most effective step that you can take to help protect yourself from malicious hyperlinks is not to click them."
