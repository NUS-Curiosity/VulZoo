Information
------------
Advisory by Netsparker.
Name: XSS Vulnerability in Banner Effect Header

Vulnerability Type : Cross-site Scripting

Description

By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can
hijack a logged in user’s session. This means that the malicious
hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the
session of the victim while the hacker maintains access. As seen from
the XSS example in this article, if a web application is vulnerable to
cross-site scripting and the administrator’s session is hijacked, the
malicious hacker exploiting the vulnerability will have full admin
privileges on that web application.
