Subject: [FD] Reflected File Download in AOL Search Website

Oren Hafif reported a new kind of attack called Reflected File Download (
https://www.blackhat.com/eu-14/briefings.html#reflected-file-download-a-new-web-attack-vector)
in Black Hat Europe 2014 conference.
More details about the attack you can found in his public presentation:
https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Hafif-Reflected-File-Download-A-New-Web-Attack-Vector.pdf
.
Google and Bing have already fixed the vulnerability but I've found the
same vulnerability in AOL Search Website.
A malicious user could send the link below to a victim that you download a
malicious batch file from autocomplete.search.aol.com domain.
In the link below we have search for 'iramar "||calc||' using the AOL
autocomplete domain. The browser will encode the double quotes but the
server will escape it (\") and return inside the json on the body response.
Since the response has the header "Content-Type:
application/x-suggestions+json;charset=UTF-8" the browser will
automatically try to download the reflected file. Chrome didn't try to
download the file but Internet Explorer and Firefox will.
