Subject: [FD] xaviershay-dm-rails v0.10.3.8 mysql credential exposure

Title: xaviershay-dm-rails v0.10.3.8 mysql credential exposure
Author: Larry W. Cashdollar, @_larry0
Date: 2015-02-17
Download Site: https://rubygems.org/gems/xaviershay-dm-rails
Vendor: Martin Gamsjaeger, Dan Kubb
Vendor Notified: 2015-02-17
Vendor Contact: notreal [at] rhnh.net
Description: This gem provides the railtie that allows datamapper to hook into rails3 and thus behave like a rails framework component. Just like activerecord does in rails, dm-rails uses the railtie API to hook into rails. The two are actually hooked into rails almost identically.
Vulnerability:
The problem is with the execute function exposing the user credentials to the process table.

Lines 169 - 177 in /datamapper/dm-rails/blob/master/lib/dm-rails/storage.rb:
 
   def execute(statement)
          system(
            'mysql',
            (username.blank? ? '' : "--user=#{username}"),
            (password.blank? ? '' : "--password=#{password}"),
            '-e',
            statement
          )
        end

OSVDB:118579
Exploit Code:
	â€¢ $ while (true) do ps -ef |grep [p]assword; done
