As far as I know there are no tools available for this.

However I submitted a talk to HITB2011KUL about exactly this technique
applied to iPhone exploitation. So there should be a tool for this in
October.
Not only covering exploiting ASLR but also ROP payloads that work
against different devices (different library load offset by device
class/firmware version).
