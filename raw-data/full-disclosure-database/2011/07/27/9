Details:
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF)-also known as one-click attack, sidejacking, or session riding-is a type of malicious website exploit. Although this attack type has similarities to cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site scripting requires the attacker to inject unauthorized code into a website, while cross-site request forgery merely transmits unauthorized commands from a user the website trusts. A user that is authenticated by a cookie saved in their web browser could unknowingly send an HTTP request to a site that trusts him and thereby cause an unwanted action.
There is no protection against this kind of attacks in Oracle Enterprise Manager menaning that all the functionallity is vulnerable to XSRF attacks.

Impact:
It is possible for an attacker hosting a malicious web site to perform operations on a victim's behalf. The victim must have a valid session in Oracle Enterprise Manager web console and visit the malicious web site.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.  To narrow the time window when this vulnerability can be exploited you should Log off from Oracle Enterprise Manager web console as soon as you finished using it and do not keep the session opened until it expires.

Fix:
Apply July 2011 CPU.
