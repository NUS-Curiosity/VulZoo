-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari's Webkit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application frees references
from a particular element. When freeing these references, the
application will fail to remove the reference from the rendering object.
Later upon trying to free the element again, the application will access
the freed reference which can lead to code execution under the context
of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
