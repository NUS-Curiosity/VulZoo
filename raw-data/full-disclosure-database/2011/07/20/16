Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers Line Card IP Version 4 Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110720-asr9k

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 July 20 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) running Cisco
IOS XR Software version 4.1.0 contain a vulnerability that may cause
a network processor in a line card to lock up while processing an IP
version 4 (IPv4) packet. As a consequence of the network processor
lockup, the line card that is processing the offending packet will
automatically reload.

Cisco has released a free software maintenance upgrade (SMU) to
address this vulnerability.

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects the following Cisco ASR 9000 Series
devices when they are running Cisco IOS XR Software version 4.1.0
without the SMU asr9k-p-4.1.0.CSCtr26695.tar installed:

  * Cisco ASR 9006 router
  * Cisco ASR 9010 router

To determine the software running on a Cisco ASR 9000 Series device,
log in to the device and issue the show version brief command to
display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device
is running Cisco IOS XR Software by displaying text similar to Cisco
IOS XR Software. The software version is displayed after the text
Cisco IOS XR Software.

The following example identifies a Cisco ASR 9010 that is running
Cisco IOS XR Software Release 4.1.0:

To determine which SMUs are active on the device, issue the show
install active summary command. This command will return a list of
all SMUs installed, as shown in the following example:

    RP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show install active summary

      Active Packages:
        disk0:asr9k-doc-p-4.1.0
        disk0:asr9k-mini-p-4.1.0
        disk0:asr9k-k9sec-p-4.1.0
        disk0:asr9k-video-p-4.1.0

Note: The preceding output shows a device without the SMU
asr9k-p-4.1.0.CSCtr26695.tar installed. Also note that Cisco IOS XR
Software can include multiple SMUs and the output may differ from the
preceding example.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following products are confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Cisco Carrier Routing System (CRS) running any version of Cisco IOS XR Software
  * Cisco XR 12000 Series Routers running any version of Cisco IOS XR Software
  * Cisco 12000 Series Routers running any version of Cisco IOS Software
  * Cisco IOS Software
  * Cisco IOS XE Software
  * Cisco NX-OS Software
  * Cisco ASR 1000 and 5000 Series routers running any version of software
  * Cisco ASR 9000 Series routers running any version of Cisco IOS XR Software other than 4.1.0
  * Cisco ASR 9000 Series routers running Cisco IOS XR Software 
    version 4.1.0 and with the SMU asr9k-p-4.1.0.CSCtr26695.tar installed

    To determine which SMUs are active on the device, issue the show
    install active summary command. This will return a list of all
    SMUs installed:

        RP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show install active summary
        Fri Jul  8 19:02:15.887 CEST
          Active Packages:
            disk0:asr9k-p-4.1.0.CSCtr26695-1.0.0
            disk0:asr9k-p-4.1.0.CSCto96804-1.0.0
            disk0:asr9k-p-4.1.0.CSCto95435-1.0.0
            disk0:asr9k-doc-p-4.1.0

            disk0:asr9k-k9sec-p-4.1.0
            disk0:asr9k-video-p-4.1.0

    Note: The preceding output shows a device with the SMU
    asr9k-p-4.1.0.CSCtr26695.tar installed (in bold). Also note that
    Cisco IOS XR Software can include multiple SMUs and the output
    may differ from the preceding example.

Details
=======

Cisco ASR 9000 Series routers are designed to provide carrier-class
reliability using the Cisco IOS XR Software modular operating system,
offering service and application-level intelligence focused on
optimized video delivery and mobile aggregation in Carrier Ethernet
Services networks.

Cisco IOS XR Software is a distributed operating system designed for
continuous system operation combined with service flexibility and
high performance.

Cisco ASR 9000 Series devices running Cisco IOS XR Software version
4.1.0 contain a vulnerability that may cause a network processor in a
line card to lock up while processing an IPv4 packet. As a
consequence of the network processor lockup, the line card that is
processing the offending packet will automatically reload.

This vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 packets. If only IP
version 6 (IPv6) is in use, the device is not vulnerable.

Both transit IPv4 packets and IPv4 packets directed to the device
itself may trigger this vulnerability.

One or both the following messages may appear in the system log:

  * PLATFORM-DIAGS-3-PUNT_FABRIC_DATA_PATH_FAILED
  * PLATFORM-DIAGS-0-LC_NP_LOOPBACK_FAILED

This vulnerability is documented as CSCtr26695and has been assigned 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-2549

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* CSCtr26695 -  ASR9k:Line Card Issue with NP lockup

CVSS Base Score - 7.8
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   None
    Integrity Impact -         None
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.8
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability described in this
advisory may cause the affected line card to reload. Repeated
exploitation could result in a sustained denial of service (DoS)
condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete 
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS XR Software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
XR Software release train. If a given release train is vulnerable,
then the earliest possible releases that contain the fix, if
available at the time of Advisory, are listed in the "First Fixed
Release" column of the table.
