OK This is not new, but it happened to me just an hour ago.

A stranger on the end of a phone call tells you your PC is infected, and you should download and install a RC server so it can be fixed.

I just been through this and installed Ammyy admin from ammyy.com (Whois - dataguarded) as per the strangers instruction on a VM XP install.
Nothing to see here, so what, big deal etc. etc.

What maybe interesting to some is the IP address it connected to:
prag178.startdedicated.com 62.75.224.229 ports 443, 80, 8080

I reveal the IP address for those of you who might like to update IPTables, databases or just like to write down numbers.

These people scam the ignorant PC user into believing their PC is rife with viruses and trojans in order to get them to part with money.
I wasted an hour of their time, got a first hand education and most likely an infected XP VM to analyse.

regards
D
