I consider our government more dangerous to the country, its citizens, and
the democracy than Bin Laden and friends. Since Barrack Obama did not close
the Guantanamo Bay, it would be a good place for these dangerous folks. Its
especially appealing because they will be denied access to the courts.

Off topic: the US has no ability to police themselves, and should not be
trying to police the world. Its kind of sad that Spain was the only nation
to indict US leaders for their war crimes. And the UN Security Counsel is a
joke - it clearly needs to be permanently expanded from the big five.
