A quad-core Core i7 earns around .00042 BitCoin per day doing pooled
mining, currently, if I did my sums right.  At current exchange rate
that's around 0.6 cents per day.

So, I doubt that mining on a random server's CPU is worth the effort.

If there is a GPU in the server, then it can mine more productively; to
pick a commodity machine at random, one of my boxes with a $100 ATI GPU
can earn around .03 BitCoin at 80 Mhash/sec, or 40 cents per day at
current exchange rates.  At that number it starts to make economic sense
to pwn mining boxes; if an attacker installed mining software on 1,000
nodes with GPUs like my $100 ATI, they'd be generating around $10k per
month at the current exchange rate.
