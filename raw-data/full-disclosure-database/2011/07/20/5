Let's think this through - the primary reason the UN Security Council is a joke is
because for it to take any action requires unanimous votes from the 5 permanent
members plus at least 4 more votes from the 10 rotating members. And you want
to make things worse by making it *larger*?  A better fix would be to remove the
unilateral veto power from the 5 permanent members...
