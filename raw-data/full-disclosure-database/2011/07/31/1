Subject: Silver Bullet : Call for Papers : Nov 12/13 : São Paulo : Brazil

Hello Full-Disclosure readers, the CFP for Silver Bullet 2011 is opened


Silver Bullet 2011 - Information Security Event - Call for Papers

http://www.sbconference.com.br
November 12th & 13th, 2011
São Paulo - Brazil


About:

Silver Bullet will bring together well-known professionals, enthusiasts
and beginners in all things related to information security. Two tracks
covering, but not limited to, technology (building and breaking),
development, management, social aspects and others.

The diversity in topics discussed is just one of the unique
characteristics of the event; vendors will have a space to present their
ideas (in the form of talks or demos), lounge room dedicated to
networking of the participants.

All of this with the high-standards of the founders of the renowned
conference: you sh0t the sheriff, which just had its 5th edition in this
past May.

Why another security event? The concept that you sh0t the sheriff has
been delivered was really well accepted, but very unique, unconventional
and expressive to the community.
Due to these unique factors, some limitations of space and time wouldn't
allow us to grow as the market has demanded, and, the security ecosystem
in Brazil is really broad, comprised of many segments and experience
levels. With this, the talks should vary from really technical
techniques to end-user awareness on how to use social networks.

In short, picture a bigger YSTS, with an additional day, an additional
track and more space.
That is what Silver Bullet is.

The first edition of Silver Bullet will be held at Centro Fecomercio de
Eventos, in São Paulo City, on November 12th & 13th, 2011.
