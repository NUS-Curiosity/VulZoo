Subject: NEW TOOL FOR PEN TEST

We are happy to announce the release of INSECT Pro 2.7 - Ultimate

INSECT Pro examines potentially vulnerable services, exposes points
where an attacker could breach the network, and exploits the
vulnerability to prove its existence without a doubt.

The most easy to use exploit launcher tool on the market:

Weekly exploit updates being distributed, stay tunned!

Regards from Argentina!
