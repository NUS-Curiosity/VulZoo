Subject: [Onapsis Research Labs] New SAP Security In-Depth
 issue - The Invoker Servlet: A Dangerous Detour into SAP Java Solutions

Dear colleague,

We are happy to announce the fourth issue of the Onapsis SAP Security In-Depth publication.

Onapsis' SAP Security In-Depth is a free technical publication leaded by the Onapsis Research Labs with the purpose of providing specialized
information about the current and future risks in the SAP security field, allowing all the different actors (financial managers, information security
managers, SAP administrators, auditors, consultants and the general professional community) to better understand the involved risks  and the
techniques and tools available to assess and mitigate them.

In this edition: "The Invoker Servlet: A Dangerous Detour into SAP Java Solutions", by Mariano Nu√±ez Di Croce and Jordan Santarsieri.

"SAP Application Servers Java, supported by the J2EE Engine, serve as the base framework for running critical solutions such as the SAP Enterprise
Portal, SAP Exchange Infrastructure (XI), SAP Process Integration (PI) and SAP Mobile Infrastructure (MI). Furthermore, customers can also deploy
their own custom Java applications over these platforms.

On December 2010, SAP released an important white-paper describing how to protect against common attacks to these applications. Among the security
concepts detailed, there was one that was particularly critical: the Invoker Servlet. This functionality introduces several threats to SAP platforms,
such as the possibility of completely bypassing the authentication and authorization mechanisms.

This publication analyzes the Invoker Servlet Detour attack, identifying the root cause of this threat, how to verify whether your platform is exposed
and how to mitigate it, effectively protecting your business-critical information against cyber attacks."

We hope you enjoy this new issue!

Kindest regards,
