Well, yes, if you are trying to hide small amounts of data, then there
are many ways to do it with plausible deniability.  I thought you were
talking about booting entire separate OSes based on boot-time
password.  Would be hard to hide that amount of data without at least
raising suspicion to a determined investigator.

Then again, many investigators are not determined.  Keep the partition
small, put it inside another encrypted partition, maybe they'll miss
it.
