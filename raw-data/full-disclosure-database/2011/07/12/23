Subject: printers used for espionage

list,

  Sometime ago I remember reading an article on printers being used to
gain intelligence in an embassy  or government agency.  The printer
had a modified firmware... Did anyone else read that?  Or was I
dreaming again?

  The recent articles about this tactic being used against the US
reminded me of the covert printer surveillance program... but now I
can find no mention of it.
