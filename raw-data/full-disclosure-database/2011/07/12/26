You do not need modified hard-/firmware: most "office" class printers
have a harddisc for spooling and hold&print built in. At today's
harddisc sizes you can store a printer's lifetime of print jobs.
If you want to be really sure simply configure the printer to keep the
jobs on disc. There simply is no need for custom hacking...

Bye
