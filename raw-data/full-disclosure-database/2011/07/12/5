G'Day Ladies and Gents,

it has been already over 3 weeks now, since they've told me they're 
going to fix this flaws, as soon as they've resolved more important 
tasks... I think they had enough time, so here is my first 
disclosure.


Just a little, not that important non-persistent XSS. Cookie 
hijacking possible:

1&search_eforum=<img src=http://wtfhub.com/wp-
content/uploads/2010/12/y-u-no-template1.jpg>

===========================

It gets funnier. They even DO allow HTML in a posting or thread.

===========================


As you can see in the Screenshot, they even allow HTML in your 
Signature. 

And yet another non-persistent XSS (search form), Cookie hijacking 
possible:

lt&exact=false&searchString=<script>alert("wat")</script>

===========================

some fun: http://i.imgur.com/1F141.png

First disclosure, keep that in mind. Now let's hope they fix the 
flaws soon. And btw, I also know they're not critical, so don't 
bitch about it.

Greets,
HypoX
