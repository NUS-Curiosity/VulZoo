The book is old at this point. Why bring it up? I think he is lame too but a review of an old book is just as lame.

Mitnick might have been someone worth knowing back in the day, but trash like the garbage literature hes slapped together serves no purpose other than to fatten his ever-growing bank account. This kind of drivel is better suited for use as outhouse toilet-paper than it is for reading. You know how much this guy makes for each one of his sappy, ear-bleeding, nasle-drowned speeches for The Art of Deception (also titled Being a Faggot)? Do yourself a favor and learn the real way -- aka knowing when to be shady and lie to get what you want like those Goatse-licking Russian and East-Bumfucked European carders (I guess you were never a teenager  --  well, not the kind that got laid)
