Why everybody must cares about the American Constitution, as far as i 
know this apply to it's citizen only and the rest of the world is not 
protected! I don't understand why we all should respect it while USA 
never respect the other constitutions! If i decide to encrypt my data 
and forget the password, how they could force me to decrypt it! I 
recently found a 234mb encrypted truecrypt file in my HD, i don't even 
remember what and when i created it and which keyfile i used!
