Really?  Even if investigators look at the partition sizes?

Once they force you to decrypt the "clean" partition, they'll be able
to see how big it is.  If it doesn't encompass the whole disk's size,
more or less, then they'll know something is missing.  How does
TruCrypt prevent that?  Seems to be very difficult, but maybe you can
enlighten me on that.
