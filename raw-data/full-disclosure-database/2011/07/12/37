Thanks I did read the first link at least.  This doesn't prevent
detection of *something else* on that disk though.

Once you give an investigator the key to the first partition/layer of
encrypted data, they can either see that the partition inside is too
small, or if the encrypted volume is within that volume in some way,
write a bunch of files and see when allocated space hits a wall.  One
way or another, TruCrypt has to prevent the hidden partition from
being overwritten.  

This is why I was saying that using compression (plus perhaps random
disk access; mixing hidden blocks in with non-hidden ones) could help
hide this discrepancy in sizes. However, the investigator can just run
the machine under a debugger to see what is really going on to
discover how much data should be left and where it should reside.

I agree with Thor though, if done carefully there are several ways to
argue "that's not mine" or "I forgot the password" or something
similar.
