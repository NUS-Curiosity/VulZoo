Tim, I actually use TruCrypt now to do exactly what you speak of.   I pre-allocate a fixed virtual disk, and use one passcode for one section of data and a different passcode for a different section of data.   It is impossible to determine if the disk is set up in this manner, and impossible to tell which section of data is being used.   It is actually quite easy to do.

What really concerns me is how ignorant our government is to issues of encryption and technology.  If I am arrested and my laptop seized, and am compelled to give up my "encrypted files," then those factors, as well as the data, become evidence.  When I give up one passphrase that decrypts a collection of my own artwork of nuns riding My Little Ponies leading a cart of newly adopted Cabbage Patch Kids, it will be disclosed as evidence in trial that I not only cooperated 100% with authorities, but that no incriminating evidence whatsoever was found in my files.  This would work in my favor, obviously.

Considering encryption keys to be analogous to keys to a safe containing documents for evidentiary purposes is, quite frankly, stupid.  Prosecutors who think they are doing the world a favor by establishing precedence that actually can be used to a criminal's advantage while reducing our constitutional rights should be forced to work in other industries.  Douche bags.
