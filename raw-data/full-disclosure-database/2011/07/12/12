Subject: Re: Encrypted files and the 5th amendment

Supposing that the US courts decide that people aren't protected by
the 5th ammendment, one solution for protecting your files might be:

Encrypt everything using a one-time pad.  When compelled to provide
the one-time pad, provide a pad that decrypts the data to something
else.  Any resulting plaintext can be crafted.

Ok, sure, that seems pretty painful (storage/protection of pad, etc).
I guess the only other technical solution would be steganography.
