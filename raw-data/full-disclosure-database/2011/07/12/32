Yeah, I'm sure there are ways to draw as little attention as possible, but I also agree with you that in the scope of the investigation, it's not going to take a genius to see that there is something wrong about available size...  However, evidence by exclusion is not admissible.  

But again, the "I forgot" defense is very hard to prove against as well.  What we don't want is a path to where NOT providing unencrypted data is a crime in itself, because all that becomes is a method to ensure that you get prosecuted for *something* irrespective of what can be proved.  

I have a bad feeling about this stuff.
