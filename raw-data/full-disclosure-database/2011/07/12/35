Subject: Re: Encrypted files and the 5th amendment

The fixed-disk method that TruCrypt uses will encrypt a static size of the
disk, and remain unchanged, regardless of the size of the files inside. I
have a file of around 2gb that I use, and currently only holds around 4mb of
data. Of course, you could look at that and say "clearly there must be more
data" but there isn't, since the remainder of the space is just encrypted
"filler" data. Really easy, with TruCrypt, to have "hidden" data in there,
and it becomes visible only when you use the different passphrase to
decrypt.
