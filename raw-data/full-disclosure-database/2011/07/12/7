If you have hate that guy doesn't mean that his book is lame & need not be referred. If you are some pro then you need not refer it. I answered the query of a beginner & this book is good enough for him. If you know anything better, pls guide the guy rather than f**k**g yourself around.

Seriously? Mitnick might have been someone worth knowing back in the day,
but trash like the garbage literature hes slapped together serves no purpose
other than to fatten his ever-growing bank account. This kind of drivel is
better suited for use as outhouse toilet-paper than it is for reading. You
know how much this guy makes for each one of his sappy, ear-bleeding,
nasle-drowned speeches for The Art of Deception (also titled Being a
Faggot)? Do yourself a favor and learn the real way -- aka knowing when to
be shady and lie to get what you want like those Goatse-licking Russian and
East-Bumfucked European carders (I guess you were never a teenager  --
well, not the kind that got laid)

I miss the _uT :/  He would have made this rant into something awful (but
awesome ^_~)

But yeah, fuck that dude. Thinks hes hard cause he spent some time in
Federal Pound-You-In-The-Ass prison? Mothafucka can get in line with tha
rest of us.
