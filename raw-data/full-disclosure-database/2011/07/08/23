Hello,
I hate to break it to you but that isn't the tool used by jester. I
wrote it during research on possibilities on how his tool functioned.
There is allot of bugs since it was more of a hack together of code
rather then being 100% viable. I designed it to run using torsocks
wrapper (http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/) with a 2nd copy running
to cycle the tor nodes due to me being lazy at wanting to code SOCKS5
in C. If you do some beta runs per above how to use it you find it
doesn't switch tor exit nodes either. I also found out latter the null
byte, "\0", was not required for it to have the same effects.
