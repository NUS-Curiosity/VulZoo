Subject: Extended: hashdays 2011 - Call for Papers (#days
	CFP)

Hi,

Due to many request #days the Swiss conference for security, extends its
call for papers (CFP) deadline until July 17th 2011. For details
regarding the submission guidelines see:
https://www.hashdays.ch/call-for-papers.html

Here is why you'd really enjoy presenting at the #days conference:
- We already have a rather impressive line-up of announced speakers:
https://www.hashdays.ch/agenda/
- There will be a speakers dinner. But remember... you should be able to
present your talk somehow the following day :-)

And why you need to visit the conference:
- Early development versions of the conference badge look really
promising: https://www.hashdays.ch/badge.html
- Early bird tickets are still available for a short period of time:
https://www.hashdays.ch/registration/
- And there will be free Club Mate - as long as our stock lasts!

If you would like to support the conference as a sponsor we can offer
attractive sponsoring opportunities. For details please contact:
sponsoring@...con-switzerland.org

Cheers,
The #days organization committee
