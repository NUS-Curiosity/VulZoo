I have found Dell to be very insecure - from their BIOS to their
applications. I've tried to report a number of issues over the years
and all have been ignored. For example, emails to
{secure|security}@...l.com are received but ignored; and calls to
their tech support (overseas call centers) to report a vulnerability
get you transferred into the bit bucket.

I no longer purchase anything Dell. It does not matter if its personal
computers to business servers.
