Subject: Re: Binary Planting Goes "Any File Type"

Ok, Dan, just for you:

Launch Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7 (probably other IE/Win works too), go to File->Open (or press Ctrl+O), browse to Test.html and open it. No double-clicking and you couldn't launch an executable this way. Better?

Cheers,
Mitja
