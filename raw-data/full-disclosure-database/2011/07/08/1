Subject: Dell iDRAC6

Is it only me, but the iDRAC6 from Dell is kinda insecure. The default
username and password is always root / calvin. (I configured a lot of Dell
server from like  R610 to NX3000 and they all share that default password)

 

On the other hand, hp iLO got hardcoded password that change from each
servers they ship.

 

 

Both of them come pre-configured on some private class IP, at least the
iDRAC is not DHCP by default, that's the only thing that make me think it's
not at 100% insecure, but just not secure at 100% either.
