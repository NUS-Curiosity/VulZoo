Hi,

Those of you in the position of getting non-sec people to understand 
what they're doing wrong in security might find this article useful:

The ABZs of Cybersecurity

<If we want people to be safer with their information we can't go the 
"just say no" route since people just won't do that. Abstinence 
doesn't work for school sex programs and it won't work for online 
safety. The main reason for this is because our physical and emotional 
needs are extremely complex, involve multiple chemical interactions in 
multiple areas of our body and you can't just will them to stop. They 
are there. So here's some of the practical security awareness we 
provide to mollify the bad info habits of people in this age of 
instant communications and instant gratifications.>
