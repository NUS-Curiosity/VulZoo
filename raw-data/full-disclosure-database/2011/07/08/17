Mitja,

A question/suggestion:

Have you guys tried influencing where the .hotspotrc files are loaded
from by supplying your own System properties (e.g. "user.dir")?  You
can do this in .jnlp files and probably applet tags as well.  This has
allowed for JRE RCE in the past.

If there is a way to influence it, then you would have a more solid
RCE vector.
