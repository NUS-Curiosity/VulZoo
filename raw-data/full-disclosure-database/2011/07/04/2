Subject: Possible Code Execution vulnerability in
	WordPress ?

hello list,

Sorry this is my first post to this list because i am really worried  
about a  wordpress vulnerability and someone on this list might use  
wordpress aswell
and could give me some advice what todo.

I am using wordpress since 2 years without any trouble, update  
regulary , but last friday, i got a mail from my hoster that someone  
"uploaded"
a phishing script into my "upload folder" in wordpress and google put  
my site on the blocklists aswell.

  After i found out that the "contact form" module might cause the  
problem because i allways found a
  "wpcf7_captcha" directory in my "upload folder , i removed the  
module and all when fine for a day..

Today i received another mail from rsa.com  that the same script is  
still on my site just in a "theme" folder.

I  looked into the installed "phishing script"   http://www.2shared.com/file/M9zwMVr5/www1royalbankcom.html
it seems everything is loaded from https://www1.royalbank.com/  for  
example
https://www1.royalbank.com/common/images/english/logo_rbc_rb.gif  <  
but this is not the original banking site !!

Is this a DNS manipulation ? https://www1.royalbank.com <  ??? when i  
try http://www.royalbank.com it redirects me to the original banking  
site at

http://www.rbcroyalbank.com  !!!!

After  i searched for some information , i found this on the full  
disclosure list , and i am a bit  concerned now....
