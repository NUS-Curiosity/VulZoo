Pray for all the innocent victims of Mumbai attack ..


This is a small answer from All Indians.. Remember we are Together..


You can just kill innocent people .. Women & Childrens..


But There is no Future for you.. We are coming with huge speed..


Corruption will be under control.. Every Indian will have Money n Power..


Then there will be no one to Save you..


You are dirty stamp on Pure Islam.. Try to Understand & Respect it..


Just Remember We are coming


Bye ..


Exit
