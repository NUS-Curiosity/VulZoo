Subject: Re: Binary Planting Goes "Any File Type"

Actually you *can* launch an executable that way, if you add a couple
more clicks afterwards, or you right click on the file and choose a
non default menu option. It's no more ridiculous than any other social
engineering that requires people to hit a hotkey they probably never
heard of and browse all the way to your malicious file...

IMHO what you're reporting is a great way to improve social
engineering attacks. But you should flag it as such rather than
calling it a 0day just for the sake of the fancy word. This is not a
demerit of your work in any way, it's just a matter of using the
proper vocabulary.
