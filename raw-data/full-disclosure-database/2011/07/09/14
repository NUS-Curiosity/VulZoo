I agree the font/colour-scheme is very difficult to read (a feature of
many security-related blogs for some reason) ... but if you use
Firefox then you could just do what I did after glancing at the page
for 5 seconds :
   "View | Page Style | No Style".

It may also help to configure Firefox with a minimum font size of 12 :
  "Tools | Options | Content | Fonts & Colours | Advanced | Minimum Font Size"

That's what these browser features are for :)

How about 12pt Verdana (or *any* other non-serif font) in *bright*
green on black (if you like that old-skool VT chic [and *I* do, though
I prefer a yellow-on-black VT theme] .... at the very least, use any
high-contrast colour scheme in a font-size of at least 12pt.  But
that's only if you want to be kind to your audience ;)
