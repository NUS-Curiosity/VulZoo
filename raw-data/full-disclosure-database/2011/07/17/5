Mumbai Blast death Toll - Approx 20 <-- People actually DIED there.

In retaliation ----> songs.pk was defaced

Wow!!!

Shut the f*%k up and go die, bloody skids. If you want to advertise ur n4m3s there are better ways than using blasts as an agenda, do something technical for a change.

I always had a feeling pirates were behind such attacks.
But music pirates seems to be a bit too much.

Just a tad wishful thinking in that rant, aren't we?

(Incidentally, if every Indian has money, it will require very careful fiscal
policy to avoid some really nasty hyperinflation...)

Science Media - Is that all you got? Is that all you have and can do to
respond back to PK? YAHA/ IHC ko yaad karo ??? Itna hi ban pada tum logon
se.... Itne saare log and bus itna hi ???

 It is often said, when a person dies, its not a single death but death of
many more .... unke aansu ka kya yehi mol hai ?

We might see a few more of these after the recent blasts in India. Cyberwar between both nations can be at peak for some time again!
