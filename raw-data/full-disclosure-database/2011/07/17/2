Subject: Multiple CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL
	modem Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new multiple security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem 
Callisto 821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of Ukrtelecom's
representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about multiple
vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models also
could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into 
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this 
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for 
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct CSRF 
or XSS attack.

CSRF (WASC-09):

This vulnerability allows to clear event logs.

XSS (WASC-08):

http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html?%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

XSS (persistent) (WASC-08):

POST request at page http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html. It's needed to 
set XSS code in the name of parameter (after dot). Vulnerable are the next 
parameters: EmWeb_ns:vim:2., EmWeb_ns:vim:7., EmWeb_ns:vim:11., 
EmWeb_ns:vim:12., EmWeb_ns:vim:13., EmWeb_ns:vim:14., EmWeb_ns:vim:15.

In this case the code will be executed immediately, and also at visiting of 
pages http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html and 
http://192.168.1.1/shared/event_log_selection.html.

To such persistent XSS vulnerability via the name of parameter is vulnerable 
almost all functionality of admin panel (that one which works via POST). 
I've already wrote earlier about some of similar holes via arbitrary 
parameters in other sections of admin panel.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5277/).
