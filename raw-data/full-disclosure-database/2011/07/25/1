Subject: Declarative Security - Browser Addons (Firefox)

Hi All

HTTP response headers (declarative security - X-Frame-Options,
X-Content-Security-Policy etc) force the browser to implement inbuilt
security mechanism against related web attacks. We have released Firefox
addons that finger prints the presence of declarative security headers
in every page which is visited by the user. Precisely, a information
gathering addons.
