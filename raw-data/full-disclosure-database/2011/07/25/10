Vladis,

The rules are clear. If you say you find a backdoor in a placebo, it
does not matter if it has a backdoor or not, you get -1 points. We
cannot guarantee that a program will be non-vulnerable :)

On the other hand, if you do: then shoot us an email at info [ at:]
backdoohiding and we will reward the first one to do it!
