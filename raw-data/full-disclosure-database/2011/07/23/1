Subject: Why Block Mail-archive.com?

What have mail-archive.com done to you that you must block them in DNS, by setting up an empty authority zone for it?

Sabahattin-Gucukoglus-MacBook-Air:~ sgucukoglu$ host -v -t a www.mail-archive.com.

Yes, using another DNS server works, only it turns out there's no UI on the iPhone to change the DNS servers used while on 3G.  Bloody thing.

Cheers,
