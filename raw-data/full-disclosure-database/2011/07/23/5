::sigh:: aren't there about a billion ways to render a browser
'un-usable' and thus have a 'denial of service' condition?

// First thing that popped into my head
javascript:while(1){alert(1)}

ZOMG where's MY bugtraq id? You have to kill the process to exit (there
are protections for retarded behavior like this in FF4 and Chrome, but
not IE8). How about http://20b.org? I'd call that 'abuse of
functionality' (especially on IE)

With HTML5 I'm sure there are a lot more evil things that can be
accomplished (using things like WebGL, etc) to actually crash the
process by consuming a lot of memory/processing power.

My point is there are a lot of 'abuse of functionality' vulnerabilities
out there. Documenting every single one isn't necessarily a useful thing
to do...

Just my $0.02
