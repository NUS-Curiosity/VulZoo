Sorry folks but wrong list, no google of "web log analyser"
and a request to count *all*? http requests. Are css, img, js and json
responses as important as the far smaller number of html "page loads".
I veyr much doubt it...

No mention of platform or web server.

Then you get into the mess that is ISP proxy caches and the tricks used to circumvent this for stats.

Just installing a web log analysis tool does not get you very far in the real world.
