Subject: Google.com - Open Redirect

=======================================================================
Google.com - Open Redirect
=======================================================================

Affected Software : Google.com domain
Severity          : Low
Local/Remote      : Remote
Author            : Piotr Duszynski (@drk1wi)

[Summary]

Due to a domain filtering bug and the way Chrome and Safari browsers 
are interpreting the '%2e' URL encoded char it is possible to
trigger an open redirection through the Google main domain.

[Vulnerability Details]

This vulnerability* has been verified on Chrome and Safari latest 
browsers.

HTTP GET request:

http://www.google.com/sorry/?continue=http://google.wp%252epl

HTTP response body:

HTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: 
http://www.google.wp%2epl/sorry/?continue=http://google.wp%252epl

The fact that the %2e is interpreted as a '.' within the address bar, 
allows to trigger an open redirect.

* - Actually, Google claims that this type of bug does not impose any 
threat to the end user.

[Time-line]

18/06/2011 - Google notified
