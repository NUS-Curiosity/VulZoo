Subject: null informal meets (Jakarta | Las Vegas)

Hi all,

Greetings from null community!

We are planning on having informal null meets at Jakarta (28th July 11) and
Las Vegas (7th August 11) as a few null members will be attending secureAsia
and defcon. The motive is to socialize with the international security
professionals and hackers. We would like to collaborate with individuals and
groups interested in information security as a whole. We are currently
seeking world-wide Chapter leads. Even if you are not currently in a
position to contribute and just want to understand the idea behind null,
it's time we catch up over a beer.
