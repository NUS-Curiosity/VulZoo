Subject: Hacking IPv6 Networks (slides)

Folks,

We've uploaded the slides used during part of our training "Hacking IPv6
Networks" at the Hack in Paris 2011 Conference. The slides are available
at: http://www.hackingipv6networks.com/past-trainings

They contain quite a few insights about IPv6 security, along with a
number of practical examples.

Thanks!

Best regards,
