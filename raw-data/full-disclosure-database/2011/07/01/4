This seems to be in libopie rather than sshd or libpam and happens
when the username is longer than OPIE_PRINCIPAL_MAX.  I'm not sure
exactly where inside libopie it is, but commenting out pam_opie.so
seems to prevent it.

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libpam/modules/pam_opie/pam_opie.c?annotate=1.26
prevents usernames longer than OPIE_PRINCIPAL_MAX from being accepted
by pam_opie.

usually comes from bad judgement.
