We've taken a closer look and haven't been able to replicate the bug. The
PoC URL appears malformed and/or incomplete.

Feel free to contact us directly via security@...gle.com if you'd like to
clarify. Also, don't forget that bugs that are privately reported under the
vulnerability reward program are eligible for a cash rewards! (
