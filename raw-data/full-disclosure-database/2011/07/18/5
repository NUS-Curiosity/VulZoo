Subject: Multiple CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL
	modem Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new multiple security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem
Callisto 821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of Ukrtelecom's
representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about multiple
vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models also
could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into 
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this 
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for 
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct CSRF 
or XSS attack.

CSRF (WASC-09):

In section LAN connection: Ethernet routed 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:3=/configuration/lan_ether_routed.html) 
it's possible to add connection.

In section LAN connection: Ethernet bridged 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:3=/configuration/lan_ether_bridged.html) 
it's possible to add connection.

In section LAN connections (http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan.html) the 
functionality of editing and deleting connections also must be vulnerable to 
CSRF. But because in my modem the functionality of creating connections 
worked incorrectly (it was not possible to create them), then there was no 
possibility to check it.

XSS (WASC-08):

There are many persistent XSS vulnerabilities in above-mentioned 
functionalities.

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:9=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:10=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:11=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:15=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

And also attacks via the names of parameters (when XSS code is setting in 
the name of parameter), which I wrote about earlier 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5277/).

In this case the code will be executed immediately, and also at visiting of 
pages http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html and 
http://192.168.1.1/shared/event_log_selection.html.

In section LAN connection: Ethernet routed 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:3=/configuration/lan_ether_routed.html) 
there are persistent XSS vulnerabilities in some text fields and some hidden 
fields (including XSS attacks via the names of parameters).

In this case the code will be executed immediately, and also at visiting of 
pages http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html and 
http://192.168.1.1/shared/event_log_selection.html. And in case of some 
fields XSS code will execute at page 
http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan.html.

In section LAN connection: Ethernet bridged 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan_create_service.html?EmWeb_ns:vim:3=/configuration/lan_ether_bridged.html) 
there are persistent XSS vulnerabilities in some text fields and some hidden 
fields (including XSS attacks via the names of parameters).

In this case the code will be executed immediately, and also at visiting of 
pages http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html and 
http://192.168.1.1/shared/event_log_selection.html. And in case of some 
fields XSS code will execute at page 
http://192.168.1.1/configuration/lan.html.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5281/).
