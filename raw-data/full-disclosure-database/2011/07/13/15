Subject: Skype <= 5.3.0.120 persistent Cross-Site
	Scripting Issue

Within I will disclose a platform-neutral Cross-site scripting
vulnerability in Skype which can be exploited to hijack user's session
IDs or compromise user's browser/system. The vulnerability is caused by
poor validation and sanitization of input/output.
