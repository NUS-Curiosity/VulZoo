If they can't legislate to get the key, they will restrict the use of crypto
api to weaker encryption maybe, just my .2c


They will sentence you for not cooperate with'em, and at the same time they
will try to crack your file, and if they happen to crack it you will get
sentenced for something else. The 'double' sentence will make people think
before not giving the key.

Interesting.  Hadn't thought about that...

Yeah, definitely.  One can also pretend to cooperate: "Oh, I just had
some source code from a previous job stored there.  It's been so long,
I don't remember the password anymore.  You can ask X corp for the
code."

> I have a bad feeling about this stuff.

Same here.  There are certainly people doing very evil things trying
to hide it with encryption.  On the other hand, how many more of those
evil people will you catch because you are forcing them to give up
keys?  How many people will be put at risk of government abuse or
other unfortunate data leaks due to being compelled to give up keys?
