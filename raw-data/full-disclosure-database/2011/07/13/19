Um .. if you have access to a fast enough Ethernet network (wherever
outside the UK you are) to pull this off, you could just use a vanilla
SIP phone and be done with it.

Cool hack though .. sure is nice of the carriers to supply off-the-shelf
UMTS modules .. cheaper/easier than USRP+GNUradio. Anyone done this to
AT&T's kit this side of the pond?
