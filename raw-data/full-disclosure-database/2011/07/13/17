Hi all,

I think the book "Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking" by Christopher Hadnagy is good for beginners. Just my 2 cents. :)

Best Regards

The book is old at this point. Why bring it up? I think he is lame too but a review of an old book is just as lame.

 If you have hate that guy doesn't mean that his book is lame & need not be referred. If you are some pro then you need not refer it. I answered the query of a beginner & this book is good enough for him. If you know anything better, pls guide the guy rather than fucking yourself around.

Seriously? Mitnick might have been someone worth knowing back in the day, but trash like the garbage literature hes slapped together serves no purpose other than to fatten his ever-growing bank account. This kind of drivel is better suited for use as outhouse toilet-paper than it is for reading. You know how much this guy makes for each one of his sappy, ear-bleeding, nasle-drowned speeches for The Art of Deception (also titled Being a Faggot)? Do yourself a favor and learn the real way -- aka knowing when to be shady and lie to get what you want like those Goatse-licking Russian and East-Bumfucked European carders (I guess you were never a teenager  --  well, not the kind that got laid)

I miss the_uT :/  He would have made this rant into something awful (but awesome ^_~)
But yeah, fuck that dude. Thinks hes hard cause he spent some time in Federal Pound-You-In-The-Ass prison? Mothafucka can get in line with tha rest of us.
