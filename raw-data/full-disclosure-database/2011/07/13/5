What if I give them my password to decrypt the fully encrypted hard
drive.  This would allow them to boot but not login.  It would be
smart to deny giving up the password first then after awhile give in
and comply.  Would one have to keep giving passwords until they are
satisfied.  How deep does the rabbithole really go?
