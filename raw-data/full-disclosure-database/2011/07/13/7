 No Login required: Analyzing the Biggest Bank Robbery in History

Hi,

"I was at a cafe in Bern, Switzerland last year to meet with two other 
ISECOMers: Nick Mayencourt, a Board Director and Philipp Egli an 
ISECOM trainer and the talk turned to robbing banks. That's not 
uncommon because Switzerland is very big on banking and also very big 
on security, especially the OSSTMM. So with the biggest diamond heist 
of the last century in the news again, you may have seen the movie 
based on it called Ocean's Eleven, we took a look at the case through 
the eyes of an OSSTMM Analyst.  This is how it went."

Sorry to all for the problem regarding the login requirements for the

to get direct access.

Sincerely,
