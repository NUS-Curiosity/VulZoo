Just got a number of antivirus nastygrams for that last message.  My
apologies.  Not sure if it was my reply or ector's quoted original.

But concerning the subject of this thread, I believe if you look at
the content of the site there is zero original content to be found.
It seems to be an elaborate link farm.

FWIW, I remember now the last time I saw that code (in the iframe) was
in a spear phishing email.
