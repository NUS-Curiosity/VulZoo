Subject: Hacked servers mining for bitcoins?

Had to deal with a server today that had been hacked (still running
realVNC 4.0, so there's that lovely bypass exploit released 4 years
ago). This server was an exchange/domain controller for a small business.

Not much seemed to have been done to it. From the looks of it, all the
attacker had done was make themselves a new account (domain user, local
admin, username 'sys'), and had then logged into it, downloaded the
Ufasoft bitcoin miner from a russian file sharing site, and then run it.
The file was called `mmc.exe`, and was saved in the new account's `My
Documents`. No other attempts to hide what was being done.

Has anyone seen this before? Can you make more money from generating
bitcoins on a hacked server than sending spam from it? The value of
bitcoin is usually offset by the cost of generating it, but if you're
using other people's resources to do it, it suddenly seems much more
attractive. This looked like a fairly amateur attempt, so it could be a
one-off skiddy, but maybe others will follow...
