Subject: It's just getting worse

Not only was there a critical flaw in the forensic software, but after the designer reported incorrect findings, the prosecution decided to keep it a secret.

Pursuant to my earlier post about an encryption case, http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20078312-281/doj-we-can-force-you-to-decrypt-that-laptop/  , I emailed John Walsh, the US Attorney heading up the case and went into a detailed explanation, complete with hard file-based examples, of how bad an idea it was to attempt to legally compel the defendant to provide decrypted files as evidence, and received no word back at all.    I didn't expect much, but at least a "thanks for providing some technical information on how we making grave mistakes" would have been nice.

Given all the crap I've seen and experienced in my life, you would think I would know better than to expect people with the power of making a difference to actually do the right thing, but for some reason I continue to believe in honor and integrity.   But when I see Florida prosecutors willfully withholding evidence to the *contrary* of what was submitted in the court of law (when a woman's life was at stake) and the arguments that people like Walsh make while disregarding impact on the Constitution, I see how misplaced my trust in government is.  Douche bags.
