PacSec CALL FOR PAPERS
 
TOKYO, Japan -- To address the increasing importance of information security 
in Japan, the best known figures in the international security industry will 
get together with leading Japanese researchers to share best practices and 
technology. The most significant new discoveries about computer network  
attacks will be presented at the ninth annual PacSec conference to be 
discussed. 
 
The PacSec meeting provides an opportunity for foreign specialists to be 
exposed to Japanese innovation and markets and collaborate on practical 
solutions to computer security issues. In an informal setting with a mixture 
of material bilingually translated in both English and Japanese the eminent 
technologists can socialize and attend training sessions. 
 
Announcing the opportunity to submit papers for the PacSec 2011 network 
security training conference. The conference will be held November 9/10th in 
Tokyo. The conference focuses on emerging information security tutorials - it 
is a bridge between the international and Japanese information security 
technology communities.. 
 
Please make your paper proposal submissions before August 3rd, 2011. Slides 
for the papers must be submitted for translation by October 1, 2011 (Which, 
oh so rarely, happens so we are going to start asking for them 
earlier :-P --dr). 

 A some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited number of speaking 
slots are still available. The conference is responsible for travel and 
accomodations for the speakers. If you have a proposal for a tutorial session 
then please email a synopsis of the material and your biography, papers and, 
speaking background to "secwest11 [at] pacsec.jp" . Tutorials are one hour in 
length, but with simultaneous translation should be approximately 45 minutes 
in English, or Japanese. Only slides will be needed for the October paper 
deadline, full text does not have to be submitted. 
 
The PacSec conference consists of tutorials on technical details about current 
issues, innovative techniques and best practices in the information security 
realm. The audiences are a multi-national mix of professionals involved on a 
daily basis with security work: security product vendors, programmers, 
security officers, and network administrators. We give preference to 
technical details and education for a technical audience. 
 
The conference itself is a single track series of presentations in a lecture 
theater environment. The presentations offer speakers the opportunity to 
showcase on-going research and collaborate with peers while educating and 
highlighting advancements in security products and techniques. The focus is 
on innovation, tutorials, and education instead of product pitches. Some 
commercial content is tolerated, but it needs to be backed up by a technical 
presenter - either giving a valuable tutorial and best practices instruction 
or detailing significant new technology in the products. 
 
Paper proposals should consist of the following information: 
 
1) Presenter, and geographical location (country of origin/passport) and 
contact info (e-mail, postal address, phone, fax). 
 
2) Employer and/or affiliations. 
 
3) Brief biography, list of publications and papers. 
 
4) Any significant presentation and educational experience/background. 
 
5) Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph description. 
 
6) Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an important 
tutorial. 
 
7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines ready. 
 
8. Will you have full text available or only slides? 
 
9. Language of preference for submission. 
 
10. Please list any other publications or conferences where this material has 
been or will be published/submitted. 
 
 
Please include the plain text version of this information in your email as 
well as any file attachments, html, or other data variant. Yes, some of our 
reviewers are so curmudgeonly they still read email in text readers.
 
Please forward the above information to "secwest11 [at] pacsec.jp" to be 
considered for placement on the speaker roster.

thanks,
