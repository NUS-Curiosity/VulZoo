Which model is this for? Thompson have made various gateways over the 
years — some better than others, I might add.

The latest BigPond–branded models are locked down so @bigpond.com is 
welded to the end of your PPP username, preventing you from using it 
with another ISP.

Getting around that is a good incentive to get root, IMO. :-)

That’s not the case. Completely separate companies, although the NBN Co 
recently signed a deal that gives them access to Telstra’s physical 
infrastructure (e.g. running fibre through their ducts).
