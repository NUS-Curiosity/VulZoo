Subject: Joomla Content Manager 1.5 Mail Fun

This might be old, but I find this interesting enough that Ill share just in
case.

By accident I ran across several sites that allow you to send an email
containing a link to whatever site you please from any sender you choose,
all under the header of a presumably legitimate site.

An example,

https://www.1stprioritymortgage.com/index.php?option=com_mailto&tmpl=component&link=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuMXN0cHJpb3JpdHltb3J0Z2FnZS5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwP3ZpZXc9YXJ0aWNsZSZpZD04NCUzQXNpdGUtbWFwJm9wdGlvbj1jb21fY29udGVudCZJdGVtaWQ9OTM=

(found by clicking the mail button on all the article pages containing this
software) will send the recipient you designate a link to the page you were
viewing. However, by changing the base64 code above to a link of your own
works as well, thus

https://www.1stprioritymortgage.com/index.php?option=com_mailto&tmpl=component&link=Cmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXZpbGdheXNleC5jb20vdmlydXMucGhwPz1sb2wK

will be sent to the recepient instead. Spoof a legitimate page and you could
easily snag the cluesless plebe into visiting somewhere much more nasty.

Also, entering %22! at the end of the address bar on the forgot password
page seems to briefly authenticate you, though nothing shows as such.
