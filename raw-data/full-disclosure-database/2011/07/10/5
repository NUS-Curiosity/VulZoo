Subject:  phpMyAdmin 3.x preg_replace RCE POC

Last night I spent some time editing the css according to Tweedledoh
recomendations.
It's now a 12pt Verdana, sans-serif font. And I changed the green
color to a better brighter yellowish kind of green. I often feel that
a black background saves my eyes when reading in the middle of the
night.

I thought my audience deserver some kindness for once...
