... [massive sillicon valley] Phone and Internet outage that has left
thousands of customers in the San Jose, Calif., area without phone or
broadband Internet service was caused by vandals who had cut
fiber-optic cables.

Police told the newspaper that four AT&T fiber-optic cables were
severed shortly before 1:30 a.m. PDT along Monterey Highway north of
Blossom Hill Road in South San Jose. A cable in San Carlos, Calif.,
owned by Sprint Nextel was also cut about two hours later, Crystal
Davis, a Sprint spokeswoman confirmed.

Davis said that a manhole cover had been lifted, and the fiber
underground had been cut. She confirmed that the Sprint fiber that was
cut also appeared to be the work of vandals.

KANSAS CITY, Missouri - Vandals cut fiber from a pole Tuesday night,

BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) A fiber optic cable failure that disrupted
telephone service to more than 60,000 customers was caused by at least
one of the lines being severed.

"We conducted a preliminary investigation and it's been determined
that someone cut this cable intentionally," Qwest spokesman Michael
Dunne said Thursday.
...
The Wednesday morning failure most affected Qwest customers in
Bellingham, with scattered outages reported by Verizon customers
elsewhere in Whatcom County before service was restored about five
hours later.

A system of cables along the Interstate 5 corridor links Bellingham's
long-distance lines to a switch in Seattle.

During the outage, "the vast majority of Qwest customers in Bellingham
could not call outside their local calling area," Dunne said. "They
could call their neighbors, but they could not call Seattle, for
example, or 911."

Police officers were asked to report for duty and police vehicles were
stationed at major intersections. Firefighters across the county were
asked to relay emergency needs to county dispatchers.

There were at least two calls to dispatch that originated from
citizens going to fire halls for help, county emergency officials told
The Bellingham Herald.

Service in the rest of the county was intermittent, said Melissa
Barran, spokesperson for Verizon, which provides much of the phone
service in the county outside of Bellingham.

Cellular phone service was disrupted throughout Whatcom County and in
the San Juan Islands, said Georgia Taylor, a Verizon Wireless
spokesperson.

Fiber optic phone lines in Snohomish County were severed for
unexplained reasons twice in two days in September 2001. Those
outages, limited to Whatcom County, caused phone blackouts that
underscored the vulnerability of the county's 911 dispatch system.

When asked whether the latest outage was related to the disruption two
years earlier, Jim Powers, an FBI agent in Bellingham, replied, "That
is of the utmost concern to us."
