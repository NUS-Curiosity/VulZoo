Subject: Rails 3.0.5 - Logfile Injection poc

Hi,

i released a bug description on 16. feb about the X-Forwarded-For variable
not being sanitized, so one can mess with request.remote_ip  (only for
intranet-apps)

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46423/info
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Feb/338

as it still isnt fixed i wondered if it is possible to date back an attack
with a spoofed ip
and it worked for the request-log-analyzer with the production.log
the example dates the requests back to 2009
its also possible to inject binary data. probably not healthy for
logfile-analyzers

little poc-script + results
https://gist.github.com/868268

i wonder how splunk would behave

best regards
