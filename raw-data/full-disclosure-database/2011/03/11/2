Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - March meet - Tuesday
	22nd March 2011

Another 22nd! How spooky is that? If I were a gambling man, I'd be 
betting on horse number 22 coming in 2nd in the 2nd race... or something....

and while we're on the subject of unlikely things, who says there's no 
such thing as free beer? Yes, this month we've found not one but two 
victi^Wsponsors who are deliberately falling foul of our Fight Club 
rules and offering to buy the room a round of drinks! And one of them 
wants to offer you a job to boot! OK, they had me at the free beer, but 
what the hell... I will pause my supping to listen to the job offer... 
and then drink more beer.

Which brings us nicely to the first talk:

   "Quantum Technology - first encounter" by Grégoire Ribordy, Quantum 
Engineer (like a Rocket Scientist, only smaller).

Not only is Grégoire going to explain a lot of stuff that we thought 
might be possible but can't quite believe, but he's also going to buy us 
another round of drinks! How awesome is that? Let's hope they're not to 
scale...

and for the short/fun talk:

   Adrien Kunysz aka Krunch brings us "BOFH meets SystemTap"

and finally...

   Bonus workshop - fibre optic sniffing. Shiny!
