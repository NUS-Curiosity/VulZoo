Subject: Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) v1.1

Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) v1.1 is out!

Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) allows to list logon sessions and add,
change, list and
delete associated credentials (ex.: LM/NT hashes).
This can be used, for example, to perform pass-the-hash on Windows and also
obtain NT/LM hashes from memory (credentials not stored locally
including domain credentials from interactive logons, services, remote
desktop connections, etc.) which can be used in further attacks.

Supports Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 7 and 2008.

This new version fixes issues when running WCE via RDP/Terminal Services,
reads NTLM credentials just by reading memory (no code injection needed,
although the tool implements both methods), and includes a tool
(getlsasrvaddr.exe)
to automatically obtain the addresses needed (among other improvements..).

You can find it here:

Thanks!,
Hernan
