CVE: CVE-2011-0745
CVE URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0745


Introduction
============

SugarCRM is a customer relation management system written in
PHP. There is a free version, Sugar Community Edition, and two
commercial versions, Sugar Professional and Sugar Enterprise.


More Details
============

SugarCRM supports defining so-called roles, that have a given set of
privileges for each object type, such as customers (called "accounts"),
calls and opportunities. A role can then be assigned to users, to which
the defined privileges apply.

These privileges, among others, include View, Edit, Delete and List. The
List privilege controls to what extent a list of existing objects can be
accessed. It may be set to All, Owner or None. When set to Owner, users
to which this applies can only see the objects they own, such as
customers assigned to them.

When trying to create, for example, a new customer, SugarCRM performs a
duplicate check and warns the user, if a customer using the same name
already exists. The warning page includes a listing of the conflicting
entries, regardless of their owner. Furthermore, when reloading the page
at this point, it shows a complete list of all customers, even if the
user's List privilege is limited to Owner. Directly accessing the URL of
this page works in the same way. This likewise applies to contact
entries, too.


Proof of Concept
================

The following URL displays a list of all customers ("accounts"):
http://www.example.org/sugarcrm/index.php?module=Accounts&action=ShowDuplicates

The following URL displays a list of all contacts:
http://www.example.org/sugarcrm/index.php?module=Contacts&action=ShowDuplicates


Fix
===

Upgrade to SugarCRM 6.1.3.


Security Risk
=============

This vulnerability enables logged-in users to see the names of
customers and contact persons, they are not allowed to see. They however
are not able to otherwise access customer or contact person entries,
such as viewing their details. Thus the risk of this vulnerability is
estimated as medium.

The risk in a particular case varies depending on the actual
confidentiality of customer relationships.
