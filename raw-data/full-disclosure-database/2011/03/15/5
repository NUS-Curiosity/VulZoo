So you need a certificate to make this work.  This is out of scope of
what TLS protects against.  If you've got a breach on the X.509 side
of things, TLS won't help you (if you rely on X.509 certificates).

I agree that this can be a problem, but it is not a protocol issue.
It's a server-side misconfiguration, combined with a certificate that
was inappropriately acquired or shared.
