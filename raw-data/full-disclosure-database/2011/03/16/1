It also turns out that I didn't test this issue enough. As I didn't
test with both gnutls and openssl. I only tested with gnutls. Mutt
actually works as I would expect with imaps, smtps and smtp -- with
starttls connection when using openssl. mutt appears to  be _broken_
when using gnutls for imaps, smtps and smtp -- with starttls. (on mutt 1.5.20).
