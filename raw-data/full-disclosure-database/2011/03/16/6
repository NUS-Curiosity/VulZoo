               Rapidly opening and closing TCP connections to services using  
   Description the ast_tcptls_* API (primarily chan_sip, manager, and         
               res_phoneprov) can cause Asterisk to crash after dereferencing 
               a NULL pointer.                                                

    

   Resolution Failure of the fdopen call is detected and dereferencing the    
              NULL pointer is avoided.
