               Rapidly opening manager connections, sending invalid data, and 
   Description closing the connection can cause Asterisk to exhaust available 
               CPU and memory resources. The manager interface is disabled by 
               default.                                                       

    

   Resolution Failed writes to manager clients are flagged and the connection 
              closed.
