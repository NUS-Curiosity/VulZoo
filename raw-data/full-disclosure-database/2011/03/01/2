Maybe I missed it, but do you have a specific patch you want us to review?

As for back porting to stable release versions, that will have to be
determined by the release managers for each version, and that can only be done
once there are actual patches we can look at.  All versions of Python prior to
3.3 are now in stable release mode, so (speaking as the Python 2.6 RM) patches
that add new features or change API just can't be accepted.  I'm skeptical,
but if there are backward compatible changes that can be added as a bug fix to
Python 3.2 or 2.7, those might be considered.

The best way to handle the situation in that case is:

* Develop a patch for Python 3.3 which includes unit tests and documentation,
  get it reviewed, and lobby the Python community for inclusion in 3.3.

* Back port the changes to a standalone library for earlier versions of Python
  and release these on the Cheeseshop.

* Evangelize these separate packages for users who want the full security of
  authenticated encrypted channels.

Please understand that these policies have been in place for many years and we
adhere to them after many hard lessons learned.
