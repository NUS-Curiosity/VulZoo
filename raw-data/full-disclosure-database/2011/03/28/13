Package        : gdm3
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0727 

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the gdm3, the GNOME Desktop Manager,
does not properly drop privileges when manipulating files related to
the logged-in user.  As a result, local users can gain root
privileges.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain a gdm3 package.
The gdm package is not affected by this issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.30.5-6squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your gdm3 packages.
