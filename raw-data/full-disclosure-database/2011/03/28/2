Better question ;)

scnc is written in Perl, and does not suffer from stack 
overflows:

http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/
2010/08/02: A stack overflow vulnerability has been fixed 
that could be triggered when command line arguments were 
longer than 512 bytes. Fixed versions are 1.7.1.3 and 
2.0.0-b4. See socat security advisory 2 for details.

This one is from command line, maybe the next will be in 
the server mode or whatever.

Regards,
