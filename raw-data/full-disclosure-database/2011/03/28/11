You seem to be implying that you released scnc 1.00 in April 2008 and
then we copied it a month later with our Ncat.  But the svn log you
referenced was just us moving Ncat between code repositories.  Chris
Gibson and I wrote Ncat years earlier.  Our first public release
(which did include SSL support) was in 2005:

http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2005/q3/112

Our Ncat certainly wasn't the first reimplementation of Netcat, and it
wasn't even the first to support SSL.  It was just the first to have
all of the features *I* wanted--proxy support (client or server), SSL,
IPv6, connection redirection, connection brokering, portability
(Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.), and more.  See http://nmap.org/ncat/.

I think you write some great tools and produce interesting research.
So if you want to write and maintain a Perl implementation of Netcat,
more power to you!  I'm only sending this email to correct the
mistaken timeline.

Cheers,
Fyodor
