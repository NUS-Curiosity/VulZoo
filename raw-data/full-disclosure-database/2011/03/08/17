Subject: Re: Insect Pro 2.1 : New version release

It seems to be a different version.

IMHO if I have to pay to download it then it's not really free. Insect
should follow the same donation policy as any open source project - download
should be free and donation should be optional. This is probably a non-issue
anyway but I feel the word "free" shouldn't be used in this context, at
least I find it misleading...
