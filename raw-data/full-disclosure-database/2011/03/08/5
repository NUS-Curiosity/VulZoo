I'm on the train and not able to test, but the muttrc(5) man page has

       smtp_url
              Type: string
              Default: ""

              Defines  the  SMTP  smarthost where sent messages should relayed
              for delivery. This should take the form of an SMTP URL, e.g.:



              smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]



              where "[...]" denotes an optional part.  Setting  this  variable
              overrides the value of the $sendmail variable.

Note the "[s]". But yes, you should arguably file a documentation-bug
with the Mutt maintainers, since ssl_starttls does suggest that it works
for SMTP too.
