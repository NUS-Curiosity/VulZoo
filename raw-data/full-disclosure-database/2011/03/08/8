Subject: Re: Mutt: failure to check server certificate in
 SMTP TLS connection

Actually it doesn't seem like switching the configuration 'fixes' the issue.

If I have

set smtp_url = "smtps://testme@...a.com"
set ssl_starttls = yes
set ssl_force_tls = yes

It _still_ connects to the 'incorrect server' fine(I expect it to
connect to lola.com and it connects to gmail's smtp server which
presents a certificate which is not valid for lola.com ... so mutt
should disconnect!).

If I have

set smtp_url = "smtps://testme@...a.com:587"
set ssl_starttls = yes
set ssl_force_tls = yes

mutt is unable to connect.
