Hi,

interestingly, I published version 1.00 of scnc in April 2008, 
the 27th (and it wasn't the first version to be released):
http://www.securiteam.com/tools/5RP0O20O0U.html

And more interestingly, ncat has been integrated in nmap SVN
in May 2008, the 6th:

Initial commit of ncat, as of current sourceforge.net HEAD CVS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Considering this timeline, pardon me if I fix bugs found in my 
softwares, even when some other tools give the same features.

Beside that, scnc is written in pure-Perl, and is easily modifiable 
by anyone. Such really simple (dumb?) stuff should not be written in 
low-level languages such as C.

Regards,
