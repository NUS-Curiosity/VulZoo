Subject: Re: Python ssl handling could be better...

The problem with this discussion is simply one of definition of security.
For some, security is entirely black and white. It is either perfectly
secure or it is not. These are the people who would say telnetd with
authentication is worse/same as telnetd without any authentication. (False
sense of security aside....really?)

On the other hand, there are people who believe in incremental security, or
grey levels of security, where something like a password is at least
somewhat better than none at all.  Where *some* encryption is at least
somewhat better than none at all. These people probably tend to be those
who've actually had jobs in general digital defense...

Unfortunately, one person's level of risk/value/security is not another's,
especially if their definitions are never going to match up.
