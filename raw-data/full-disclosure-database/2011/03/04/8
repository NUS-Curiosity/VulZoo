I can't speak for others, but I don't see anything as black & white.  What I'm railing against is FALSE security.  If it can be trivially broken, it shouldn't be labeled as security.  Python has an incomplete implementation of SSL.  The protocol was not designed to be used w/o authentication.  It's lazy people who took it out.  One cannot implement a lock without pins.  If anyone can walk up and turn the plug, it has no value and if someone is selling that to you to make your house safe, they would be sued.

If we're talking about whether a certain key length would take 20 years vs. implementing more operations to make it last for 50 years, that's a discussion of acceptable levels of risk and it comes down to what's appropriate for the data you're protecting.  If you're talking about whether it takes 5 minutes to download a sniffing program vs. taking 10 minutes to download and configure tools to MITM a connection, that's not shades of grey.  It's freakin broken.

LOL, really?  Have you seen http://extendedsubset.com/?page_id=2 (Marsh Ray)?  What about http://www.sentinelchicken.com/advisories/ (Tim).  

I've worked in security roles since 2000 and I'm credited in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2009 .
