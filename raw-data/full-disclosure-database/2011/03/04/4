Subject: Agnitio Security Code Review Tool v1.2 released

Hi,

I've released an update to Agnitio which I hope will help people
carryout security focused code reviews and find vulnerabilities in the
source code they are reviewing.

v1.2 of Agnitio includes a new application metrics section to give
better visibility of the security code review process and allows you
to monitor trends etc across multiple reviews of an application.

For more information on the changes in this release please visit this page:

You can download Agnitio v1.2 here:

Let me know what you think of it!

Dave
