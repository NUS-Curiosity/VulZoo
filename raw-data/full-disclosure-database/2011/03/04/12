Yes, I have come to the conclusion over the years that some things in
security really are black and white, while other things definitely are
very grey.*  Being able to determine the difference is a key skill for

* To put it another way, the function which describes security return on

  continuous and sometimes discontinuous (stair-stepped), or a mix
  thereof, depending on the situation.
