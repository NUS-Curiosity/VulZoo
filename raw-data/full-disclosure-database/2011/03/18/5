Package        : libcgroup
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1006 CVE-2011-1022
Debian Bug     : 615987

Several issues have been discovered in libcgroup, a library to control
and monitor control groups:

CVE-2011-1006

   Heap-based buffer overflow by converting list of controllers for
   given task into an array of strings could lead to privilege
   escalation by a local attacker.

CVE-2011-1022

    libcgroup did not properly check the origin of Netlink messages,
    allowing a local attacker to send crafted Netlink messages which
    could lead to privilege escalation.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain libgroup packages.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.36.2-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libcgroup packages.
