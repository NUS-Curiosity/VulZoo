Check out /Inside Cyber Warfare/ by Jeffrey Carr, published by O'Reilly.
A little over a year old, it talks most of the higher profile pre-2010
cyberwar events.

It's a good read. In it, he republishes a paper by a military officer on
dealing with cyber events and their legal ramifications.

hope that helps,
