Subject: The "Lots of Sex" Risk and Security Project

Hi,

I posted a new article:

https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/12596-The-Lots-of-Sex-Risk-and-Security-Project.html

There's some interesting info in there for pen testers who ply social 
engineering or phishing tactics. But if you can come to the Troopers 
con (troopers.de) at the end of the month, I'll be there discussing a 
lot of these techniques in depth as well giving examples of many, many 
more.

Sincerely,
-pete.
