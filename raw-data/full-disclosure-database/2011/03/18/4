Package        : chromium-browser
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0779 CVE-2011-1290


Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2011-0779

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 does not properly handle a missing key in an
  extension, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) via a crafted extension.

CVE-2011-1290

  Integer overflow in WebKit allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
  via unknown vectors, as demonstrated by Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and
  Ralf-Philipp Weinmann during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2011.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze4

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed
version 10.0.648.133~r77742-1


We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.
