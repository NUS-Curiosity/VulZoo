Subject: MSA-2524375 fraudulent digital certification
	updates on Windows Phone

Please help to advise the clarification of the MSA-2524375 updates, it may
related to the zeroday.
Regarding to the fraudulent digital certification on March 23rd, 2011
Microsoft was releasing Microsoft Security Advisory 2524375 as per below
url:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2524375.mspx

which describing "..An update is available for all supported versions of
Windows to help address this issue.."
I was reviewing the updates described my Micorosoft is the below url:
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2524375

..and found that Windows Phone a.k.a Windows Mobile wasn't included into the
updates. Does it mean that Microsoft stated that smartphone browser is not
affected by the fraudulent digital certification? Please kindly explain if I
was wrong.
