Subject: Re: Python ssl handling could be better...

Marsh, the thing is that the ssl module was only introduced in python 2.6. [0]
There has been other options for a _long_ time. As an example, (for
https traffic) pycurl. So python developers can and do use public wifi
without problems. Only the ones who do not read warning messages are
at risk.  Of course a fair amount of code would have been written
before the warnings were added...
