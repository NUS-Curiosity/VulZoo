-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's iPhone Webkit library. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way the library implements the .sort
function for an array. The library will trust the implementation of a
particular method which when executed can be used to manipulate elements
out from underneath it. This can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.
