Ok great, but by comparing MitM with sniffing, we're already assuming
the attacker has access to the traffic.  Think about it.  There aren't
any networks in common use today which in their physical
implementation make alteration of packets harder than observation of
packets.  This is why the big-Os are the same.

I've had this conversation at many different times with different
people over the years.  I don't really have the time to continue this
one.  I think if you take the time to think about it from a
theoretical perspective, you'll come to understand the solid arguments
several of us are making.
