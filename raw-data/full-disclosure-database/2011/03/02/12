I don't think you're quite catching on here.  In some practical sense
performing man-in-the-middle attacks is "harder" because of the
technical challenge of managing other people's packets without
breaking things or being noticed.  But in a security sense, they are
the same.  Another way to look at it is O(MitM) = O(sniff).  There may
be some implementation details that make MitM harder, but it's within
a constant factor.

To illustrate this point, we merely need to search the web for MitM
tools.  At the network layer, we could achieve this in one of numerous
ways, including:
  * DNS cache poisoning
  * ARP poisoning
  * routing protocol poisoning (many kinds)
  * ICMP router redirects
  * NETBIOS name poisoning
  * ...

The list goes on, I'm sure.  There are automated tools for all of
these.  Once you've redirected traffic, selectively doing the MitM on
SSL is also very easy, as there are more automated tools out there for
this.

Finally, note that MitM is precisely one of the types of attacks
SSL/TLS is designed to prevent.  When you consider the complexity and
difficulty of the types of cryptographic attacks on the protocol and
its PKI that garner headlines these days, you should quickly realize
that a simple MitM isn't in the same league of difficulty.  Reconsider
your view on how hard it is.  Try it out some time for yourself.
