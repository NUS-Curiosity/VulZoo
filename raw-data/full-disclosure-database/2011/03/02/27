-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's Webkit Library. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a specially
formatted HTML file. When parsing a particular element that also defines
the namespace of the document, the library will call a dangling pointer
which is consistent but unmapped. Due to this being unmapped, if an
attacker can get code loaded at that address this can can lead to code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
