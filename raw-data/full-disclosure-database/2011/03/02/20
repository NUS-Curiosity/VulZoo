Debian Bug     : 614302

Ansgar Burchardt discovered several vulnerabilities in DTC, a web
control panel for admin and accounting hosting services.

CVE-2011-0434
    The bw_per_moth.php graph contains an SQL injection vulnerability.

CVE-2011-0435
    Insufficient checks in bw_per_month.php can lead to bandwidth
    usage information disclosure.

CVE-2011-0436
    After a registration, passwords are sent in cleartext
    email messages.

CVE-2011-0437
    Authenticated users could delete accounts using an obsolete
    interface which was incorrectly included in the package.

This update introduces a new configuration option which controls the
presence of cleartext passwords in email messages.  The default is not
to include cleartext passwords

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.29.17-1+lenny1.

The stable distribution (squeeze) and the the testing distribution
(wheezy) do not contain any dtc packages.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.32.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.
