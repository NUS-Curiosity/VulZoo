Interesting...!

Does that mean that there is a 100 percent risk of the same tsunami over
500 years? Is there a cycle? When was the last one? Risk would be a lot
higher than 10 percent if it was, say, 300 years since the last tsunami....

Haven't dug at all into it, this is just a very spontaneous thought...
