Subject: Re: INSECT Pro 2.5 Release - Web scanner tool

The INSECT Pro version hosted on that site is really old, from what I
see is the version 1.1 and is not an official version, on the other
side. INSECT Pro 2.5 is free and we only ask for a donation to show
interest. The amount of the donation is not fixed.

We want to say thanks to the community that allows us to further
develop and thank to you we can afford a decent hosting so you can
download updates directly from our site.

Just as there are trolls on this list going around and insulting
everyone, too many people are worthwhile and that is why we continue
learning and developing for this project.

Greetings!
Juan Sacco
