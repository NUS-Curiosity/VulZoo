The version made available is older (2.0 version, not 1.1 as you claim), 
but it is an official version, or at least what you gave me as an 
official download.  There is also a recompressed version with the same 
content for a smaller download size for people that want that.
As I said before, I'll happily update the version hosted there to the 
newest version if you allow it.  My download password stopped working at 
the time of the next release, and emails about it have been ignored.

Please, let's not start this up again.  Your page clearly says you are 
buying a license, and has removed all comments about it being free.  The 
licenses of the software you include (Metasploit and Skipfish) allow 
this, and there's no benefit to you making the claim of the software 
being free.  You may or may not offer some licenses gratis, but that's 
different from the software being free in the sense that most people 
understand.  If it's free, I'll happily host newer versions for free 
download for everyone.  Otherwise, stick with the license language you 
have on your website.

To be clear, I have no problem with you offering licenses for sale, 
offering licenses for donations, or making software freely available. 
Just do the one you are claiming to do please.
