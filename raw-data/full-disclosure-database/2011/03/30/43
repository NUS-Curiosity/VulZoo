If a person or company places a host on the public internet and offers
a service, I don't think its reasonable to claim some input is "fair"
and other input is "unfair". Perhaps the person or company should not
offer public services in the first place.

It seems reasonable (to me) that users of the site expect that the
site is relatively defect free and secure. A tech-savy user who tests
the site through its public interface is simply exercising due
diligence before using the services of the site. I personally feel
that individuals and companies which want to criminalize 'due
diligence' is cowardly at best. I don't want to use the services of
such a site; nor do I want to have an account on such a system.
