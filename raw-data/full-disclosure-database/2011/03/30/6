Read the link ( http://nagareshwar.securityxploded.com/2011/03/30/launched-rar-password-unlocker-by-neeraj/ )

It [the tool] uses brute force password recovery technique that can help you to recover not only easy but also complex passwords.

But without any GPU acceleration, it will take forever to bruteforce a complex password.

Use this tool instead: http://www.golubev.com/rargpu.htm
