Nah, not from my POV anyway…   I’m not concerned with who is attacking whom from where – I just tend to say something when people claim to be “ethical hackers” but then say they are going to target a security company because they criticizing the group for targeting people.   It seems redundantly ironic.  Or would that be ironically redundant?

Guys,

Is it because these are Burmese hackers as to why everyone is getting in a pickle, e.g eastern hackers attacking western companies? I feel an Obama moment coming on, where he condemns the group known as YGN.
