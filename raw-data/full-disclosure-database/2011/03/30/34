Steve, thanks to the community support we are able to afford a hosting
for insect pro with unlimited bandwith. Now located in USA which
allows higher transfer rates.

We apologize if you got the wrong picture, but right now we don't need
unofficial hosting... I don't care if you want to share it with
whoever you want. I do appreciate your offer but we are going to pass
this time. We have official releases almost every weeks.

The latest version is on our own site and we started to share every
new version with all our supporters, thus there is no need to include
mirrors so far. If something comes up I'll let you know.

I'm sending you the latest version of Insect Pro 2.5 to your personal
email in a couple of minutes.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to email
me at jsacco@...ecurityresearch.com

Juan Sacco
