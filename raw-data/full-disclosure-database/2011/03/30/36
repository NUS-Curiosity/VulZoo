Subject: Re: Launched New Tool - RAR Password Unlocker

Hey Guys,

That's interesting reversing work and we appreciate your comments on the same.

This tool is from one of our contributing author, Neeraj
(appnimi.com). He is new into this tool development and protocols
where we acknowledge other's contribution in our work.

I have now talked to author and he will be introducing ACK section for
the same. Soon we will update on our pages too.

Generally we give complete credit to other's work however small it may be !

Thank you !

With Regards
Nagareshwar Talekar
