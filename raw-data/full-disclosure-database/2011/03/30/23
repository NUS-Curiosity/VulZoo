That's funny (i.e. pathetic).

A quick search of the tool's website doesn't reveal any links to the
7-zip website.  I'm not going to bother to download this tool, since a
1-line shell script would accomplish the same thing, but if 7-zip
isn't linked to in the accompanying documentation, then that would be
a violation of the LGPL.  From 7-zip's FAQ:

  Can I use the EXE or DLL files from 7-Zip in a Commercial Application?

  Yes, but you are required to specify in your documentation (1) that
  you used parts of the 7-Zip program, (2) that 7-Zip is licensed under
  the GNU LGPL license and (3) you must give a link to www.7-zip.org,
  where the source code can be found.
