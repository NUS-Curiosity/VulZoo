 	Softwink, Inc. [https://www.softwink.com] is proud to release
 Sagan version 0.1.8 [http://sagan.softwink.com].
 
What is Sagan?
 
Sagan is multi-threaded, real-time system- and event-log monitoring software,
but with a twist. Sagan uses a "Snort" like rule set for detecting nefarious
events happening on your network and/or computer systems. If Sagan detects a
"bad thing" happening, it can do a number of things with that information. For
example, Sagan can store the information to a Snort MySQL database for viewing
with utilities like Snorby [http://www.snorby.org],  it can send e-mail(s)
about the event to the appropriate personnel,  it can store to a Prelude back
end, it can also spawn external utilities, as well as numerous other things.
 
Sagan can also correlate the events with your Intrusion Detection/Intrusion 
Prevention (IDS/IPS) system and basically acts like an SIEM (Security
Information & Log Management) system.
 
What's new in Sagan?
 
 * Unified2 output. [src/output-plugins/sagan-unified2.c]
 
This allows Sagan to work in conjunction with programs like Barnyard2
[http://www.securixlive.com/barnyard2/] or Snoge   
[http://leonward.wordpress.com/snoge/]. Via Barnyard, Sagan can also access
output formats such as:
 
   - MySQL,  PostgreSQL,  MS-SQL,  Oracle (Which can give you access to Sagan
     data alongside your IDS/IPS data using consoles like Snorby 
     [http://www.snorby.org] or BASE.)
   - The Prelude framework   
   - Sguil  
   - ..and many more..
 
 * Liblognorm functionality
 
Liblognorm is a log normalization library that Sagan can use to extract
useful information from logged messages; including, TCP/IP information,
user-names,  uid,  etc. This library/project was started by Rainer Gerhards of
"Rsyslog" fame and is being designed from the Mitre CEE (Common Event
Expression) standard (not released/complete). For more information, please
see: http://www.liblognorm.com/news/introducing-liblognorm and  
http://cee.mitre.org.
 
 * "PLOG" support [src/sagan-plog.c]
 
This is a syslog based sniffer created from Marcus J. Ranum's "plog"
work. Sagan can spawn a thread that will "sniff" the wire for syslog traffic.
If traffic is seen, it is re-injected into /dev/log for Sagan to analyze
and/or archive. This is handy for environments resistant to changes.
 
 * Many,  many bug fixes.....
 
Other Sagan features:
 
* Native threaded output support to Snort databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL) 
* Native threaded Prelude plug in
* Threaded libesmtp support (SMTP/e-mail triggered events) based on rule 
  criteria or general Sagan configuration
* Native threaded Logzilla support (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
* 'Snort' like rule set making Sagan compatible with rule management 
  utilities like oinkmaster and pulled pork
* Sagan can spawn external programs when events get triggered. This way,  you
  can write your own "plugin" in the language you choose (perl, C, python, ruby,
  etc).
