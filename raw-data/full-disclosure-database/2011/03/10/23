Hrm....

Could this have something to do with this => http://pastebin.com/rD8hwpxT ? :-P

As far as 'magic secrets' go, either disclose something or don't. Then move on, personally I think posting cryptic messages to a public forum like this is a bit dumb. If you're trying to say something, just say it.
