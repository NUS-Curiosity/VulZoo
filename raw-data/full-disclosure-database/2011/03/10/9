 measuring time to fix for [Firefox] [Internet Explorer] [Safari]

Hi,

It's unusual to get both conditions:

- The exact same bug across multiple different codebases.
- Already partially disclosed.

So the rare opportunity will be seized to provide a direct comparison of
response quality and response time. Some might argue that this is a much
better metric than other common metrics such as "bug counting".

It's not serious by any stretch of the imagination, so those looking for
pwnage can stop reading.

Full details,

Who will handle it best? Results via @scarybeasts


Cheers
Chris
