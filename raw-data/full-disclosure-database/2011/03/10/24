Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

  
CVE-2011-1108

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly implement JavaScript
  dialogs, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
  HTML document.


CVE-2011-1109

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly process nodes in Cascading
  Style Sheets (CSS) stylesheets, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
  vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."


CVE-2011-1113

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 on 64-bit Linux platforms does not properly
  perform pickle deserialization, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.


CVE-2011-1114

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly handle tables, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale node."


CVE-2011-1115

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 does not properly render tables, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."


CVE-2011-1121

  Integer overflow in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
  vectors involving a TEXTAREA element.


CVE-2011-1122

  The WebGL implementation in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.107 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified
  vectors, aka Issue 71960.


In addition, this upload fixes the following issues (they don't have a CVE id yet):

 Out-of-bounds read in text searching [69640]
