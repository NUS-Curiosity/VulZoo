Subject: Re: Facebook URL Redirect Vulnerability

I understand what your saying but I don't agree.  We may have to agree to
disagree on this.

You can obscure a URL several different ways.  For this particular case, I
used decimal to IP.

In the following example, you can see the target URL isn't in a human
readable format.
http://apps.facebook.com/truthsaboutu/track.php?r=http%3A%2F%2F1208929384

Also when you post a link on Facebook,  'apps.facebook.com' is the only text
displayed to the user.
