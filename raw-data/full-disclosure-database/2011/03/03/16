The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only
provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.12-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
