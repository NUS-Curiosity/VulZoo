Subject: Re: Facebook URL Redirect Vulnerability

There are 3 different steps to perform an attack using a URL redirect:  1)
trick the user 2) redirect 3) exploit .. We are using a Facebook URL to
trick the user, we are using the URL redirect as the catalyst to perform an
exploit.

Here are some examples of the types of attacks you can perform with a URL
redirect, CSRF, phishing (fake fb login), and browser exploits (javascript
zombie,0days,etc).

How would you have written the impact section?

To be clear - I was trying to make a point when determining the impact, once
you click on a bad link, bad things will happen.
