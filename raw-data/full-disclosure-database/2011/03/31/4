Oh! And you list the Dept. of Energy as a customer. I used to work
there, and still talk to a lot of the security offices for various
locations. They've never heard of it.

Also, did you get clearance from the DoE's Office of Public Affairs to
list them as a customer? They get touchy about that sort of stuff.
