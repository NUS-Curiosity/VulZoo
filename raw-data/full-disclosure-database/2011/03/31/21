Subject: Re: Vulnerabilities in *McAfee.com

Nothing new under the sun.. i have done some security testing on _open
source_ webapps, and most of the time
if you allert the publisher of your founding ( most of the time remote
code executions, not "boring" XSS ) the answer is tipically "F*** off,
we do not need your help / you are lying / you are a criminal /
etc.etc." showing that bug founding is still looked with diffidence
from many people;

on the other side admins are so proud of themselfs that they do not
want  other people to know they have bad coded something, look at
this: http://forums.pligg.com/questions-comments/23065-pligg-1-1-3-security-vulnerabilities.html#post103328

to close with a semi-serious joke: put all this together and you will
know why black market selling of exploit is increasing his size: at
least someone will appreciate your work and eventually recompensate
you for it..
