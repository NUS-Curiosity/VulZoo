Everyone makes mistakes. Being unable to admit fault is a serious character
flaw for a developer. However for a business, this may be a commercially
sensible strategy.

A long time ago I was asked to demo a MAC web server memory leak to a .mil
address. I declined but provided the details and test script to the contact
and left him to run his own tests. The server turned into a linux box a few
months later. My worry was my demo would be construed as an attack by his
"higher ups".

A lot of businesses do not consider "constructive criticism" as positive and
will sometimes do everything in thier power to "PR" you to death - its
often seen as cheaper than fixing the problem.
