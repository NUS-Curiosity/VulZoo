Hi Juan.

Cool soft. I love how it makes good use of BSD software and put a nice
interface around it so people can use without having to face a horrible
black console.

Last week, I was trying to write an exploit, you know, it's so hard. And
I was thinking on how INSECT PRO can help me do it. Sadly it can't right
now, but if it only came with a binary differ, then it would be so much
easier! then, it came to me: there is a differ with BSD license and
would be great to include in INSECT! the differ is called "TurboDiff",
you can download it from here:
http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&action=attachment&type=tool&page=turbodiff&file=turbodiff_v1.0.1b2.zip

I tried to use without INSECT with it's somewhat difficult.
I hope to see Turbodiff in future versions of INSECT. In fact maybe you
can change the name to TURBOINSECT or maybe TURBOINSECTPLOIT. That would
be so awesome.
