I know what you are trying to say about, but I don't agree with your math if this is a cyclic event that has a 500 year cycle. Risk will increase the closer you get to when it's supposed to happen.

There are of course no such thing as cyclic events in a Casino. It's supposed.to be purely random. Unless you play rigged slot machines.
