Yes and no. The thing is with gnutls if the certificate is valid for
another host - like I had in my test example then gnutls will not show
the error and will continue as if there is no error.
Obviously if the host has a certificate that is not 'valid' (e.g. self
signed) mutt will
prompt and ask for you to accept it first .
