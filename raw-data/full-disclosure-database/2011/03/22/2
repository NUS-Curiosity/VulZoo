Hi,

I've tested this behaviour using both - gnutls and openssl - and it 
seems like the only difference is that there is an error printed using 
openssl: "Certificate host check failed: certificate owner does not 
match hostname imap.myhost.web".

In both cases a user can accept the certificate, but there is no warning 
about certificate's hostname mishmash using gnutls, which is a 
vulnerability.

I just wanted to sum up the issue, do I understand it correctly?
