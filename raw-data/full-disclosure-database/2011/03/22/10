Product Description
- -------------------
- From [1]:

 "Beneath the appealing, easy-to-use interface of Mac OS X is a rock-solid,
  UNIX-based foundation that is engineered for stability, reliability, and
  performance.  The kernel environment is built on top of Mach 3.0 and provides
  high-performance networking facilities and support for multiple, integrated
  file systems."


Vulnerability Overview
- ----------------------

On June 30th, VSR identified a vulnerability in HFS+, a filesystem implemented
in the OS X XNU kernel.  HFS+ is the default filesystem in use on many
installations of the Mac OS X operating system.  By exploiting this
vulnerability, an unprivileged user with local access to a machine using HFS+
may be able to read raw filesystem data, bypassing file permissions and
resulting in information disclosure.


Vulnerability Details
- ---------------------

Users may interact with the filesystem using the standard ioctl interface.
HFS+ features an ioctl called F_READBOOTSTRAP that allows unprivileged users to
read raw data from an HFS+ filesystem.  The ioctl intends to ensure that this
data is restricted to the first 1024 bytes, where bootstrap information is
stored.  However, due to an integer overflow in the code that attempts to
enforce this restriction, it is possible for an unprivileged user to use this
ioctl to read large portions of filesystem data outside of this byte range,
leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.

The vulnerable check reads as follows, in bsd/hfs/hfs_readwrite.c:

if (user_bootstrapp->fbt_offset + user_bootstrapp->fbt_length > 1024)
	return EINVAL;

If a user provides values for the fbt_offset and fbt_length members such that
their sum overflows and wraps around to an integer less than 1024, portions of
filesystem data outside the intended range will be read and returned to the
user.


Proof-of-Concept Exploit
- ------------------------

VSR has developed a proof-of-concept exploit [3] to both demonstrate the
severity of this issue as well as allow users and administrators to verify the
existence of the vulnerability. The exploit leverages the integer overflow to
read arbitrary amounts of filesystem data at a negative offset from the end of
the filesystem.


Versions Affected
- -----------------
Testing was performed on Darwin Kernel Version 10.4.0, xnu-1504.7.4~1, but
review of older source code suggests that all versions of OS X may be affected.
