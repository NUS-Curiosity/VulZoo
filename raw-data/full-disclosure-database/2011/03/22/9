-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari on the iPhone. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the support for parsing Office files.
When handling the OfficeArtMetafileHeader the process trusts the cbSize
field and performs arithmetic on it before making an allocation. As the
result is not checked for overflow, the subsequent allocation can be
undersized. Later when copying into this buffer, memory can be corrupted
leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the mobile user
on the iPhone.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
