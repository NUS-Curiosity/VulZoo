Wrong. You can't just generalize "all existing /common/ networks match
my idea of what is".
You have to back up your statement with some argument.

I already gave examples as to why reading isn't the same as writing, not by far.

And you know, even if you weren't wrong, big O isn't the end-all of metrics.

It's a useful metric, no doubt, but implying that "O(a) = O(b) => f(a) = f(b)"
where f is a function that has security impacts is just foolish.

A does not equal B.
5 does not equal 10.
Reading does not equal writing.
O(attack execution) does not imply f(attack execution).. e.g. Risk to
attacker of being discovered.
Monitor port does not equal ??mysterious nebulous MitM attack??

And you two are the ones complaining about snake oil :/

If you tell a lie enough times.....
