Subject: [TEHTRI-Security] Security and iPhone IOS4.3
	Personal Hotspot feature


Gents,

Here is a tiny blog entry dealing with the new feature of the iPhone 4
with iOS 4.3, which turns it into a Wireless Hotspot in order to share
your 3G session through a WLAN.

We wanted to propose a quick geeky and security overview of this awesome
functionality.

We only found one tiny vulnerability which is related to the passphrase
used to protect the wireless. This can easily be patched by Apple.

The security advisory and explanations are available here:

Happy update this week for lucky owners of iPhone / http://apple.com/ios

Best regards,
