The First International Workshop on Privacy, Security and Trust in Mobile and Wireless Systems (MobiPST 2011) in conjunction with ICCCN 2011.

Maui, Hawaii, July 31 or August 4 (TBD), 2011

The First International Workshop on Privacy, Security and Trust in Mobile and Wireless Systems (MobiPST 2011) will be held in conjunction with the 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2011), in Maui, Hawaii, USA. All papers presented in MobiPST 2011 will be published in the workshop proceedings.

Outstanding papers will be invited to extend to full version for a prestigious journal (SCI(E)-indexed).

Recently, mobile wireless devices, such as wireless sensors, smart tags, smart pads, tablets, PDAs and smart phones, have become pervasive and attracted significant interest from academia, industry, and standard organizations. With the latest cloud computing technology, those mobile wireless devices will play a more and more important role in computing and communication. When those devices become pervasive, security, privacy and trust become critical components for the acceptance of applications build based on those devices. Moreover, several favorable characteristics of mobile and wireless devices, including portability, mobility, and sensitivity, further impose the challenge of security and privacy in those systems. Despite recent advances, many research issues still remain in the design of secure, privacy-preserving, or trust architectures, protocols, algorithms, services, and applications on mobile and wireless systems. For example, when mobile devices have more storage s
 pace, high bandwidth, and super sensing capability, more sensitive information will be stored in those devices. On the other hand, operating systems running on those devices are not as powerful and reliable as those on traditional computers. Both OS layer and higher-level layer protocols are expected to enhance the security and preserve the privacy of those devices. With more mobile devices being used in social networks and traditional web-based systems, novel trust models are essential for new applications. New cryptographic algorithms, key distribution schemes and access control policies are also encouraged by considering the special characteristics of mobile and wireless devices. Other issues such as malware, cyber threat, intrusion detection, attack modeling, security analysis, identity management and anonymity techniques also need to be revisited in mobile and wireless systems.

This workshop aims to bring together the technologists and researchers who share interest in the area of security, privacy and trust in mobile and wireless systems, as well as explore new venues of collaboration. The main purpose is to promote discussions of research and relevant activities in the models and designs of secure, privacy-preserving, or trust architectures, protocols, algorithms, services, and applications, as well as analysis on cyber threat in mobile and wireless systems. It also aims at increasing the synergy between academic and industry professionals working in this area. We plan to seek papers that address theoretical, experimental research, and work in-progress for security, privacy and trust related issues in the context of mobile and wireless systems that include, but are not limited to, the following

Wireless Local Area Networks
Wireless Sensor Networks
Wireless Mesh Networks
Wireless Ad-hoc Networks
Vehicular Networks
Body-area Networks
Cellular Networks
Home Networks
Social Networks
Smart Grid
RFID-based Systems
Mobile Cloud
Cyber-Physical Systems
Internet of Things
Location-based Service Systems

Authors are invited to submit manuscripts reporting original unpublished research and recent developments in the topics related to the workshop. Submissions should include an abstract, the e-mail address of the corresponding author. The length of the papers should be limited to 6 pages in standard IEEE camera-ready format (double-column, 10-pt font). Submission via EDAS at http://edas.info//N10077. Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the workshop to present the work.

All papers will be peer reviewed and the comments will be provided to the authors. All accepted papers will be published in workshop proceedings.
Outstanding papers will be invited to extend to full version for a prestigious journal (SCI(E)-indexed), which is targeting publication in early 2012.
