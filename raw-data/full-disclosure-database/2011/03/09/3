I agree with Ryan here, too many red flags... Essentially this $20
"donation" is paying for a windows only gui as most of the functionality
that is being advertised to encourage people to download and pay the
donation is provided by actual open-source products...

Do you know what would be really good... not using FD to advertise and drum
up donations for your product...
