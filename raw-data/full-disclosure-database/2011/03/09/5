Subject: Re: Mutt: failure to check server certificate in
 SMTP TLS connection

Um. Sorry, but I didn't want to be sent 100 different configurations
to test when perhaps someone knows about a configuration which is
'correct'.
So my test case as you pointed out did contain an error.
Here are the test case(s) I think you wanted me to run.

1. a muttrc with just
set smtp_url = "smtps://testme@...a.com"

in it.
This does not 'fix' the problem (mutt still connects).

2.
a muttrc with just

set smtp_url = "smtps://testme@...a.com:587"

it it.
mutt is unable to connect (it just 'hangs').

Did you mean for me to test any other configurations?
