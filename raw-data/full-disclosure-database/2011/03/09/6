Subject: Re: Mutt: failure to check server certificate in
 SMTP TLS connection

I should add that mutt hanging on the
set smtp_url = "smtps://testme@...a.com:587"
configuration is what I would expect to happen.
As port 587 is for port for TLS/STARTTLS and port 465 is for ssl if I
am not mistaken.

Please do point out if I have gotten this completely incorrect.
