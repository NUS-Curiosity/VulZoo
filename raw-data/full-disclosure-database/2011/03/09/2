I agree, in order for it to qualify as 'free' it needs to be just that. 

Forcing someone to make a 'donation' before you give them said free software is SELLING that software. Saying it's free is not just misleading, it's a blatantly *not* true. 

Juan did however give me a download to test it out when I contacted him off-list, which was nice of him, but I don't think that these announcements should say 'free with a donation from 20$ up'. It should state that you HAVE to pay 20$ in order to get a download. Anything else is misleading. 

Also due to the fact that this is *not* open-source I did not try it out. Just too many red flags for me.

Just my 2 cents.

It seems to be a different version.

IMHO if I have to pay to download it then it's not really free. Insect
should follow the same donation policy as any open source project - download
should be free and donation should be optional. This is probably a non-issue
anyway but I feel the word "free" shouldn't be used in this context, at
least I find it misleading...
