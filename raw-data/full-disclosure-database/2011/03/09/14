Subject: Re: Buying Web Malware Samples

I need (JS/PDF/HTML/Exploit) malware samples, and I'm not a cheater.
If I say that I'll pay 500$ for best submission, I'll pay 500$ for it.

I won't pay before I see the stuff.
I don't want to pay 500$ for big zip file with garbage in it.

Best submission will be rewarded with 500$. That's it.
If you have what I need, and you are not satisfied with this arrangement,
find a way in which we'll both be satisfied...
give me access to place where I can inspect them or something like that.

Sincerely,
J.H.
