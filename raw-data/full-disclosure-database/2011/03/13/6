Host-Extract | Host/IP Pattern Extractor
===============================

category: /pentest/enumeration/www
useful area: blackbox testing


This little ruby script tries to extract all IP/Host patterns in page
response of a given URL and JavaScript/CSS files of that URL.

With it, you can quickly identify internal IPs/Hostnames, development
IPs/ports, cdn, load balancers, additional attack entries related to
your target that are revealed in inline js, css, html comment areas
and js/css files.

This is unlike web crawler which looks for new links only in anchor
tags (<a) or the like.

In some cases, host-extract may give you false positives when there
are some words like - main-site_ver_10.2.1.3.swf.

With -v option, you can ask the tool to output html view-source
snippets for each IP/Domain extracted. This will shorten your manual
analysis time.

Please go to http://host-extract.googlecode.com/ for more info.
