Subject: Joomla! 1.6.0 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
	Vulnerability

==========================================
 Joomla! 1.6.0 | Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
==========================================


1. OVERVIEW

Joomla! 1.6.0 was vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.


2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Joomla is a free and open source content management system (CMS) for
publishing content on the World Wide Web and intranets. It comprises a
model–view–controller (MVC) Web application framework that can also be
used independently.
Joomla is written in PHP, uses object-oriented programming (OOP)
techniques and software design patterns, stores data in a MySQL
database, and includes features such as page caching, RSS feeds,
printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, polls, search, and
support for language internationalization.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The Query String parameter was not properly sanitized upon submission
to the /index.php url, which allows attacker to conduct Cross Site
Scripting attack. This may allow an attacker to create a specially
crafted URL that would execute arbitrary script code in a victim's
browser.


4. VERSION AFFECTED

Joomla! 1.6.0


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

This is the exactly same variant as shown in our last year demo video
in 1.5.20:

http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/training/view/misc/joomla-1.5.20_encoded-xss/

We thought Joomla! team would fix this issue in 1.6.0 stable release
whilst they fixed it in Joomla! 1.5.21!


6. IMPACT

Attackers can compromise currently logged-in user/administrator
session and impersonate arbitrary user actions available under
/administrator/ functions.


7. SOLUTION

Upgrade to Joomla! 1.6.1 or higher
