Subject: Re: Secunia jumps on vuln reward bandwagon

Their 'rewards' do not seem to justify the vulnerability/exploit research time.

"The rewards on offer will range from top-of-the range merchandise to
two major annual rewards such as free hotel accommodation and entry to
an IT security conference chosen from a list of the most popular
global security conferences.  The latter rewards will be given for the
first time in January 2012.  One reward will be given to the
researcher who coordinates the most interesting vulnerability as
judged by Secunia in the form of a prize under the Most Interesting
Coordination Report category.  Criteria will include complexity,
impact, level and level of detail.  The other will be given to the
researcher who has been consistently coordinating correct, clearly
detailed vulnerability reports that are quick and easy to confirm as
judged by Secunia.  The researcher will be given the title, ‘Most
Valued Contributor’ by Secunia.  Other rewards will be continuously
given to researchers coordinating their discoveries through Secunia
based on their individual performance."
