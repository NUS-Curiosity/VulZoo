Subject: CSRF and clickjacking on the web sites of domain
	registrars

Hello,

I tested security of czech domain registrars. I found out that web
applications for administration of user's domains are vulnerable to CSRF and
clickjacking attacks. This allows hijacking of domain names.

I wrote the article in czech language about it:

What is the situation in your countries? Is your domain registrar vulnerable
too?
