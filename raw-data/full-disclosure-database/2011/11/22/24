I'm a moderator? News to me - which would explain why I suck at it, seeing as

And one of these days you'll realize there's more to the security community

(Just for the record, I've probably been coding since before you were born,
given that I was hacking on IBM mainframes all the way back in the late 70s.
Type=J opens of system libraries rocked. ;)
