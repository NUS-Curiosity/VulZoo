I'll second that; the isp I work at has a sizeable ubuntu customer base and these are customers who have made an informed decision.

Now; let's consider ubuntu's inherited security from debian such as configuring a 'mortal account' (admittedly can be ignored in the preseed) and then the lack of perms on su; must use sudo.

This is a distro that is newbie friendly but is not designed specifically for them.

Unfortunately, though, you make a distro with simplified tasks (printer installation a fantastic example) and people, especially long term linuxers- though I ought to be included I guess, remember back all too easily to when everything was an uphill struggle: "what do you mean I don't have to compile this as a flipping module? That's not freedom!" Being all too familiar.

Just my tuppence worth anyway.
