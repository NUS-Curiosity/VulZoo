Bullshit, Ubuntu is designed (or at least, was designed) to be very
secure, check all the stuff it comes by default:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features

Not even the default Debian kernel has all those features activated. If
I'm wrong, why you see metasploit modules for Debian but not for Ubuntu?
that's the reason.

Recently some stupid people got into management (as always happens) and
we have things like unity, the fucked up 24-bit ASLR in i386, and this
guest account for retards.
