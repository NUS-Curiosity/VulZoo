Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

Sometimes it bothers me that everyone says Ubuntu is made for newbs and
that you're expected to switch distros as soon as you know enough to do it.
I worked as an intern with some folks who developed 802.11s, secure mesh
networking, and they mostly used Ubuntu. I find it extremely fast to
install, set up IDE's, and get a dev workstation up and running. I've never
had an easier time installing a printer. Sure, that helps newbies, but it
also makes work happen quick. If any problems come up, you can't beat their
user base and forums.
I love the freedom of choice, and I switch it up every few months to see
how the other distros are doing, but generally I'm back to ubuntu in a few
weeks.
Also, maybe I'm wrong about this and there are other reasons, but the
newest backtrack is ubuntu based, and they always mention that their distro
is meant for experienced linux users (and more of a toolkit than anything).
I don't know, I guess I feel like ubuntu should be cut some slack for being
newb friendly. It's not such a bad thing.
