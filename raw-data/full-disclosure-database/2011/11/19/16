Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

Recently some stupid people got into management (as always happens)

Oh here your right, but you still can relent, just dont fucking use
the os wich sucks, i have learnt that this suually dictates how an os
gets put tyogether... or no.... tajke some lessons out of windows
even,. but do it smarter... idc, id never put ubuntu on a prod, OR
local box, It got me once with the APC mags promo about how cooool ubu
is, then i found there is only about 100 bad binarys, your almost
there now, only 30 or so togo! almost patched dude! tyhe biggest laugh
is, your main binary wich is simplest, is vulnerable to suid attack...
i guess some people would know this method, and know what i am talking
about.. if not badluck.


Now, adding in a known MS flawed user... well, whats stopping it from
taking out lamest fucking os of year award... nothing. clean
management, and clean your 3rd party addons, then ill maybe consider
even using it partially again.
It sucks, simple, gimme user ax to your ubuntu, so i can rape it. thx :)
