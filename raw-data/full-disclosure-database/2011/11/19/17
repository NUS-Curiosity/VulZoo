Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

very good question, when i have seen bugs in sudo, wich allow me to
gain root, using sudo su - ,wich is a feature but, if not protected
and you have a bad sudo binary 9the sudo -g bug was about time i did
tests with the amazon sudo) .. i asked a friend also to do this test
and he also gained root thru a non sudo account, because BOTH binarys
are there.... i am still baffled with this, i try avoid sudo where i
can and, because sudo -g bug was nasty, i try use su - ,wich is abit
better i 8think* , but very good question,... id like to know this
reasons why to..
