Package        : spip
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : not available yet

Two vulnerabilities have been found in SPIP, a website engine for 
publishing, which allow privilege escalation to site administrator
privileges and cross-site scripting.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) doesn't include spip.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-3squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.12-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your spip packages.
