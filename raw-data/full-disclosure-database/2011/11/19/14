Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

Ok well how about lets put it simply...

MS have had a Guest user, i believe it is MSUSER***  since what, 1970
? I know locally, i could possibly manipulate registry keys and make
this user 'login' ready... but at this point i have local ax, so a. we
know ms guest user cannot be touched remotely , or is someone putting
up theyre own 0day wich can remotely change ms's inbuilt user... (as i
thought, no one will answer that bit... there is no way to exploit
it).

So if we compare these two os, one would be classed as crappy
(windows), one would be classed as entry-level... now the reason why
ubuntu has this look is simple, you have 3 versions of one OS, Kubuntu
Xubuntu and ubuntu , all split into server-client categorys, and these
are totally different configurations... so stop trying to say Ubuntu
is PRO, it aint, it is handed out on magazines, like many smaller os
are, and then you have places like APC mag, doing direct changeovers
from windows to ubuntu, was a 2010 issue wich actually did this, and
yea, i could prolly find exactly what mag, but i dont think that is
alone...
Ubuntu is portrayed as entry level by its owners, and then having a
thousand local xploits, and people like the e-caliber , making addons
for ubuntu, i would say the popularity of it, is growing less... so
dont worry, im sure there will b less exploitations of Ubuntu..just
not this year :)
have a nice day, m$ r00l users.
