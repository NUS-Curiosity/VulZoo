Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : improper assert
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4313

It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, crashes while processing
certain sequences of recursive DNS queries, leading to a denial of
service.  Authoritative-only server configurations are not affected by
this issue.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R4+dfsg-0+lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze4.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
