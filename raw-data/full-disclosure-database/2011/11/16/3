*** ABOUT ******************************
THOTCON (pronounced \ˈthȯt\ and taken from THree - One - Two) is a small 
venue hacking conference based in Chicago IL, USA. This is a non-profit, 
non-commercial event looking to provide the best conference possible on 
a very limited budget.

This is the 3rd year for THOTCON. Last year was a sold out event with 
world-class speakers and talks.

This year we'll be expanding the attendance to 500 and 20 talks.

*** WHEN / WHERE ***********************
The conference will be held in Chicago, IL USA on 04.27.12.

It will be held at a location only to be disclosed to attendees and 
speakers during the week before the event. It WILL be in the City of 
Chicago and close to a CTA train stop, accessible by bus, cab, and even 
a rickshaw (we have them in Chicago).

*** FORMAT *****************************
The event will be a single track.

There will be ten (10) 50-minute talks and ten (10) 25-minute turbo 
talks selected.

Topics we are interested in: retro computing, forensics, robotics, 
physical security, 0days, application hacking, wireless, malware 
development/research, hackerspaces, The Muppets, Penguins, zombies, 
attack detection, the number 7, online game hacking, consumer device 
hacking, beer, and bananas [foster].

This year, based upon past attendee feedback, the selection committee 
will be prioritizing technical talks over non-technical talks.

*** SPEAKER PERKS **********************
Speakers will be given free admission to the conference as well as one 
(1) free attendee badge (to bring a guest). In addition, 50-minute 
speakers who give their presentation as planned, will be given a THOTCON 
life-time attendance badge. This means you will be given free entry to 
every future THOTCON event for life.

You will also have access to the THOTCON VIP Lounge. This means you will
have access to free stuff (food and drinks). We don't have anything else 
to give, except you can tell your mom and your friends you spoke at the 
THOTCON.

*** HOW TO SUBMIT **********************
If you are interested in speaking at this event, please send your
completed speaker application <http://www.thotcon.org/cfp.html> to
cfp@...tcon.org.

Once we receive your submission, you will get an email back within 48-72 
hours. If you do not hear back from us, please resend.

The CFP will close on 01.01.12 or when we feel we have 20 outstanding
talks. We anticipate having all speakers selected by 02.01.12.

Note: We will not accept CFP submissions as PDF attachments. No need to

you a VIP pass to the conference ($240.00 USD value). Email your design 
to contests@...tcon.org

*** Sponsors ***************************
If you happen to work for a company that likes to sponsor cons, we could 
use your help. We are not looking for actual conference sponsors, but 
Saturday night (04.28.12), we're having a party for attendees and 
speakers. We are looking for sponsors at $2,000.00 USD each to cover the
cost of the party. Email sponsors@...tcon.org to become a sponsor.
