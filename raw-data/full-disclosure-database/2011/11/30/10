Hello there!
The exploit "roaringbeast" will be added to Exploit pack

Authors name and code/license will be respected and it will be ported 
to Python with minimal modifications

The code will be uploaded to Exploit Pack Git Repo and will be 
available to all our users

Thank you and congratulations for such a great job!
