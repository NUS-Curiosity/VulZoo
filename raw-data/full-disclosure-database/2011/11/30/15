Subject: XSSer v1.6 -beta- aka "Grey Swarm!" released.

Hi list,

There is released a new version of *XSSer* (v1.6-beta-) - the cross site
scripter framework.

Take a look to the XSSer website to see new features implemented,
screenshots, documentation, etc...

http://xsser.sf.net

You can download original code directly from here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsser/files/xsser_1.6-1.tar.gz/download

Or update your copy from the XSSer svn repository:

$ svn co https://xsser.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xsser xsser

Also, you have on the main website some pre-compiled packages
(ArchLinux, Debian/Ubuntu, Gentoo, etc..)

"Are you ready for the Grey Swarm!?"

Happy cross hacking.

psy.
