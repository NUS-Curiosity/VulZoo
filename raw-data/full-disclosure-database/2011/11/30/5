Subject: Re: New FREE security tool!

Hi,

I'm afraid all the download links in that webpage seem to be broken, except
for the Windows installer (which has a different version number than the
rest of the downloads).

Also, the github repository where you're hosting the source code appears to
be empty.

Cheers,
-Mario
