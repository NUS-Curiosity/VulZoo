Subject: Is there anything wrong with Skype?

I HAVE BEEN USING SKYPE FOR THE FIRST TIME

and its been a while now

I have tried that on two separate windows desktops

On windows 7 and on windows server 2008 R2

Clean installation

Freshly downloaded skype from internet and I think there is something wrong

Please check the images below:

{Personally I never trust using *netstat* or Resource Monitor , I know they
can be spoofed

But let me tell you in depth whats happening here

When ever I see skype running I see strande connections to unknown ipâ€™s and
Domains

Even when I am not on call / chat



I think skype is a free P2P software ?

right ?

but does P2P allows skype to register bots with Temporary domain names?

how is this happening

because the only other option is that the skype software is cracked

even when I downloaded a fresh installation of skype on a newly build
windows machine the connection objects are the same and they are the same
to the point of writing !!



Please anyone enlighten me with your comments!!
I have written down a post there on the internet :
