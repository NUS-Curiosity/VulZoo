ZDI-11-334 : RealNetworks RealPlayer genr Sample Size Parsing Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-334
November 28, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-4251

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks



- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application processes the audio
specific data within a RealMedia audio file. When decoding sample data,
the application will explicitly trust a length read from the sample data
when populating a buffer that is allocated based on the codec
information. Due to this, a memory corruption can be made to occur which
can result in code execution within the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
