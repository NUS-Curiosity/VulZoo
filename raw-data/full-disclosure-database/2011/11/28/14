ZDI-11-337 : RealNetworks RealPlayer RV30 Uninitialized Index Value
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-337
November 28, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-4256

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks



- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses sample data
encoded with the RV30 codec. When parsing this sample data, the
application will make an allocation and then fail to completely
initialize the buffer. During decoding of the sample data, the
application will explicitly trust an index from the partially filled
buffer and then use that to calculate an address to write to. This can
lead to memory corruption which can be converted into code execution
under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
