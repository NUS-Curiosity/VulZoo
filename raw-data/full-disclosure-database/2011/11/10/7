Subject: New w3af release! (1.1)

Guys,

    Today we're releasing version 1.1 of w3af which includes the
following changes:

        * Considerably increased performance by implementing gzip encoding
        * Enhanced embedded bug report system using Trac's XMLRPC
        * Fixed hundreds of bugs
        * Fixed critical bug in auto-update feature
        * Enhanced integration with other tools (bug fixed and added
more info to the file)

    And of course many others that were not included for the sake of
brevity. As usual, you can download the latest version from
http://www.w3af.com/

    In other exciting news, we're actively working towards a new webUI
(thanks Taras and Dmitriy) that will allow enterprise users to run
recurrent scans and analyze the results. If you're interested in that
part of the project, please let us know and we'll work together to
improve it!

    We were included in the latest sectools Top Network Security Tools
in place 18th! Please download the latest version, test it and if you
