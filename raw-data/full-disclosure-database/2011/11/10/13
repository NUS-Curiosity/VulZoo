Not sure. but the actual real one, is in english :)

About the PPS, i think thats a very bad summary of the exploit, 49days
to send a packet, my butt.
There is many people assuming wrong things, when it can be done with
seconds, syscanner would scan a -b class in minutes, remember it only
has to find the vulns, gather, then it would break scan, and trigger
vuln... so in real world botnet, yes then, with tcpip patchers, like
somany ppl i know myself, even use (tcpipz)patcher ) , wich rocks...
and it is ONLY one wich actually works, when you maybe modify the src
so the sys file, is dropped from within a .cpp file, well thats up to
you but thats better way to make it work, this will open
sockets/threads, as i could, easily proove with one exe, but, the goal
is, to trigger the vuln then exploit it, less than 49days :P , so ,
iguess if this exploit, in real form, gathered 2 million hosts over 3
nights.. i guessing that the exploit, could possibly be triggered with
ONE properly setup packet.. people forget that, a packet is one thing,
and a crafted UDP packet, is quite another..
I would not use that YT as the base for anything, it is bs, the author
is NOT russian.
Anyhow, nice try but no banana.
