Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow flaw in GNU Tar could result in execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

GNU Tar is a utility to create archives as well as add and extract
files from archives.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/tar                  < 1.23                     >= 1.23 

Description
===========

GNU Tar is vulnerable to a boundary error in the rmt_read__ function in
lib/rtapelib.c, which could cause a heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice the user to load a specially crafted
archive, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU Tar users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/tar-1.23"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since July 18, 2010. It is likely that your system is already
no longer affected by this issue.
