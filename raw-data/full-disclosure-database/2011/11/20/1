Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

You say there are at least 10 configurations mistakes specific to Ubuntu
that allows you to "exploit" it. Care to name one?

If you can't, maybe you can name other, more secure Linux distro in
which your 10 ways do not work.

Fedora do not count as it is unusable.
