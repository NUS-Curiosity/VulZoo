Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

Hello Full Disclosure Hysterics & Friends,

I have now read through five dozen complaints about how Ubuntu
is fundamentally an "unsecure" operating system, filled with more holes
than Swiss cheese.

If somebody could direct me toward a local root exploit against a fully
up-to-date Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10 that attacks a piece of software that is
installed by default, I would be most impressed and persuaded by your
assertions, as well as being very appreciative.

Thank you,
Management
