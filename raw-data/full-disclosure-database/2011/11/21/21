As of this morning, Linus's git tree had:

[/usr/src/linux] find * -type f | xargs cat | wc -l
14993265

and we're still at 3.2.0-rc2.  Almost certainly will tip over 15M by the time Linus
lets 3.2.0 escape.  The linux-next tree (which will become 3.3) is already sitting at
somewhere north of 15.3M lines of code.  Yes, we're averaging 100K lines of code
a month.

Are you sure it's NetworkManager that's hosing things up, and not the driver
itself?  "card hangs and takes a few reboots" sounds like a MadWifi issue
rather than NetworkManager - there's a *reason* MadWifi got deprecated in favor
of the ath[59]k drivers. ;)

That's actually a reasonable goal easily achieved by 3-5 motivated people in
their spare time.
