still you dont need a gpu, even with renegotiation disabled and hardware
acceleration present.
Just don't use openssl (or similar libraries).
you can send the intial communication yourself before its the client's
task to do CPU intensive operations and then just close the connection
and reconnect.

and the thc-ssl-dos is a proof of concept code, and could be enhanced to
do be more effective too.
