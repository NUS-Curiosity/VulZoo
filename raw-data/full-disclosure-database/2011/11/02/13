Subject: Re: Citibank CitiDirect - forced usage of
 vulnerable version of Java Runtime Environment

Ay i second that one.. biggest group of billionaire thieves known and
seemingly go anonymously by... i would not even serach for theyre
'security' as they would not care ... i doubt...,
2 other banks wich, are pretty blatant thieves also, (by thieves i
mean they do not align to reserve bank rate drops...)...anyhow i tried
to contact 2 to stop some real nasty redirecting spam and, theyre
online form on one was dead, second one i got a thanks but domain
stayd alive, stays alive till today :s
Banks really should start to take security more seriously, ONLY 1
overseas bank for me,w ich was actually i think was Nova Scotia Bank,
was very helpful and did kill spam when it was happening to them..
I guess that is one out of about 5 for me... you just cant tell them
theyre vuln coz, most dont give a shit anyhow until it seems it is to
late ala CBA...
cheers
