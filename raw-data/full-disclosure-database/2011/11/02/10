Thanks for the link.

Here's the thing. I'm working on an internal team. I've watched this talk,
I've downloaded Praeda and scanned some of our internal nets, and think I
have a general sense of what the future might hold in this area. I keep
coming back to my original question. Is this stuff for real? Am I missing
something, or is the answer to "block port 80." I'm curious, but know I'll
never get a serious answer here, to know if these things are actually being
exploited in the wild. 10 minutes with a search engine searching for
internet-connected printers seems to reveal interesting targets.

Also, whoever deals with these things, please note that pen-test@ seems to
be bustimicated.
