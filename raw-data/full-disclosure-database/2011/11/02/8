Introduction:
=============
The NATO Research and Technology Organisation (RTO) (Organisation pour la Recherche et la Technologie OTAN in French) 
promotes and conducts co-operative scientific research and exchange of technical information amongst 26 NATO nations 
and 38 NATO partners. The largest such collaborative body in the world, the RTO encompasses over 3000 scientists and 
engineers addressing the complete scope of defence technologies and operational domains. This effort is supported by 
an executive agency, the Research and Technology Agency (RTA), that facilitates the collaboration by organising a wide 
range of studies, workshops, symposia, and other forums in which researchers can meet and exchange knowledge.

Reference:
http://[SERVER].int/[FILE].[ASP]?[PARA]=[INCLUDE LOCAL FILE OR PATH]


Solution:
=========
To fix the security issue restrict the request to allowed files & parse the input.
Form a secure exception-handling & filter to prevent against future web attacks.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the file include vulnerability is estimated as critical.
