A challenge you say?  ....

Help on function arpcachepoison in module scapy.layers.l2:

arpcachepoison(target, victim, interval=60)
    Poison target's cache with (your MAC,victim's IP) couple
    arpcachepoison(target, victim, [interval=60]) -> None

The official Scapy site has good documentation[0]
