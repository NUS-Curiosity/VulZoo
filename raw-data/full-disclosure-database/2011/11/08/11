Subject: Re: Tor anonymizing network Compromised by French
	researchers

I think these details released are in line with our understanding of the
attack:
a) Enumerate network (by trying routes, or reading the broadcast list.)
b) Scan the nodes
c) Hack the vulnerable ones, installing malware, and/or add your own
malicious nodes
d) DOS the un-comprimized nodes, forcing network traffic to the attacker
controlled nodes

The only things that seem like they could be of value are the malicious
node used to support traffic correlation and the alluded to TCP-Reset
attack (which is probably just a syn flood).

The rest is hype, you are safe to use Tor as usual. If you are worried
about using Tor, grab a list of exit nodes and try to hack them yourself.
