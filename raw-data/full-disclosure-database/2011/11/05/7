Good move. Luckily i did not find even one copy of the calibre on any of my
boxen so the fix wasnt needed... i did a quick look around tho and there
seems to be plenty of other simpler readers even.. heres a cpl liks to
FBreader and another 'simple ebook reader'... both for Ubuntu as googled
for but most of these would exist also in tarball/deb/rpm i think* anyhow
here ;

FBreader :

Lucidor (simple ebook reader) ;
http://www.ubuntugeek.com/lucidor-simple-ebook-reader.html
This one does have a .deb and debian port...

I have not looked further for other distros but, i do like the *look* of
Lucidor.
Cheers.
