Which any savvy sysadmin knows really means "It's your problem to set
up iptables to restrict this sucker..."

And of course, *that* usually means "avoid this product like the plague" ;)

OK as far as it goes.  But take it a step further.  Does the LogDownloadService
process do any sanity checking and only let you download world-readable files?
If so, it's quite the yawner of an "exploit".

Or does it let you snarf up /etc/shadow, or other ways to get a system
privilege escalation. Remember - you could have users trusted with the data in
the database, but not other content on the system. A *lot* of shops have policy
where the DBAs do *not* have the root password - can you use this to bypass
that policy? Can you get it to cough up a file containing the database config
or access passwords?  Can you get it to cough up the logfile where it logs the
fact you accessed it (and can you abuse that into an infinite loop filling the
log space?)  What other creative failure modes can you come up with for this
"fee-chur"? :)
