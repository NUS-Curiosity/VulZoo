The thread on launchpad clearly shows (at least for me) that the developer 
has absolutely no clue about security, so imo the way to go is, even if 
there are no local root exploits anymore (in upstream), to uninstall it.
I'm not that adventurous to wait until it deletes all my user files
because he (Maybe, I haven't looked at the source) also reinvented rm ;)

Just my 2 Eurocents,
