Subject: LabStoRe <= 1.5.4 Sql Injection Vulnerabilities

Dear All,
I have found multiple sql injection vulnerabilities in LabStoRe <= 1.5.4.
The vendor knows the vulnerabilities and he is fixing them as stated
in the enclosed advisory. (See also
http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/labwiki/index.php?page=release_notes)
Since the developer is currently patching the current release it is
possible that you can find in the software link different versions of
the same app (1.5.4).
Best,
muuratsalo
