The comment and "patch" you posted shows you clearly did not read the comments in the bug report.

Ubuntu has already had the bug fixed, because they use a safe udev-based hook. The vulnerability only applies to those who have installed Calibre from source. So "apt-get remove calibre" is a pretty na√Øve comment to make, but you couldn't resist the bashing, could you?

The reason why he's reinvented the wheel writing the insecure calibre-mount-helper daemon is because there is no platform-agnostic solution for auto-mounting.

Modern Linux distros need a udev hook, older ones need a HAL-based hook, BSD needs HAL, and who knows what everyone else needs.
