RMS has an interesting position on free software and security. Given a
choice, Stallman would rather see free software used even if its not
secure (so I've been told):

    RMS has been quite open about it on several
    occasions when push came to shove: it was more
    important that GNU systems use free software than
    that they be secure [1]

calibre is not an isolated case (Kovid did look like an ass when he
blew off Rosenberg). Mailman has been storing plain text/reversible
pass words for years [2]. Debian and friends supply a ressed(8) which
fetches random data over HTTP and uses it to reseed the kernel's PRNG
[3]. It goes on and on.

After GNU's Savannah was hacked, I tried to get security related items
to the GNU coding/style guide [4]. I did not even receive a reply from
the folks in Massachusetts.

Be wary of open source and free software - you get what you pay for.
And its not even really free: take a look at GPL V3. Apparently,
Stallman encumbered it to set it free (???).
