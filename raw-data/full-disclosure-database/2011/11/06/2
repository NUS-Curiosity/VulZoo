Yes, but you won't get Oracle to do squat about a directory traversal bug that
coughs up a world-readable file - especially when it's a program they don't
even pretend is secure.  Getting it to give up the goods on a file that's
supposed to be sensitive *might* get their attention.

That, and it *does* matter what file was included - if only for the lulz value. ;)
