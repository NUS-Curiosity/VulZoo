Subject: New vulnerabilities in poMMo

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in poMMo. In addition
to previous XSS, BF and IAA vulnerabilities.

These are Information Leakage, Insufficient Anti-automation and Abuse of
Functionality vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of poMMo (poMMo Aardvark PR16.1 and previous
versions).

----------
Details:
----------

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

After entering of e-mail at subscribe.php, at the page
http://site/pommo/user/process.php the pending_code is showed (as debug
information). Which allows to pass registration confirmation and which can
be used for subscribing of arbitrary e-mails.

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

http://site/pommo/user/confirm.php?code=32456bdc42bf333c7cf842924aabeba8

Due to lack of captcha at this page and with taking into account
Insufficient Anti-automation at subscribe.php and Information Leakage at
process.php, it's possible to automate subscription of people on mailing
list.

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

These vulnerabilities allow e-mail (login) enumeration attack, at that only
login (without password) is used for user authentication. And also to use
e-mails for spam purposes.

http://site/pommo/user/update.php?email=1@1.com

At setting of e-mail (which is login), which isn't in DB of subscribers, the
redirect occurs, and if it's in DB then the message shows about incorrect
code.

http://site/pommo/user/activate.php?email=1@1.com

At setting of e-mail (which is login), which isn't in DB of subscribers, the
redirect occurs, and if it's in DB then the message shows that letter was
sent on this e-mail.
