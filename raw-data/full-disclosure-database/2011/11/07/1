Subject: Re: Researchers Uncover 'Massive Security Flaws'
 In Amazon Cloud

I know for my Access, i use a key ... i do not keep my cloud active,
thats about the only thing disabled actually... service with them on
EC2 is great to, VPS has no plain text pass, all of those have
keyfile, then you have to convert the keyfile using putty , i guess
the key could maybe be grabbed and ofcourse if they can access account
and download the file, if the user is *still* using that.... i know my
cloud service is off by default, so i wonder how this affects users on
the amazon-management console ec2/free service.. i assume that cloud
has to be active to be exploited... right?
