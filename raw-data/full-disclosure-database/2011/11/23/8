Subject: CodeV discovers 31 vulnerabilitys on 5 OS
	softwares

Dear FullDisclosure,

CodeV is a static code analysis tool (currently for php only, but soon
to be developed to other languages) developed by Dognaedis
(https://www.dognaedis.com/) to offer a tool to integrate in the
development of the life cycle of software in order to detect
vulnerabilities that arise from bad input validations as soon as they
hit the code. The tool has a public demo version that is limited to a
script with 250 lines of code and is available at
https://codev.dognaedis.com/.

We analyzed some Open Source software to test our own tool and
discovered 31 new vulnerabilities in 5 different opensource softwares.
Following responsible disclosures of discovered vulnerabilities
throughout CodeV's Open Source Software analysis, we are here reporting
all the vulnerabilities discovered as soon as possible to the community,
offering security not only to our clients but to the entire public. All
the vulnerabilities brought to public previously followed the necessary
disclosure protocol to the responsible teams. The vulnerabilities
discovered can be found in https://www.dognaedis.com/vulns/.

Thank you for your time and we hope you enjoy CodeV.
