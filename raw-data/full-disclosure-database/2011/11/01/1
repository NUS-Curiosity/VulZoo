Subject: The Hacker News (THN) 1st Anniversary Celebration

It has been a wonderful “HACK” filled year as we disseminated security and
hacking information around the world. We are grateful for our loyal
readership and welcome new readers and contributors.

Let’s face it. Hacking isn’t going away and growing security concerns are
an issue we all need to stay on top of. Being informed about the latest and
newest in security measures and the work of hackers to break into these
means is a global issue with tremendous consequences.

Hacking and security violations affect us all. Not only big corporations
which store your information but the health and welfare of your personal
PC’s.

The Hacker news has tracked the events of the last year and we are amazed
and the talent and finesse of techy people who can break into the most
complicated and sophisticated systems. You can depend on us for breaking
news in the area of computer security. Keep reading and keep checking our
daily web news.
