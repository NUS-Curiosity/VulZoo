Subject: Re: Facebook Attach EXE Vulnerability

Face Book is trying to save its face. It's typical.
I got the same answer from SonicWALL one year ago when discovered that simple internal network scanning (Nessus, Nmap, etc.) brings down entire network. The firewall internal TCP connections stack was overloaded within a few seconds (IPS is not enabled, thus was not accepting new connections.

Nathan, It IS an issue, don't let their foolishness harsh your mellow.

Although it's a completely ridiculous, backwards, and standards-relaxing "security" mechanism, the fact is they implemented it, and you subverted it.

In my book that's Pentester 1 :: Fail Vendor 0

I've had large vendors (read:Microsoft) reply to issues with the same kind of garbage, where they take a situation where there wasn't a threat, create a "security" mechanism to counter the nonexistent threat, then implement it incorrectly, thus creating either a vulnerability in the system itself or a false sense of security for the user.

Fail: "Hello user, you can add attachments now! Look at our amazing
1997 web technology!!"

User: "Oh neat, I can't wait to send my friend this random file (read:
give up your rights and control of your random file to facebook) your through your excessive, unnecessary, inefficient, insecure, closed-source tool"

Fail: "I am blocking exe attachments 'for your security' so feel free to just run attachments without a second thought, don't even bother to waste 100ns of your time to practice normal security"

User: "Wait, what about .bat, .cmd, .vbs, .ws, .pif, .inx, .lnk etc etc? What about the extensions that I set up? Can I really just spam clicks all over the place?"

Fail: "Oh those, well you shouldn't be clicking those. What, we can't be held responsible if you don't practice normal security!! P.S. You know when we said we were blocking .exe files? Well--- we aren't.
Enjoy."
