Subject: Re: Facebook Attach EXE Vulnerability

Hey great read,
    very true, there is way too little money in this area, but thats
what i am hoping to change, albeit pinch per punch and company by
company, slowly if more people turn to some ideals that you must
atleast know how to make the exploit and then how to debug it enough,
then to present it appropriately, full-disclosure or no disclosure, it
would work for me on how that first email breaks, if the company sees
me as someone who can offer them help, before i sell the poc and
instead, let blackhats chew away.... or,. they can start to learn that
security investment, is important, with some luck this wont take
20yrs.
I only think, seriously, if the item is NOT open source, and is a
multi million ENT erprise, yes that means you to RedHat RHEL, then the
item is up for scrutiny, since especially with FB it affects us all in
sme way, try to tell me that one of your family doesnt use the crap...
even if youdont... so, security would affect me/you/whoever, so why
not scrutinise what we are then left to use, and then, bugs come about
like this and others, and worse if you were to really worm it up then
you could on FB, and probably make tonnes of 'bots' from it, and
believe me thats where there is no shortage of spammers and such who
will use tis to make money.... Unfortunately many security
independants as theyre called, have yes indeed taken the one exploit.c
to another level and have now called themselfs specialists etc, HDM is
a prime example but, if you look at what he does, he is fuzzzing the
shit out of chrome, he is fuzzing the shit out of eveything we use, so
i have to applaud him, he does it silently though, wich is abit
annoying, he could have a better voice than i or you or probably
anyone on the list... i guess slide presentations do take theyre
toll...
i recall HDM as once active here... is a pity to see these people now
turn away from it, they are probably sick of trying to do what i am,
wich is not going to be easy but, im a boxer and i can handle punch
per punch basis.
Your writeup was good, alot of thinking has gone into it, and you are
right on all too many levels.
Cheers.
