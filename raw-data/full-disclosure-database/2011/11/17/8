Subject: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

Hi list,

Backdoors in ubuntu are now called features :

https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+question/175756

Unfortunately remote SSH connection are not allowed, I suggest guest
account to be silently add in /etc/shadow for 12.04. It could be the
best Ubuntu April fool ever.

Maybe calibre could also be installed by default, for a root shell out
of the box.
