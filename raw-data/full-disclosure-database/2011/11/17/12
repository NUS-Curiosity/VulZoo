Hi,

What is the password for this guest account?
Is the password random generated?

Is remote access of any kind enabled by default for this guest account?

In what way is the guest account different from any of the half dozen or so other accounts(with the obvious exception of access rights)
created during a default Ubuntu install?

How insecure is it really?

I am not an Ubuntu expert so these are genuine questions, I am far to busy to research this at this time so I ask these questions in the hope
than an Ubuntu Guru comes forth and either allays all my/your/our fears(if they exist) or scares me/us into action.

regards
Dave
