 Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2588516)

yep!
next time, i wont say shit, and, believe it.
seems, you cannot even wait for the author to do it... as, to wich, i
have said... and, i tried to show yu also, ow to simply *catch* it...
but, you trying to get code from me, wich, i will never give you :)
so to those who care about it, and want to wait, they can then see who
is bullshitting who..

I am shocked, howmany socalled 'skilled' people, cannot get this bug
to work...  but, theyre NOT the ones whining about code :)
they probably already doing what I am, making a nice, portable cpp
version, wich, wouldnot be hard, if you already know what to start
with etc.. so, i guess idscussion, would only assist maliugn use of
code, wich i wont have , as a ms user.
Sorry but, wen the author likes, he will gief to u.
until then , go roll a joint and relax.
thx!
