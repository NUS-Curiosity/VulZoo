Introduction:
=============
Skype is a software application that allows users to make voice and video calls and chats over the Internet. Calls to other users within the
Skype service are free, while calls to both traditional landline telephones and mobile phones can be made for a fee using a debit-based
user account system. Skype has also become popular for its additional features which include instant messaging, file transfer, and
videoconferencing. Skype has 663 million registered users as of 2010.  The network is operated by Skype Limited, which has its headquarters
in Luxembourg. Most of the development team and 44% of the overall employees of Skype are situated in the offices of Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia.

Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Low


Details:
========
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected on the Skype vendor website. The vulnerability allows remote 
attackers to hijack skype customer sessions via cross site scripting. Successful exploitation of the client-side vulnerability 
can result in session hijacking & account steal.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				                        [+] Subscriptions to call a single country
