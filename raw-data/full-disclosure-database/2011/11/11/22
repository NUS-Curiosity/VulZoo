Introduction:
=============
Each iGuard Biometric / Smart Card Security Appliance has a built-in Web Server enables all the computers in the corporate 
network to directly simultaneously access the device using any Internet Browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer Netscape 
Navigator. Different computer platforms such as Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows Linux machines can access the device. No 
additional software is required. So whether you are in an airport lounge or a hotel room, you can always check if your employees 
are already in the office or not, and you can even control, modify or disable their access rights to your office remotely via 
internet connection provided your iGuard Biometric / Smart Card Security Appliance is connected to an external IP address or 
your network is available through a VPN connection that is reachable from your location.

Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability-Lab Team discovered multiple persistent & non-persistent  input validation vulnerabilities on iGuards - Biometric Access Control Application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-09-01:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent  input validation vulnerabilities are detected oniGuards - Biometric Access Control Application.
The vulnerability allows an local privileged user account or remote attacker(with inter action) to manipulate the vulnerable application sections.
Successful exploitation of the bug can lead to session hijacking & manipulation of vulnerable application modules via persistent inject.

Vulnerable Module(s): (Persistent)
												[+] Select Month
												[+] New Access Record - ID
												[+] Department ID & Description

1.2
A client-side cross site vulnerability is detected on iGuards - Biometric Access Control Application. 
The bug allows an remote attacker to attack (high user inter action) a customer on client-side. Successful exploitation can result in 
phishing passwords or manipulation of content when processing client-side requests.


Vulnerable Module(s): (Non-Persistent)
												[+] Employee Record

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers or local low privileged user accounts.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC: (Persistent)
                                                          ../database.cgi.htm
                                              


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.
The security risk of the client-side vulnerability are estimated as low.
