ZDI-11-328 : ProFTPD Response Pool Use-After-Free Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-328
November 11, 2011

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

ProFTPD



- -- Affected Products:

ProFTPD FTP Server



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the ProFTPd server. Authentication is
required to exploit this vulnerability in order to have access to the
ftp command set.

The specific flaw exists within how the server manages the response pool
that is used to send responses from the server to the client. When
handling an exceptional condition the application will fail to restore
the original response pointer which will allow there to be more than one
reference to the response pointer. The next time it is used, a memory
corruption can be made to occur which can allow for code execution under
the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

ProFTPD has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
