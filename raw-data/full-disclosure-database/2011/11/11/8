So did I, which is why I came to Amazon's defense in pointing out that
those in glass houses shouldn't be throwing stones. The company
(Enomaly) abusing Amazon over a complex SAML XML digsig
vulnerability[1] was/is still using a trivial vulnerable signature
mechanism in their own products that Amazon had fixed years ago[2],
among other issues which I had reported 6+ months earlier (not
validating requests, passing prices to clients in hidden form fields,
etc). Their security response is also appalling[3].

Sorry for the confusion but that's not at all what I said[4]. No harm
done — others replied off list to say they found it amusing. Anyway I
have a credit card to go cancel (per the subject of this thread).
