I'd really like to see you actually explain this bug with code. Either
with a poc or with the disassembly. You seem to act like you know
what's going on, but so far your description has been off base (from
what I can make of your writing).

No one cares about paragraphs of speculation and bragging, code or you
are just another heavy breather in the perv closet of FD.
