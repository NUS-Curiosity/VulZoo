the list is not bad, we have celebrity flamers like GNAA themselves here ;)

i won't be surprised if the list owner (whoever he/she is) sell the list 
at good opportunity (like aleph1 ruined bugtraq).

appears to me secunia gets too much advertisement by injecting

though this is up to the list owner.
