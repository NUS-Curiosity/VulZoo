Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A persistent script code injection vulnerability is detected on the WhiteHouse Gov website. The vulnerability allows remote 
attackers to implement/inject own malicious script code (persistent) on a web service main module of the website. The successful 
exploitation of the vulnerability results in hijacking of user-,admin- or -backend sessions, manipulation of profile content, 
redirect to external malicious targets(websites), defacement & can lead to malware infiltration via petition.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				                        [+] Profil - Location Input

Affected Module(s):
							[+] Petition - Add, Share & Sign
