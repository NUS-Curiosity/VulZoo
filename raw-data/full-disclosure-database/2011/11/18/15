Right.  Which is why a passwordless guest account available to people who have
physical access isn't such a big deal.  The problem is that if you manage to
get ssh enabled, there's not *that* much stopping the account from being used
from Zanzibar.

Some operating systems (AIX, for instance) allowed tagging a userid as "local
access only", or even "may only login on tty 3, 5, and 23".  Adding that sort
of a tag to the guest account would help the situation by adding some
security in depth.
