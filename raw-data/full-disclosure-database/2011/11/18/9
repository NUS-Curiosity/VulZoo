Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

Let's not overreact. We're talking about a guest account only on dekstop
systems, for local login only, and perfectly visible to the user. The only
problem I see here is not having a simple GUI way to disable the guest
login for a non tech-savvy user, but no more. (Or am I missing something
here?)
