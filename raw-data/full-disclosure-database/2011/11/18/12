Subject: Re: Ubuntu 11.10 now unsecure by default

To be honest, while Ubuntu is hardly secure, it is not DESIGNED to be
secure per se. It is designed to wean Windows users away from M$ and toward
GNU/Linux OS types. Kind of a "Linux for newbs". My family went from Win XP
to Ubuntu years ago and stuck with it. I moved on to Debian, they stuck to
Ubuntu and Win7 (eventually) as they are not computer enthusiasts - mere
users.

Hell, a friend of mine, she was a self confessed "computer illiterate" and
when I moved her to Ubuntu a month later she was learning how to write
simple shell scripts to automate tasks - not bad for someone who couldn't
work XP's Control Panel for ages...

If you want secure as in, OUR version of secure, look elsewhere. One thing
I do like about Ubuntu though is it looks pretty :)
