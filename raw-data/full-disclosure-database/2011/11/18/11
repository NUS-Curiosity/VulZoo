Given that Ubuntu is an African word for "Can't configure Debian", and the
target audience of Ubuntu, the lack of the simple GUI is surprising...

(Yes, there's still one config setting saving your butt in sshd_config - but
for a distro that wraps a Teletubby interface around freaking /bin/su so you
don't accidentally hurt yourself, the fact that there's exactly one config file
setting saving your butt if you manage to enable inbound ssh seems a bit of an
oversight).
