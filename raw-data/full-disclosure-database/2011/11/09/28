Subject: Re: Microsoft Windows vulnerability in TCP/IP
 Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2588516)

You could just google for IRC packs of win2k src ;)
I know i have a copy of it somewhere... acvtually tho, would not be
helpful tho, as it does not affect win2k.. so i guess there would be
some code there but not the code you want.

@george
and, ideally if 'years' ago existed for this exploit but, it does only
affect v6 and up , this is tested.... so xp/2k/2k3 not affected...
still, i know people are using other ways anyhow , and thats just how
botting is... one way dies, one takes its place :s
i guess we wait for the rls of this.. maybe!
