 Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2588516)

Oddly enough, I was aware the kernel has to handle packets sent to "closed"
ports, just was not thinking of HOW it handles them. I would love to see
the code for that, and am planning to look at the same code on Linux so I
can see exactly what the hell it does.
