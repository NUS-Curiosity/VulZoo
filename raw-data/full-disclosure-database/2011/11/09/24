I am surprised about this, because Microsoft is definately lagging some level of testing and change management in critical code. How many servers are people using without networking these days. We do talk about remote execution vulnerable in something, which obviously might get unnoticed when we think of security audits, PCI and such. I wonder if integrated firewall in Windows could block this as Microsoft should do everything in their power to stop attacks in this security vulnerability.
