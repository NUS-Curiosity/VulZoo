Sounds at least potentially interesting.  A few questions:

> -          CAT uses Internet Explorer's rendering engine for accurate HTML representation

Is this optional/switchable?  Might be nice to *not* use the actual IE render
engine if you're working on serving up a client-side exploit via XSS - that would
be shooting yourself in the foot then. ;)

What render engine does it use for Linux/OSX? Or is this referring to using
MONO to talk from a Windows test box to a Linux/OSX target?

What license?
