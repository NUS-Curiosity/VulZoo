Subject: Agnitio Security Code Review Tool v2.0 released

Hi,

I've released an update to Agnitio which I hope will help people
carryout security focused code reviews and find vulnerabilities in the
source code they are reviewing.

The major changes in v2.0 are listed below:

1) Basic code analysis module with rules for analysing Android and iOS
application source code

2) Editors for checklist items, code analysis rules and database configuration

3) Editor for the principles and checklist question guidance sections

Plus lots of small user requested changes.

For more information on the changes in this release please visit this page:

You can download Agnitio v2.0 here:

Let me know what you think of it!

Dave
