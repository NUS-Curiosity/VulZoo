-          Request Repeater – Used for repeating a single request
-          Proxy – Classic Inline proxy
-          Fuzzer – Allows for batch of tests to be sent to a server for brute forcing, parameter fuzzing, forced browsing etc.
-          Log – View a list of requests to sort, search repeat etc. Allows for a sequence of requests to be repeated and modified.
-          Authentication Checker – Two synchronised proxies which can be used to check authentication and authorisation controls.
-          SSL Checker – Request a specific page with various SSL ciphers and versions.
-          Notepad – A text/RTF editor which can be used as a scratch pad for conversions etc.
