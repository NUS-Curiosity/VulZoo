Right, politics and religion, just as I suspected.  The mouthpiece for much of it seems to be wholly unrepresentative of the people I know, as usual.

There's a lot of highly dubious crap in there, but none of it is about repression or obviously religious acts of violence.  As such, I wish I could say I agreed, but I don't and can't and never will.  From my point of view it's just two equally stupid groups of people on either side fighting over the veracity of issues that just aren't important to human beings.  Meantime, mail-archive.com is in my hosts file, so I can get on with following my perfectly non-violent, non-religious, non-political mailing lists. :-(

Yup.  It turns out that the problem goes away if you don't use their custom USB tethering interface and use PAN or wifi instead.  But that's too much trouble, and I'm not messing around with the configd database either, so I'm just adding the site (www, not plain domain) to the hosts file.

FD, because now everyone knows why they can't follow their favourite mailing lists while on holiday in Turkey. :-)

Cheers,
