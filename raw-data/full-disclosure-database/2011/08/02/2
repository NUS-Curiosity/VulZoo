Hello Internetizens,

Welcome to our brand new sekurity proj3kt - the Month Of Humorous Stefan

Here is today's first post:

Feel free to submit your own humorous stefan esser photoshops! It's for a
good cause! Security for everyone! Raise awareness! Be celebrity! Then
complain when you get famous! :(

We accept almost any photoshop, but it has to be humorous! So no just ms
paint penis on esser's head. Unless you do it in a humorous way!!
