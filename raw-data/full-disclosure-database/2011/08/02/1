Subject: Spreadsheet with infosec talks

Some people asked me to send them this but better share it with everyone.
The idea is to have a spreadsheet similar to the TED one with all the
talks and links but with computer security conferences (Defcon, Black
Hat, etc.)
In a future I will add the other important conferences like HITB,
Ekoparty, C3, etc and complete the oldest Defcons with links/duration.
