The data you posted seems like the stuff from SRBLCHE.... Seem him around and he's a nice guy. Well coming to think of it his site is currently not selling military data.. Its just maintaining a repository of SQLi sites like the hell lot of sites around... There are sites like thehackernews.com etc which leak out all the dumps to the public that these hackers get...


So why all the fuss?? YouJellyBruh?? =))

Cheers,
MaxCaps

PS:  http://esploit.blogspot.com/p/exploit.html  is from your site right! You sure this is all legal stuff? Trust me you can get into lots of shit cause of this so why create rukus around when others are just having some fun and sharing knowledge.
