The ironic part is that "pedestrian hacking techniques" *will* be sufficient to
break into the vast majority of places. And the places that it isn't enough are
not likely to be hiring his crew anyhow.  So you end up with "able to break
into anything that's likely to pay you for security advice".  Good work, if you
can get it. ;)

Though the tip-off *should* be that anybody who's the self-professed "world's
number one hacker" is saying it out in the open.  For the most part, the *real*
top 10 or 15 guys are being very quiet about it (yes, you know know who they
are, but if they're in the top 10, they aren't issuing frikking press releases
about the fact ;)
