	Photoshops - 0x05 (Late Edition)

Hi Everyone and welcome to a very late edition of MOHSEP.

As I'm sure you are all capable of tellin from the excedingly poor quality
of our photoshops, we are not actually that good with computers. As a
result, we were unable to bring you MOHSEP 0x5 in a timely fashion.

But, in the finest internet traditions we bring you MOHSEP 0x5 today:

Enjoy and we'll be back with more later today :)
