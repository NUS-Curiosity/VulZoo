	Databases Dump

Dear List,

This is to expose a security company who according to their website 
(http://www.prolinux.net.uy) are the #1 in their country..yet they 
fail at the simplest tasks such as securing their web server...

This file contains a dump of all their databases including 
logins/passwords to websites, SSH login/passwords, insurance 
company client's PI (Names, addresses, IDs, License plates, DOB, 
etc)...and much more..

You can grab the file at : http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7ASU4KEJ
