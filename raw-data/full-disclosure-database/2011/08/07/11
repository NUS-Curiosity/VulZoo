"Doesn't get it"?  You're making the rash assumption it's not intentional.

You yourself say "Government spooks and contractors take note: you can use
these to stage your false flag attacks!".  Now take it one step further - what if
they're intentionally open so the Chinese gov't can launch an attack through them
and claim it was somebody else pulling a false flag attack?

You think that's too devious? Go read up on who financed the research that
lead to TOR - and *why* they financed it. (tl;dr: US Gov. financed it, so the US
spooks could more easily fly under the wire mixed in with all the other nefarious
people using TOR.  So yes, it's patriotic to use TOR so it's even harder to use
traffic analysis to track down our spooks. :)
