	Quadrant Information Security [http://www.quadrantsec.com] is proud
to release Sagan version 0.2.0 [http://sagan.quadrantsec.com].  Please note
that the release site has changed!

What is Sagan?

Sagan is multi-threaded, real-time system and event-log monitoring software,
but with a twist. Sagan uses a "Snort" like rule set for detecting nefarious
events happening on your network and/or computer systems. If Sagan detects a
"bad thing" happening, it can do a number of things with that information. For
example, Sagan can store the information to a Snort MySQL database for viewing
with utilities like Snorby [http://www.snorby.org],  it can send e-mail(s)
about the event to the appropriate personnel,  it can store to a Prelude back
end, it can also spawn external utilities, as well as numerous other things.
 
Sagan can also correlate the events with your Intrusion Detection/Intrusion 
Prevention (IDS/IPS) system and basically acts like an SIEM (Security
Information & Log Management) system.

Release Information:

This is primarly a bug fix/stability release.  This release addresses many 
issues.   We've also decide to remove support for --program mode and Logzilla
support from this and future releases. 

Next stop for Sagan:

Sagan with Snortsam support in verison 0.2.1 

Thanks: 

Special thanks to Merlyn Cousins (AKA - DrForbin) with bug stomping/patches/
development.
