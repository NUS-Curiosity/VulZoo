I understand your point but it's always harder to find bugs when you have
no source code.

It's obfuscated because NiX don't have a name yet. If it will become a
brand, I'll have no issues to release the source code.

The software contains very unique parsing engine and other advanced logics
which im not up to publishing to the public unless the above condition has
met. There's no backdoors whatsoever and it does not steal any personal
information. Protected source code also prevents others from using the
software for malicious purposes. We neither will see that easily renamed
derivate work.

So protected source code has it's advantages/disadvantages.

This means you are not using windows nor any other commercial software
because they don't release source code?
