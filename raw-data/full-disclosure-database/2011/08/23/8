Well then I wonder why you made this accusation to public. What comes to
proxifying, there are always some similarities.

Im little bit upset because you made this false accusation. Anyways,
browse this site with the glype proxy: http://midco.net/

You will see it will fail. Try it with my proxy, it opens OK. Simply, if I
really would have copied the sources, my software should have the same
bugs right?

Now I will put a dot to this conversation.

PS. I will have more unique features coming with the future updates.
Features that also the list will like even they would not otherwise have
interests of any kind to web proxies ;)
