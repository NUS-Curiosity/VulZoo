yeah

They don't even customized the error codes, look invalid url:

https://myproxylists.com/nix_web_proxy/browse.php?u=%%%

Return:
"The requested URL was not recognised as a valid URL."

In Glype Source code:
# grep -r "The requested URL was not recognised" .

./includes/init.php:$phrases['invalid_url']     = 'The requested URL was
not recognised as a valid URL. Attempted to load: %s';
