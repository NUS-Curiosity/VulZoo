What is FHTTP?
FHTTP is a "framework for HTTP protocol attacks" consisting of more than
2000 lines.
Programmed entirely in Perl (with Perl-GTK user interface support).
A quick sample of FHTTP modules:
- DoS Tool - The HTTP killer (Nothing more to say :P)
- Proxy - Debugging/manipulation of queries/responses (Bypass: IDS's,
Firewalls, Proxies and more) - Recommended against "Snort" :P.
-- Proxy chaining ("CONNECT" method).
-- Evasion rules (Regex).
-- Evasion rules (Perl).
-- HTTPS removal.
- Fingerprint - Multiple fingerprinting methods that use, among other
things, keep-alive and malformed requests.
- Shodan Integration.
- Google Images integration.
- Tineye Integration.
- etc.
