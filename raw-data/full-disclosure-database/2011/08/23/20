Subject: INSECT Pro - Free tool for penetration security
	testing

INSECT Pro is a new free tool for Penetration Testing and the ultimate 
resource to demonstrate the security or vulnerability of your network.

INSECT Pro goes beyond simply detecting vulnerabilities to safely 
exploiting them. The first free integrated vulnerability and penetration 
testing tool, INSECT is part of the complete solution Insecurity 
Research offers to evaluate the vulnerabilities on your network.

Download now your copy from http://www.insecurityresearch.com and try 
to defeat and test your network security

If you want to colaborate please write us an email to: 
insectpro@...ecurityresearch.com or join to our mailing list

Why is free? We have two new members in our team and that allow us to 
keep working and follow our own way. We think that no one should charge 
for knowledge. Of course we have to pay bills, like web space among 
other things.

Insecurity Research is an innovator in software development, our 
products include exploitation development tools, vulnerability 
assessment and remote control technologies.
