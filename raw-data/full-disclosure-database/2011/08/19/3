	Photoshops - 0x11

Hi Guys and welcome to day 18 of Month Of Humorous Stefan Esser
Photo-ma-Gimps,

Guys, its very hard to be superbright magnesium type whitehat superstar.
Waking up to Network Securitiy Podcast mp3, reading the metasploit manual
while taking a dump, reading the full disclosure on the subway, flipping
burgers all day at work then coming home and having to make great photoshops
with french-fry-fat burned fingers.

But I do! Every day! For you guys. Because I love you, and I love security
and I love this great full disclosure photogimp project!!!!1

Anyway. Enough. Here is today's link:

Until tomorrow!
