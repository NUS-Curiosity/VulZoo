So basically once you sign over a GPL v2 , you sign over any right to misuse
even the code wich you have written ?
i guess i thought this could be scrutinized outside of the GPL via means of
a solicitor but, if the law is complacent about use and misse then, i guess
thats that and your correct, i have actually yes, used myself the CC lisence
and was thinking the gpl was just a simpler version but seems that is
probably safer to go wityh CC i guess there atleast you have some say over
mis-use in cases where you specify wich docunments in particular, ie:
sourcecode1.cpp,source2.cpp and v.cpp must not be modified... the rest could
be.., for example.
Ohwell, that shoots any theory then of why it is even being mentioned in the
list, other than to potentially harm all users of tightvnc src.
Stranger things have happened i guess.. Sorry for my earlier report and,
enjoy the code!
lol
xd
cheers Valdis ..
