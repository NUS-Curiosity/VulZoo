Ahem.  What the GPL V2 actually says:

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

"Not to defame" is an additional restriction, as is " scrutinize why the code
is being used". You can't do either of those for a GPL-licensed package - you
may be thinking of some of the Creative Commons licenses.
