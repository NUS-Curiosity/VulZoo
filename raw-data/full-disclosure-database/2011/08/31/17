And even the top-level Metasploit HACKING says:

   By submitting code contributions to the Metasploit Project it is
   assumed that you are offering your code under a BSD or similar
   license.  MIT and Ruby Licenses are also fine.  We specifically cannot
   include GPL code. LGPL code is accepted on a case by case basis for
   libraries only and is never accepted for modules.

But it's murkier than that - looking at external/source/tightvnc/README shows
that it includes code from Dave ZImmerman and Jef Poskanzer, with licencing
that I'm not immediately convinced is GPL-compatible. So Metasploit may be
invalidly including GPL code that itself is invalidly including non-GPL code.

I'm gonna go make some popcorn. :)
