Subject: Re: INSECT Pro - Free tool for pentest - New
 version release 2.7

woah!

OK so it is not that nice to deface another product, thats kinda why i do
pick on it myself but about the GPL,
well i have to help anyone on this one, including tighvnc themself, as they
did release this as open src software remember,
Let me try and explain this abit better/clearer..

Regarding the GPL,
I dont think the guy has breached it directly or indirectly.
Ofcourse, if he has, wich i dont thinkso* then he would be subject to being
sued by either TighVNC group, or Metasploit.

IF the INSECT pro exploit for tightvnc/code wich is used for that, is being
manipulated  AT ALL , that is at compile time, if it is modified from the
original code, to the end user/product.
IF that is the case, then tighVNC would be able to scrutinize the insect pro
maker,and perhaps even take it to small claims or worse, direct defamation
of product, wich would not be a good/smart thing todo for anyone.

So, i think this should clear up alittle of this small debacle wich has
broken about GPL... GPL is usually there to protect the src code in the GPL
(named), but is also, not to be used in ways wich defame, wich is why it
exists.. if tightvnc wanted to now, they could look at ALL its uses and
scrutinize them in every case, and why the code is being used. It is
something wich is verymuch now up to them and up to wether people have
modified theyre code.

Good for you. I think that is great. But you are pretending to be a "big
company." Stop that.

I am happy to see you removed that silly donation-for-download scheme.

Fantastic advice.

I did too, until I learned how to program. Oracle's purchase/murder also
hastened my departure.

Might I suggest C++/Qt? :-)
