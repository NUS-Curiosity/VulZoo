is running wordpress 3.2.1

This lahore based spammer is running a PPC link blog and is pushing his crap
all over the social networks right now and has just appeared in my work
spamtraps from botnett'd systems.

Anyone know if the above site has any known exploits?

Note the hosting company has been notified, so expect any attacks/tests to be monitored.
