of course many of these seem innocuous or unrelated. that's the point
and why attacking via these methods was effective.

there are situations where signal and link would be bad just given
congestion and noise floor.

however i am speaking to particular effects when the MitM was taking
over a connection from target to the carrier and redirecting through
itself. this was done in a manner that causes some effects described.



sorry media, no inquiries. i bet you can find people to talk to; try
