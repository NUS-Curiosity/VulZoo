Subject: Re: DEF CON 19 - hackers get hacked!

Helo again stranger,
hehe, well, the old method was to use a fake html page to ask for some 'java
update' to view some non existent 'suuposedly' awesome, poster/pic/mvie.. on
myspace, this was written in VB but,, logged every email that clicked and,
this loaded an exe, in 2 days was 200 thousand boxes on one ircd.. this di
not last once the myspace found out.. but it was nonetheless, a BIG one...
and yes, i still have the ONLY src i know for this kind of trickter method..
it is VB :P hehe.
times are a changing... but, i see now what tyou mean... still, i just dont
know why people even INSTALL or, accept anything at a defcon meeting, ofc
someone will try to make some name, mining for data, is stealing an id
nowdays, so there would be GREat potential for one device, to connect to
some network, and rescan for other weak/known exploits... then you have an
army :)

but, intersting about 4G... i have not yet to see that haxd so, 1 point for
that but, thats prolly coz ui aint really been looking at that side of it
... and, kinda wish that some idiot would try and fool me at a defconz ....
it would be fun to watch tho... i still rember the gotse loading in corner
of pages....ahhh the old days....

nice writeup tho coderman, well researched article wich i even have to re
read :)
cheers
xd
