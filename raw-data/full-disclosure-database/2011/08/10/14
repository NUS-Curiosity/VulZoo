I attempted to use both the Windows registry IsDefaultRenderer=1 entry
and 'X-UA-Compatible: chrome=1' header in every response, but still
could not change the rendering engine in CAT (latest version) from IE
to ChromeFrame.

However, CAT has a proxy. It does not, however, include the feature to
"show response in browser" as does Burp -- which would allow you to
switch between browsers to see if the XSS works in one versus another.

Cheers,
Andre
