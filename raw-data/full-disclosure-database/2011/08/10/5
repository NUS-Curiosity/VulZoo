indeed. but as indicated, this system tried easy and known attacks
first (including checking for "su" on device without authorization.
did anyone click to give root to some strange app?)

only when the easy and known attacks failed did the more advanced
attacks take place. these were increasingly more interesting / novel
attacks.

not sure what this means, but i like the idea of "NO html" ;)

not a botnet; a phone pilfering and surveillance network targeted at
Rio attendees.

a number of the attacks would only work and/or remain active while on
the MitM network - designed with limited scope and longevity.

scanning for what? the intent was pretty clear and seemed entirely
useful to the attackers: pilfer data from phones, leverage pwnd phones
for surveillance within the conference / among attendees.
