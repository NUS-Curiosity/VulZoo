Subject: Re: DEF CON 19 - hackers get hacked!

android exploit attached to bad html file (alot like the myspace
hacking)...so whats s new... same methods, and same bs...
i just dont see any usefulness to what could be done anytime, and if you
were silly enough to accept ASNY files direct dl at ANY  **COn, expect it
:P~
but the method, is pathetically old, and, hiding behind some lame
android-root, as most of these ppl do... when i see them lever, linux, with
NO html, ill maybe like them abit :P~~

have a nice defbomb ... hehe



meh.. so whats new... hijacking a phone botnet would be fun but, i dont see
why would bother scanning for them.. when, i have and, theyre pretty
useless... well, maybe for android freaks...and, this is simple a root
exploit or, exoploit being levered, thru an LD
