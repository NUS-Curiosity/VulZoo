The annual symposium brings together leading researchers and
practitioners from academia, government, and industry to discuss
issues and technologies related to intrusion detection and
defense.

RAID 2011 features an exciting technical program, with
presentations addressing topics such as dynamic analysis of malicious
shellcode, world's fastest taint tracker, anomaly detection using
software defined networking, defending legacy embeded systems,
web and social network security, and cross-analysis of botnet victims.
A poster session during the symposium will provide lively
face-to-face discussions of work in progress.

This year we will have a great keynote presentation on "The
Cutting Edge of Medical Device Security and Privacy" by Dr. Kevin Fu!

We also have a special panel to discuss "State and Future of
Open-Source Network Intrusion Detection":
 Panel Moderator:
 - Ron Gula, Tenable Network Security
