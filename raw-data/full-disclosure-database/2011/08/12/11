These guys just ought to be really happy it's a fricken pain in the
ass to get mod_frontpage 5.2 working these days or some highly annoyed
person could start churning up a private exploit for the known
associated vulnerability. That or fire up canvas/core impact(I don't
remember which one had the exploit for it), but sadly no public
exploit for it or he would likely have gone down fast and hard.
