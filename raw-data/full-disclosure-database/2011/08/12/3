Subject: [MOHSEP] Month Of Humorous Stefan Esser
	Photoshops - 0x0B

Hi guys :)

Welcome to day 11 of amazing k-rad-tastic MOHSEP. The only security project
with more photoshops than travisto has bugs in Flash. Remember Travis, a
single case file does not equal a bug! It does not equal a funny photoshop
either which is why we only publish the very best submissions.

Anyway, link is here:

enjoy, until tomorrow
