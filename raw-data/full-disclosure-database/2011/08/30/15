> As of now (29.08.2011) apache d3v3lop3rs released an advisory not mentioning neither Kingcope nor Zalewski and citing the cve sh1t which is VIRTUALLY EMPTY as of now - check for yourself (citing empty stuff appears strange to me).

In the advisory of 26.08.2011

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.announce/59

they link both  Kingcope and Zalewski
