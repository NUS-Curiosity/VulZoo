You'll note that later versions of Chrome protect against this via
HTTP Strict Transport Security.

http://www.chromium.org/sts
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hodges-strict-transport-sec-02

Google includes their cert fingerprints (see kGoogleAcceptableCerts) in:
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/base/transport_security_state.cc?view=markup

In chrome:
chrome://net-internals/#hsts
