===========================================================
About the conference:

For the fourteenth year, the intrusion detection community will 
converge at RAID'2011 to discuss cutting-edge research in malware, 
application security, anomaly detection, special environments 
and sandboxing, web security and social networks, and network  
security. You are invited to join us at RAID for two days 
this September at SRI International, Menlo Park, CA.

The annual symposium brings together leading researchers and 
practitioners from academia, government, and industry to discuss 
issues and technologies related to intrusion detection and 
defense. 

RAID 2011 features an exciting technical program, with 
presentations addressing topics such as dynamic analysis of malicious
shellcode, world's fastest taint tracker, anomaly detection using 
software defined networking, defending legacy embeded systems, 
web and social network security, and cross-analysis of botnet victims.
A poster session during the symposium will provide lively 
face-to-face discussions of work in progress.
