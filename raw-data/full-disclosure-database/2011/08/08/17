-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of McAfee Security-as-a-Service. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaws exist within the MyAsUtil5.2.0.603.dll which exposes
an ActiveX control. First, XSS can be used to bypass the domain
execution policy implemented in
MyASUtil.SecureObjectFactory.CreateSecureObject() to create an instance
of MyASUtil.InstallInfo. Then, MyASUtil.InstallInfo.RunUserProgram() can
be used to execute code on the user's system.  Additionally, many other
objects and interfaces on the user's system can likely be abused using
this general mechanism.

-- Vendor Response:
McAfee   has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
