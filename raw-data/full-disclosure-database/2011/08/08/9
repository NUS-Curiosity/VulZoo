Subject: NiX Online Web Proxy with pentest mode?

Hello list, is there interests of any kind to subjects feature?

I mean web proxy https://myproxylists.com/nix_web_proxy/ with same
features as firefox add-ons tamper data, modify headers and modify cookies
has? I think it would be quite cool feature while having 50-100 proxies to
choose from without need to do anything extra.

I got the idea of those features because I'll need to add debug mode
anyway for faster developing.

The script will be released soon free of charge, if you're interested:
http://myproxylists.com/proxy-script

The parsing engine need more testers, and I hope some of you bother
surfing sites with it. Needless to say, you can unblock blocked sites at
work/school with the proxy and fully automatically rotating proxies all
over the world allos you to unblock more sites.

PS. I know this list is not the best places to post this kind of things
but atleast the web proxy will increase your online anonyminity and
security ;) It's completely unique service due to rotating proxies and
best part of it, it's free.
