Subject: Re: [MOHSEP] Month Of Humorous Stefan Esser
 Photoshops - 0x07

Since by now everyone would have probably figured that there is one per day
surely anyone who is interested can just look themselves... Or maybe you can
only send a email if both these criteria are actually met:

1) Are actually Humorous.
2) Are actually quality photoshops and not more accurately described as
mspaintshops...

Based on the quick look I've had it's doubtful you'll need to send further
emails.
