 Photoshops - 0x06

Christian,

How do you know how hard is life between studying for your CISSP exam for
twelve years and getting rejected for being a mentor at Defcon Kids just
because of that one time with the priests in Jaurez (and YES it was only
once)? I don't think you do because if you did you would not be so off hand
about my terrible half-strangled cries for some kind of acceptance from my
peers?

Why should be only people like you who get all the fame? The love? The
tshirts? The twits. I WANT TOO!!!!

Do you know, Christian how long you have to stare at Stefan Esser's face on
Photoshop at 400% zoom before you wish that the nurses let you have sharp
things? I do, Christian. It is 22 minutes. I timed it. Today. Then I try
kill myself with my breakfast bowl. It no work.

I have suffered for my art, Christian. And I am proud. That you should mock
me for my pain is beyond me. I am a sad man.

Also, well done in missing both the pop culture reference and Tavis'
admittedly unexpected sense of humor. You now win at irony. Forever.
