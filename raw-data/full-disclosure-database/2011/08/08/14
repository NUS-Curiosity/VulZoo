Various vulnerabilities have been found in SquirrelMail, a webmail
application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2010-4554

  SquirrelMail did not prevent page rendering inside a third-party
  HTML frame, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site. 

CVE-2010-4555, CVE-2011-2752, CVE-2011-2753

  Multiple small bugs in SquirrelMail allowed an attacker to inject
  malicious script into various pages or alter the contents of user
  preferences.

CVE-2011-2023

  It was possible to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
  crafted STYLE element in an HTML part of an e-mail message.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21-2.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 1.4.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.
