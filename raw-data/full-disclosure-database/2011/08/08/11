Subject: Re: IE handling the HTML notes incorrectly may
 lead to XSS attacks

Javascript:

if(alert(1)); // executed
i(alert(1));  // not executed (TypeError: i is not a function)

It's worth to note that Firefox (5) does execute the inside function,
whereas Chrome (13) and IE(9) do not.
Talk about browser consistency...
