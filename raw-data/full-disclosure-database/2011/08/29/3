Photoshops - SUPER WEEKEND BUMPER EDITION!!!


Hi guys!

I no that some of you worry that I got hit by car or sql mapped into
1992 but no I is ok!

You know, has been few years since my dog died but still i have some
problem. Normally i keep myself in control, but as soon as i have just
even one glass of wine with dinner an thats it i am go complete crazy
until i wake up 2 weeks later in some crack den in dresden. Is ok. As
soon as got home again i smoke some meth and secanol and open photoshop
and is all ok.

Anyway here is today super mega bumper link!!!
