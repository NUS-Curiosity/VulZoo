Hi, Roland,

Thanks so much for your e-mail! Please find my comments inline...

Agreed. -- Which makes one wonder a bit about the "stremlined header
blah blah" that one usually hears :-) (ok, it's "streamlined" in a world
in which attackers do not exist :-) )

Hadn't though aboiut this one. Good grief :-)

Yes, this would be another one to add to the list of "IPv6 addresses
leaked by application protocols".

Agreed. At least in the short and near term, NAT usage will only
increase despite of the claims of "return to the e2e internet" (I have
commented a bit about this one in
(http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/tip/Why-IPv6-wont-rid-the-Internet-of-Network-Address-Translation).

-- And it's not just the additional state... it's the increased
complexity of the resulting "system" (the Internet). Even for
troubleshooting it will become more and more painful.

It has been relieving to read your post, I must admit :-) --
particularly when at least half of the stuff that usually gets published
about IPv6 security has to do with how the mandatory-ness of IPsec is
going to save us all. :-)

Thanks!
