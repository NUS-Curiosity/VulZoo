Subject: Re: CAT Version 1 Released - Web App Testing Tool

Under native Windows, CAT will only use IE to render the HTML.  I can see your point as to why you might not want to use IE and I will look into adding in a Gecko rendering option for the next version.
  
Under Mono it uses the Mono provided WebBrowser control, which rendering engine is used depends on the operating system's configuration e.g. Gecko or WebKit.  For more details see:
http://www.mono-project.com/WebBrowser

The license can be see here:

Cheers,
Mike

Sounds at least potentially interesting.  A few questions:

> -          CAT uses Internet Explorer's rendering engine for accurate HTML representation

Is this optional/switchable?  Might be nice to *not* use the actual IE render
engine if you're working on serving up a client-side exploit via XSS - that would
be shooting yourself in the foot then. ;)

> -          MONO Support for Linux and OSX (Currently in Beta).

What render engine does it use for Linux/OSX? Or is this referring to using
MONO to talk from a Windows test box to a Linux/OSX target?

> -          It is totally free!

What license?
