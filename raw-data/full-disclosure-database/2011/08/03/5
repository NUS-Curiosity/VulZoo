Haha....
    Again, this ridiculous tool comes to our lives :-) , hey i am all for
it, but not when ya see 'trial' , on a FD list :P~~ just bit 'wrong'.
Anyhow it speaks for itself..  ;

-------------------> Because,obviously the author cannot spell or sensibly
merge the words 'security' with 'testing'

code a Pentesting tool)

pass,now there is some nicer 'new' features wich allows others to 'remotely'
assist!!YES!

more,many many more..

OK, so for a paid tool, wich needs REG to just look at, and, wares crews are
not even bothering to crack this one (yes, i have seen that almost every
'decent' pack is either OPEN src,or cracked online somewhere)... this tool
is old, it is called Nessus :) , only, these guys are hiding stuff obv, the
fact it is so buggy, after all these socalled 'releases,id like to hope
anyone who has purchased this rubbish, to consider lobbying for a
free/updated exe of this, i would not take less, and +6months of prescribed
key, for such a crappy thing it seems to now be, see, they did disclose
things, they just did it in a stupid way.
Saint is vuln-scanner also for http ,free,small,yet it still beats this
rubbish! Id also, love to see why it is closed src, they could have
disclosed src, they are most probably using some codeproject.com snippet
:P~~ ha.
ohwell,ppl will try to make money anyhow they can and, putting a shitty
closed src app up, is pretty good way to get alot of people who just need
something 'fast' ,and theyre target market, would be already wary after
somany bugs.
Fix it, make it free, and people might even addon to it and help this crap
from becoming, totally useless....Ive seen these tools endyup on that scrap
heap tomany times... this is headed straight to it.

xd-- / NOT an Insect pro user but IS a Nessus Beta tester :-) ..
