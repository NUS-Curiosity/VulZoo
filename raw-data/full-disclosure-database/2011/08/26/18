"possibly" doesn't mean much unless you have an actual point to make.

I doubt Mitre has any such plans - the "®" is there mostly so they can take
action against people who invent their own CVE numbers.

I beleive those are pools allocated to the various CVE Numbering Authorities:

https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html#participating_cnas

Each of those vendors and researchers has a small pool of pre-assigned numbers
they can use - so if Apple or Microsoft gets notified of a vulnerability, they
can peel off the next number from their pool and use it without the delay of
going back to Mitre to get a number assigned.

It usually *doesn't* mean people are sitting on unannounced stuff - it means
people are sitting on numbers to use quickly if they have to make an
announcement.
