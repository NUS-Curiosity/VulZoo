Subject: Bypassing PHPIDS 0.6.5

Full Paper:
https://sitewat.ch/en/Blog/10

Using these attacks it is possible to bypass all of PHPIDS's rule sets,
which defeats all protection PHPIDS can provide.  Further more on a default
install of PHPIDS the log file can be used to drop a PHP backdoor.  There by
using PHPIDS as a vital steping stone in turning an LFI vulnerability into
remote code execution.  Thus PHPIDS 0.6.5 made you less secure.  Of course
all of these issues have been fixed in PHPIDS 0.7,  and by using the latest
version of PHPIDS I have no doubt that you're php application will be more
secure. If someone tells you that you are absolutely secure,  then they are
trying to sell you something.  However PHPIDS 0.7 provides a strong barrier
between your application and an attacker.
