Same here, but i tried with a rather large html file... had no effect, in
fact, it got blocked, here is the log:


root@...10-170-103-253:~# perl mn.pl http://www.****.com/news/articles.html

here is where it paused abit... caused the site to lag abit, but not
drop,had no affect but getting itself blocked,very ineffective.

////and whala we are blocked by the target machine, wich is not even running
any real firewall just a large bw box but, was infact vuln to the byte/range
attack vector...

^C

Id like to see this abit better, and the fake-ip setting, to be implemnted
so it works maybe, then even some form of spoof wich cannot b seen by
webserver... then might have more chances of attack lasting long enough to
soak the sockets,.....well, it should be doing that aspart of this.
cheers and, great coded tool but, just alittle tricky maybe to use it....and
no automatic d0s. and lag lasted like seconds..
regards, and, i always say, never stop improving the code, nomatter if the
comliments are pos or neg,take all in and use it to majke your work better.
thankyou for sharing the code, i like to read code wich is coded well :)
cheers,
xd



PSS
As a total sidenopte, I really do like immunitysec.com, but i really dont
want to fork out however much it would cost for the complete pro opacks, atm
it is very stable deployment.. I have only got an older v6 of the canvas,
but i am interested in anyone who could get me the set... i mean every item
that is deployed to plugin, all the packs by gleg etc... wich i know exists
on private forums. Id be happy to swap something as equally as valuable for
it anyhow...
ops.
