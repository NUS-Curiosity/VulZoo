Subject: Question about disclosure of WordPress plugin
	vulnerabilities

Hi.

Does anybody know what's the general opinion on disclosure of
WordPress plugin vulnerabilities in these two sections:
1) unfiltered string parameter values - while magic_quotes are
automatically turned on on WordPress >= 3.0 [1] installations
2) admin ones (requires access to the restricted admin area)

Kind regards.
