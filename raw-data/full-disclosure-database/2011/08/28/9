Subject: Make requests through Google servers

ABSTRACT:
The vulnerable pages are /"*/_/sharebox/linkpreview/*"/ and
/"*gadgets/proxy?*"/
Is possible to request any file type, and G+ will download and show all
the content. So, if you parallelize so many requests, is possible to
*DDoS* any site with *Google bandwidth*. Is also possible to start the
*attack* without be logged in G+.
