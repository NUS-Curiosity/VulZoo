Subject: Re: Make requests through Google servers

Interesting. I'm especially curious if it could be used to scrape Google
services (e.g. search results) without being picked up by filters (due to it
being a Google operated IP address).

I also wonder how far recursively it'd go - would it be possible to use one
of those URLs to attack itself?
