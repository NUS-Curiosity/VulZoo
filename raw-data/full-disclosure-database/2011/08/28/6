Subject: Re: INSECT Pro - Free tool for pentest - New
 version release 2.7

INSECT Pro uses native exploits and these are taken from the Internet, 
modified and tested to work with our tool, the sources of these exploits 
are exploit-db and securityfocus in most cases. Also has support for 
some modules of metasploit.

If you look at INSECT PRO exploit description you could check the 
source of each one, "native" or "metasploit"

This isnt a company making a big product, Im doing this because I like 
doing it.

I'm not forcing you to use my software, if you don't like it please 
don't waste bandwith on it.

We are working on a JAVA version in order to support multi-plataform, 
and because I really like to JAVA

We are a small group of developers so we do this on baby steps, we dont 
like to receive that kind of critic from people like you, you should try 
to help instead of drop shit all around the internet
