This has yes, 2 sides to it, range accept and then another issue with
doc_size, but i believe this one patch addresses both, atleast, the advisory
that kcope just showed me put me onto the correct patch... tested, same
httpd after patches applied thru freebsd-update,it appied the patches for
range... anyhow here it is again for anyone who wants to look at
it...attached unified diff patch for the whole issue of 0- and doc_size ,
but i still think the framework is abit shaky :s
anyhow, patch up if ya need to... otherwise, be eaten by shkidz
xd
