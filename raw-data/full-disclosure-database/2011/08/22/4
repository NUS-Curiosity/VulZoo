My guess is there are 2 things keeping him going.
1. People are looking at the pages.  No matter how much people
complain the truth is they are looking.  He can tell by
checking web logs on his site to see if there is interest.
He probably see's enough people to feel there are enough
seats occupied in his theater to keep the doors opn on 
the current show.

2. Messages like those above indicate people are still looking/
curious as to how bad the latest renditions are going to be.
The critics haven't found a new show yet to generate a better
buzz elsehere.  They keep coming back to his trainwreck.

So, to repeat the phrase to the all of you, "Just stop."
