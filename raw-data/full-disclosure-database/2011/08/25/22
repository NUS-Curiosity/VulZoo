Ummm ok, lets see, i tried to use this, it keeps giving me 'usage' abit to
much :P , even when i have read thru the code and seen an example/would make
example.... but seems it is not being nice, unless i have perhaps made the
error.. or it is not pasted in correctly,... i will try again but, i sofar
see no threat here, because it doesnt work to well, to start with... btw, it
looks alot like a slowloris like attack, wich would be blocked by most
servers... still, please show me some examples.. this is NOT a happening
script atm!
and also, maybe adjust encoding, so when copy and paste, it doesnt bork up..
incase it is maybe that.... altho, it seems to exec fine... i am using perl
script.pl blah.com 10 10 ip.fake.here.ofc
nothing but usage...
cheers in advance
xd
