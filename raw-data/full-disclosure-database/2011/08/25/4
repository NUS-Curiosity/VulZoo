Hi Michal,
just for the record I have the impression that this not the same vulnerability
you outlined in your advisory a while back. It is more that the idea
for this vulnerability originated from your advisory, not the same bug.
Actually I even think that the while back when you released the advisory
there was a patch for both Apache and IIS by limiting the maximal Byte Range
headers slightly. This is a feeling I got over years of fuzzing for httpd bugs.

Regards,

Kingcope
