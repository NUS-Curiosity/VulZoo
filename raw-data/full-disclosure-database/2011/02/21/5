Finally, a response worthy of a non porn reply! Well done AndyPants!

You're not entirely correct. But you do hold a valid point that I should
remove the company name from my FD emails and/or add a liability disclaimer
in the footer. But footers suck for mailing lists, and you really are a
complete and total faggot (see urbandictionary for alternative meanings,
trying to be a grammar whore isn't going to help you here). So, we'll see :D

What Cal doesn't realise is, not only are threats of violence against the
law, but discrimination in the work place over sexual orientation is also
against the law.

He isn't doing well in convincing us that he's a reformed criminal, maybe he
was just telling porkies to the BBC.
