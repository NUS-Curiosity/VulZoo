Hash: SHA1

Drupal's dev team gave enough of a fuck to fix the issue in Drupal 7
(http://drupal.org/node/86299).  I am not aware of any evidence of this
flaw being exploited in the wild, however, with high profile, state
sponsored, sites like WhiteHouse.gov running Drupal it is reasonable to
assume that any flaw in Drupal, no matter how small, is going to receive
attention.
