I always felt "purposefully antagonizing others and inciting general
distress, fear, uncertainty, doubt, and frustration among as many
people as possible, without letting others know it was your intention"
was a better description..

All in all it means you aren't a nice person and you have
psychological problems :'(

Are you a troll, Cal?  I doubt :D
Of course I'm one of the few who thinks Andrew isn't a troll either ... :/
