	Dirty Indian rant

Don't worry with your grasp of English, you will grace AOL tech support 
with your wonderful communication skills. Maybe one day, they'll make 
you Level 2. Why do you keep on using homosexual slurs towards me? Do 
you get your advances declined in India?

You are exactly correct with your statement that "I am out of it" 
because you are. You are out of your mind.

Please stop butchering the English language. We already have MustLive 
and his Engrish skills hard at work. Maybe you guys could chip in on 
splitting the costs of an Engrish to English class.
