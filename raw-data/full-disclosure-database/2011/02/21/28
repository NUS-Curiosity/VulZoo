Subject: Re: Other recommended lists?

Swearing? Several. Insults? I think most people would include that under
douchebaggery. What you want probably fits better under forums or IRC chans
rather than mailing lists.

Not to state the obvious, but I've not personally been subjected to n3ttie's
emails for some time, except when people include them in their responses...

If there is someone you think is n3ttie posting under some other name, keep
in mind he has always been decidedly non-technical and it is not terribly
hard to pick his tone/style/subjects out of a crowd. It wouldn't take a
doctorate to analyze the text.

Content of type "text/html" skipped
