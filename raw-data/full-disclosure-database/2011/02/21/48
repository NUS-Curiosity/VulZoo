You really seems to be robbed by some Indian from your job. Anyways, I am a regular reader of FD and know idiots like you who poke their noses _only_ in nonsense. I talk only Info Sec here and I am a LOT better than fags like you. My mistake I got into argument with waste like you. I am out of it.

My name is Endia Pakistan.

their money by putting the likes of you online?
