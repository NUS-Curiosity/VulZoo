Yep, some huge shadowy "national security organization" that nobody but the
leader admits being a part of, it must be a conspiracy.  I wonder who out there
is a sleeper agent.  Consider Gadi Evron, Marcus Sachs, and myself - Andrew's
done so much to distance himself from all three of us that we must all be
sleeper agents.  Think about that.. and who *else* might be part of the
conspiracy.  It could go deeper than even Andrew realizes...
