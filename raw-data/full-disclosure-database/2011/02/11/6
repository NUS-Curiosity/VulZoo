Don't think for a second this trolls name is even Andrew Wallace..

http://www.hw.ac.uk/research/experts/810_313139.htm

Edinburgh Uni just happens to have a researcher for computer vision and image analysis named the same.. He has probably done some graphic design and thought he had mad skills with Photoshop so could pwn the world hence the antics on this list, he's never actually submitted anything of decent quality.. and we will never get rid of the annoying crap he posts..

National Security?? He should be be concerned about his own sanity.

Nettie (and that isn't a term of endearment - see http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nettie)

Please bog off. You make me ashamed to be British. Anyone with a burgeoning consultancy would shut the hell up about it, not bawl about it on FD.

I have to say that your trolling is first-class though. I am an FD lurker, not a contributor, yet you have wound me up enough to respond. For that, well done.

Now sod off. I am only a short train ride from your neck of the woods, and I would love to kick your ass for plaguing my inbox again.

Adios,

Thankfully you are very rarely involved with public and private sector business talks in the UK, so the situation will probably never arise we are in the same board room.

Stay in America and keep away from the UK is the best thing that could ever happen to you, because frankly meeting you would be a complete nightmare for me and I would find it hard to work with you on any meaningful level.

One thing for sure is you have pissed me off with the way you speak to me via private email and your perceived perception of who I am, and what you think n3td3v is.

Maybe in the beginning it seemed like disorganised non-sense to you, but it has evolved and shaped over the years with me and is now a serious force to be reckoned with and is able to compete with other consultancy orgainsations in the UK, now that there are serious consultants on board from the business and government sector in the UK, where we work on meaningful policy reform within organisations, to tighten security against foreign powers, terrorist attacks and other matters.

To be perfectly honest, I would like to say, I think you've been reading mailing lists too much, a lot more goes on in industry than the stupid disclosure community, work actually gets done that is meaningful and satisfying when I come home at night.

My advice to you is, stop reading mailing lists, get on with the physical industry and stop basing your views of people based on back and forward horse play people have have had between 2004-2009.

That part of n3td3v is behind you, me and everyone, I removed the mailing list as a symbolic gesture to move on from that.

I'm now a professional, consulting and liaising with other consultants in the UK in the public and private sector through the consortium, the consultants who ive had dealings with in the physical domain who have decided to join through knowing me in a working relationship.

The organisation is nothing to do with what it might have been, n3td3v is rethought and matured, along with me.

You couldn't possibly say the same orgainsation I started when I was 18 is going to be the same orgainsation today now that I'm 30, it isn't.

I've changed, we've changed, the type of people I come into contact has changed through opportunities I've gained in the physical domain.

n3td3v is very much nothing to do with anything online-based, but has shifted into the physical domain, in that, its people I actually know who I can shake hands with who are members.

That is why the name was changed, the brand, its now a consortium, its nothing to do with online or some silly Google group mailing list.

The beginning days of n3td3v between 2004-2009 and the Google group mailing list was used to pushed my name out into the industry to become known, you should be able to work with me in a meaningful working relationship if you ever had to through work commitments.

Everyone else who I meet in the physical domain knows who I am, but they don't judge me for it, they shake my hand and move on with the problems in the industry that are needing solved.

They don't say, that's Andrew who used to post in the disclosure community, let's huff and puff about it.

They take me as I am in the physical domain, realise it was silly horse play from the past and move on.

I hope you are able to do the same, because your attitude just annoys me that you cannot have a mature and professional approach in the way you talk with me.

Andrew
