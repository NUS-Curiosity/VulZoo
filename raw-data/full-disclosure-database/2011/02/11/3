Subject: KeySoft (BrailleNote Apex) 9.1 Fixes Gaping
	Security Hole

>>From the release notes:

> Password protected login
> BrailleNote Apex can be password protected.  In case you forget your password, you can contact our Technical Support services to obtain a password unlock file. User identification and device serial number will be required. For security purposes, ActiveSync is disabled at this stage.)
> 
> Improved security
> Access to communication protocols has been protected to prevent unwanted access to file system. When password protection is activated, ActiveSync is disabled.

I'll leave the reader to draw his/her own conclusions concerning the "Password protected login" feature, pausing only to doubt its usefulness in protecting my data when it doesn't use any encryption, but it's nice to know they've *finally* addressed the telnet/FTP problem.  And just in time for a shiny new release, too.  I'll be the most handsome web surfer at the local cafe.

Cheers,
