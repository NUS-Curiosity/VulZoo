Subject: Re: Mr. Lemming

Andrew, are you in some way suggesting that if another person engages in
conversation with me, that it will be frowned upon and/or cause them
problems?

If so, maybe you should go and give this same advice to the list of people
I've worked with on my linkedin profile, and watch how quickly you are told
to go and do one.

It is exactly this kind of narrow minded, stereotypical thinking that
alienates those with real talent, but a troubled history.
