I don't know who is a more worthless idiot, the people posting things
that will (without question) flood into oblivion because no one gives
a shit... or the town idiot who always feels the need to chime in to
prolong it. You'd think on a list this size, there would be tons of
town idiots...

But no, 99% of the time it's always that same idiot.
