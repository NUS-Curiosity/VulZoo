It is your responsibility to ensure your site remains secure no?
So sharing a host could be seen as a risk, one which you would have
considered already.
A reverse DNS on your domain output the following:
- www.shalb.org
- www.websecurity.com.ua

This most likely indicates you are sharing the host with your neighbor...
Is he the man in the relationship, or perhaps its you taking care of XSS and
he does the sysadmin?
