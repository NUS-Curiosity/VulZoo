Subject: Re: "IO wait chains" in Linux??

Hmm, I'd never heard of any of those before, I'll check them out.

Haven't really got an end goal, it's more of a learning curve trying to
teach myself some of the fundamentals about how the kernel works, and
sharing what I find.

That, and IO wait / deadlocking was the bane of my existence for the entire
of 2010 whilst attempting to try out technologies such as DRBD, XFS, OCFS2
in a HA environment :/
