-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Calendar Manager RPC Service.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the CMSD server (rpc.cmsd) which listens
by default on UDP port 32768. The process does not properly handle large
XDR-encoded ASCII strings to RPC call 10 followed by RPC call 6. This
can be abused by an attacker to overflow a buffer on the remote host.
Successful exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution.
