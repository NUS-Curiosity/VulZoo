Description:
    The kernel in rPath Linux 2 has been updated to 2.6.32.  
    
    In order to provide maximum hardware compatibility without 
    removing features already shipping as a part of rPath Linux 2, 
    we have decided to base the rPath Linux kernel on the sources 
    to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel.  This is a 2.6.32 
    kernel with a number of patches added for performance 
    improvements and additional hardware support.  Using this as 
    our "upstream" source will make it easier for us to keep up 
    with security and hardware support updates, and may also make 
    it simpler for customers to build third party kernel modules 
    when needed.
    
    In order to stay compatible with existing rPath Linux 2 
    deployments, our kernel configuration is not the same as what 
    RHEL 6 uses, and in general, rPath Linux 2 continues to be 
    quite similar to RHEL 5.
    
    Note that anaconda-templates including this kernel will need
    to be released to support installation on new hardware which
    requires this kernel update.
