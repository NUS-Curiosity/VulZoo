Quite frankly Andrew, I neither know nor care if Cal is an ex-blackhat. He
showed up on full-disclosure asking a legitimate technical question of general
interest, so in the spirit of full-disclosure, he's going to get pointed in the
direction of useful information on the topic.

It isn't like Cal got any "tips" that are both (a) secrets and (b) useful in
hacking systems - if anything, the info has all been (a) well known in the
Linux performance-tuning world, if not elsewhere, and (b) of more use for
people *defending* their systems. But that's usually the case - there's a lot
less dangerous secrets than there are insufficiently well known useful things.
