Full disclosure means just that, unfortunately we have to take all the bad
with the good.

Sure it would work well for messages just being trolls/profanities and
whatnot, but it would be up to the moderator to determine if something falls
into a non desirable category.

I am sure you can see at this point it becomes complicated. What if an issue
compromising national security gets posted (wetdream) would the moderator
remove it or keep it?

I believe it's asking a lot for someone to moderate this list, it may not
seem it but it's a huge ethical responsibility. 


....especially if a vendor ends up having a say in the moderation

David Klein
