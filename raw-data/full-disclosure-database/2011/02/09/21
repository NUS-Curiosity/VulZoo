TPTI-11-04: Adobe Shockwave GIF Logical Screen Descriptor Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-4189

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the IML32 module distributed with the
player. While parsing GIF files within a director movie (.dir or .dcr)
the code trusts the specified size of the global color table and uses it
to determine an offset to image data. The process subsequently attempts
to write two NULL bytes to the calculated address. A remote attacker can
abuse this logic to corrupt memory at a controlled location and
subsequently execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
