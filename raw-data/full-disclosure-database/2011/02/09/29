Take a careful gander at that number, then go look at the floating point spec -
it's a specific corner case that isn't obviously trivial to get right (doing
floating point *right* is a lot harder than it looks - take a class on
numerical methods sometime, you spend 75% of your time dealing with rounding
errors in the last bit).

Having said that, anybody writing floating point support for a package should
probably google 'floating point paranoia' and learn what sort of things to test
for. :)
