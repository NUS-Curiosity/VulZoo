Package        : cgiirc
Vulnerability  : cross-site scripting
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0050

Michael Brooks (Sitewatch) discovered a reflective XSS flaw in
cgiirc, a web based IRC client, which could lead to the execution
of arbitrary javascript.

For the old-stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.9-3lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your cgiirc packages.
