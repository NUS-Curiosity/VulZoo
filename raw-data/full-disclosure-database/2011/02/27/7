Subject: looking for Network Trafic Monitoring software

Hi Security/Network Gurus

I am working in an organization where we have around 50 workstations.  I am
using ADSL modem for DHCP.  I want to check the traffic.  Because recently
many times some systems were throughing more trafic.  It was difficult for
me to check each and every system mannulaly .  Is there any tool which i can
use to monitor the traffic of each and every workstation.  We are using only
Micosoft windows xp and 7 OS.

Thanks
S.Gopinath
