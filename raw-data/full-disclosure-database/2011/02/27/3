The behaviour isn't that insane. While some of us disagree with it the
python developers are correct in saying that changing this behaviour
(by default) will break stuff.

Also thanks to some awesome work by Antoine Pitrou [0]
in python3.2   -->  "http.client.HTTPSConnection,
urllib.request.HTTPSHandler and
urllib.request.urlopen now take optional arguments to allow for
server certificate checking, as recommended in public uses of HTTPS. "
