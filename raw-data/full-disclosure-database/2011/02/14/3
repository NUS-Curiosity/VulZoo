Subject: Re: High performance exception/traceback
	reporting system

Oh, having support for XMPP/AMQP would be extremely nice, ideally I'd want
to try and make it compatible with as many different messaging systems as
possible.

On top of this, each supported language would have a library containing
out-of-the-box functions which has every type of messaging/transport option
available. This means the developer can;

   - Choose to use the system out-of-the-box, using the self contained
   messaging system binaries, and simply copy and paste the exception handling
   library / code.

   - Choose to optimize the system by not using the self contained binaries
   (for example, specifying an external database / messaging system to use
   etc).

   - Modify the exception handling code to suit there needs, rather than
   having to write one up from scratch.

As for the fingerprint hashes, this is a really good idea and would make the
reporting aspect very efficient, so I'll be sure to include this.

I'd never heard of SIEM before, after looking on wikipedia I came across
"NitroSecurity" SIEM which sure does look interesting. I'm gonna have a
flick through some of these sites for some inspiration, this may end up
turning in quite a big project!
