In the past I've worked with a number of Security Incident and Event
Management[1] (SIEM) products, although I can attest to the functionality
NitroSecurity I assume it is quite similar. One of the primary faults I've
experienced was that they lacked the ability to extract useful information
from stacktraces as they have the potential to be more dynamic than the
usual messages they deal with, which are usually oneline with predictable
field values.
