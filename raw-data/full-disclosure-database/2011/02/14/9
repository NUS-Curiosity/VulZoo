iDefense Security Advisory 02.08.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 08, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

The Windows Picture and Fax Viewer "shimgvw.dll" library is used by
Windows Explorer to generate thumbnail previews for media files.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple
versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows could allow attackers to execute
arbitrary code on the targeted host. <BR><BR> An integer overflow
vulnerability exists in the "shimgvw" library. During the processing of
an image within a certain function, a bitmap containing a large
"biWidth" value can be used to cause an integer calculation overflow.
This condition can lead to the overflow of a heap buffer and may result
in the execute arbitrary code on the targeted host.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the
targeted host under the privileges of the current logged-on user.
Successful exploitation would require the attacker to entice his or her
victim into viewing a specially-crafted thumbnail leveraging the
vulnerability. <BR><BR> Some vectors of attack include e-mail, the
browser and network shares. In an e-mail-based attack, the attacker
must entice his or her victim into opening or previewing a
specially-crafted Office document containing a specially-crafted
thumbnail. In a browser-based attack, the victim must simply view a
maliciously crafted website. In a network share attack, such as UNC or
WebDAV, an attacker would require the victim to simply navigate to the
folder containing the crafted thumbnail.
