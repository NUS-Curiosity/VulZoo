Hey Alexis, 

I have to admit my opinion is a little biaised... I work for GoSecure, the best pentest company across Canada !  We are based out of Montreal, feel free to contact me off list for more info : cprevost -=at=- gosecure.ca ... We can take some time to take a look at what kind of mandate you are looking for exactly.

Cheers,
Charles
