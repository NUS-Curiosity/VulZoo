Subject: Re: Pen-Testing Companies in Quebec

Like I said, I was just curious.  Since the one and only email alexis.mcduff@...il.com has ever sent to anyone was this question to this list,  I just found it odd that you mistakenly created a new post with him CC'd with the exact same subject when replying about your company's services.  It's almost like it was a fake name made up specifically to ask this question so that you could reply back to talk about your company.  But, since you've already cleared that up, I guess we don't have to worry about people using this list for that kind of thing :)

I'm curious.  Why didn't you just reply to his email?  Why a brand-new post?

Hey Alexis, 

I have to admit my opinion is a little biaised... I work for GoSecure, the best pentest company across Canada !  We are based out of Montreal, feel free to contact me off list for more info : cprevost -=at=- gosecure.ca ... We can take some time to take a look at what kind of mandate you are looking for exactly.

Cheers,
Charles
