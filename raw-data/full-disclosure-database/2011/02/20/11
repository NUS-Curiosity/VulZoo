Caspian,

I'm not here to catch flies, I'm here to ensure holes get patched. As I've
stated time and time again I contacted many people all throughout the "food
chain" and even went so far as contacted web developers on their personal
cellular devices. When Brown University had a problem I emailed their
security contact and within 5 hours I received word back; the same is not
true of UCF. When Berkeley had a gaping hole in their security which allowed
me into their administrative backend, I again emailed the security contact
listed in their whois information and within 12 hours heard back from them
with the vulnerability itself being patched within 18 hours; the same is not
true of UCF. I've contacted schools and organizations much larger than UCF
and received not only faster response times but have been given explicit
security contacts should I find anything new; after having disclosed over 20
bugs to UCF, I've yet to ever receive a _single_ email back or even given an
explicit security contact despite asking for one in _every_ email I send. At
this point, following the RFP Disclosure Policy, I no longer feel obligated
to work with them and will more than likely instantly disclose any
vulnerability I find in their code; if FD doesn't approve they should
consider their stance on Full Disclosure as a disclosure policy.

*"Full disclosure* requires that full details of a security vulnerability
are disclosed to the public, including details of the vulnerability and how
to detect and exploit it. The theory behind *full disclosure* is that
releasing vulnerability information immediately results in quicker fixes and
better security. Fixes are produced faster because vendors and authors are
forced to respond in order to protect their system from potential attacks as
well as to protect their own image. Security is improved because the *window
of exposure*, the amount of time the vulnerability is open to attack, is
reduced."
