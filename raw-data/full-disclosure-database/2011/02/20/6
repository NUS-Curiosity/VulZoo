Subject: Re: LFI Bug and other

Uh, did you even disclose this to the provider first? Not meaning to be
funny, but really you should have taken screenshots, informed the abuse
team, given them a reasonable amount of time to fix, then disclosed the
problem once fixed or once the time had expired (whilst giving them warning
48 hours before hand).

My apologies if you have already disclosed this too them, but even if this
was the case, you should have explained the story better, showing the
disclosure timeframes etc.

> >   Problem Description:
> >
> >   Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in python-django:
> >
> >   Django 1.1.x before 1.1.4 and 1.2.x before 1.2.5 does not properly
> >   validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header,
> >   which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site
> >   request forgery (CSRF) attacks via forged AJAX requests that leverage
> >   a combination of browser plugins and redirects, a related issue to
> >   CVE-2011-0447 (CVE-2011-0696).
> >
> >   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Django 1.1.x before
> >   1.1.4 and 1.2.x before 1.2.5 might allow remote attackers to inject
> >   arbitrary web script or HTML via a filename associated with a file
> >   upload (CVE-2011-0697).
> >
> >   Directory traversal vulnerability in Django 1.1.x before 1.1.4 and
> >   1.2.x before 1.2.5 on Windows might allow remote attackers to read or
> >   execute files via a / (slash) character in a key in a session cookie,
> >   related to session replays (CVE-2011-0698).
> >
> >   The updated packages have been upgraded to the 1.1.4 version which
> >   is not vulnerable to these issues.
