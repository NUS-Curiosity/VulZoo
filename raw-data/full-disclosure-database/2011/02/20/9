Subject: Re: University of Central Florida Multiple LFI

Chris and Luis,
Thinking that a university IT department is a centralized, monolithic structure (like it is in most businesses) is stretching it. Most of the places I've worked with or for have little internal empires run by whoever got there first, and their budgets are pretty slim. Having something like a regular infrastructure meeting would be great if the heads of the official infrastructure department even knew who the other infrastructure stakeholders were, but they usually don't. 

Additionally, 5 days or even 12 is far too short a time to disclose vulns for institutions that have a support response time of a week or more (most universities move at a glacial pace). While I realize that you think this is critical, their IT managers might not have any idea what the problem is (communications are poor, they are usually undertrained and underpaid), and certainly have about 300 other things to think about that are likely just as serious to them (like prof Fuzzyhair's massive lab installation, or the director of research needing a new pc). Next time, make a few phone calls, and not to the peons who run the support desk (no offense, help desk), call the head of IT or the president, rector, or someone equally high up, and give them enough time to respond. You catch more flies with honey, etc..

If anything they should have regular infrastructure meetings where items like this should be at the top of the agenda.

In addition to that I have gone so far as to finding one of the developer's website (http://www.stevenmonetti.com/) and not only emailing him, but adding him to my gTalk list (the invitation to which he has yet to accept after about a month) and after looking at his resume left him a text message and a voicemail all with no contact back. I am flat out when reporting vulnerabilities and let the affected party know from day one that I follow the RFP Responsible Disclosure Policy and if I don't hear back in 5 days I no longer need to work with them. On days 3 and 5 I always email back if they haven't gotten back in contact with me and once again reiterate the disclosure policy. At this point they must not care enough if I was doing that every 3 days for quite some time. If they don't care about their own security then something must happen to make them care.
