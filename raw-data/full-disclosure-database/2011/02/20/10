Subject: Re: [Google Chrome Browser] Google Mail Checker
 Plus: JavaScript Code Execution

The XSS in Google Mail Checker Plus was reported in 06/2010. However, the
latest version is still vulnerable.

The PoC can be an email with a body like this:
Anything in this line, or nothing at all
<script>alert('you are vulnerable');</script>

I posted a notification on their support forum yesterday.
