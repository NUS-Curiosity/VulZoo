Hello full disclosure!!

  i is like to warn you about is consumer profiling. As is thor state:
"they have to send all this information to the Seattle police in case
any of the titles I turned in were reported stolen by someone" So I is
must warn you now!!

  law enforcement is agencies is concerned with this is information in
order to stop terrorism. is we now think of this reason for police is
need information, we only need to look in movie se7en with brangelina
pitt and morgan fairchild, in part where is blackie tell tyler durden:
"he is give me all information for library books, everyone is keep
records!!"

  deductive reasoning is state:

i) user turn in 100s of games (high likelihood of stolen property,
seller needs money for crank)
ii) 100s is of games are all terrorist games (is proof in titles:
Fallout, Modern Warfare, Grandtheft Auto, Saints Row, Resident Evil)
iii) anyone is with such propensity for violent titles must also
listen to rap music, alternative, industrial or is make their own
music
iv) police is needed to investigate these people

  is proof system works:

i) user tries to turn in games with expired license (check thor is do this)
ii) title is 'pimp my ride' is likely to be game where pimp sell whore
iii) is established thor make his own music on his website
iv) is need to further investigate thor as he graduates from violent
video games, to angry music, to studying serial killer dexter

  musntlive is now warn all parents: 'save your is children from
violent video games, angry music and violent televisions else if not,
there is consequence: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson'
