Hello Laurent!

You are very "intelligent" man, as I see from this and previous your letter
(in 2010).

You need to take into account the next:

1. I know better where to send.

2. If you write shitty stuff, then it doesn't mean that other do the same.

3. No need to think and state instead of other people - if it's not
interesting for you, then it can be interesting for others.

4. The main and obvious thing it's that I write all my advisories from 2006
for those people who are interested in them (and there are such people, as I
know for sure). So if you or anybody else is not interested in them, just
skip them (and don't need to write me nonsenses) - I'm writing my letters
not for you, but for others who is interested in them and who thanks me for
my work. It's strange that such "intelligent" man as you didn't understand
it for last five years :-).

5. I don't need any not serious letters from you, so don't waste your time
writing me anymore, because I've put your e-mail into blacklist. Spend your
time for good things.

Best wishes & regards,
