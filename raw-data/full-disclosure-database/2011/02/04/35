To give this a little more perspective, one of our neighbors here in Seattle is a painter, and his trailer full of painting supplies was stolen.  He estimated that the value of the trailer and supplies was $20-$30K. The police told him that they didn't have the bandwidth to pursue thefts of such low value.

Apparently, a man's tools for his livelihood aren't important, but we'd better come down hard on those people who steal a game.

No, that didn't come up at the time, but I wondered the same thing.   I've not heard of any rash of XBOX game thievery around, so my feeling is that it's practiced elsewhere, though I have no evidence of that.  The thing is, stealing a $50 game in order to get $5 or so at Best Buy isn't exactly an equitable model for theft, so none of it really makes too much sense to me.
