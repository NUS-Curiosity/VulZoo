Agreed. GPG makes the rather rash assumption that you use it on a
system where the computing resources can be at least somewhat
trusted (i.e. it assumes you're not on a system that somebody else
may have installed a keystroke logger or similar).

1a) It may be simpler/safer to totally disable the feature so you
don't leave behind a .bash_history.

1b) If you don't trust root with your .bash_history, why do you trust
root with every single keystroke you entered while doing the commands
that created that history? (Think about that for a bit...)
