Thor,

Who knows what drug addicts would do to get some dough. We should know this
from our friend, Mr A. A (*The* iPad Hacker ;).

Jokes aside, I don't understand what the fuss is since they already had this
info when you signed up  your license.
I don't see matching a couple of games with your personal info much of a big
deal. Of course, this only me and my opinion.
Though a public-standing privacy  policy would be definitely nice. Shouldn't
have been a big deal neither.

Cheers,
Chris.
