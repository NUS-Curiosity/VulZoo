Subject: Re: Best Buy and Privacy?

No, that didn't come up at the time, but I wondered the same thing.   I've not heard of any rash of XBOX game thievery around, so my feeling is that it's practiced elsewhere, though I have no evidence of that.  The thing is, stealing a $50 game in order to get $5 or so at Best Buy isn't exactly an equitable model for theft, so none of it really makes too much sense to me.
