Subject: Re: An enemy of the infosec community needs to be
 brought to justice

I must admit this is the first time I heard about this person.

I did the obvious, running a Google search on his name, coming up with the
following page: http://gregorydevans.com/
I sure hope that is NOT in fact his page. Surely an "entrepreneur" knows how
to writing visually appeasing websites, which even a 10 year old could do.

Assuming the above is in fact his site, I took the liberty to criticize
those supposedly "facts".

#1 - I know of another guy that did a similar thing to AT&T. Got caught over
drug issues.

#2 - Some people are permanently glued to TV. Plus, you need acting skills
to appear on TV, not "hacking".

#3 - Whatever. I've repeatedly taught people my own age (an sometimes older)
certain aspects of a certain industry. Not a biggie really.

#4 - Gregory D Evans invented GPS?!! (I was being sarcastic)

#5 - I know a guy that wrote the world's best seller over a security-related
fiction story. He doesn't count himself as the "World's #1 Hacker".

#6 - Uhm, there's always a fist time. Successful writers are usually good at
it.

#7 - Uh, nope?! How exactly does Mr Evans track downloading of his
competitors?

#8 - Irrelevant.

#9 - Irrelevant. (hint: how many such companies actually exist? the only one
!= the best one can get)

#10 - The effectiveness of such courses could be more relevant. As an
independent developer, I realized one can learn from a 4-hour tutorial more
than one can get from a whole year of CS at Uni.

#11 - Well, there's company which is the only one in history to serve our
company. What about it?

#12 - Must have took a long time to realize this after #6.

#13 - So what? Lots of people writes mobile applications. Speaking of
myself, I write real software, not package some sh*t in a "mobile
application" and call it a masterpiece.

#14 - Irrelevant.

#15 - Only a fool would enjoy his stay of "Fools Weekly". If both channels
have casual viewers as the intended audience, I doubt his stay served any
purpose. Now, if it were a BBC documentary, I'd give some credit...

#16 - Might be because no one else sees it worthwhile?

#17 - Oh God. Seriously.

#18 - I was pretty sure "geek.net" was much more popular. Either case,
appearances may not mean anything. You'd be surprised what a monster of a PC
could be hidden behind a P2-era case...

#19 - It all comes down to what the adjective, "largest", is applied to. For
instance, if it applied to "ugliness and hot air", I'd wholeheartedly agree.

#20 - Uh, no 20?!


It's worth to note that a little time into writing this, I noticed his
WORDPRESS site was DOWN (or, uhm, seems like someone flipped over a switch
;) or several..). Well, Wordpress is a good platform, but his site really
puts Wordpress to shame.
Well, maybe while fixing his site, he might consider getting a professional
10-year-old to do it. Maybe great hackers don't have the time to design
visually appeasing stuff, who knows!

Cheerio,
Chris.
