ZDI-11-039: BMC PATROL Agent Service Daemon BGS_MULTIPLE_READS Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-039

February 3, 2011

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
BMC Software

-- Affected Products:
BMC Software Patrol

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of BMC Patrol Agent. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the service daemon which listens by
default on TCP port 6768. When processing the BGS_MULTIPLE_READS
commands a user-supplied length value is trusted and utilized in reading
arbitrary data into a stack buffer. By providing large enough values a
remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context
of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
BMC Software states:
BMC Performance Assurance for Servers
Versions 7.4.00, 7.4.10, 7.4.15, 7.5.00, 7.5.10 January, 2011 Tracking
number QM001683974: Potential vulnerability in network-accessible binary
Service Daemon and Manager Daemon

BMC Software is alerting users of the following products to a potential
problem:
- BMC Performance Analysis for Servers, versions 7.4.00 through 7.5.10
- BMC Performance Assurance for Servers, versions 7.4.00 through 7.5.10
- BMC Performance Assurance for Virtual Servers, versions 7.4.00 through
7.5.10
- BMC Performance Analyzer for Servers, versions 7.4.00 through 7.5.10
- BMC Performance Predictor for Servers, versions 7.4.00 through 7.5.10
- BMC Capacity Management Essentials 1.2.00 (7.4.15)

This technical bulletin describes a patch that prevents the problem from
occurring. If you have any questions about the problem or the patch,
contact BMC Software Customer Support at 800 537 1813 (United States or
Canada) or call your local support center.

BMC Software thanks Manuel Santamarina-Suarez, of the TippingPoint Zero
Day Initiative (ZDI), for reporting this issue.

Potential vulnerability in network accessible binaries Service Daemon
and Manager Daemon 

BMC Software has identified a potential security exposure in Perform
binaries Service Daemon and Manager Daemon, which listen on a network
port. (The default port is 6768.) This problem affects all supported
versions of these products. 

This is a remotely exploitable memory corruption that can result in the
remote execution of arbitrary code such as the Perform Installation
Owner account on UNIX, or the SYSTEM account on Windows.

You can correct this issue by downloading and applying the appropriate
patch for your operating system and version of these products.
