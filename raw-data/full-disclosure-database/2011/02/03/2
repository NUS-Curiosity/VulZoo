 brought to justice

How about you give some real examples of why he is considered to be a "fraud
in the infosec community".

I know nothing of LIGATT security, nor this Gregory character, but one must
notice that the person who posted this thread, didn't even have the balls to
post using their real details. Or to quote a famous movie "I bet you'd f*ck
a guy in the ass and not even have the common decency to give him a reach
around".

Tbh, even if he is considered a fraud, that doesn't make him any different
than the majority of the asshats in the so called "infosec community", the
only difference is he has been on TV/Radio and thus has had more public
attention.
