Here’s a better formatted version, as the bio now seems to be “down” lol.



Facts About Gregory Evans



Fact 1 – Gregory Evans was ordered to pay back $10 million to AT&T, MCI and
other fortune 500 companies due to computer hacking.

*Christian Sciberras*: #1 - I know of another guy that did a similar thing
to AT&T. Got caught over drug issues.



Fact 2 – According to Nielsen Audience, 3,043,600 people listened to Gregory
Evans speak in 2010 on national television and radio stations.

*Christian Sciberras*: #2 - Some people are permanently glued to TV. Plus,
you need acting skills to appear on TV, not "hacking".



Fact 3 – The State Bar in California, Nevada, and Georgia has authorized
Gregory Evans to teach Continuing Legal Education to attorneys.

*Christian Sciberras*: #3 - Whatever. I've repeatedly taught people my own
age (an sometimes older) certain aspects of a certain industry. Not a biggie
really.



Fact 4 - Gregory Evans invented the worlds first device to track a computer
anywhere in the world.

*Christian Sciberras*: #4 - Gregory D Evans invented GPS?!! (I was being
sarcastic)



Fact 5 – Gregory Evans wrote 8 books on computer security and identity
theft.

*Christian Sciberras*: #5 - I know a guy that wrote the world's best seller
over a security-related fiction story. He doesn't count himself as the
"World's #1 Hacker".



Fact 6 - Greg Evans wrote the only book in the world dedicated to laptop
security.

*Christian Sciberras*: #6 - Uhm, there's always a fist time. Successful
writers are usually good at it.



Fact 7 – LocatePC is the most downloaded computer tracking software in the
world.

*Christian Sciberras*: #7 - Uh, nope?! How exactly does Mr Evans track
downloading of his competitors?



Fact 8 – Gregory Evans is the founder of 3 publicly traded companies. Mr.
Evans sold The Cyber Group Network and the other 2 are currently trading
under the stock symbol LGTT and SPFM.

*Christian Sciberras*: #8 - Irrelevant.



Fact 9 – Gregory Evans owns the 2nd largest caller ID spoofing services in
the world.

*Christian Sciberras*: #9 - Irrelevant. (hint: how many such companies
actually exist? the only one != the best one can get)



Fact 10 – Gregory Evans has taught over 5 different Cyber Security courses
on college campus such as, Santa Monica City College, Irvine Valley College,
California State University, Los Angeles, San Marcos College, Pepperdine
University, Anaheim City College, Rancho Santiago College, and ITT in
Duluth, GA.

*Christian Sciberras*: #10 - The effectiveness of such courses could be more
relevant. As an independent developer, I realized one can learn from a
4-hour tutorial more than one can get from a whole year of CS at Uni.



Fact 11 Cyber Group Network and LIGATT Security are the only computer
security companies in history to be the Official Cyber Security company for
the NBA and the NHL, teams like the Los Angeles Clippers, Atlanta Hawks, and
the Thrashers.

*Christian Sciberras*: #11 - Well, there's company which is the only one in
history to serve our company. What about it?



Fact 12 Evans wrote the first book on Laptop Security.

*Christian Sciberras*: #12 - Must have took a long time to realize this
after #6.



Fact 13 LIGATT Security developed one Android and two iPhone Applications –
Cyber P.I. for the iPhone. iSPOOFEM for iPhone and Android  phones.  LIGATT
Security has three other iPhone and iPad apps under Apple review at this
time.

*Christian Sciberras*: #13 - So what? Lots of people writes mobile
applications. Speaking of myself, I write real software, not package some
sh*t in a "mobile application" and call it a masterpiece.



Fact 14 Distribution – Gregory Evans company LIGATT Security signed a
distribution deal with the multi-billion distributor D and H Distribution.

*Christian Sciberras*: #14 - Irrelevant.



Fact 15 Gregory Evans is the only computer security expert to be featured on
Fox News Network (3 times) and CNN (currently a regular).

*Christian Sciberras*: #15 - Only a fool would enjoy his stay of "Fools
Weekly". If both channels have casual viewers as the intended audience, I
doubt his stay served any purpose. Now, if it were a BBC documentary, I'd
give some credit...



Fact 16 Evans is the only Computer Security Expert to write articles for
Essence Magazine.

*Christian Sciberras*: #16 - Might be because no one else sees it
worthwhile?



Fact 17 Evans is the only expert to be interviewed by 3 hip-hop magazines:
Rolling Out, Crème and Ozone Magazine.

*Christian Sciberras*: #17 - Oh God. Seriously.



Fact 18 Evans has the largest line of clothing for Computer Nerds, Geeks, IT
Managers and Hackers. HackerGearOnine.com

*Christian Sciberras*: #18 - I was pretty sure "geek.net" was much more
popular. Either case, appearances may not mean anything. You'd be surprised
what a monster of a PC could be hidden behind a P2-era case...



Fact 19 Evans has one of the largest computer security news portal websites
in the world.  NationalCyberSecurity.com

*Christian Sciberras*: #19 - It all comes down to what the adjective,
"largest", is applied to. For instance, if it applied to "ugliness and hot
air", I'd wholeheartedly agree.



*Christian Sciberras*: #20 - Uh, no 20?!
