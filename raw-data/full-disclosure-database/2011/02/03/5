Gregory D. Evans / LIGATT Security
A supposed "hi-tech hustler", "WORLD'S NO 1 HACKER" and convicted
felon (Bureau of Prisons #13432-112), Gregory Dante Evans has invented
himself as some form of hacker with the ability to break into anything
and spin that supposed knowledge into advising companies on security.
In reality, Evans and his company have little real knowledge beyond
pedestrian hacking techniques found in plagiarized books and beginner
hacking texts. His company, LIGATT Security International, offers a
"suite" of products that are bloated version of common tools such as
ping and nmap. Evans, who plagiarizes content rather than write it
himself, is over US$10 million in debt due to his own history of crime
and his inability to run a company. Every press release, every video
cast, every public communication is full of discrepancies, half-truths
and outright lies.
