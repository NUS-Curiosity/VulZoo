Subject: Re: Full-Disclosure Digest, Vol 72, Issue 6

Narcissm in final stage. Is it a joke or a social engineering attack or 
both? Real Hackers know that they know nothing in the security area. 
Humility is the foundation for a good hacker not TV, Hacker conferences, 
... Never be proud on your Security+, CISSP certifications or whatever. 
You can buy this on your local supermarket. This is real hacker ethics 
in my mind.
