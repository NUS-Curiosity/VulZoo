We once had an incident where after the guy whacked the box, he intentionally
spammed the box with more incorrect logins, just so when we went to respond,
none of the sysadmins were able to login because their accounts were all off in
the "too many failed logins, logins suspended for 30 mins" limbo.

Like most security features, rate-limiting logins can be used against you by
an attacker with sufficient security jiu-jitsu.
