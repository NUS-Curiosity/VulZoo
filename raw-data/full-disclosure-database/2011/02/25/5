Subject: Re: Why should the presence of shebang (#!) freak
 out ANY security conscious guy?

RFC3986 marks both # and ! as reserved characters (sec 2.2); from a skim
read, # is used for fragment identification (somewhere in sec 3) and there
is a small note on ! ' and " at the end of the document.  More a standards
issue than a security issue.

Also, what he'd quoted !# is not the "shebang" used to guide unix shells,
which is #!, and also what you quoted.
