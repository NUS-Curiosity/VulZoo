Something about that sounds wrong.
Anyone posting from your companies connection will be sending out their IP addresses with each web request, be it to a proxy or a third party.
If you wanted, for whatever reason, to route your traffic through a web proxy, so that your companies main address isn't shown, something like Squid on entirely different IP range might be useful.
As for Mac addresses, anyone sniffing your lan or wlan can find those out. If this happens, you've got more than just a small problem, however.
I'm still not sure what your aim is, here, though.
TO stop general data leakage, you could look into OpenDLP, though this would only work for your Windows workstations.
If you wanted to add a Mac component, you could code it, if you have experience in programming.

List, please correct me if I'm off base with any of this.

Sincerely,
Brandon McGinty
