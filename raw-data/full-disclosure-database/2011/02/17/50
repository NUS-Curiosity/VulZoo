Subject: Vulnerability is in response

Hello full-disclosure!!

I is like to warn you about rhetoric and annoyance nuisance. Is once
upon a time MustLive has maybe is one exploit to is make me say "черт
возьми!" howisever MustLive is how you say? pička in Crotia.

Is I top post for annoy:

1) MustLive is lonely pička with is one to many copy of cracked
Accunetix is run in background to report to full disclosure (hi is
look at me, I find vuln no one is care about!!)

2) Is vuln he find are old news to many who choose is not to release
lame advisory (is especially those future advisory of his)

3) Is every so often I is want to kick him in teeth and say "is shut
up puto sucio"

Your guess is wrong. MustLive is point and click-kiddiot (&TM;) who is
never discovery real vulnerability and is not even know what is EAX
(is hint not to be confused with is LAX airport)

4) Is stop feeding troll
