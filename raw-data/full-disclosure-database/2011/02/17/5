Package        : telepathy-gabble
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : none yet

It was discovered that telepathy-gabble, the Jabber/XMMP connection manager
for the Telepathy framework, is processing google:jingleinfo updates without
validating their origin.  This may allow an attacker to trick telepathy-gabble
into relaying streamed media data through a server of his choice and thus
intercept audio and video calls.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.6-1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.15-1+squeeze1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your telepathy-gabble packages.
