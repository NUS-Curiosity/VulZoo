Subject: Re: Vulnerability in reCAPTCHA for Drupal

If you thing that some statements from MustLive like the following:

"

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

At POST request to the page with form with using of Cyrillic char in
parameter op, the error message is showing, which consists the full path on
the system.

Vulnerabilities exist at pages:http://site/user/,http://site/user/1/edit,
http://site/user/password,http://site/user/register,http://site/contact,
http://site/user/1/contact. Other pages which have forms also can be
vulnerable.

Exploit:

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2011/Drupal%20Full%20path%20disclosure.html

As noted Drupal developers, these vulnerabilities appear due to turned on
debugging option in administrator panel. So for preventing of these and
other FPD at the site it's needed to turn off this option.

"
are not hilarious, then you're a really noob.
I mean, every Drupal user knows that the default path to register a new 
user is user/register,
or that the default admin account is reachable at user/1, or that the 
contact form is at the contact URI.

These are not vulnerabilities, and this is one of the many reasons why 
almost no-one in FD
read his "advisories" and flag his address as spam :)

> Hello list!

> I want to warn you about Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerability in

> In project MoBiC in 2007 I already wrote about bypassing of reCaptcha for

> -------------------------
> Affected products:

> Vulnerable are all versions of reCAPTCHA plugin for Captcha module

> Details:

>
> Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):
>
> In different forms in Drupal the vulnerable captcha-plugin reCAPTCHA is
> using. Drupal's Captcha module is vulnerable itself, so besides reCAPTCHA

>
> For bypassing of captcha it's needed to use correct value of

> Vulnerabilities exist on pages with forms: http://site/contact,
