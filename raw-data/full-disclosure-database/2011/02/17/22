I don't want to be invited for cross-dressing talks with you, you delusional
moron

Get back down the pub.

A long way to go? I make good money from my career, matey. (Career. Ever
heard of one?) You on the other hand are firmly wedged in cloud-cuckoo. I
work for the government at the minute, and no-one here has ever heard of
you.

Goodnight.

the unknown will be gratified to learn that there is no hidden message
revealed by reading this warning backwards, so just ignore that Alert Notice

However, by pouring a complete circle of salt around yourself and your
computer you can ensure that no harm befalls you and your pets. If you have
received this email in error, please add some nutmeg and egg whites, whisk
and place in a warm oven for 40 minutes.*
