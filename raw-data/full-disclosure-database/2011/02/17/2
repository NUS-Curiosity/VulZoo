February 16, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0364

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Cisco

-- Affected Products:
Cisco Security Agent Management Console

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cisco Security Agent Management Console.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The flaw exists within the webagent.exe component which is handed
requests by an Apache instance that listens by default on TCP port 443.
When handling an st_upload request the process does not properly
validate POST parameters used for a file creation. The contents of this
newly created file are controllable via another POST variable. A remote
attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under
the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Cisco has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
