The right to free expression can be restricted if this is necessary to protect the reputation of others. The law of defamation allows persons who consider that their reputation has been or may be harmed by statements made by others to sue for damages or to prevent the making of those statments. http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/right-of-free-expression/defamation/index.html

You're treading on very thin ice.
