Ah, so that's how you don't seem to realise what you call the 'disclosure
community' was largely founded by people you call 'criminal blackhats' - you
were still at school.

How embarassing it must have been for you when you realised the very list
you were spouting that crap on was founded by an (alleged) ex-hacker who did
jail time..

Perhaps you should now have the courage of your (non) convictions and stay
away from full disclosure and bugtraq ? After all, they're tainted for you
now, aren't they
