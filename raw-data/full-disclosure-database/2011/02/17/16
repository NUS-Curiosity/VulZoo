Andrew, have you even looked at my linkedin profile?

I designed and implemented an embedded router (from scratch) directly for a
local authority in the UK for UTMS (Urban Traffic Management System). I also
gave a private conference (where I was the *only* speaker) of which there
were 40 attendees from large financial institutions, NCS (National Crime
Squad, now known as SOCA) and APACS.

For example, I doubt you have even heard of QnetiQ, let alone had any
involvement with them :S
