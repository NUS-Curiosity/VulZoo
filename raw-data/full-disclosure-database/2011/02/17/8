Subject: Announcing NVD CVE parser for Ruby on Rails

Hello list!

I'd like to announce the public release of the FreeBSD licensed FIDIUS
CVE-DB RubyGem.

The FIDIUS CVE-DB gem is used to create and run your own vulnerability
database. It uses the National Vulnerability Database to gather
vulnerability entries which are based on the Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) identifiers.

Therefore it includes rake tasks to download and parse XML files provided
by the NVD, to store and update them in your personal database.
Furthermore it includes ActiveRecord models, migrations and example
database configuration to store vulnerabilities easily.

This gem is developed in the context of the students project "FIDIUS"
at the Universitaet Bremen, and is available here:

    https://rubygems.org/gems/fidius-cvedb
    https://github.com/fidius/cvedb

Cheers
