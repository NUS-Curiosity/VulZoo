Yes, but that's the *URL PATH*.  What's the full path *on the filesystem*?
Is it /opt/drupal/user/register?  Or did they stick it in /usr/local/drupal?
Or somewhere else?  This actually matters if you're trying to do
a tree traversal exploit like ../../../path/to/drupal/install/ - or if
you *thought* you had configured your system so it wouldn't leak full
pathnames so skiddies couldn't abuse tree traversal exploits.
