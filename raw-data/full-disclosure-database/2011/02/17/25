I bet you never even used the term "local authority" until I posted it just
then lol.

As for 'central government organisation' in Cheltenham, you are most
likely referring to GCHQ and/or the new department that was branched off
from it to deal with cyber crime. If this is the case, then you are going to
be taught a very serious lesson from one of the risk assessment officers.
Even hinting that you have involvements with GCHQ outside of you duties
(unless you are an MP making a public statement), is grounds to have your
employment/contract suspended and/or terminated.

Seriously mate, I know the score when it comes to this area, and I don't
even for a second the bullshit you are peddling.
