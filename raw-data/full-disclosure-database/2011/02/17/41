Subject: (this thread is now about porn).‏

Ah, now this is a different subject entirely! It suits some, but not
others.

Personally, I think there's nothing better (porn wise) than seeing the sad
look on a dumb broads face after she realized what she's just done. Or even
better, the constant sad look on her face when she's doing the scene, and
you know she's only doing it for the money, and that it's her first time,
and probably her last. Mind you, working on facialabuse.com has pretty much
desensitized me to *everything* (check out the Tecey video, classic
example!). Maybe check out the front page video for
http://bit.ly/1KTVJv(xxxlubetube), I gotta admit that did kinda make
me go "eww".

And another thing, no matter how bad a recession is, there will *always* be
a market for sex and porn. No matter if someone loses their job, their home,
their wife and kids etc, their hand and the internet will be a steady friend
for them. It helps save marriages because it gives the individual a means of
escape and fantasy, without resorting to cheating.
