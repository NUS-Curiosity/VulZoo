"Cal is a blackhat with criminal convictions, I hope he is forced from the
list by an uprising of whitehats.

I'm a whitehat and its upsetting to see the disclosure community being taken
over by criminals.

this list ?  Then go look them up in wikipedia....

While yer at it, check out Scott Chasin, who founded bugtraq...

And 8lgm, who were prolific bugtraq posters...

the list goes on and on (and on and on).  How old are you, son ?
