Agreed - by not taking further steps following the complete negligence of
the institution to protect the security of their assets (and thereby placing
students & staff at risk) there must be some further incentive to bring this
to their attention. If anything they should have regular infrastructure
meetings where items like this should be at the top of the agenda.

Its unfortunate that it has to come to this with many institutions - I have
had many similar experiences.
