Weev,

I actually know many of the "techrangers" who are UCF employed students
which are in charge of maintaining websites and have spoken to them
personally about these and other vulnerabilities many times in the past and
they have yet to patch them. In addition to that I have gone so far as to
finding one of the developer's website (http://www.stevenmonetti.com/) and
not only emailing him, but adding him to my gTalk list (the invitation to
which he has yet to accept after about a month) and after looking at his
resume left him a text message and a voicemail all with no contact back. I
am flat out when reporting vulnerabilities and let the affected party know
from day one that I follow the RFP Responsible Disclosure Policy and if I
don't hear back in 5 days I no longer need to work with them. On days 3 and
5 I always email back if they haven't gotten back in contact with me and
once again reiterate the disclosure policy. At this point they must not care
enough if I was doing that every 3 days for quite some time. If they don't
care about their own security then something must happen to make them care.
