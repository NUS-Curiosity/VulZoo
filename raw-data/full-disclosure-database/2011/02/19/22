I'll side-step the discussion of possible ethical and legal ramifications here.

However, I humbly suggest there are ways to escalate ones concerns in
most organizations, especially open ones like public .edus.  For
example, one could, after "no contact back" from a .edus security/site
owners could notify the .edu's general counsel and president's office,
perhaps cc'ing US-CERT and CERT/CC as well.  Having your process,
intentions and outcomes documented in a disclosure policy that you've
provided to all parties from initial communication also might be
something to consider.

Cheers,
