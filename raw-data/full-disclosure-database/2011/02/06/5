Why not use the GPG solution but instead of leaving your key open, you
require a password (encrypted key)?  This way, if root does a su - user
it will need the 'password' to open your key to decrypt the file.

Integrating that with PAM seems very easy so when you type the password
to login, the same password is used to call the GPG and open your
key...  If the root changes the password and then logs with this new
password, it will not work in your encrypted key.
