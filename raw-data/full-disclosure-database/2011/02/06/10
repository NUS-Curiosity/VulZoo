This sounds highly questionable, especially after reading the article of
Brad. The same goes with Cisco of course.
So what else than the marketing guy certification can we get? Before
designing an architecture, I need much more.

Sure but in that case, this is not the same code, nor the same editor,
hardware, etc.
Of course there are exploits too, but the probability of having 2
exploits on totally differents devices at the same time is lower than
only 1 exploit.
