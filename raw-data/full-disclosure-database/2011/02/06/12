We could wait for the next 0day of HP procurve, Cisco Catalyst or Dell
PowerConnect firmware as well ;)

The history of software bugs so far tells us that, until now, the chance to have
a 0day of a firewall is greater than the chance of the 0day of a switch firmware.

I am not telling that switches are bulletproof, I am only talking about probability.
