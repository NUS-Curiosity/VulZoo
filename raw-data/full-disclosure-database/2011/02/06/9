vmware certifies the solution "DMZ+LAN" within a single vmware host with two
vswitches.

This is of course true until proven false, that is sending IP packets from the
LAN or DMZ to Internet and viceversa bypassing the firewall protection.

If you keep the netwok separated you bet that another piece of code (the
firewall) could not be compromised.
