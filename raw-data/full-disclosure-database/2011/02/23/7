all apologies, that was not my intent in the least-- referencing the public portion of the aurora stuff, which is part of the myth I thought you were referencing. I wasn't actua
lly trying to get you to comment on anything employer related, just assuming you drew your experience that formed the basis of the opinion.

Fair enough; and I would agree with what all you had to say there. Something to note is that I've never held a clearance, sometimes they need to come up with terms for communicating with the 'unclean' who is doing the work, thus terms like APT are born. If I had to tie down the A somewhere, I'd probably couple it with some of the social aspects-- like having phd level scientists available for the early stages of your phishing attacks.
