Subject: Re: Announcing NVD CVE parser for Ruby on Rails

Hi,
If you don't want to maintain your own CVE database you can use
http://www.cvedetails.com/  , someone (me) already maintains it for you. If
you also want to view full details of related OVAL definitions you can use
http://www.itsecdb.com/oval/

Regards
Serkan
