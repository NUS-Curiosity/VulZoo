-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Netware. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The flaw exists within the XNFS.NLM component which listens by default
on UDP port 1234. When handling the an NFS RPC request the
xdrDecodeString function uses a user supplied length value to null
terminate a string. This value can be signed allowing the NULL byte to
be written at an arbitrary address. A remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the system.
