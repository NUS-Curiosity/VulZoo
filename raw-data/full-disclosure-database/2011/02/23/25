Subject: Re: What the f*** is going on?

Michal hit the nail on it's head. The news isn't want some script kiddie
ring did to some supposedly info sec website as much as what the whole
industria is leading to.

So the public thinks the bad guys go around in suits and neckties with the
intent of "breaking the net" when the truth is there's a huge broken mess
out there.

Even worse, those paid to fix it do not give a hoot and often times make it
worse (re: HBGary).

The media of course follows the more sensational news, some supposedly
vigilantes (correction: vandals) attacking some sites.

Well, we've been saying the net's broken for how long, 10, 30 years? News is
kinda getting old. And where are we now?

Salute,
Pietro DeMedici
