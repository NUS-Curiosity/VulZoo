Totally understandable; I need to figure out the 'rhetorical question' emoticon and I probably should've put a disclaimer of some sort up there somewhere. I know how sensitive this sector can be.

I generally agree, other than I think it's important to understand that regardless of our sentiments, 'they' believe in it and are investing in it and that sorta makes it reality. The more people call things a myth or unimportant or hype or what not, the more it operates in the dark. We're not talking about germans who think they live in a crashed UFO and are out to lift your 0-day, we're talking about the governments of the world realizing they have a new black-ops tool.  That sorta makes it fundamentally different, or at least it does to me.

either way, we're mostly on the same page; didn't mean to drag it out. cheers.
