+------------------

Cisco TelePresence Recording Server devices that are running an
affected version of software are affected.

To determine the current version of software that is running on the
Cisco TelePresence Recording Server, SSH into the device and issue the
show version active and the show version inactive commands. The
output should resemble the following example:

    admin: show version active
    Active Master Version: 1.7.0.0-151

    Active Version Installed Software Options:
    No Installed Software Options Found.

    admin: show version inactive
    Inactive Master Version: 1.6.2.0-237

    Inactive Version Installed Software Options:

    No Installed Software Options Found.

In the preceding example, the system has versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.0
loaded on the device and version 1.7.0 is currently active. A device
is affected only by vulnerabilities that are present in the active
software version.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco TelePresence solution allows for immersive, in-person
communication and collaboration over the network with colleagues,
prospects, and partners even when they are located in opposite
hemispheres.

This security advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities in
the Cisco TelePresence Recording Server. These vulnerabilities are
independent of each other.

Unauthenticated Java Servlet Access
+----------------------------------

A number of sensitive Java Servlets delivered via a Java Servlet
framework within the Cisco TelePresence Recording Server could allow
a remote, unauthenticated attacker to perform actions that should be
restricted to administrative users. To successfully exploit this
vulnerability, the attacker would need the ability to submit a
crafted request to an affected device on TCP port 80, TCP port 443,
or TCP port 8080.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit these vulnerabilities.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCtf42005 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0383.

CGI Command Injection
+--------------------

A CGI command injection vulnerability exists within the Cisco
TelePresence Recording Server that could allow a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated
privileges. To successfully exploit this vulnerability the attacker
would need the ability to submit a malformed request to an affected
device via TCP port 443.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit these vulnerabilities.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCtf97221 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0382.

Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
+------------------------------------

An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists within the
administrative web interface of the Cisco TelePresence Recording
Server. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could place content to
arbitrary locations on the device by submitting crafted requests to
the affected device. To successfully exploit this vulnerability the
attacker would need the ability to submit a crafted request to an
affected device on TCP port 80 or 443.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCth85786 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0385.

XML-RPC Arbitrary File Overwrite
+-------------------------------

An arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability exists within Cisco
TelePresence Recording Server devices that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to overwrite arbitrary files with
logging data. This vulnerability could be leveraged to obtain full
control of the affected device. To successfully exploit this
vulnerability the attacker would need the ability to submit a
malformed request to an affected device via TCP port 12102 or 12104.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCti50739 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0386.

Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution
+---------------------------------------------

A remote code execution vulnerability exists within Cisco
TelePresence Recording Server devices. This vulnerability could allow
an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a buffer overflow
condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must submit a
malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the affected system.

Because Cisco Discovery Protocol works at the data-link layer (Layer
2), an attacker must have a way to submit an Ethernet frame directly
to an affected device. This may be possible in situations where the
affected system is part of a bridged network or connected to a
nonpartitioned device such as a network hub.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCtd75769 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0379.

Ad Hoc Recording Denial of Service
+---------------------------------

A denial of service vulnerability exists within Cisco TelePresence
Recording Server devices. The vulnerability could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause all recording and playback
threads on the device to be consumed. A restart of the affected
device may be required to regain functionality. To successfully
exploit this vulnerability the attacker would need the ability to
submit a malformed request to an affected device via TCP port 80.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCtf97205 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0391.

Java RMI Denial of Service
+-------------------------

A denial of service vulnerability exists within Cisco TelePresence
Recording Server devices due to a failure to properly restrict access
to the RMI interface of the Java Servlet framework. An
unauthenticated, remote attacker could trigger an out-of-memory
condition on the Servlet host by issuing a series of crafted
requests. To successfully exploit this vulnerability the attacker
would need the ability to communicate to an affected device on TCP
port 8999.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCtg35830 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0388.

Unauthenticated XML-RPC Interface
+--------------------------------

An unauthenticated XML-RPC interface exists within Cisco TelePresence
Recording Server devices. This vulnerability could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a limited number of
actions on the system that should be restricted to authorized users.
To successfully exploit this vulnerability the attacker would need
the ability to communicate to an affected device on TCP port 8080.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence Recording Server - CSCtg35833 ( registered
    customers only) has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2011-0392.

their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
