Dear Bob aka corruption.addicts () hushmail com,

 

I am sure you are full of good intention. Feel free to use our contact
details for any inquiries. It would be a pleasure for us to invite you
somewhere for dinner.

 

And if you need more clarification on the current matter, we will be glad to
help you understand why we put REAL NAMES while performing black box
penetration testing. I am sure you might have missed this part during one of
our training session.

 

Have a nice day.

 

Regards,

 

Pierre-Guy
