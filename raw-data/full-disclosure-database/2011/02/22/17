I think that sentiment made sense 8-10 years ago, but today, it's
increasingly difficult to defend. I mean, we are at a point where
casual users can do without any "real" applications, beyond just
having a browser. And in terms of complexity, the browser itself is
approaching the kernel, and is growing more rapidly.

Yes, web app vulnerabilities are easier to discover. That's partly
because of horrible design decisions back in the 1990s, and partly
because we're dealing with greater diversity, more complex
interactions, and a much younger codebase. Plus, we had much less time
to develop systemic defenses.
