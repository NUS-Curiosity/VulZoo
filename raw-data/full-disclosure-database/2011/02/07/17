R7-0038: Check Point Endpoint Security Server Information Disclosure
February 7, 2011

-- Vulnerability Details:

The Check Point Endpoint Security Server and Integrity Server products
inadvertently expose a number of private directories through the web
interface. These directories include the SSL private keys, sensitive
configuration files (often containing passwords), and application binaries.

Examples of exposed files include:

https://server/conf/ssl/apache/integrity-smartcenter.cert
https://server/conf/ssl/apache/integrity-smartcenter.key
https://server/conf/ssl/apache/integrity.cert
https://server/conf/ssl/apache/integrity.key
https://server/conf/ssl/apache/smartcenter.cert
https://server/conf/ssl/integrity-keystore.jks
https://server/conf/ssl/isskeys.jks
https://server/conf/ssl/openssl.pem
https://server/conf/integrity.xml
https://server/conf/jaas/users.xml

https://server/bin/DBSeed.xml

These files are also exposed via the Tomcat server:

http://server:8080/conf/ssl/apache/integrity-smartcenter.cert



-- Vendor Response:
Check Point has issued a hotfix for Endpoint Security Server versions
R71, R72 and R73 and Integrity Server version 7.

 https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk57881

This patch blocks remote access to the Tomcat instance (8080) and
restricts access to private directories via POST and GET requests. This
patch does not prevent a remote attacker from determining the size of a
sensitive file by using HEAD requests.
