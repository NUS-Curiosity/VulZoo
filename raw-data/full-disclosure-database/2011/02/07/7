what I did for a project I was working on was I create a LD_PRELOAD library
which overloaded the i/o operations and used gz and bz2. This could easily
be adapted to overload with encryption library functions rather than
compression libraries. You can also use this to keep the bash history in
memory using a shared memory location.

As said in the rest of the thread this won't completely stop root, but it
does make it more difficult.
