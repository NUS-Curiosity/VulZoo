-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Domino. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The flaw exists within the ndiiop.exe component which listens by default
on a dynamic TCP port. When handling a GIOP getEnvironmentString request
the process blindly copies user supplied argument into an stack buffer
while checking the local variable cache. A remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
SYSTEM user.
