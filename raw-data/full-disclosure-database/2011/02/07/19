You need to distinguish between I/O that's supposed to complete quickly (for
instance, local disk I/O), and stuff that can reasonably take a while (reads
from a network connection, waiting for a file lock, etc).  The 'D' state is for
stuff that's supposed to be fast, if it's taking more than milliseconds you
have a big problem - as in "you have hit an actual kernel bug or hardware
has failed on you".  More often, you'll block inside open(), flock(), poll(),
and similar places, resulting in a 'sleeping' status.

So the big question is "what you're trying to accomplish" rather than "is there
a CLI tool that does XYZ" - most of the problems won't be found by checking for
XYZ at all...
