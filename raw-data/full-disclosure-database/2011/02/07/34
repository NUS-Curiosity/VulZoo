-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Informix Database Server. SQL query
execution privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the oninit process bound to TCP port
9088 when processing the arguments to the USELASTCOMMITTED option in a
SQL query. User-supplied data is copied into a stack-based buffer
without proper bounds checking resulting in an exploitable overflow.
Exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution under the context of
the database server.
