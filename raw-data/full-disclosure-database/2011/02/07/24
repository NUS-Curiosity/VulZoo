Hello antisnatchor!

No, I've not :-).

When some mothefucker hacked ANOTHER site (to which I had no relations) on 
the same server, rooted the server of my hoster and put lame and lying 
message to my web site and also to the mailing list - I not considering it 
as a deface ;-). It's only lame lying bullshit.

And when Laurent is believing in such bullshit and trying to use it as an 
argument, then it just shows his level of "intelligent". About which I've 
told already. So, antisnatchor, don't believe in bullshits and nonsense.

Best wishes & regards,
