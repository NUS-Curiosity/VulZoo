Subject: Learn to Fuzz with SPIKE

Hi full disclosure dudes. InfoSec Institute author Stephen Bradshaw put
together a nice tutorial: A complete guide to Fuzzing, using the SPIKE
fuzzer. There is a good chance you have heard of SPIKE, maybe even attempted
to get its block based fuzzing awesomesauce to work. It is a powerful
fuzzer, but poorly documented. 

Ever wanted to learn how to fuzz an unknown proprietary binary protocol?
This is your chance:

Already fuzzing with SPIKE (or some other lesser tool) and want to learn how
to do some advanced vuln dev? How about some fuzzer automation for dessert:

Let me know what you think of this tutorial!
