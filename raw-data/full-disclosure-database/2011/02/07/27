-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Office Excel

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way the application parses an Office
Art record within a Microsoft Excel Document. Specifically, when parsing
an office art object record, if an error occurs, the application will
add a stray reference to an element which is part of a linked list. When
receiving a window message, the application will proceed to navigate
this linked list. This will access a method from the malformed object
which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
