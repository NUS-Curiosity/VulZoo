Sneakernet virus as source of WikiLeaks cablegate, Iraq and
Afghanistan war log files.

 Package : .sgov.gov / smil.mil (SIPRNet)
 Date    : February 16, 2011
 Affected: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning

 Problem Description:

The Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) is "a system of
interconnected
computer networks used by the United States Department of Defense and the
U.S. Department of State to transmit classified information (up to and
including
information classified SECRET) over regular TCP/IP network to about
half a million
of computers world-wide.

Computers are isolated from others networks for security reasons.

No viruses that rely on TCP/IP connectivity to Command and Control
Center are able
to attack this infrastructure.

But decades old technology known as Sneakernet (aka. Floppynet,
CD-Net) based on
delivery of physical media with information able to successfully attack it.

Virus embedded in CD/DVD-RW (like one that pretend it is music-only)
can copy up to 600Mb/4Gb
of information to another PC if it will erase existing CD data and
write new one be sent to/from C&C.

By distributing "music" CD-R to USA soldiers stationed in Iraq (or
simply infecting PCs
and waiting for rewritable CD/DVD inserted) one can take control over their
Internet connected PCs and use Sneakernet as last-mile to collect
information from
SIPRNet computers.

Communication from infected PC to C&C can be done as trivially as IRC,
many open-source recording tools are available on SF.net.

After successful copy - can restore CD-RW to original state,
clean up virus from PC and initiate fake IRC conversation to cover
trails/set-up private Manning.

Solutions: SIPRNet computers/laptops should have no DVD/CD writers on them
                and no USB ports at all.
