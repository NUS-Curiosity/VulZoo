hi,

the X-Forwarded-For headerfield isn't sanitized if the request comes
from a class c network. This would affect intranet-applications.

i made a poc screencast that shows the bug with the latest rails
version with devise (authentication-plugin) and more possible attacks

http://webservsec.blogspot.com/2011/02/ruby-on-rails-vulnerability.html

quick-fix for your intranet-apps:
check request.remote_ip before you use it

best regards
J
