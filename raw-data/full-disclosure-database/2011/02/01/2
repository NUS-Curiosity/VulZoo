CHANGELOG
===========

covered remaining checks (empty array, null cookie) in
Full_Path_Disclosure
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Full_Path_Disclosure) of OWASP
Application Security Desk Reference (ASDR) Project
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ASDR_Project)

added support for generating path definition file and you can now use
-d with path-definition file to check in addition to cms directory
path

added support for reading gzip/deflate compressed response from server

added regexp support (use your own regexp rules to search in returned
responses in addition to built-in regexp error messages)

added null session cookie  support
	--null-cookie [will auto null session for all languages ]
	
added custom headers  support
	--headers "cookie: sid[%00]=1\r\nX-pingback:: %00"

	--data (var=1&var=2)
	
added method (get by default)  support
	--method post
	
added follow redirect support

added cold fusion language support; when feeded by large inputs, cold
fusion apps tend to reveal source code disclosure if without boundary
checks when used as IIS ISAPI extensions

added --rm option to remove directory used to generate path list
[suggestion by Brendan Coles]

cleaned *-vuln-path.txt file content to make it ready for path definition file

[suggestion by Sebastien Damaye]



THANKS
=======


Ryan Dewhurst (http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk) for his suggestion to
cover all checks (empty array, null cookie) of
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Full_Path_Disclosure
 --data, --param-array, -n/--null-session options.


Brendan Coles (http://itsecuritysolutions.org/, http://whatweb.net/)
for his suggestion that known web application paths should be bundled
for convenience and time saving. I've done files with dozens of
open-source web app known paths under 'paths' directory. You can do it
for your desired CMS/application by -d and -g options. See EXAMPLES
for more details. Submit latest path files to inspathx at yehg.net.


Sebastien.damaye for his write-up about inspathx tutorial ,
http://www.aldeid.com/index.php/Inspathx


And finally to developers community, their common coding practice,
their belief on path disclosure as server side issue
that make this tool meaningful and usable for current plus future web apps
