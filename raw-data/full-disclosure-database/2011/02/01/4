Subject: Book Review: Computer Incident Response and
	Product Security by Damir Rajnovic

Hi FD folks,

A short review of a new title on building a vendor product security
response and team.  I think this book would prove useful for vendors
wishing to avoid the shame and humiliation of having vulns published
when they could have avoided it with a process and team in place.

Cheers,
