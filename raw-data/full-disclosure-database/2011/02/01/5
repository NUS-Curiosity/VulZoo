Subject: Travel letter #2; What we do for knowledge

Some epic's in this one as well :)

Hello all,
I am sitting in LAX right now. This last week I have been in 
Venezuela and Columbia.

A small part of this trip was the dubious distinction that has 
resulted from around two years of work to setup. I have spoken with 
two cartels in the area.

What makes Venezuela special is that they have non-extradition 
rights as far as the US is concerned. Cybercrime is illegal in 
country, but is actually (under the table) encouraged. The 
government is happy to support criminal groups acting in the US 
(And the UK and AU) from Ve. Basically, as long as nothing is done 
against the citizens of Ve, not criminal sanctions come against the 
cartels.

For this reason, they are actually willing to talk. I managed to 
have a good walkthrough of an operation.

One major aspect is rape videos from abduced foreign nationals and 
the other is child porn videos. I was surprised to learn just how 
many US, UK and AU "clients" these cartels manage. The interesting 
thing is that once they get bank or credit card details, they move 
to an extortion model. One that lasts many years. The dumb bastards 
who buy the videos and other child porn/rape videos are extorted. 
The cartels use the information they obtain to collect evidence of 
the crime.

On top of this, there is the usual crimeware stuff.

These groups are current and moving to more former drug cartels.
Interestingly, cybercrime is earning more than cocaine. The US 
market for coke is depressed and cybercrime has been turning more 
money for the groups I met with at least.

I plan on writing it up within the next few weeks and letting sans 
do what they will with this paper. Just a freebee. Not even seeking 
yet another Gold from this.

Regards,
Dr Craig S wright, GSE etc
