If you think about it, it's not a "here and now" investigation thing, it's
more of a "get you later" thing.

If you get pulled over in your car after a person of similar description is
seen stealing from a store, and your boot is filled with games, then they
have a historical reference pointing towards what you've been up to
recently. Makes for a longer sentence in the end surely.

I don't like the privacy side of it either, especially since you only found
out where it was going after you asked. There will be the usual calls of
"well if you have nothing to hide blah blah"... it's down to who you trust
with your information at the end of the day.
