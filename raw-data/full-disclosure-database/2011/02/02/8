Subject: TROOPERS11

We want to announce TROOPERS11, Europe's premium IT Security event. The 
conference features international top guys/girls, spends a lot of 
attention to ensure the best experience for every participant and saves 
a lot on lame marketing presentations, shabby conference sites and 
overall profit oriented rip-off. You'll like the concept :)
