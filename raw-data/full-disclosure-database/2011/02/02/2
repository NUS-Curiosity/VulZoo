This attack is called XXE (Xml eXternal Entity).

It's depressing because it's been known about since at least 2002 (
http://archive.cert.uni-stuttgart.de/bugtraq/2002/10/msg00421.html), yet it
still keeps rearing its head. There's also the "billion laughs" attack which
is a variant that consumes excessive server-side resource.

There have also been client-side examples of this attack, including in
Safari and (IIRC) Adobe Reader.
