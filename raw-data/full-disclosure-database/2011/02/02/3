Subject: New malware exchange service

Gentlemen,

I'm glad to publicly announce the Binalyze malware samples exchange
project, that until recently was a closed beta program.
Currently, we have more than 14 million of classified malware samples,
for immediate exchange with security vendors.


Services :
Binalyze has built an incredibly robust binaries collection and
analysis set of tools,
enabling organizations of all sizes to leverage the data and threats
to be monitored in orded to build a better defense system.
With customers located in almost every continent, and 12 anonymous
partners, Binalyze's offers the most complete industry leading
technology, service, flexibility and cost effectiveness.

Currently, Binalyze feed is the world's largest malware collection
repository, that was created for the security vendors and the the
hackers community,
in order to give an opportunity of a real testing of security and
anti-virus products, and evaluate their real effectiveness.
Our vast collection of malware samples now indexes more than
13,000,000 samples, and grows rapidly every day with the great help of
our partners.
We use 8 high interaction honeypot sensors, deployed in several
different geographical locations -  in order to collect daily samples,
that are inspected by our "Binalyzer"
emulator for further classification.

We are looking for new partners, that are willing to join the trade
program (equal ratio of upload/download  of new samples).
By our in-house classification mechanism, you will get only the
samples that you are interested in (By family, date of first
appearance, etc.)

Want to become a member?
We will provide an evaluation period of 30 days, which includes an
unlimited access to our samples repository.*

*To prevent leeching, only known security vendors are currently
accepted for the evaluation plan.

Anton Ziukin,
