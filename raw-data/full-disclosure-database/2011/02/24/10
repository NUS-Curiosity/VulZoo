Not that assuming you're popped/gonna get popped and acting accordingly is a horrible idea, but to make sure I'm understanding your debating points correctly; you're arguing that the reason you want complex passwords is to slow the rainbow tab les once an attacker has write access to lsass, read access to shadow, popped the pdc, et cetera?
