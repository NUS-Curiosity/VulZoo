Subject: Vulnerability in Cumulus for Drupal

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Cumulus for
Drupal.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Cumulus 6.x-1.4 and previous versions and 5.x-1.1 and
previous versions.

----------
Details:
----------

This XSS is similar to XSS vulnerability in WP-Cumulus, because it's using
tagcloud.swf made by author of WP-Cumulus. About such vulnerabilities I
wrote in 2009-2011, particularly about millions of flash files tagcloud.swf
which are vulnerable to XSS attacks I mentioned in my article XSS
vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2010-January/006033.html).

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/sites/all/modules/cumulus/cumulus.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS. Also it's possible
to conduct (like in WP-Cumulus) HTML Injection attack.

------------
Timeline:
------------

2011.02.23 - disclosed at my site.
2011.02.24 - informed developers of module and developers of Drupal.

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4954/).

Best wishes & regards,
