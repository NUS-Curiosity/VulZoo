"Doing security" really isn't that hard.  Behind all the fancy appliances 
and gee-whiz technology, the underlying principle is, don't unnecessarily 
expose your assets to attack.

This boils down to a few simple things:
1) Don't allow users to create simple passwords.
2) Don't allow admins to forego routine patching
3) Don't allow poor configuration of applications
4) Don't allow services that aren't vetted and authorized

Those four simple rules will go a long way toward reducing your attack 
surface enough that the "routine" "hackers" will move on to easier targets. 
Depending upon your infrastructure, some of this can be automated, but the 
bottom line for good security is auditing.  Know what your assets are. 
Know what the weaknesses are.  Do everything you can do to avoid 
unnecessary exposure.

You're not going to stop a determined adversary from getting in.  There is 
always a weakness somewhere that can be leveraged to gain further access. 
But if you forgo routine patching, allow lousy passwords, allow poor 
configuration practices and run services that aren't vetted and authorized, 
then, well, you're an HBGary clone..
