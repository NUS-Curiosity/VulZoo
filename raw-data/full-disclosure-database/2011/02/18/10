Its not just Drupal - a number of captcha systems are open to attacks of this form.
For instance hotfile.com is randomly open, allowing downloads of multiple files because
of capcha "cookie replay".

I have seen this - by accident I should point out - on a number of (commercial) sites where
captcha is employed for login or download sanity checks.

The most recent system to be borked during upgrade was http://www.nextgenserver.com/calculator/
