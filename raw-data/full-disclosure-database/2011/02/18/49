Unless you has actually decrypted the file you would not "know" what was in
the file, you would be relying on what the person who gave you the file told
you. I assume this would be some kind of hearsay, although a judge might
consider you an accessory after the fact or a (co-)conspirator which in some
cases might result in a higher sentence than the original crime.
