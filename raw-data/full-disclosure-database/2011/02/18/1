This video shows how to exploit Android using Insect Pro 2.0 gaining root
privileges using adb setuid exhaustion attack.

"Typically has the name “rageagainstthecage” and the code refers to it has
“CVE-2010-EASY” in one comment, but whatever you call it, it’s a pretty
smooth way of getting adbd (android’s debugging bridge daemon) to run as
root". We just make it easy for you :-)
