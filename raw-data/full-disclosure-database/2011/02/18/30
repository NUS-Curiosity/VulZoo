I agree Valdis, and I personally used shatter when it was popularized..
resulting in tons of fun here at the university with my colleagues.

However, I'm simply stating a belief in a more abstract sense,
I agree beliefs are not always realistic, but personally I /do/ make
that guarantee whenever I write a piece of code.

I am very aware I must compromise this belief when working in the market,
like most of my other beliefs and morals, and I do so daily.

Then I go home and cry myself to sleep.

Charles
