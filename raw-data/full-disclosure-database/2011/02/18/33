Attempt A:
Cal, I'm not sure on this point off-the-cuff, however encrypted files should* be
indistinguishable from random data, so assuming that even if a given LEE
has obtained the key and knows that your distributed data is "illegal", you
could be held blameless as you have no feasible way to know what the data was.

Attempt 2:
You could also consider a key and an algorithm a "transform" for a set of random
bits, such that once the transform is applied to those bits it would
result in something
"bad", so you aren't actually distributing "encrypted" "files" at all..

just random bits :D

*DISCLAIMER: The above will PROBABLY NOT hold in court, so apologies
if you get jailed for life
