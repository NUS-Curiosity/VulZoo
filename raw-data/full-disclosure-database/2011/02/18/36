I'm wondering along the same lines as Thor, based on intent. One of those
"don't take the piss or the judge is gonna own you" scenarios that would be
tested in court on a per trial basis. Like, if the files were known to
contain encrypted info, and if it was proved that you knew the contents of
those files, then you would be held liable.

@Charles: luckily for me, this is all academic as I've kept as far away as
possible from this hbgary thing :P
