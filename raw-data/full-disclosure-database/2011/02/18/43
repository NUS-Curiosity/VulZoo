It's a semi-alternative.  Both address the "make it difficult to trace"
issue in somewhat similar ways.  Tor is probably more famous for its
"provide an anonymous proxy" function, but also supports "hidden" storage.
The biggest difference is that in the Tor case, the person running the
storage knows where the files are and what they are - it's just difficult
for anybody else to find out where it really is.  Freenet is more oriented
towards totally obfuscated storage, where *nobody* knows what a given file
is, or where it is actually stored, until you actually fetch it (and even
then, you don't know where the data came from).
