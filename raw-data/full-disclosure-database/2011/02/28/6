III. INTRODUCTION

BackWPup version 1.4.0 (and may be the previous ones too) has an unfiltered

two php pages that let a remote user to access sensitive files like /etc/passwd.
No authentication required. No plugin activation required.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Input passed via the "wpabs" parameter to the php pages
- wp-content/plugins/backwpup/app/options-view_log-iframe.php
- wp-content/plugins/backwpup/app/options-runnow-iframe.php
is not sanitized before being used.

Both files starts trying to include the wp-load.php file using the wpabs 
parameter that can
be inject with a direct call to the page.

options-view_log-iframe.php:
<?PHP
if (file_exists($_GET['wpabs'].'wp-load.php') and file_exists($_GET['logfile'])) 
{
 require_once($_GET['wpabs'].'wp-load.php'); /** Setup WordPress environment */
...
options-runnow-iframe.php:
if (file_exists($_GET['wpabs'].'wp-load.php') and 
is_numeric(trim($_GET['jobid']))) {
 require_once($_GET['wpabs'].'wp-load.php'); /** Setup WordPress environment */

any $_GET['wpabs'] in a trim call like this:
if (file_exists(trim($_GET['wpabs']).'wp-load.php') and 
file_exists($_GET['logfile'])) {
