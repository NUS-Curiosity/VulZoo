ZDI-11-094: (0 day) Hewlett-Packard StorageWorks File Migration Agent Remote Archive Tampering Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-094

February 28, 2011

-- CVSS:
7.5, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

-- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

-- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard StorageWorks

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 10854.

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to compromise the archive
records on vulnerable installations of HP StorageWorks File Migration
Agent. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the HsmCfgSvc.exe service responsible
for managing archive stores. The archive manager is susceptible to
tampering due to a failure to enforce authentication from remote users.
An attacker could exploit this flaw to compromise the server managing
the archives and arbitrarily modify the archive data store under the
context of the File Migration Agent software.

-- Vendor Response:
February 23, 2011 - This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a 
patch in accordance with the ZDI 180 day deadline.

--Mitigations:
The overall design of the File Migration Agent (FMA) assumes it runs as
an application on a Windows server. Given the stated purpose of FMA, and
the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is
to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the
clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with
the HP StorageWorks File Migration Agent should be permitted to
communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways,
most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are
available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx
and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
