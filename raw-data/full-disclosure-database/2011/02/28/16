Subject: III World War. - Broadcast Request.

Hello,

To Whom it may concern.


I believe that the IIIWorld War conflict might start in 10 months or 
more from now. The question is: who's unified and who's willing to 
participate.
Leadership is not yet defnied. It may be as well someone well known in 
IT industry or someone completely unknown.

Where we could meet if such situation happens ?


It might not happen any time soon so it may sound like hoax but just in 
case, any ideas ?

Security guys must have a plan. Even if it sounds pathetic as for now.
So?
