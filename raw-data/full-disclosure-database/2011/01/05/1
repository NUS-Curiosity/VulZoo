Subject: Camp Terror: Andrew Auernheimer’s Desert Klan Meetings

"Go to their business partners, friends and family and tell them outright lies (they said I “ran klan meetings in the desert” and “manufactured grenades”, no joke). Due to crown immunity, you can never sue the FBI for libel, no matter what they say!" - Andrew Auernheimer
