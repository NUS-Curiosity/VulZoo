Synopsis
========

gif2png contains a stack overflow vulnerability when parsing command
line arguments.

Background
==========

gif2png is a command line program that converts image files from the
Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format to the Portable Network
Graphics (PNG) format.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/gif2png     < 2.5.1-r1                      >= 2.5.1-r1

Description
===========

gif2png contains a command line parsing vulnerability that may result
in a stack overflow due to an unexpectedly long input filename.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.
Note that applications relying on gif2png to process images can also
trigger the vulnerability.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gif2png users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/gif2png-2.5.1-r1"

==========
