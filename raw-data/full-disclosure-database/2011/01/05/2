(a) I think on the side of the puddle that the FBI matters, we don't recognize
a Crown Anything. It's called sovereign immunity over here.

(b) You can in fact sue it for libel, or any other other tortable cause, if it
consents to be sued or waives its immunity.  In fact, the US Government has
mostly waived via statute much of its immunity:
