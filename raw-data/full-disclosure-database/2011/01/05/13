Subject: CarolinaCon-VII/2011 - Call for Papers/Presenters

InfoSec professionals, h4x0rs, international spies, script kidz, and 
posers,

CarolinaCon is accepting speaker/paper/demo submissions for its 7th annual 
Hacking/InfoSec conference.  This year's event will be held on the final 
weekend of April 2011 (Apr 29th thru May 1st) in Raleigh NC.


Who will be presenting which topics this year?

That's where YOU possibly come in.  If you are somewhat knowledgeable in 
some interesting field of hacking, technology, robotics, science, global 
thermonuclear war, etc., and are interested in speaking/presenting at 
CarolinaCon, we invite you to submit your proposal (in brief) for our 
review.  If you are interested in presenting please send;

- your name or handle
- presentation name/title
- brief topic abstract
- estimated time-length of presentation

....via e-mail to:
speakers <at> carolinacon.org

*NOTE: All submissions are due BY March 1st, 2011.  However we may be 
making some early selections this year from amongst the submissions, so 
please be timely in submission if you're committed to being part of the 
elite cadre of chosen presenters.  We value diversity, so please don't 
hesitate to propose your ideas no matter how outlandish.

If you speak at the Con, you will receive;

- free Con admission for you and one guest
- one free CarolinaCon-7 t-shirt
- minimal fame, glory, and possibly even notoriety
- mad props and much love from our staff and attendees
- something else that's l33t but has yet to be finalized by the Con staff


SPONSORS:
We don't accept any, so don't bother asking.  Capitalism and philanthropic 
knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion.  We keep our admission price 
to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses.  All of our 
staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy.  All of 
our presenters generously donate their time, talent, knowledge, and 
experience - and for that we and all of our attendees can't thank them 
enough.


ATTENDEES:
If you are interested in attending, watch this space for more details:

...and don't forget to mark the dates on your calendar.  We look forward 
to seeing you at our 2011 chill event.


Peace,
Vic
