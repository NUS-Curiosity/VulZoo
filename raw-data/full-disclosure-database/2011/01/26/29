Steve, Insect Pro 2.0 is redistributable and I even talked with Microsoft (
they called me ) about that and there are no issues when it comes to
copyrights.

Ruby, Python, Metasploit and Our exploits are redistributables.

Again, thanks for your time and interest!

If you have any further question please let me know about it by email
info@...ecurityresearch.com !
