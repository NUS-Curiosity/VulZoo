-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Zenworks Handheld Management.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the Access Point process (ZfHIPCnd.exe)
which listens by default on TCP port 2400. The problem occurs due to the
application copying arbitrary sized data from a packet into a statically
sized buffer. Due to the application not accommodating for the variable
sized data during initialization of this buffer a buffer overflow will
occur. This can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.
