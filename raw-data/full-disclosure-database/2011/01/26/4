I repeat: If I'm just paying for download access, can I pay $20,
download it, then host if for others to download for free.  If not, it's
paying for licensing, not download bandwidth.  Also, I repeat, YOUR OWN
SITE says you are paying for a license, not download access.

Quote from the page we both linked to:

Put up or shut up time: I will pay to host the download on my own server
for the next 6 months if the product license allows it(and it legal for
me to do so as not infringing copyright, etc), or you need to stop
claiming it is free.

So, can I redistribute it for free, or are you a liar?
