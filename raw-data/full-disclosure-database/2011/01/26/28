For clarity, the $20 was for a unmetered, 100Mb/s VPS so I could make
good on my part of the deal if you weren't lying about it being free.

I haven't given you any money, and don't plan on it because your claims
about it being freely redistributable are now proven false.

Here's a reminder of our email exchanges:

My simple request is that you state that your software is free to
redistribute, and make a testable assertion that it does not infringe
other's copyright.

I think I've made my case.  If you change your mind, the offer still
stands, and the server is all set up to host the file as soon as it is
made available to me with appropriate legal disclaimers.  Otherwise I
think we are done here.
