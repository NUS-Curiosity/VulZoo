That's not what your website claims.

You are selling a license, not server access.

If what you said is true, I should be able to download Insect PRO 2.0
and provide it for free to others online.  Can I put it on BitTorrent or
on my website? If not, you are full of it.

You want to try to sell a tool where most of the value seems to come
from free tools which already have better GUIs? Fine. But drop the crap
about it being free.
