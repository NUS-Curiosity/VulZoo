Hi Pavel,

The panel has determined this doesn't qualify for a reward for 2 reasons:

1) A very close variant was publicly disclosed on 21 Jan:
http://www.wooyun.org/bugs/wooyun-2010-01199
2) Technically, it's not a bug in Google, it's really a big in IE.

Cheers,
xxx, Google Security Team

and Today we test the vul again ,it has been fixed .[2011/01/26]

Thus, we understand the unspoken rules of this, This is a football
game, the vulnerability is the ball , MS and GG are the players
