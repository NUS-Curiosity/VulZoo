-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the ovas.exe component which listens by default

POST variables the process blindly copies user supplied data into a
fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the OVAS
service.
