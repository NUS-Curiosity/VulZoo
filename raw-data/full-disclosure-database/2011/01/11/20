-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Network Node Manager. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the nnmRptConfig.exe module exposed by
the webserver that listens by default on TCP port 80. A remote user can
send an oversized schdParams or nameParams parameter via a POST request
to one of the CGI functions of NNM to trigger a buffer overflow in this
module. Exploitation of this issue leads to remote code execution under
the context of the target service.
