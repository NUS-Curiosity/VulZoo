I agree with you but in my opinion ubuntu tracking team has here nothing
to do. Main problem exists in the GNU libc code so this team should fix
the problem. Just compare the regcomp(3)/BSD and regcomp (3)/linux. In
my opinion the GNU libc implementation is the worst in terms of safety.
Probably vulnerability in glob(3) (CVE-2010-2632) can be used to
resource exhasusion in GNU inetutils ftp server.
