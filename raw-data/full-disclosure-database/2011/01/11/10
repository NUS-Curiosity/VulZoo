Yeah, sounds good in theory.  What about when vulnerabilities (and
presumably patches) come out for your "sandbox" or other security
software?  

IMO, adding more software to a system rarely results in overall
management gains.  This is because most software, including security
software, sucks.  If you find yourself patching too often, or you
can't trust that the patches won't break your environment, then you
probably need to find a software vendor that invests more in QA.
