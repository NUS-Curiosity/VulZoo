Subject: Getting Off the Patch

Hi,

Here's a new article on how and why you may want to stop patching your 
software and take a new approach to your security.

"So if patching is a tactic towards a particular security strategy, 
how can that be bad? I never said it was all bad. There are reasons 
where patching makes sense just like there are reasons to get a kick 
from a cup of coffee, get kicked by a shot of tequila, or spray stuff 
up your nose to breathe easier for 1.5 seconds. Yes, for the record, I 
am comparing patching to nasal spray."

-pete.
