-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
The exploit would require a crafted HTTP request to the target host.

The specific flaw exists within jovgraph.exe, a Java-based grapher that
extends the SNMP Data Presenter to include xnmgraph-like applications
created by the application builder. The vulnerability occurs within
jovgraph when processing malformed displayWidth option passed from the
arg parameter to the CGI program. A remote unauthenticated attacker can
send a crafted HTTP request to the target host to exploit this
vulnerability. Successful attack could allow for arbitrary code being
injected and executed with the privileges of the affected process,
normally Internet Guest Account on Windows platforms.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
