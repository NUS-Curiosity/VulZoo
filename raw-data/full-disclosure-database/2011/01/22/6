Why would you want to argue for those data points in the first place?  After the breach, TJXs stock immediately dumped 14% to its lowest value of the entire year.  It took ~6 months for it to stabilize around pre-breach trading.   I'm not sure what actually qualifies for a "Nuff said" closer here, but I think stock quotes are a pretty good candidate over position cycling.  

But to be specific, that isn't what Sweeny said anyway.  He said hacking effect on "brand identity" not "value."   That said, if he considers a 6 month stock recovery from a 14% drop a "little dip" then I'm envious of his portfolio (and is actually a point worth making to establish his reference).  How Shostack took that to mean that breaches don't have business consequences and that a Day of Reckoning is coming for those who say it does is something I just can't see, but I think it is safe to assume that his opinion is not based on owning TJX stock.
