Last I checked, TJX and Heartland were both still in business, and I don't
think any of their security teams ended up in jail or severely unemployed(*).
It's really hard to argue against those two data points.

'Nuff said.

(*) If in fact major numbers of people got canned, I missed it. References to any
"The security chief committed hari-kiri and 23 others were shown the door" news
articles are welcome.
