Subject: [OVSA20110118] OpenVAS Manager Vulnerable To
	Command Injection

Summary

It has been identified that OpenVAS Manager is vulnerable to command injection 
due to insufficient validation of user supplied data when processing OMP 
requests. It has been identified that this vulnerability allows privilege 
escalation within the OpenVAS Manager but more complex injection may allow 
arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the OpenVAS Manager on 
vulnerable systems. CVE-2011-0018 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

The vulnerable code path is only accessible to authenticated users of OpenVAS 
Manager however it may also be triggered either directly or by using a cross-
site request forgery based attack via the Greenbone Security Assistant web 
application.

Current Status

As of the 20th January 2011, the state of the vulnerabilities is believed to 
be as follows. A patch has been supplied by Greenbone Networks which it 
successfully resolves this vulnerability. New releases of both 1.0.x and 2.0.x 
have also been created which incorporate this patch. Note that the cross-site 
address forgery elements of this vulnerability have not yet been addressed in 
the Greenbone Security Assistant web application.

Thanks

OpenVAS would like to thank Ronald Kingma and Alexander van Eee of ISSX for 
their help in reporting the vulnerability.
