Subject: /etc/passwd corruption

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello List,

On ubuntu lucid, I found a way to add corrupted entries to /etc/passwd
e.g. "AAA\n", but not to /etc/shadow. Does someone know a way to use
that for privilege escalation? What is the "+" line handling in
/etc/passwd for?
