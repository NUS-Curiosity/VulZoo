Just setup a temporary account with no password so shadow won't get referenced, save yourself effort

Please see "man 5 passwd", I suspect you'll be able to leverage this to 
create a system account in /etc/passwd.  The file will likely need to contain 
a crypt()'d password.  Not exactly sure how PAM will handle.

The Ubuntu gents are normally really good about fixing security issues so
you'll likely want to get in touch with them so they can fix it up.

Cheers,
John
