 Violent Ideations of Law Enforcement

Laurelai,

If my goal were attention, there are far better ways of getting it.
Promiscuous homosexuality, for example, can generate a whole lot of
attention. Just ask Dave Aitel, the author of CANVAS and current CEO
of Immunitysec:

Dave Aitel's highly promiscuous anus has seen the arrival of more
dicks than your wifi card has seen frames not addressed to its MAC
address. He has spun it into loads of positive attention and financial
success. Surely, if I were to aim for attention, I would have become a
big fucking faggot just like aiteld. I assure you I have differing
motivations.

Trolling is an act of great intellectual lineage. Giordano Bruno was
disemboweled and burned at the stake because he had the courage to say
that our Sun was one of an infinite number of nearly identical burning
balls of fire in the sky. Zeno of Elea trolled so hard he was
universally declared a sophist, but hundreds of years later spurred
the creation of calculus. Jesus Christ saved us from Pharisitic
tyranny largely by simply teaching people to not take the authority of
the unjust seriously, and was put to the cross for it. Martin Luther
saved Europe from utter destruction largely by advocating seizing and
destroying the assets of the people who were the source of the rot:
http://www.humanitas-international.org/showcase/chronography/documents/luther-jews.htm
and today the Lutheran Church is one of the most successful and
steadfast in the world.

The active conflict of trolling is not a method for attention-getting,
but that of advancing public dialogue into taboo areas. This is
largely healthy for a society, particularly a formerly open one like
the United States whose speech-related liberties are being eroded by
terrorist "watch lists", unwarranted surveillance and trial-less
executive assassination orders a la Anwar al-Awaki. One day you will
have the age and wisdom to realize that standing up and speaking out
against those who would harm our glorious common law heritage is a
brave and noble thing to do. I have chosen the right means to fight,
and like most who employ my methods I will be crucified for it. I knew
that going in, hence my history of Christianity-related rhetoric.

Let me make something clear: when I say a sane society would shoot
feds who engage in COINTELPRO style operations in the street, I
absolutely meant it. In time, after the collapse of the dollar, there
will be a parallel system of courts set up so we can best catalog
these traitors and punish them for their crimes. It hasn't even been
two decades since FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi shot Vicki Weaver in the
back without cause as she held her infant Elisheba in her arms. There
will be no justice in the world until those in federal law enforcement
who have murdered or otherwise attacked innocent citizens of the
United States are brought to justice for their crimes. In the end, the
best justice will give them the same treatment they have given others:
they will be randomly slaughtered in their homes by gunfire, or their
homes will be burnt down with them inside. However, unlike the FBI a
new post-revolution system of justice will leave innocent family
members alone.

I myself have been wronged. In 2009, an FBI agent decided he didn't
like me, so he called in a bomb threat to a synagogue. After the FBI
threatened this innocent and undeserving place of worship with
violence, they decided to run around town telling everyone I did it.
This should alarm you. The federal government, through its crown
immunity, can go door to door saying you are a pederast who raped a 4
year old girl and there is nothing you can do about it. They did it
specifically to try to have a chilling effect on speech-- the
resulting articles in Jewish literature stated that my publications on
the Internet were taken down hoping I'd follow suit. Nothing could be
further from the case. I am not one to be bullied and I resolved to
speak louder than ever. This was a calculated and cunning act of
treason, a government-funded attack to try to shut me up. If there
were a prosecutor in the world with integrity, there would have been
an investigation and charges into these men.

I am heartened by those who oppose me in both the government and the
media. The fact that there is so much strong opposition to what I do
proves that they are really afraid of free speech and terrified of
being exposed as sinful traitors to our great nation and its
Constitution. When the cards are finally laid out on the table, I want
it clear what side I picked, what I fought for, and how I was punished
for it. All pigs must die. Death to feds. Dongs are -fucking
hilarious-.
