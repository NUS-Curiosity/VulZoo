-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-110

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Symantec

-- Affected Products:
Symantec Alert Management System

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec Alert Management System.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the AMSLIB.dll module while processing
data sent from the msgsys.exe process which listens by default on TCP
port 38292. The DLL allocates a fixed length stack buffer and
subsequently copies a user-supplied string using memcpy without
validating the size. By supplying a large enough value this buffer can
be overflowed leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of
the vulnerable daemon.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
