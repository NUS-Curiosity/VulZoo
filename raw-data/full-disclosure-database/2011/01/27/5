Phrack and the blackhats.
You are an army I am one.
The only lasting.

I am your conscience.

I am always behind you,
every day from morning to late,
I am near you
no matter
where you go
I'm the bad feeling
that you get the one or the other day.
And you without difficulty
Simply push aside

On your last day I'll get you, -
i'll Take you tight in my grip -
Then you're not getting past me -
I'll show you your true self -
The thousand lies from you
i'll put you down to account -
All the tricks and gimmicks -
I am your conscience
I will not let you alone more

I am the tick
sitting in your neck -

i will not leave you
whether you like it or not -
Your sleep is still deep and strong -
Because you think
you come out without me -
But believe me
even you wake up at some point

On your last day I'll get you, -
i'll Take you tight in my grip -
Then you're not getting past me -
I'll show you your true self -
The thousand lies from you
i'll put you down to account -
All the tricks and gimmicks -
I am your conscience
I will not let you alone more
