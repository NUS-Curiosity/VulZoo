Subject: Free Download of Insect Pro 2.0 (Was: Re: [VIDEO]
 Keylogger, RecordMic and Shell)

I've received indications that Insect Pro 2.0 is free to redistribute
and contains no copyright infringement, and as such am making it
available from the following site:

http://insectpro.highprofilesite.com/

The only assertions for legality and usefulness come from the author,
juansacco@...il.com.  I am not affiliated in any way except agreeing to
host the software for free for others to try out.

The software is Windows only. I haven't even installed it yet, so can't
make any claims. ;-)

If anyone finds anything illegal or undesirable in the download, please
don't hesitate to report it.

Thanks,
Steve
