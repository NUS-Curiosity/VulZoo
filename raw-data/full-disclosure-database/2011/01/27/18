Knowing one of the people listed in the shout-outs, I told them about the
props and they got back with the following statement:
"After doing some digging, [I] found out that they did it to their own
website to generate publicity.  The person responsible told me he didn't
think anything would happen from it so he used my old nick.  He apologized
to me and said he'll not do something like that in the future. "
