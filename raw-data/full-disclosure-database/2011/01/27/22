-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec Alert Management System.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the HDNLRSVC.EXE service while
processing data sent from the msgsys.exe process which listens by
default on TCP port 38292. This process passes user-supplied data
directly to a CreateProcessA call. By supplying a UNC path to a
controlled binary a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code under the
context of the vulnerable daemon.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
