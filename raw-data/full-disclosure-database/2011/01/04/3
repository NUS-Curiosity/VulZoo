Subject: [ACM,
	Ariadne Content Manager] unauth. SQL injection + user enumeration

Hi sec-folks,

I recently discuss with Ariadne team to public disclose two new
different vulnerabilities found in Ariadne Content Manager (ACM).

As the name says, ACM is an enterprise solution for content management
mainly used by big private and public companies and institutions.

This is the site of the product: http://www.ariadnecontentmanager.com


ยง The most critical vulnerability is an "unauthenticated SQL injection",
which can be exploited by unauthenticated users injecting malicious code
into the "idPhoto" parameter to the preview photo page of the product.


ยง The next one, that is a classic user enumeration, can be performed
trying to login to the main interface and exploiting the verbose
messages received.
Different messages will be displayed back after the login process,
depending of what username was used (existing or not existing).


Affected version: v4.4 and priors.

Solution: upgrade ACM to the v4.5, now available.


Best whises for a happy and secure new year ;)
