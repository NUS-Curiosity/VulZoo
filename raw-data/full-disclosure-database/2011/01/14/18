Which is all the more reason to implement an array of controls 
(defense in width) for the interactive points rather than rely on 
patches to fix ONLY the problems you know about.

And you would be wrong because patching means changing the code. You 
know what you have and the operations are as you want them. Then you 
want to change the code to deal with some problem which requires you 
to verify your operations again to assure it is what you want. Perhaps 
you don't implement change control. Perhaps you don't do functional 
testing of operations after patching. Perhaps you choose to trust the 
same people who made the flaw in the first place. Perhaps you don't 
know your operational baseline. Perhaps you have lots of time to 
spare. All reasons why you may want to patch AND use controls. But you 
would be remiss to think that patching means only fixing a problem and 
changes nothing else.

Which is good if the world was made of only skiddies and all the bad 
things that can happen are in the hands of the lowest common 
denominator. But operational controls will keep out the skiddies and 
all the rest of the undesirables.

Or else, do what is realistic- control that which you have less than 
nominal reason to trust. If you can't control it, get rid of it. 
Patching it constantly will only constantly change your operations 
which, should be as stable as possible. The less stable it is, the 
less you can tell when something is wrong.

And I'm saying that's the wrong way to think about this because 
patches don't just fix the flaw. They change things. There is nothing 
wrong with a flaw in your software if it can be mitigated in other 
ways efficiently because your software is FULL of flaws that you don't 
know about anyways. So you can mitigate a large number of them or even 
all of them before they become zero days. So don't waste your time on 
the patching and the updating because a patch isn't always "just a patch".
