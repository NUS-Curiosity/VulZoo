And declines to fund it.  Just had that happen here.  All sorts of 
excitement about the new research-servers-only datacenter - until they 
found out what it costs in floor space, hvac, power, backup capacity, etc., 
etc.  All of sudden the excitement dissipated.

Just adding another 400 Amp service gives them palpitations.  I swear they 
think these things grow on trees and cost nothing to operate.
