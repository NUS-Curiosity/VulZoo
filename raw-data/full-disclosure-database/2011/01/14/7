[1] Description

A large amount of vulnerabilities have been found in just
about every site and service that gatech.edu has online.
The ones listed here in this document are just a small
amount of the real deal, and these are only SQL injections,
which seems to be their biggest issue. And with a simple 
Google dork, a lot of more vulnerabilites can be found
under this domain.

Since one of their issues lies in /news/event.php, a 
simple Google search of that, within the domain will show
a lot of their affected sites.

https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=allinurl:
+/news/event.php%3Fid%3D+site:gatech.edu&hl=en

The people responsible for these services have been notified.

A very limited amount of sensitive information will be
disclosed in this document (apart from the vulnerabilities).
