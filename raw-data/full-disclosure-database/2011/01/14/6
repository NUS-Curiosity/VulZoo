                                RAID 2011

  14th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection

                          September 20-21, 2011

                    SRI International, Menlo Park, CA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This symposium, the 14th in an annual series, brings together leading
researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to
discuss issues and technologies related to intrusion detection and
defense. The Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID) International
Symposium series furthers advances in intrusion defense by promoting the
exchange of ideas in a broad range of topics. As in previous years, all
topics related to intrusion detection, prevention and defense systems and
technologies are within scope, including but not limited to the
following:


    * Network and host intrusion detection and prevention
    * Anomaly and specification-based approaches
    * IDS cooperation and event correlation
    * Malware prevention, detection, analysis, containment
    * Web application security
    * Insider attack detection
    * Intrusion response, tolerance, and self-protection
    * Operational experiences with current approaches
    * Intrusion detection assessment and benchmarking
    * Attacks against intrusion detection systems
    * Formal models, analysis, and standards
    * Deception systems and honeypots
    * Vulnerability analysis and forensics
    * Adversarial machine learning for security
    * Visualization techniques
    * High-performance intrusion detection
    * Legal, social, and privacy issues
    * Network exfiltration detection
    * Botnet analysis, detection, and mitigation
    * Cyber-physical systems

Types of Submissions
--------------------

    * Full papers presenting mature research results or convincing case
      studies of protecting large operational networks. Papers accepted
      by the Program Committee will be presented at RAID 2011 and
      included in the Symposium’s proceedings published by Springer in
      its Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Papers must include
      an abstract and a list of keywords, and must not exceed 20 pages in
      total length, formatted in LNCS-style and including the
      bibliography and any appendices.

    * Posters describing a work in progress or an innovative idea not yet
      sufficiently mature for a full paper. Posters are submitted for
      review in the form of an extended abstract that must likewise be
      formatted in LNCS-style and not exceed 2 pages in length. Accepted
      posters will be presented at RAID 2011 in a separate session, and
      the submitted abstracts will be published on the Symposium’s web
      site.

    All submissions (papers and poster abstracts) must be formatted
    according to the instructions provided by Springer
    (http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html) and then submitted
    electronically; details will be provided on the conference web site.
    Papers must list all authors and their affiliations; RAID does not
    require anonymized submissions.  For accepted papers, at least one of
    the authors must attend the conference to present the paper. Further
    questions on the submission process may be sent to the program
    chairs. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that has
    already been published elsewhere or is submitted in parallel to a
    journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings.
    Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues,
    submission of previously published work, and plagiarism constitute
    dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific and technical
    conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the
    recommendation of the program chair, take action against authors who
    have committed them.


Student Scholarships
--------------------

    RAID 2011 will offer student scholarships to reduce symposium
    attendance costs. Students should visit the web site
    (http://raid2011.org) to learn about availability of scholarships and
    application deadlines.
