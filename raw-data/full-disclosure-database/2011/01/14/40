I'm particularly interested in the cost points and identification of the exponential cost of security from patching and the money saved by not patching in your environment.

Maybe you misunderstood this? If you need empirical evidence that 
patches change code then please do a diff yourself between two apps, 
one patched and one not. Here I was writing of the cost of functional 
testing and remediation of the operational security which scales 
exponentially as the operations scale. One doesn't need a server farm 
to prove as more servers are introduced into an operation that the 
number of connections between them grows. 2 servers each with 1 
connection has 2. Add 2 more servers and now you have 4 servers but 8 
connections to verify. And it goes on like that. If you don't do any 
testing and don't care then you don't have that work or money to lose 
with patching. But I said that already.
