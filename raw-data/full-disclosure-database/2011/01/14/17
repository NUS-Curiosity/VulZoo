I'm sure it will all be cleared up when we see the reporting...

Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Getting Off the Patch

Thought I should point out that they seem to have forgotten the main function in mass/distributed computer control and management.
What otherwise would be a "huge" waste, it's done in little time and tested reliable in as much little time. According to the reliability of the patch, one would also assume that worst case scenarios involve *just* rolling back changes, again, not really loosing anything at all.

Please share the research you have that backs up this statement.  I would be very interested in knowing the details that that provide the foundation for this argument.  I'm particularly interested in the cost points and identification of the exponential cost of security from patching and the money saved by not patching in your environment.

I presume that you have empirical evidence of the vast savings based on concurrent operational models in an enterprise environment, so I'm curious as to how many thousands of servers you are operationally responsible for, because that information is not only critical, but required for this model to be considered.  IOW, if you could share the analysis you presented to management that they bought off on, that would extremely helpful.

Thanks!
