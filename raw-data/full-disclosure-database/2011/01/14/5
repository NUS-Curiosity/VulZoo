Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


CVE-2010-3677

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) via a join query that uses a
  table with a unique SET column.


CVE-2010-3680

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by creating temporary tables
  while using InnoDB, which triggers an assertion failure.


CVE-2010-3681

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by using the HANDLER interface
  and performing "alternate reads from two indexes on a table," which
  triggers an assertion failure.


CVE-2010-3682

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled use of EXPLAIN with
  certain queries.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


CVE-2010-3833

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled propagation during
  evaluation of arguments to extreme-value functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


CVE-2010-3834

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled materializing a derived
  table that required a temporary table for grouping.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


CVE-2010-3835

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain user-variable
  assignment expressions that are evaluated in a logical expression context.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


CVE-2010-3836

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled pre-evaluation of LIKE
  predicates during view preparation.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


CVE-2010-3837

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled using GROUP_CONCAT()
  and WITH ROLLUP together.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


CVE-2010-3838

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain queries using a
  mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments to the GREATEST() or
  LEAST() functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


CVE-2010-3840

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled improper WKB data
  passed to the PolyFromWKB() function.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.51a-24+lenny5

The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5.0 anymore.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.
