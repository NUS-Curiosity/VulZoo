Well you're right about that all along the row .. I have all the certs
and I'm not impressed with most of them, but if you want to get in the
door, you better have the certs .. anyone who can memorize two or three
books can get his CISSP or most other certs .. with a very few
exceptions .. certs are about memorizing books ... the only two I can
say are different are CCIE and RHCE .. both of those are hands on certs ..
