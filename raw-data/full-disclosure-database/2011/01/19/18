uptime, above security.

I can't speak for others but I hope my data is not housed at such a
shop. If my data went out the e-door of such a shop, and the shop was
not patching, then I would consider the shop's practices grossly
negligent. It would be irrelevant to me who claimed it was OK for
whatever reason.
