Nice tool.


If you think  useful I have added a build system
for this utility (with GNU autotools) and a toy man page.

If you're interested i have put all on github
even with the auto-generated tarball make distcheck. Perhaps some small
detail still needs to be fixed. Free of contact me if you're interested in
this.
