Here's another factor to consider: with $VENDOR's kit you can't
get support unless all the released patches are in place.
$VENDOR doesn't field the resources to support n differently
patched systems in the field; they're already coping with n
different *configurations* of their product. At our shop some
vendors are more critical re support than others so there's not
a blanket policy. Management would not be amused if $SYSTEM was
down but wasn't in a $VENDOR-supported state. This isn't
theoretical - it happened, it was ugly, it came with extended
downtime. 

TLDR: site patching policy is not always homogenous.
