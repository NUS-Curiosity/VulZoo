Package        : pimd
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary files
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0007

Vincent Bernat discovered that pimd, a multicast routing daemon, creates
files with predictable names upon the receipt of particular signals.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-alpha29.17-8.1lenny1.

The testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid)
will receive updates shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your pimd packages.
