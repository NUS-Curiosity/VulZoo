My mistake then - I shouldn't have inferred your position from previous thread subject matter.

This is precisely what I asked for several times and never received.  When the idea was presented, it indicated a serious deficiency of any depth of knowledge just around security and engineering, not to mention the requirements for dev, legal and compliance.  Being the kind-hearted and generous type of person I am, I assumed that I was missing something, and that there would be an opportunity to review some sort of qualifying data.  There isn't any, so I reverted back to my original position. 

I don't always agree with your viewpoints, but I know that there is always merit to your position that I should take into account.  Not that you care or need my approval or agreement, but thanks for the clarification.
