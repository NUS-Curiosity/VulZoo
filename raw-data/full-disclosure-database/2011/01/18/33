No, I'm taking the position that "most people" are in fact solely relying on
patching because they are clueless and they wouldn't even be patching at
all if auto-update wasn't turned on. (And Cal caught on what I meant in his
reply - that there's two very disjoint communities).

And that changes the calculus of "best practices" - what's "best" at a shop
that has thousands of managed nodes and a staff of dozens of experienced
sysadmins is different from a shop that has dozens of machines and one
semi-clued guy with a McSE. (We'll leave home machines out of the
equation for now - it's safe to assume that *those* machines the operating
system has to take steps to protect itself, including auto-patching, because the
user won't do it).

Yes, it's almost mandatory for large shops in billion-a-year revenues to have
separate devel, testing, pre-prod, and prod systems, and extensive controls and
testing procedures. They usually can afford a few extra servers and one or two
more live bodies to do the work. But in a smaller shop, the added cost of 4x
the servers and added pressure on a single sysadmin's time can be a real
show-stopper. Hiring a second guy will mean *literally* doubling the total IT
budget - and if you're a small business with only 15 or 25 employees *total*,
this can be a showstopper issue.  In those shops, you'll *never* get a 'best
practice' deployed, no matter how 'best' it is, unless it's at least both
cost-neutral and time-neutral.  Even at large shops, trying to deploy a better
practice can be difficult - if the current security is seen as "good enough",
trying to sell something that's only a 10% or 15% incremental benefit can be
difficult unless you can make the business case for it.

And that's something I've noticed is lacking from much of the discussion - the
business case for deploying something.  Sure, something might well be more
secure, but unless the added security is worth more than the added cost, time,
and effort, it's actually a bad idea to deploy.
