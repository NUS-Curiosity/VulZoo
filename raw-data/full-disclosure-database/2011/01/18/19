         CVE Name       

   Description When forming an outgoing SIP request while in pedantic mode, a 
               stack buffer can be made to overflow if supplied with          
               carefully crafted caller ID information. This vulnerability    
               also affects the URIENCODE dialplan function and in some       
               versions of asterisk, the AGI dialplan application as well.    
               The ast_uri_encode function does not properly respect the size 
               of its output buffer and can write past the end of it when     
               encoding URIs.                                                 

   Resolution The size of the output buffer passed to the ast_uri_encode      
              function is now properly respected.                             
                                                                              
              In asterisk versions not containing the fix for this issue,     
              limiting strings originating from remote sources that will be   
              URI encoded to a length of 40 characters will protect against   
              this vulnerability.                                             
                                                                              
              exten => s,1,Set(CALLERID(num)=${CALLERID(num):0:40})           
              exten => s,n,Set(CALLERID(name)=${CALLERID(name):0:40})         
              exten => s,n,Dial(SIP/channel)                                  
                                                                              
              The CALLERID(num) and CALLERID(name) channel values, and any    
              strings passed to the URIENCODE dialplan function should be     
              limited in this manner.
