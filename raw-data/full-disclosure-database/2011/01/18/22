Subject: [VIDEO] IE CVE-2010-3962

A serious security vulnerability affects Internet Explorer on
versions 6, 7 and 8, which allows a remote attacker
execute arbitrary code via a CSS stylesheet in
"Invalid reference flag" this exploit is marked as corruption of
type memory and remote client side.

The exploit was publicly released in November but as of today (
January 2011) is still not a patch serious personal recommendation is
use another browser.

We record a video where you can see a practical example which exploits
the version 8 browser.

Hope you enjoy!

Greetings
