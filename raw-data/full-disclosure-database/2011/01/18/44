-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Beehive. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within 'voice-servlet/prompt-qa/Index.jspf'.
During the creation of a file used for storing an evaluation parameter
user supplied data is used to create a filename and another user
specified field is later used to populate that file's contents. By
inserting a null byte (0x00) into the filename the user can control the
extension of the newly created file. A remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the oracle
user.
