ZDI-11-018: Oracle Database and Enterprise Manager Grid Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-018

January 18, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3600

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Database Server

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Database 11g. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within a JSP script exposed via an HTTPS server
running by default on TCP port 1158. The script allows clients to upload
XML files to the server. However, if a NULL byte is supplied within a
POST parameter during a request to this JSP page, the process will fail
to properly append the XML extension to the created file. An attacker
can abuse this to upload executable code which can later be accessed
remotely allowing for code execution to be achieved on the server
system.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
