Subject: Path to IT Security

Hello All,

I'm a newbie to this list and all i need is some guidance into the world of IT security. i have completed Comptia A+ and Network + and wish to pursue a career in security.

After researching i found out that the most prestigious security certification is the CISSP and it seems like a very long journey to it since i have no experience in it at all but need to get my foot in.

Could anyone please advise me on the best path to being a security professional? ie from beginner to pro? 

All advise will be well appreciated.

Thanks
