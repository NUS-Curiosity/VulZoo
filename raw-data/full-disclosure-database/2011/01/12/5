 Cheat-sheet [maybe 0day]

Hello Chris,

This article is written in order to emphasize the need to verify your user
information, such as file names.
Unfortunately, in our practice (mainly in Russia) of study of web
applications, such meets are not always.

I am very glad that all your applications are well protected! 

But also keep in mind that the vulnerability much more than meets the eye
...
