4. Affected Components Description
==================================

The SAP Management Console (SAP MC) provides a common framework for centralized system management. It allows users to monitor and perform basic
administration tasks on the SAP system centrally, thus simplifying system administration. Through this component, administrators can start, stop and
restart instances, monitor system alerts, display log and trace files, etc.

This service is enabled by default in every SAP system.


5. Vulnerability Details

It has been detected that many of the available methods in the sapstartsrv SOAP server do not require user authentication, allowing remote and
unauthenticated users to obtain sensitive information from the SAP system, such as the list of log files and their content, profile parameters,
developer traces, etc.

Furthermore, some of the unauthenticated methods perform security sensitive operations that may impact over the integrity, confidentiality and/or
availability of the SAP system.

Technical details about this issue are not disclosed at this moment with the purpose of providing enough time to affected customers to patch their
systems and protect against the exploitation of the described vulnerability.
