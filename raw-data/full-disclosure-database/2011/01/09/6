Yes sure, here you go:

Just check any subdir/html page under
*developerworks/* since it was the case of a full deface
if you ask me(inject the deface in every page the attacker
has access too).
You can also Google for:
site:www.ibm.com/developerworks/ intitle:"Defaced by Hmei7"
And check the caches.

The admins are on to it and they are progressively fixing them,
thus why you get that message.
Must suck though, since it's a weekend. :-)

	Our apologies 
		

The IBM developerWorks Web site is currently under maintenance. 
Please try again later. 



Thank you.
