Subject: Re: Path to IT Security

Go for it any way you can.  15 years ago I had just began writing HTML and basic 
JavaScript and learning about computers.  I really caught fire and could not get 
enough, I just kept learning on my own until one day a computer scientist I met 
decided I should come in for an interview for a information security engineer at 
a company where he worked; thought I could make a positive contribution, and I 
did.

I am now well into my career as an Information Security professional with 
numerous SANS certs, etc.  That said all certs are BS and almost anyone who can 
study can pass them.  Whether or not your can provide practical examples is 
another matter.

I've rejected Masters in Comp Sci candidates from prestigious west coast 
universities because though they looked good on paper, the turned out to be 
nothing more than GUI slingers.

If you are real and you are talented, you will be a gearhead; not a GUI 
slinger.  And with any luck you will find success.
