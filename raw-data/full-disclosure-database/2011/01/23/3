Subject: NiX Brute Forcer 1.1.0 update has been released

NiX Brute Forcer is a tool that uses brute force in parallel to log into a
system without having authentication credentials beforehand. This tool is
intended to demonstrate the importance of choosing strong passwords.

After you've used it, you'll see why it will outright beat any other brute
forcer.

Why NiX? ItÂ´s free of charge and offers major features over any other
brute forcer such as:

HTTP/SOCKS 4 and 5 proxy support
FORM auto-detection

Auto-removal of dead or unreliable proxy and when site protection
mechanism blocks the proxy

Integrated proxy randomization to defeat certain protection mechanisms
