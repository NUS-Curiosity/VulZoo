Thank you for that link. That was extremely instructive.

It scares the heck out of me that someone might convince a government 
that it's a good idea to endorse such a thing in official regulations.

Thank goodness the working exploit will remain as the "gold standard" 
for cutting through the BS in the field of data security for the 
foreseeable future.
