It all depends what kind of breach happened.

Breaches caused by script kiddies and their automated kits, aren't exactly
very high profile, and usually come from poor security ethics surrounding
the infrastructure (i.e. lack of updates, no NIDS in place, no port
blocking, no IP whitelisting etc etc). Falling under this category would
certainly NOT be credible to the company, as it shows their security game is
piss poor.

Breaches caused by rouge internal staff members, or where the company has
been specifically targeted for a long play, would be the only circumstances
where the publicity could actually be beneficial, as it creates interesting
controversy, unlike the latter.

All the above is just my opinion though, not proven fact (although I've
headed up enough disaster recovery contracts after both ext and int breaches
to have a clear insight as to how these kinda things go down)
