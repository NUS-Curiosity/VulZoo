Subject: "Hacker attacks won't hurt your company brand"

"...the idea that a breach is unlikely to kill your organization is
spreading, because it’s backed by data."

" If you’ve been spreading FUD [..] you’re going to face some harsh
questions. By regularly making claims which turn out to be false, people
undermine their credibility. If you’re one of those people, expect questions
from those outside security who’ve heard you make the claim."

"If you’re still doing it, you’re creating problems for yourself. Even
worse, you’re creating problems for security professionals in general."
