TeamSHATTER Security Advisory

January 20, 2011

Risk Level:
Medium

Affected versions:
Oracle Database Server version 10gR2, 11gR1 and 11gR2

Remote exploitable:
No

Credits:

Details:

commands. The pipe handling is not secure enough resulting in the vulnerability.

Impact:
It is possible for a local user to execute code as localsystem.

Vendor Status:

There is no workaround for this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Windows platforms only.
