Subject: Re: Drupal 5.x,
 6.x <= Stored Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Drupal security has been aware of this issue for quite some time now.
But basically, as their response indicates, you need admin access to
exploit these issues.  However, if you have admin access you can execute
PHP and basically do anything you want.  Your vulnerability hinges on
being able to bypass the CSRF security in place in Drupal.  Seems like a
bit of a stretch to release this as an advisory.  Why not include the
fact that if you can bypass the CSRF detection you can also execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server?
