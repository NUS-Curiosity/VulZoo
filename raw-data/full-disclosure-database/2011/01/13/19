And a few others...

For the record, I'm perfectly aware of the definition of penultimate.
It was my (apparently) lame attempt at being whimsical. Should have made it "Final, Really, Really, Last, Almost Definitely, Penultimate, Call For Papers." - to poke fun at ourselves and extending deadlines. In my defense it was 3 a.m. and I'd been working on stuff since six in the morning so I'm sure I wasn't firing on all cylinders.

This is why I work with computers instead of doing stand up.
I guess I should leave the humor to the SecurityClowns.

cheers,
