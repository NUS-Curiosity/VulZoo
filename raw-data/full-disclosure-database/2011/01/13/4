Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : compatibility problem with updated openssl
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3555
Debian Bug     : 609124

The openssl update in DSA-2141-1 caused a regression in lighttpd. Due
to a bug in lighttpd, the server fails to start in some configurations
if using the updated openssl libraries. This update fixes this problem.

For the stable distribution (lenny), the problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.19-5+lenny2.

The packages for the hppa, mips, and mipsel architectures are not yet
available. They will be released as soon as they have been built.

For the unstable distribution (sid), and the testing distribution
(squeeze), the problem has been fixed some time ago in version 1.4.26-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
