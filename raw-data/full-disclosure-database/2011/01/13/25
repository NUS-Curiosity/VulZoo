my favorite steganographic file system design used bits in inodes for
storage. the benefit of this more stealthy mechanism is offset by the
vastly expanded storage requirements. you need a *lot* of files to
have enough inodes in play to be useful.

this would not be vulnerable to the trivial unmasking that image based
storage or other similar approaches take (like mentioned in the paper
above) although it is unclear exactly how sparse and subtle the inode
modification must be across a large, populated file system to be
effective.

alas, i remember hearing about this from a certain fellow at DC13 and
never heard more...
