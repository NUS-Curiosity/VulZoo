Subject: ESFS - The encrypted steganography filesystem

Hello everyone,

I wanted to announce this little pet project that was born a couple of
weeks ago, and now it sees the light in the form of a proof of
concept, in hopes that it'll become a fully featured filesystem.
Here's an extract of the main README text:

============================================================================

What's this?

Just like the title says, it's a filesystem. Particularly, it's a FUSE
filesystem that's implemented entirely in Python (for now), and it's a
proof of concept in alpha state, so don't save stuff only within this
filesystem just yet. A couple of weeks ago, I started reading about
and playing with encrypted filesystems (LUKS + dmcrypt, encfs, etc). I
came across an email (actually, a friend of mine tossed me the link)
from the now well-known Assange, about a Linux kernel module he and
other people were working on that provided different layers of
encryption in a filesystem, so you can say "oh, yes, I have encrypted
data in here", but in a deeper layer you'd have more encrypted data,
with another key, and nobody but you would know about it. And I
thought it was a really cool idea. I started looking for the code, but
it was too old to be used with the current kernel. A couple of days
before that, I read about StegFS, a filesystem that uses steganography
to hide your files within your other files. And again, I thought it
was a really cool idea, BUT I didn't like the fact that (and please
correct me if I'm wrong) when you copied a file in StegFS, there's a
chance you'll lose some other file. So, this one is usable, but this
drawback didn't suit me. I started bouncing ideas with a lot of
friends, and then it hit me: a filesystem, hides its data in images
and encrypts this data. I wanted to build a FUSE filesystem since I
first learned about it, so I finally had an idea to work with. This
idea gives you the same advantages of Assange's kernel module: you
have a bunch of images that seem like regular files, but when you
mount the filesystem with certain parameters BAM! you have lots of
files that nobody knew were there.

============================================================================

You can find the rest of this README, a more detail design document,
and the actual code in: https://github.com/chiiph/esfs

If you find any bugs, please let me know.
Any comments and critics are more than welcome.
