That's why you use a wide array of operational controls and not just 
one, like a sandbox. The sandbox in the article was just a small example.

I couldn't agree more. Flaws in operational controls (security 
software) are a serious shame on the security industry and as you 
suggested, if you have that many flaws in a software, replace the 
vendor. However, I'll go one more- if you find your patches breaking 
too often or too many things, then stop patching and find an alternative.
