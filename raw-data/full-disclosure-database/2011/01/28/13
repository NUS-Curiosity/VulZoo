At the risk of having the eyes of the spiteful turned on me...

It's kind of funny how these sorts of groups seem to be governed by a pursuit of "the lulz" -- that is, personal amusement/schadenfreude at the expense of someone else, usually as a result of their own actions. But ironically, if Mr. Kaiser can be believed and judging by his overall "tone" of general irritation, it seems to be not quite so funny for the lulz-seekers when it happens to them. 

Although, to be honest, I think it's pretty funny. Kudos to trelane if he really did it; he's probably "lulz enemy n√∫mero uno" now or something.
