I don't actually think it's how easy it is to upgrade it's more so that most
vendors have a monolithic software image so frequently the upgrade fixes a
multitude of things and you can't pick and choose which you want and which
you do not. This is where I can see a lot of money and time being consumed
in the "patching" process, some vendors even provide (potentially expensive)
services to do this testing for you. I know that JUNOS is based on FreeBSD
and leverage's the FreeBSD packaging system for upgrades but not many other
vendors have adopted a package management or modular software strategy.
