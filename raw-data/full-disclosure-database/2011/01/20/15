Subject: Re: Path to IT Security

Emmanuel, Can I also just say here, that being an expert in any area of IT
isn't about qualifications, it's a state of mind, a mentality. There a
thousand and thousands of people out there that call themselves "qualified
professionals", and for 99% of them, that's all they will ever be. If you've
got the passion, then you'll go far. :)
