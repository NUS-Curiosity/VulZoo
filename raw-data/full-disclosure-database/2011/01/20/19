As a side note, I really like comments to the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CISSP - in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Certified_Information_Systems_Security_Professional

From tqbf -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tqbf (Thomas Ptacek):
"..the last graf summed up and contextualized the big long list of
crap the CISSP talks about...."

Response (Virgil Vaduva):
"..Being bitter or jealous about failed exams will not help your
career, and honestly you should put the time into studying the
material, understanding the (ISC)2 approach to security and focusing
on security from that perspective..."
