 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2011:014
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ccid
 Date    : January 20, 2011
 Affected: Corporate 4.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in ccid:
 
 Signedness error in ccid_serial.c in libccid in the USB Chip/Smart Card
 Interface Devices (CCID) driver, as used in pcscd in PCSC-Lite 1.5.3
 and possibly other products, allows physically proximate attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a smart card with a crafted serial number
 that causes a negative value to be used in a memcpy operation, which
 triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: some sources refer to this issue
 as an integer overflow (CVE-2010-4530).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
