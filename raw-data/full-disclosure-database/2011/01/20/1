Subject: Re: Getting Off the Patch

All,

I agree with most of the stuff that Thor has been saying and from what I
have read this has mostly been centred around patching software on servers.
However most large companies take the don't patch or patch infrequently
stance when it comes to network infrastructure, Cisco, Juniper, 3COM, HP and
other large network infrastructure companies by no means have a clean record
when it comes to vulnerabilities in their software but yet businesses will
often not patch even in environments that are highly redundant and can be
rebooted with no or little impact.

Can anyone seriously say that they patch every time Cisco releases a new
version of IOS?
