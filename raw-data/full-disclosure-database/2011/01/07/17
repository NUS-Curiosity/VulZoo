Oh interesting. I don't get away from technical sites much so I'd not 
heard of http://girlvinyl.com/ or http://encyclopediadramatica.com/ 
before. (NSFW)

It looks like one of those WikiMedia sites where the Special:Random page 
is really the best way to understand what that site is about.
That site will be really handy if I ever find myself in the middle of a 
flamewar on some PHPBB forums and in quick need of an animated gif with 
which to underscore my main point.

I'm sure I've just been trolled on F-D, but thanks for the links anyhow. 
You know I count on you guys to learn all the hip memes so I can follow 
what the teenagers are talking about these days. (I cannot help but to 
note in passing that Lawrence Welk always made sense.)
