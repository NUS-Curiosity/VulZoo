Andrew Auernheimer uses sexual extortion:

Here's the deal. I originally attempted to get a small excerpt about me on Neil's ED page taken down. The mods seemed reasonable at first.

Except when it came to me. Weev, the master of some arbitration chat or something, and I had a little conversation over IM in which he told me that, in order to take the link to my photos down, I would have to sleep with him in a hotel room. 

"Weev: i'm an attractive guy
Weev: you want something
Weev: i have it
Weev: you have something
Weev: i want it"

I rejected him (whether or not he was trolling me, I still don't know), and to punish me, a Chloe Dykstra ED article was started. An article all to myself!
