Subject: Re: Mentioning of my consultancy on mailing lists

No problem, it will be easy as I don't care about you and I am willing
to talk anymore about your business.

However, note that I was just refering to the fair amount of trolling
which has been made with your pseudo. So don't mistake : you are the
only responsible of what you have said and done.

Good luck if you find any matter for legal action on it. If ever some
judge accepted to open a case, even the worst lawyer of the world would
win it.

Regards.
