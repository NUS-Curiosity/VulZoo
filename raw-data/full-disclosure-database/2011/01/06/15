Subject: Re: Getting root, the hard way

you should try with this one instead, it is more stable:

/*
 * Linux Kernel SUID_PERM to root exploit
 *
 * Usage:
 *  gcc -w suid-to-root.c -o suid-to-root
 *  sudo chown root.root suid-to-root
 *  sudo chmod +s suid-to-root
 *  ./suid-to-root
 *
 *  This exploit is NOT stable:
 *   It does not work when you don't have sudo for example
 *   But you can easily port it with "su -c" !!!

#include <stdlib.h>
const char* args[] = {"/bin/sh", "-i", NULL};
int main() { setuid(0); execve("/bin/sh", args, NULL); }
