Subject: Google Caching For Fun And Profit


With the latest autocomplete google search feature filtering torrent keywords,
what happens when illegal data is split into many pieces and Google caches them.
 
If the site hosting the illegal data is forced to remove it, what about google?
The original file can still be reassembled from the cached pieces.
 
For example:
 
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rWWxuilWeYUJ...
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rWWxuilWeYUJ...
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rWWxuilWeYUJ...
...
...
...
 
Is Google now liable because it's hosting illegal files on their servers.
 
 
Thanks.
