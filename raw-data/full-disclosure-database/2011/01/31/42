ZDI-11-036: IBM DB2 db2dasrrm receiveDASMessage Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-036

January 31, 2011

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
IBM

-- Affected Products:
IBM DB2 Universal Database

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM DB2. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability. 

The flaw exists within the db2dasrrm component which listens by default
on TCP port 524. When allocating a buffer within receiveDASMessage a
user supplied length is used as a parameter to malloc(). This buffer is
later copied into without any bounds checking and can be made to
overflow. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the das user user.

-- Vendor Response:
IBM states:
v9.1 fp10
