Subject: TELUS Security Labs VR - Novell ZENworks Handheld
	Management	ZfHIPCND.exe Buffer Overflow

Novell ZENworks Handheld Management ZfHIPCND.exe Buffer Overflow

TSL ID: FSC20110125-06

1. Affected Software

    Novell ZENworks Handheld Management 7.0

Reference: http://www.novell.com/products/zenworks/handhelds

2. Vulnerability Summary

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Novell ZENworks Handheld Management that could be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a vulnerable server.

3. Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability is due to a boundary error in the IP Conduit Service, ZfHIPCND.exe. If a crafted packet is sent to the service on port 2400/TCP, it allocates a fixed size heap buffer and copies the client device information into it without validating the string size. This could be exploited by attackers to overflow the buffer and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ZfHIPCND.exe service, by default SYSTEM.

4. Vulnerability Detection

TELUS Security Labs has confirmed the vulnerability in:

    ZENworks Handheld Management 7.0 (ZfHIPCND.exe version 7.0.2.1029 Build 10/29/10)

5. Workaround

Do not allow untrusted hosts to access the vulnerable service.
