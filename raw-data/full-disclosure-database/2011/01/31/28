 Excel secure printing

Yes, it comes in very handy for those who need to ensure that the documents they placed on open shares be held at the printer for security.  

I love this part: "The adversary can then either print two copies of the victim's file and leave
one on the printer for the victim, or print one copy of the victim's file and photocopy it before
leaving the original on the printer for the victim, or print one copy of the victim's file and take it
resulting in the victim thinking that perhaps they didn't click the print icon after all."

They forgot to add "Or, the attacker could open the spreadsheet from the share."  LOL

Hello list,

Stumbled across this today. Â It appears Excel spreadsheets store
printer information including the PIN you might use when trying to do
a "secure" print.

http://insecureprinting.com/Microsoft_Excel_Spreadsheets_Expose_User_PIN_Used_for_Confidential_Secure_Printing.pdf

The paper is quite thorough and shows that in most cases the PIN is
stored in clear text in the spreadsheet, though some printer vendors
try to obfuscate the PIN (though not very successfully).

Thanks,
Ed
