Subject: Re: Vulnerability discloses PIN used in Microsoft
 Excel secure printing

I assume it is embedded so that cancelled or queued jobs can still require PIN.  You can't have one job pause all other jobs in the queue, so it would need some way of continuing from bypass.  The whole "vulnerability" angle is pretty lame.
