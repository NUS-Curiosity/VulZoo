Of course.

I agree that patching is not the largest part of an infrastructure but 
unfortunately, it's one that many organizations rely on for security. 
You can't deny that. I'm glad yours doesn't so maybe it doesn't matter 
to you. And what about the smaller organizations that don't have 
multiple environments or do their own coding? The article was written 
to a broad audience. Like many are. How many times have you read an 
article and realized it doesn't apply to you or someone in your 
situation? Do you go on the attack for all of them? We both know that 
there are situations where patching is the means of security for many 
organizations. I want to see that changed and one of the things they 
hate is the chore of patching and patch remediation.

That's a fallacious argument because there's no win. If I prove 
otherwise you tell me their not "serious".

Sorry if me trying to help find solutions for those companies bothers 
you so much. Please feel free to ignore my future posts and future 
work then so as not to waste your time.

Sincerely,
