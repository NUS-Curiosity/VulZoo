Subject: Re: [Dailydave] [TOOL RELEASE] T50 Sukhoi PAK FA
 Mixed Packet Injector v2.45r-H2HC

That was an awesome display, but I am always reminded of this
fantastic discussion of Robert Frost's classic poem "Fire and Ice"
when involved in such things. Especially Dvonna's fantastic
contribution to the thread (see below)
http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/4158-Robert-Frost-Fire-And-Ice

"""
eclipse....?
>>From guest Dvonna (contact)
Well.... When bella is bitten, Her life is being ended by the burn of
venom. Correct? If she stayed human, [chose jacob,] Then her life
would one day end in ice. Correct? So think about that. Bella wants
her life to end in fire. But if Edward were to leave her, [if she had
to perish twice] ice would also be great as in jacob would be her
second choice. Just because Edward is cold and hard, doesnt mean that
he is ice. And just because Jacob is warm... actually burning hot,
well that doesnt make him fire. This poem relates to eclipse because
its talking about the way of life that person would chose, and also
the second choice. You see?
"""
It's like you guys are doing an interpretive phenomenological analysis
of sending packets down the wire, or as Husserl would wish, making
science a "second order knowledge system, which depends ultimately on
first order personal experience". Honestly, which one of these tools
is Jacob, and which one is Edward? Cause I know which team I'm on! :>

SmartBits, AFAIK, is a great tool, but I've never used it. So I have no ambition of having T50 being compared to SmartBits, neither of having such performance nor even its features. T50 will use the NIC connected to the network you are testing, so I have no plans to support multiple interfaces... Not yet! But people can find a way to do this, right? =)

What do you do in this case? What is your analysis? Was the packet discarded by Kernel? Was the packet blocked by a Firewall, IPS, Router, or Switch? To address this inconvenient fact the only thing that comes from the top of my mind is using SELECT or PSELECT, but both of them can impact in the performance. Please, don't even think of using SLEEP, USLEEP or NANOSLEEP.

> 5. That is great, one request less. About the "re-inventing a wheel", I am kind of tired of hearing this... Imagine a world that is really happy with STROBE and nobody developed NMap. I don't like this world. I have no ambition of saying T50 is as innovating as NMap is, but it addresses my needs of having a tool to perform some stress testing and that could be launched from my notebook... So I am not spending my spare time with something useless, in opposite, I am doing something to address my needs and sharing with the community. About T50 being inferior to readily available ones, I have a video showing the opposite, can you show me any evidence of your statement? Here is another evidence of my statement: http://twitpic.com/2cu3ib/full.

> The goal, as I understand it, of T50 is to be a software based version of a SmartBits tester, yes? You aim to saturate a network link with as much traffic as possible, and that traffic needs to be predictable. In that case, you need to keep a few important requirements in mind:
>
> 1 - if we want to saturate multiple links simultaneously, having multiple contexts of execution being able to feed multiple network devices would be a good thing(tm). Additionally, you need a way to measure what's being done on the link - best way to do that is with a second nic which is able to capture the packets. Preferably, this is not just done with tcpdump/wireshark and manually trying to correlate.
>
> 2 - You failed to understand what packet_mmap is, or what I meant by checksum recalculation. Here's a quick logical proof:
>  a - Time spent working on the packet is time spent not transmitting
>  b - Time spent not transmitting is time that the network may have to absorb your attempt at saturation
>  c - Time spent computing checksums, rebuilding packets from the header, from the very beginning is time spent working on the packet
>  d - Time spent memcpy()'ing from userspace to kernel space is additionally, time spent not transmitting
>  e  - Using these mechanisms (like the packet_mmap tx ring) reduces your latency for transmission and tries to push the bottleneck as close to the hardware as possible.
>  Your code makes at least 2 memcpy()s. Additionally, you don't use the ethtool IOCTLs to try and increase the actual nic buffers, which I think we can both agree is just a smart idea.
>
> 3 - TCPREPLAY has far more advantage than T50; don't bother trying to deny it. It floods a link just as well as T50, and since you control the pcap, you control the packets transmitted - and can do anything with them, not just whatever options T50 allows. Tcpreplay can also flood with the captured packet's MAC included, meaning that if you do this to test your network, you can test your ability to detect which macs/ports can be turned off/on to alleviate an internal attack. The fact that you can even use real-world packet captures is just gravy. I can take emacs in hex mode and stamp out a TCP-SYN. Heck, I can use a packet capture of HPING and have a tcp-syn. Pcaps of interesting traffic are all over the internet, just use some google-fu. Heck, I can get captures of 3gpp traffic searching google. You have any SCTP generation? Any RRC or NBAP message flooding? When can I expect T50 to have this functionality? tcpreplay has it, as long as I have the packets.
>
> 4 - You still didn't explain how this isn't just hping --flood? I've gone through the code - what am I missing? I'm curious - you just decided to attack me, and call me stupid - I've refrained from juvenile responses. What am I missing? What power do I get with this tool that I don't already have?
>
> 5 - I'm not trying to have you give me, or anyone else credit - and nowhere in my email did I say such. I, frankly, don't care who gets their name plastered on what piece of if/then/else code; I do care to evaluate potentially better network saturation solutions, since that's part and parcel of my day-to-day life at work (network flood testing). I've used smartbits, tcpreplay, and tried using T50. It's not even close to either of those tools in terms of features. It doesn't have any clear advantage, either. I'm just trying to help you not spend your time re-inventing a wheel that is inferior to readily available ones. You can take that any way you want.

The reason I did this is to show that cool things can be done in this space (user space), with no Kernel patch or Kernel driver module. The concept is not new, and I didn't say it is. IRC old-school (old is cool [?] =D) will remember all things I did with this code. T50 is the very first public tool applying multi-protocol injection using a single socket - AFAIK. That said, how you dare to compare T50 and TCPREAPLY? I am not a TCPREPLAY expert, but I am not aware of any feature of TCPREPLAY that makes it able to inject packet without a PCAP file.

> I don't see the "wow" factor from this tool? Perhaps I forgot to take my "super l33t" pills, but I fail to see how this is different from something like tcpreplay, which not only does any packet(s) desired, but can pull them from an existing packet capture (and even edit those packets on the fly) allowing one to truly customize the traffic as much as possible. Additionally, I looked at this tool hoping for some "exciting" new code, but found nothing which people writing router / gateway software haven't known for years. In fact, you didn't even do intelligent checksum recalculation (ie: store a "base" checksum somewhere, and just do some quick delta calculation on it), and you didn't take advantage of packet_mmap on linux (zero copy seems like good juju for high-speed network transmission); HECK you're running from a single context of execution, instead of trying to execute on all available cores (which could add some scalability, depending on the architecture).

> I don't want to sound like I'm a total negative nancy - and certainly security is a hobby domain, not my primary area of expertise, but you posted this to a publicly available forum, so I suppose you were looking for some type of vetting, criticism, and feedback. My feedback would be to contribute to tcpreplay. There's nothing that your tool offers as an advantage (from a cursory glance, your tool appears to be hping --flood) to any available options; there's nothing unique that I saw.
