Dude, please don't take it personnaly. I was just debating and defending
my point of view.
I never meant to attack or offend you, and you did not bother me at all.
To the contrary, if I took time to answer, it's because I was interested

I respect you opinion but what I mean basically is that I need more to
be convinced.
