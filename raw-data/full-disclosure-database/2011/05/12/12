Subject: BackTrack 5 Released

Hi All, 

The BackTrack Dev team has worked furiously in the past months on BackTrack 5, code name “revolution”. 
We are proud to release our work to the public, and then rest for a couple of weeks. 
This new revision has been built from scratch, and boasts several major improvements over all our previous releases. 
We recommend you use the official download page, available at: http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/.

As usual, comments, bug fixes and tool requests can be posted in our forums:

Enjoy this fine release, 

The BackTrack Dev Team
