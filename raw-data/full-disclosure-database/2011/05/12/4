I think Roland said earlier that outbound connections from these boxes
should be going out another interface, presumably (my presumption)
through a stateful firewall of some kind, because ACLs wouldn't be
sufficient.

This is perhaps the aspect that has been missed in this discussion
(mentioned once, not particularly picked up on, and not really noted
again).  It eliminates many of the concerns of using ACLs over stateful.
