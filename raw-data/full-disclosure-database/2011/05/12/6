Actually, the stateless solution was to just ACL via "known good" source ports.  And this was a large part of my original response of the value of firewalls in front of a server. Limiting outbound traffic to responses to valid initiated traffic is an important security control, specifically because the "ACL's wouldn't be sufficient."

The examples I was going to tally up for Roland were any number of SQL injection attacks where tftp and ftp command files were created (in this case, by some tool that I presume created .cmd files just like we all used to do with "echo >>") to get other toolsets.  These requests failed as the SQL box couldn't make outbound connections.  There was no capability for the attacker to initiate another remote connection to craft a response to.  

I was actually going to try to get detailed information from way back where Code Red propagation was avoided by outbound connection attempts as well, but I don't really see the value in doing that at this point.  I also had Slammer research where I tested ISA's resilience to blocking outbound UDP 1434 connections, but I think it suffices to say that there are many, many valid examples of why stateful inspection of traffic is valuable and adds security in depth. 

I had some other responses as well, but I have to bolt.  I'll make sure to catch up on the rest of the responses before I do so as well.
