Sorry, but my operational experience is quite the opposite.  And one generally deploys clusters of servers, in any kind of even semi-important site.

I can and do tell you that.  I further tell you that enforcing network access policies for servers in stateless ACLs instantiated in ASIC-based routers and layer-3 switches is the way to go.  I tell you this based upon my direct experience working for the largest manufacturer of firewalls in the world, and on my day-to-day operational experience with people calling up and screaming that 'the data center is down' and the proximate cause being a stateful firewall which gave up the ghost to trivial amounts of traffic.

For example, I've seen 80kpps of SYN-flood take down a stateful firewall rated for 2.5gb/sec.

The folks cited on pp. 41 - 42 of the survey in question have reached a different conclusion:
