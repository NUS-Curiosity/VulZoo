Maybe it would be best if people didn't cc the list when replying to
Andrew Wallace kinda like nanog does with their pet
troll-that-took-it-too-far.
I don't think that the individual who was banned from FD for being the
biggest idiot ever seen in a security ml should be allowed to
circumvent that through others replying to his paranoid nonsense.

On a side note, as you are obviously reading this netters, i too am in
glasgow so why don't we meet up. I could even arrange to get your meds
re-prescribed or organise some acu-detox for your cocaine problem

best wishes
mike
