Subject: Leakdirectory: call for contribution

Hi guys,

we setup a wiki-based directory of leaksites and transparency ecosystem
available on:

http://leakdirectory.org

We would be pleased to have contribution in working on the wiki and on
the project.

Anonymous contributions are welcome, the wiki is open for editing.
