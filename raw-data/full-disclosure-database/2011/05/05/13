Amish not being in the "regular databases" cause they don't use
technology (i.e., like Facebook, or any of the other databases mentioned
previously). A better way to word "It wouldn't just be a selective
subset but pretty much who, where,
when and probably why without too many non-Amish exceptions." would have
been "It wouldn't just be a select subset of people, but basically the
who, where, when, and why of almost everyone, with little to no
exceptions (aside from the Amish and suchlike folk, who obviously don't
use technology). Make sense now? :D
