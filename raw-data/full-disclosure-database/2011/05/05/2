Subject: [USN-1126-2] PHP Regressions

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1126-2
May 05, 2011

php5 regressions
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 9.10
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

Summary:

USN 1126-1 introduced two regressions in PHP.

Software Description:
- php5: HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

Details:

USN 1126-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in PHP. The fix for
CVE-2010-4697 introduced an incorrect reference counting regression
in the Zend engine that caused the PHP interpreter to segfault. This
regression affects Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

The fixes for CVE-2011-1072 and CVE-2011-1144 introduced a regression
in the PEAR installer that prevented it from creating its cache
directory and reporting errors correctly.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Stephane Chazelas discovered that the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job for
 PHP 5.3.5 allows local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
 attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. (CVE-2011-0441)
 
 Raphael Geisert and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the PEAR installer
 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on
 the package.xml file, related to the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir,
 (3) tmp_dir, and (4) pear-build-download directories. (CVE-2011-1072,
 CVE-2011-1144)
 
 Ben Schmidt discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability in the PHP
 Zend engine could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (heap
 memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-4697)
 
 Martin Barbella discovered a buffer overflow in the PHP GD extension
 that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash)
 via a large number of anti- aliasing steps in an argument to the
 imagepstext function. (CVE-2010-4698)
 
 It was discovered that PHP accepts the \0 character in a pathname,
 which might allow an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions
 by placing a safe file extension after this character. This issue
 is addressed in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04.
 (CVE-2006-7243)
 
 Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the grapheme_extract function
 in the PHP Internationalization extension (Intl) for ICU allow
 an attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid
 size argument, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference. This
 issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu
 11.04. (CVE-2011-0420)
 
 Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the _zip_name_locate
 function in the PHP Zip extension does not properly handle a
 ZIPARCHIVE::FL_UNCHANGED argument, which might allow an attacker to
 cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via an empty
 ZIP archive. This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu
 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-0421)
 
 Luca Carettoni discovered that the PHP Exif extension performs an
 incorrect cast on 64bit platforms, which allows a remote attacker
 to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an image with
 a crafted Image File Directory (IFD). (CVE-2011-0708)
 
 Jose Carlos Norte discovered that an integer overflow in the PHP
 shmop extension could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and possibly read sensitive memory function. (CVE-2011-1092)
 
 Felipe Pena discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability in the
 substr_replace function allows an attacker to cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
 (CVE-2011-1148)
 
 Felipe Pena discovered multiple format string vulnerabilities in the
 PHP phar extension. These could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive
 information from process memory, cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption), or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue affected
 Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04.(CVE-2011-1153)
 
 It was discovered that a buffer overflow occurs in the strval function
 when the precision configuration option has a large value. The default
 compiler options for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,
 Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04 should reduce the vulnerability to a
 denial of service. (CVE-2011-1464)
 
 It was discovered that an integer overflow in the SdnToJulian function
 in the PHP Calendar extension could allow an attacker to cause a
 denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2011-1466)
 
 Tomas Hoger discovered that an integer overflow in the
 NumberFormatter::setSymbol function in the PHP Intl extension
 could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application
 crash). This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu
 11.04. (CVE-2011-1467)
 
 It was discovered that multiple memory leaks in the PHP OpenSSL
 extension might allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
 (memory consumption). This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu
 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1468)
 
 Daniel Buschke discovered that the PHP Streams component in PHP
 handled types improperly, possibly allowing an attacker to cause a
 denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2011-1469)
 
 It was discovered that the PHP Zip extension could allow an attacker to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a ziparchive stream
 that is not properly handled by the stream_get_contents function. This
 issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu
 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1470)
 
 It was discovered that an integer signedness error in the PHP Zip
 extension could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (CPU
 consumption) via a malformed archive file.  This issue affected
 Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and
 Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1470) (CVE-2011-1471)
