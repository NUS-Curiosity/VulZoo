>>From http://blog.lastpass.com/2011/05/lastpass-security-notification.html :

  "We're rebuilding the boxes in question and have shut down and
  moved services from them in the meantime. The source code
  running the website and plugins has been verified against our
  source code repositories, and we have further determined from
  offline snapshots and cryptographic hashes in the repository
  that there was no tampering with the repository itself"
