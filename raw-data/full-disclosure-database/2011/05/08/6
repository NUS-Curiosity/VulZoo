Subject: Pytbull v1.0 release now available

Hi guys,

A new major Pytbull version (version 1.0) has been released, with following
features:

   - Support of other IDS/IPS than just Snort & Suricata, provided you can
   grab the alerts file via FTP (the parameter -i doesn't exist anymore).
   - Pattern matching feature, enabling to specify a regex in the tests
   (optional), that will be compared to the alerts triggered for each payload.
   A flag will then indicate for each test if succeeded or failed.
   - A new module has been added: pcapReplay, enabling to replay traffic
   from a pcap file
   - Issue #1 (f.close()) has been fixed

You can try this new release from this link:
