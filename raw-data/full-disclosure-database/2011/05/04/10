"some leet profiling"
if you look at what netflix (supposedly anonymised) + imdb was able to
do, or the classic of AOL releasing their searches (again anonymised)
then a join of google with facebook is quite a scary prospect.
Especially as d of b + partial zip/postcode allows for
re-identification most of the time (i believe that d of b + state =
85% re-identification).
It wouldn't just be a selective subset but pretty much who, where,
when and probably why without too many non-Amish exceptions.
