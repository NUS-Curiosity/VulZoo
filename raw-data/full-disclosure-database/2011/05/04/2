Facebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever
been invented. 

I dont agree, google is by far the biggest database of what user want and
look for. If you merge those database (google) and facebook that must make
some leet profiling. (especially when you think that you can easily find
where someone live with phone directory and you can match the ip by sector
too to match the google database)

...they are
doing free work for United States intelligence agencies in building this
database for them.
