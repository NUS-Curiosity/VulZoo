and PHP code? Be instructed by masters of the craft Dave Wichers and
Robert H'obbes' Zakon, and respected infosec authors Shreeraj Shah
(author of "Hacking Web Services") and Erez Metula (author of "Managed
Code Rootkits"). And if you want to set up the next generation of
application layer defenses, build your intrusion detection and

5K/10K FOR CHARITY
See Dinis Cruz, Dan Cornell, and Mark Curphey sprint to the finish

electromagnetism. Let's strengthen the bond with community and improve
our health. Place your donations and get signed up to race in the late
afternoon Wednesday (September 21, 2011) the day before the conference
talks.

WOMEN IN APPSEC
Enable more women to enter the application security field. We're off
to a great start with the Wells Fargo Foundation's generous seed
funding of $5,000 for grants to women interested in attending OWASP
AppSec USA 2011 to launch their career in this growing field. OWASP
transformed the way information security works once already, and it's
time again to propel positive progress.
