Subject: Re: Sony: No firewall and no patches

I congratulate all those that made a good pawn (pwn?) out of Anonymous,
urging the group into a vendetta attack in the name of George Hotz; while
the upper echelon collected the bounty; loads of user information.

Must be the social engineering effort of the century considering the size of
the outcome as well as suckering a different kind of victim into it.

Of course, on the other side of the Fail scale there is Sony, but the media
will do the job of an appropriate critique - so I won't even bother.
