Subject: [Tool] peepdf: a new tool to analyse/modify PDF
	files

Hi list,

I've just released the first version of my tool to analyse and modify
PDF files:

"peepdf is a Python tool to explore PDF files in order to find out if
the file can be harmful or not. The aim of this tool is to provide all
the necessary components that a security researcher could need in a PDF
analysis without using 3 or 4 tools to make all the tasks. With peepdf
it's possible to see all the objects in the document showing the
suspicious elements, supports all the most used filters and encodings,
it can parse different versions of a file, object streams and encrypted
files. With the installation of Spidermonkey and Libemu it provides
Javascript and shellcode analysis wrappers too. It's also able to create
new PDF files and to modify existent ones."

You can find more information and download it here:

Any comments and bugs are welcomed! ;)

Regards,

Jose
