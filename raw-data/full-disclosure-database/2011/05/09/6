PR10-17: Various XSS and information disclosure flaws within KeyFax
response management system

http://www.omfax.co.uk

Vulnerability found: 25th August 2010

Vendor informed:

Vulnerability fixed:

Severity: Medium/High

Description:

KeyFax response management system provides professional management of
housing and other repairs; KeyFax is normally accessed using a web
browser over port 80. Various KeyFax pages are vulnerable to a
reflective XSS attacks. Other pages including the configuration file
disclose information including the operator and SQL account passwords.

Version 3.2.2.6 dated 2003-2010

The following demonstrate the XSS flaws (no authentication needed):
1) Various pages are vulnerable to XSS  (IE only)
http://target-domain.foo/keyfax32/test/response.asp?co="style%3d"x:expression(alert(1))""%20";

http://target-domain.foo/keyfax32/rs/main_rs.asp?C="style%3d"x:expression(alert(1))""%20";


Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to a KeyFax response
management system based site. Such code would run within the security
context of the target domain. This type of attack can result in
non-persistent defacement of the target site, or the redirection of
confidential information (i.e.: session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following demonstrate the Information disclosure flaws (no
authentication needed)

1) Account passwords can be remotely retrieved, by knowing the path of
the configuration file.

http://target-domain.foo/KFLauncher/KF_config.xml (this also contains
other username and password combinations like operator)
http://target-domain.foo/KFLauncher/KFRDROL_target-domain_config.xml

These contain the following information:-

http://target-domain.foo/kfdataview/password.asp?user=operator&pwd=operator

Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Password=omfax;Persist Security Info=True;User
ID=keyfax;Initial Catalog=KF_target-domain_ROL_32;Data
Source=target-domain.foo

2) Information about the web site is publically disclosed by the debug
console.

http://target-domain.foo/keyfax32/includes/debug.asp

And within verbose error pages
http://target-domain.foo/keyfax32/request_sa_fl.asp?user=.

Consequences:

An attacker may be able to obtain additional information on the machines
configuration including user names and passwords, and use this
information to gain authenticated access.
