	System!

   Thank you for testing our Malbox, we've looking into the problem
about the  wrong TCP connections in analysis reports, and  will  fix
it as soon as possible. And we will improve our web server in 1-2
weeks in order to avoid the HTTP 500 error. Besides, we are going to
release the Technical Whitepaper of Sandbox as soon as we finish
translating it into English :)
   Best regards, and thanks again.
