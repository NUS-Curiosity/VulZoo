Subject: Re: Linux kernel 2011 local root does it exist


Apologies in advance for thread-jacking but does someone happen to have a spare GNU/Linux CD-Key for sale?  I'm having some issues with Linux Genuine Advantage for Linux Kernel 2011 Home Edition.  I did recently change my motherboard and evidently it was an OEM license and LGA went crazy.

Please do not recommend a Linux key-gen, I do not pirate GNU/Linux!  I've seen many of these Linux torrents floating around and the last thing I want is to be sued over downloading Linux!  Amazingly many of them are right out there in the open too!

Kind Regards,
John Jacobs
