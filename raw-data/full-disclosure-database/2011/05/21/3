Package        : apr
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0419 CVE-2011-1928
Debian bug     : 627182


The recent APR update DSA-2237-1 introduced a regression that could
lead to an endless loop in the apr_fnmatch() function, causing a
denial of service. This update fixes this problem (CVE-2011-1928).

For reference, the description of the original DSA, which fixed
CVE-2011-0419:

A flaw was found in the APR library, which could be exploited through
Apache HTTPD's mod_autoindex.  If a directory indexed by mod_autoindex
contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could
send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU
usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.12-5+lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-6+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.4.5-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.4.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apr packages and restart the
apache2 server.
