Yeah these are Yahoo TV Widget url signing keys for Samsung & LG devices,
they are used together with a timestamp to prevent you from grabbing other
people's widgets/spoofing devices. If you fire up wireshark while you're
poking at these TV's you'll see some calls to Yahoo services ending in
&sign=

url = http://....yahoo....?1=a&2=b&3=c
url = url+"&sign="md5(url+Secret)

Update the ts (timestamp in msecs) parameter, resign, post & play.
Interesting to look at the various widgets & sources, none of them have any
form of obfuscation applied to the javascript, could be useful in finding
and exploring unknown APIs :)
