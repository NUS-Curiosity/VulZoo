	System!

Hello ppl,
same , I had uploaded a KNOWN infected exe, and it loaded page, but then
returned nothing , Using firefox 4 browser, yes some script addons wich
prevent crapware,but other than that, it should have been swift to respond
with a positive, it did nothing but load in the browser, was a letdown,hope
you can get it to work cross browser, because would be a very handy app for
sure
xd
