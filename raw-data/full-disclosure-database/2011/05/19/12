Subject: Google chrome sending strange DNS queries

Greetings,

Has anyone ever noticed, the sort of DNS queries when you fire/running
Google-chrome?
The DNS queries for domain names likes:
bsjghxplor
hrrtjswxtt
epjyptuure

etc.

Behavior has been observed on Linux as well as Windows systems.
See the attached screenshot of wireshark dump.
