Subject: Ubuntu Security Notice publication update

Historically, Ubuntu sends Ubuntu Security Notices (USNs) to bugtraq,
full-disclosure and our own announce mailing list. After a recent review
of our publication process, we decided we will no longer post USNs to
bugtraq and full-disclosure.

People interested in receiving USNs by email should subscribe to the
ubuntu-security-announce mailing list directly:
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce

An archive of all USNs can be found at:
https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/

Alternatively, people can view USNs and subscribe to news feeds on our
website: http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/
