Interesting I will have to test this one and see. I know recently someone did a writeup about Microsoft doing a similar phone home when you launch I.E  so it can verify you internet connection.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Google chrome sending strange DNS queries

Greetings,

Has anyone ever noticed, the sort of DNS queries when you fire/running
Google-chrome?
The DNS queries for domain names likes:
bsjghxplor
hrrtjswxtt
epjyptuure

etc.

Behavior has been observed on Linux as well as Windows systems.
See the attached screenshot of wireshark dump.
