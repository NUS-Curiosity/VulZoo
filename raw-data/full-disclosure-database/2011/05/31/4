if you meant using your backup software for specific restoration,
there is no reason you can't do this on the live file system using the
backup software as expected.

my intent was to encourage use of making / updating the backups on a
read-only snapshot of the file system, rather than live. using logical
volumes alone are not sufficient for advanced file specific
backups/restore or de-dupe or other features traditionally provided by
managed backup software.
