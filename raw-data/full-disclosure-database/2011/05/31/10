Significant quibble:  It's a backup of the data *as it existed on the disk* as
of that timestamp.  If it's a file that's backing any production database more
complicated than the older Berkeley DBM package, it will almost certainly *not*
restore to anything usable without help from the database (either by making the
database quiesce for a moment while you snapshot, or other methods that are
able to ensure a self-consistent version is backed up).  I've seen all too many
sysadmins trying to figure out why Oracle won't come back up after restoring
the file that had the tables in it....

(And of course, the same issues apply if you're trying to do forensics on a
bad backup of a database.)
