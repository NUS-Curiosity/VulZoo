- lilo.conf commonly has whitespace around '=', pam_env does not tolerate that
- bind configs don't even use '=' and are often indented, pam_env does not tolerate indents
- RSA appears to be uninteresting in that the amount of bits we can lift is not sufficient to make an attack feasible (this is in the article!)
- the DSA host key certainly is a target

If I understand correctly, Debian (and, I presume, Ubuntu) put this bug on low priority precisely because there were very few practical applications that they knew of.

Cheers, Peter
