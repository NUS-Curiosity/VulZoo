there are also corner cases depending on filesystem used on top of the
logical volumes, there is often no fail-safe behavior when you fuck up
sizing or lose backing devices, you need to handle application level
sync yourself (like locking DB tables and letting buffers flush to
disk), etc.

did you expect training wheels?

are you a volume shadow copy user? ;)

the poor man's way to handle this is mounting the RO snapshot
somewhere, and invoking and rsync, afick, $your_favorite_tool to see
what changed and copy/restore what you want.
