someone asked, "then why use snapshots for backups if difficult?"

a backup is represented as a collection of data at a specific point in
time. your backup software will traverse the entire collection to
perform a complete or incremental archive of this collection.

you probably reference it by date, like 05/30/2011-18:50:30. if it
takes 45 minutes to traverse a filesystem for backup, what you expect
to be backup 05/30/2011-18:50:30 is really a set spanning
05/30/2011-18:50:30 to 05/30/2011-19:20:00 with potentially large
amounts of change spanning that time frame and no clue what they were.

with a snapshot of a volume at 05/30/2011-18:50:30, you know the
backup process performed on that snapshot is truly a backup of the
data as of 05/30/2011-18:50:30 no matter how long it takes to iterate
over / analyze the files within it.
