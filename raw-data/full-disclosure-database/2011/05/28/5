The Hack-Cup team is happy to announce the 2nd edition of the Hack Cup
2011 in Las Vegas. As usual it will be during the first day of Defcon
(the 4th of August). We welcome anyone who wants to play indoor soccer
and likes hacking or hackers. This is a co-ed sport.

As with all Immunity-sponsored events, all players will receive one free
SMB kernel 0day for playing.

The dynamic will be the same as before:

 o The tournament will go from  9-12 AM

 o We will have 12 teams of five players each playing 15 minutes matches
in four different groups. We recommend that you have at least 2-5
substitutes because its a very fast field and you may have drank beer
the night before. Last year, several teams absorbed people who came
without a team, so if you don't know five other soccer players, all is
not lost. We made new friends!

Last year the final between the Argentinians and the South Africans was
just plain good soccer, so if you want to come to watch and have a good
time, we offer that as well.

We just opened the team subscription page which can be found here:
http://www.hack-cup.com/add-your-team

Remember there are only 12 spots. First Come, First Serve. Just like
kernel.org!

For more information or pictures of last year, please visit our
stunningly attractive and highly scalable website: http://www.hack-cup.com/

Thanks,
Team Hack-Cup!
