We are currently soliciting presentations for the fourth annual SEC-T 
technical security conference in Stockholm, Sweden on the 8-9th of September.
The content of this conference is information security related, but strongly
rooted in the technical realm.

Some topics of interest are:
 - Why the attacker always wins and how to improve your security posture
 - Novel ideas on detection and response or how to run a CIRT
 - Security metrics and repeatable testing, is the OSSTMM dead?
 - New technologies, hardware and software, from a security point of view
 - Offensive tools and techniques, from bug-hunting to post-exploitation

Anything submitted will be considered and we will judge each proposal by its
content and not the name attached. Proposals should include a description of
the talk contents and what attendees will learn from it.

Send all submissions to cfp@...-t.org.

Thanks to all past speakers and attendees for making SEC-T what it is,

The SEC-T organizing committee.
