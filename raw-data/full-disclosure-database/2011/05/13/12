Subject: Capture the Captcha - The Game

List,

Our Capture the Captcha game is now on-line:

http://ctc.bonsai-sec.com/

As you might know, this game has been already presented in H2HC and
BugCON in 2010.

Teams are scored on their success in breaking the security behind every
presented Captcha on the game. The winner of the game will be the
user/team who bypasses the highest amount of Captchas in less time in
order to receive the major prize: a 50USD Amazon Gift Card ;)

The CTC game starts at 2011-05-13 21:00:00 GMT 0 and ends at 2011-07-15
21:00:00 GMT 0 or if any participant breaks ALL Captchas.

Happy Captcha Killing !
