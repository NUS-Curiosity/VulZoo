Subject: Re: WordPress DB Dump - "Spammers Delight"

while is a matter of concern (being the sql dumps the worst) I think this is
more an admin/maintainer problem than wordpress'

wordpress isn't the only one able to use backup jobs or other type of dumps
of data, it's a common thing, but should be a concern to the owner or
hosting provider or whomever takes care of updates/backups to secure either
the locations of such dumps or the dumped files
