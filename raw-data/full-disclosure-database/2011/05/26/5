Subject: The Case of the Great Router Robbery

Whereas a home or SOHO router is unlikely to have much more value than
what can be had on eBay, it?s a very different story when a corporate
router is concerned.

This article will look at what information can be gleaned from a
stolen Cisco router, the mechanism available to reduce your exposure
in these circumstances, and an evaluation of its effectiveness.
