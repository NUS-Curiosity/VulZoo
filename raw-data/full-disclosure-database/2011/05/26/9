Subject: Online Base64 Decoder & Encoder with ASCII/Hex
	Output

Hi all,

Here is one of our new online tools, Base64 Decoder & Encoder.  Apart
from attractive, easy to use interface, it shows output in both ASCII
& HEX format.
It will be more useful for folks who are more involved in crypto stuff.

Try it out yourself,
