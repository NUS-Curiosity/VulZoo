Subject: IncrediMail Password Decryptor is just released

Hi all,

We have just released new tool,  IncrediMail Password Decryptor to
instantly recover passwords from IncrediMail client.

IncrediMail stores all the configured mail account passwords in
registry in an encrypted format at following location.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IncrediMail\Identities\<GUID>\Accounts\<GUID>

Usernames are stored in clear text, however passwords are encrypted
using proprietary encoding algorithm. Passwords for each type
(POP3/SMTP) are stored in the registry values “PopPassword“ &
“SMTPPassword“.

IncrediMail Password Decryptor helps in automatically discovering &
decrypting all such stored passwords.
