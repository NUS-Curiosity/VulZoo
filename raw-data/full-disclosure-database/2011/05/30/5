Gaah.  People are *still* getting this one wrong?  I mean, hasn't
the problem of /tmp races been here since at least V6 if not
earlier? So this problem has been here longer than most of the
readers of this list.  And proper solutions have been around for
at least 2 decades or so, as well.

Makes one wonder what *else* they got wrong.  Gotta worry when
bozos write security-sensitive software...
