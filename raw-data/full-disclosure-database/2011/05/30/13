Subject: CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem
	Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting 
vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of Ukrtelecom's 
representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about multiple 
vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models also 
could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into 
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this 
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for 
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct CSRF 
or XSS attack.

CSRF (WASC-09):

This vulnerability allows to change password of default user.

XSS (WASC-08):

In this form there are also two persistent XSS vulnerabilities.

In this case the code will be executed immediately, and also at visiting of 
pages http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html and 
http://192.168.1.1/shared/event_log_selection.html.

In this case the code will be executed immediately, and also at visiting of 
page http://192.168.1.1/configuration/authentication.html.

Timeline:
------------

2011.04.14 - informed Ukrtelecom about multiple vulnerabilities in modems,
which they give (sell) to their clients.
2011.05.25 - disclosed at my site.
2011.05.26 - informed developers (Iskratel).

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5165/).
