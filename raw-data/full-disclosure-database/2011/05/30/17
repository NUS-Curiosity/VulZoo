Subject: Leveraging pam_env to steal DSA keys

Hello,

regarding http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1140-1/ posted today (originally documented as http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3435), what
the notices do not mention is that this attack, under certain circumstances, can lift enough key material from a private DSA key to reconstruct the whole key in feasible time.

More information in my article at http://7bits.nl/projects/pamenv-dsakeys/pamenv-dsakeys.html

Comments or questions, please post a comment at the blog post or mail me privately.

Kind regards,
Peter van Dijk
