Subject: Allied Telesis divulges secret backdoor

>>From http://h-online.com/-1251556
Allied Telesis <http://www.alliedtelesis.com/> accidentally put
information about the backdoors present in all of its products into the
support area on its web site.

Didn't see this yet in FD, so I thought it is worth to post it...
