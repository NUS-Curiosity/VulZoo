Subject: pytbull update!

Hi guys,

Please notice a few updates about pytbull:

   - The entire project (downloads, bugs, svn, ...) has moved from
   googlecode to sourceforge.
   - There's now a dedicated site for pytbull here:
   http://pytbull.sourceforge.net
   - I've posted a request to include pytbull in Backtrack. Any comments are
   welcome:
   http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/backtrack-5-tool-requests/40639-pytbull-backtrack.html
   - There's a new version available: v1.3. You can download it from here:
   https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pytbull/pytbull-1.3.tar.bz2

Changelog for v1.3:

   - Bug fix 3305244<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3305244&group_id=547041&atid=2220536>:
   Error while using reverse shell
   - Minor changes (check new version) due to migration of pytbull on
   Sourceforge

Many thanks in advance for your updates and your support!
