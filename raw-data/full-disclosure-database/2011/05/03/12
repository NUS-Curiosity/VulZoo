Facebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever
been invented. Here we have the worlds most comprehensive database about
people, their relationships, their names, their addresses, their locations
and the communications with each other, their relatives, all sitting
within the United States, all accessible to US intelligence. Facebook,
Google, Yahoo  all these major US organizations have built-in interfaces
for US intelligence. Its not a matter of serving a subpoena. They have an
interface that they have developed for US intelligence to use.

Now, is it the case that Facebook is actually run by US intelligence? No,
its not like that. Its simply that US intelligence is able to bring to
bear legal and political pressure on them. And its costly for them to
hand out records one by one, so they have automated the process. Everyone
should understand that when they add their friends to Facebook, they are
doing free work for United States intelligence agencies in building this
database for them.

Any thoughts on that or is not it quite obvious even? I think everyone
should stop using that fuckbook.
