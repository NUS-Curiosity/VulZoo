I can understand their need to block the proxies, for example to prevent
you from registering multiple accounts or otherwise abusing their service.

How I do find it funny? Considering the size of their company and the
method used to build the database of blacklisted IP-addresses against well
protected system. Leeching proxies means - scraping the lists by using
automated scripts. This is not a proper way to do it. Hope you got the
point. They would be better off contacting me directly in a professional
manner rather than raping directly google's search results.
