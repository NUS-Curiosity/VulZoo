Subject: Viewpoint: Security implications of IPv6

Folks,

CPNI (http://www.cpni.gov.uk) has published the "Security implications
of IPv6" viewpoint document, which is basically an excerpt of a
technical report on which I have been working during the last couple
of years, and we'll be published anytime soon.

The viewpoint is available at:
<http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Documents/Publications/2011/2011mar22-infosec-cpni_viewpoint_security_implications_of_IPv6.pdf>

Best regards,
--
