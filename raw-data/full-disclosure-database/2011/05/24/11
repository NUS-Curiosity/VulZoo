What a nice euphemism. :)

The only thing legitimate database administrators really need to know is:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resetting-permissions.html#resetting-permissions-unix

If anyone wanted to write a real tool for auditing mysql they would look at
query logs and generate a list of least-privilege permissions each user needs
and identify database users with overly broad permissions based on past usage.
Anyone know if such a tool exists? I keep hoping the ingenious maatkit folks
will come up with something along these lines.
