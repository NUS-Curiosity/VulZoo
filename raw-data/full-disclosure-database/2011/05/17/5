Subject: Vulnerable and completely outdated 3rd party ZIP
	code in FastStone image viewer

The FastStone image viewer <http://www.faststone.org/> (and most
probably other FastStone products too) contains a 3rd party
ZipDll.dll 1.6.0.0 dated 2001-10-28.

This DLL was originally written by Chris Vleghert and Eric W. Engler,
based on InfoZIPs <http://infozip.org> code from 2000.

It is but vulnerable and completely outdated:  the current version of
the successor <http://dll.delphizip.org/> is 1.90, the oldest version
(1.78.7.3) listed there is from July 2005, almost 4 years newer than
the DLL distributed with the Faststone image viewer.

According to <http://infozip.org/FAQ.html#corruption> all versions of
ZIP prior to 2.31 (November 2004) and UnZIP prior to 5.52
(February/March 2005) are vulnerable.


Vendor was informed via <http://www.faststone.org/contactUs.htm>,
but did not respond at all!

PS: Tools like Secunia's PSI don't detect such outdated and
    vulnerable DLLs/components, so: user beware!
