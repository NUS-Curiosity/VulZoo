When I look at the specs of high end machines of most makers, they are
and they outmatch most of x64 servers. Do you mean they lie?
I don't mean to defend them, I really don't care, but can you develop?

Ok. First English is not my mother language, so I try to be precise but
that not always easy :)
Second, I am talking about rules sizes, not network sizes, and by
complexity, I wanted to address the ease of administration. You will
certainly agree that the more rules there are, the most risks there are
of human mistake.
Reducing rules by something like 70% in an improvment and an advantage
that stateful can have.
