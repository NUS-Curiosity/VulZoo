My operational experience, including that acquired during my tenure working for the world's largest manufacturer of firewalls by units shipped, contradicts this statement.

This is a) untrue and b) a near non-sequitur.  In general state is much more harmful on larger networks than on smaller ones; and there's no correlation at all between the size of a network and the complexity of network access policies.

Marketing aside, those 'sanity checks' take place in software, not in hardware; and they actually constitute a greatly broadened attack surface (look at the multiple vulnerability notices/patch notices for any commercial stateful firewall you can name, as well as for open-source stateful firewall packages).

Sadly, this is also not borne out by experience.  Quite the opposite, actually.
