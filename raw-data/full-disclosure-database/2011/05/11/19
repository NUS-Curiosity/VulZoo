Subject: Released FTPCommander Password Decryptor !

Hi all,

FTPCommanderPasswordDecryptor is the FREE software to instantly
recover FTP passwords stored by FTPCommander- one of the popular FTP
clients. It can automatically recover passwords from all versions of
FTPCommander, FTPCommander Pro & FTPCommander Deluxe.

FTPCommander stores the FTP account passwords in a file called
“ftplist.txt” in the same folder. Passwords are not stored in clear
text but merely XOR encoded with the magic number 25 (0×19).
FTPCommanderPasswordDecryptor makes it easy to recover these passwords
with its automatic & manual mode of operation.
