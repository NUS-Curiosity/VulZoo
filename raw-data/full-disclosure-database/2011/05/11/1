I would be extremely interested to learn details of how a stateful firewall in front of a server saved a company, when stateless ACLs in hardware-based network infrastructure devices would've led to failure.  Seriously, if you don't mind outlining the scenario, I think it would be very instructive.

If an attacker is already in a position to issue commands and induce your box to do things, he *already has his covert channel over which he can exfiltrate data*.  So the outbound stateful checking of server response traffic is moot, and simply constitutes a stateful DDoS chokepoint which makes it trivial for an attacker to take down the server in question by filling up the state-tables of said firewall with well-formed, programatically-generated traffic.

That's my point, in a nutshell.
