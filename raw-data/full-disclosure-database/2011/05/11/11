 Well, but this doesn't seem to be a problem when it comes to lunatic 
 errands of Andrew or Call's porn, so why would it bother to talk about

 I want to read how you justify that stateful hardware is useless to 
 check sessions of TCP and upper protocols.
 Of course, it doesn't protect from all kind of attacks and you cited 
 some of these cases, but there are plenty of cases where it is useful.
