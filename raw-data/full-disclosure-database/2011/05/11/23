Can you develop? I still don't see how the hell the typical web server
will handle as much traffic as one of these Checkpoint, Cisco or
whatever monsters.

I was talking about complexity correlation between using stateful or
stateless. Maybe it does not make any difference on a frontal firewall
with a few servers behind. But on a large network with inter-vlan
filtering, it matters a lot. Believe me, this one is based on my
operational experience.

I still trust more the network stack of a Linux/BSD/IOS dedicated box
than the one of a Windows Server. And it means a crafted packet has to
go through mixed devices.

Well maybe. I have no certitude on this point, but if you have facts,
it's welcome.
