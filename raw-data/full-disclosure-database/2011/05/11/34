Nice but not very precise : nature of packets, fragmentation, sessions,
bandwidth, etc.
Anyway, most appliances run a version of Linux or some BSD, so there is
potentially not much difference with an appliance.

To go back to my point: an application server (IIS, Apache) cannot
sustain as many connections as a firewall (of course in a sane and
standard environment).
So you cannot tell that a firewall will increase the risk of DoS.

From what I have seen so far as arguments, I think the discussion is
over.
