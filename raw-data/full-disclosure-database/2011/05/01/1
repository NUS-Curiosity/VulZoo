In Sweden they did that 14 days after they got hacked, and at the same 
time informed us that we should pay attention to weird things happening 
on our bank accounts...

LOL, it's fucking lame to come out with that warning 14 days after it 
happened... Quite obvious that they wanted to bury the whole thing...
