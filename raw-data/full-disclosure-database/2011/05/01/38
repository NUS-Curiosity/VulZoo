Subject: Detect and block ARP Spoofing/Poisoning

Hi guys,

ArpON (ARP handler inspection) is a portable handler daemon that make ARP secure in order to avoid the Man In The Middle (MITM) through ARP Spoofing/Poisoning attacks. It detects and blocks also derived attacks by it for more complex attacks, as: DHCP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing, WEB Spoofing, Session Hijacking and SSL/TLS Hijacking & co attacks.

Today, I released ArpON 2.2 version!

Thanks,
best regards!
