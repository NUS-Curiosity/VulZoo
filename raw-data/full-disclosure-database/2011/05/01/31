Package        : spip
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : not yet available

A vulnerability has been found in SPIP, a website engine for publishing,
which allows a malicious registered author to disconnect the website 
from its database, resulting in denial of service.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) doesn't include spip.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-3squeeze1.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your spip packages.
