I do not see a reason why they should. The Admin panel is not remotely
accessible by default and you technically have to be logged in for this
to be of any use.

Also if someone can already log in to the admin panel I somewhat doubt
that this would be of even the least bit of interest seeing as they
would already have control of the whole router.
