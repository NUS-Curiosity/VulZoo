"dude if you can't appreciate sharing, it's a better idea to be

in silent mode.

understand this:
=============================
you != everyone in FD
hence , you 'know' != everyone in FD knows
============================="




Have you guys heard, recently (July 2010) a new form of malware that
seemed to target SCADA systems was found, named Stuxnet.

Some interesting info here; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet


Also it contains 6 Windows 0days!!!


Anyway, thought you might not know due to FD members apparent
inability to read the news.


Lots of love,


Benji xoxox
