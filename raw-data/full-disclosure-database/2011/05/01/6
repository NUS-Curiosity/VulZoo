Subject: Re: psnhack - playstation network hack

Just having some additional info to share regardingly. Sorry for
interrupt.

In Japan people were very patient to wait for announce from Sony, while
in heart worried so much.
It was 27th just a day before summer holiday here when the announce
came .. I got to hold the phone for 3hours to passed thru to cancell
all cards.

Today I was watching the whole Sony news conference and writing it in
text word by word the took time to translate to english. The reporters
here was presenting the user's feelings very well, and I really respect
them a lot, they cleverly cornered Mr. Hirai's team with very logical
questions.
Access for the Q&A text is here... http://0day.jp/data/PSN.txt

I hope this list allowed this message to pass through, for I got a
strong sense that maybe I cannot hold the the text uptime for too long.

Best regards,

In Sweden they did that 14 days after they got hacked, and at the same
time informed us that we should pay attention to weird things happening
on our bank accounts...

LOL, it&apos;s fucking lame to come out with that warning 14 days after
it
happened... Quite obvious that they wanted to bury the whole thing...
