Subject: Re: psnhack - playstation network hack

Dear all,

Sorry for conveniences.
At least I have to reveal the truth here.

Since the parts of my translation text is up online in some sites
(without my permission at all!) anyway.Looks it was downloaded during
my middle editing and fixing the words,

As security developer I am very sad if it is used for the bad purpose.

I don't think that ps3dev was on it, yet I don't know what anonymous
is and I don't care of  it.
What I cared is so many misinformation happens, and so many people got
worried for the privacy got leaked.. I personally got 2 accounts in
PSN too, and have some rage in my heart for the incident follow up.

But, what was happened in the press conference today was moving my heart .
The reporters which many of them are from security professionals was
asking sharp questions related to the incident handlings , thumbs up,
And for the SONY, they answered it well. And this is the truth. I feel
like all sides want to play fair to compensate every damages occured,
which it is good deed, gentlemen. So let's the good stuffs rolling.

Herewith I am passing you the attachment of the real translation of
Q&A between reporters and them, this is for the above purpose.
Actually it was half personal notes for me..(comments exist), please
read the note above the translation text which said that I am not a
professional translator, which text was being CUT by any irresponsible
guy who uoload it.
I
f  some of you have the access to the sites who onlined this
translations like the below URLs mentioned by Mr.satyam pujari
below....

http://esploit.blogspot.com/2011/05/psnhack-sony-q.html
http://www.thehackernews.com/2011/05/anonymous-vs-sony-word-by-word-qa-bw.html
-------------------------------------------------------------
....please upload the REAL finished and FULL TEXT translation then!
Which is the one attached in this email and please NOT ALLOWED TO CUT,
MODIFIED or CHANGED it please,

Actually I am still pissing off to know this text is up and online in
a hacker site too..., but anyway, please help me to upload the truth
then.

I compared (diff) my text and the uploaded text and found some slight
differences too, and somehow the translations was cut/ not full in the
middle... and cut at the top..., this is really giving me bad name. To
proof  it  below is the diff of it:

I am now in fukushima and visiting my family who got to moved to
another place to live now, remote connecting to my desktop , its sad
enough for seeing disaster here,
is already hard and please don't make it harder.
