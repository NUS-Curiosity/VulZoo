Package        : qemu-kvm
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0011 CVE-2011-1750 
Debian Bug     : 611134 624177

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in KVM, a solution for full 
virtualization on x86 hardware:

CVE-2011-0011

   Setting the VNC password to an empty string silently disabled
   all authentication.

CVE-2011-1750

   The virtio-blk driver performed insufficient validation of
   read/write I/O from the guest instance, which could lead to
   denial of service or privilege escalation.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze1.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
