 Heap Buffer Overflow in xMatters APClient

Juan, perhaps you could contribute further POC code which shows how far you
can get with this exp?  Plus. xMatters only seems to be used by high level
enterprise users in big corporations, and I can think of 1 other person on
this list that matches this criteria, so the chances of finding someone here
to do this, are slim.
