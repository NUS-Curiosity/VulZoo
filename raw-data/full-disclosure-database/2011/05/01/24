PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOPS (October 17, 2011)
http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2011/preworkshops.shtml

Workshop on Security and Privacy in Smartphones and Mobile Devices (SPSM)
Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as the emerging area, this
workshop intends to provide a venue for interested researchers and
practitioners to get together and exchange ideas, thus to deepen our
understanding to various security and privacy issues on smartphones.
This workshop will seek presentations on a number of topics related to
smartphone security and privacy, including emerging smartphone threats,
rogue mobile application detection, smartphone-centric regulatory compliance
issues and mechanisms, mobile application sandboxing and virtualization, and
others.

Workshop on Scalable Trusted Computing (STC)
ACM STC 2011 focuses on fundamental technologies of trusted and high
assurance computing and its applications in large-scale systems with varying
degrees of trust. The workshop is intended to serve as a forum for
researchers as well as practitioners to disseminate and discuss recent
advances and emerging issues. Topics of interests include but not limited to
fundamental security principles of trusted computing (root of trust, trust
measurement, storage, reporting, and attestation), hardware and software
based trusted computing, architecture and implementation challenges, trusted
computing for cloud, trusted mobile and smartphone devices, trusted emerging
digital infrastructures such as smart grid, power grid, and Internet of
Things, trusted social networks.

Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES)
The need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques has been
widely recognized. This workshop discusses the problems of privacy in the
global interconnected societies and possible solutions. The 2011 Workshop,
held in conjunction with the ACM CCS 2011 conference, is the tenth in a
yearly forum for papers on all the different aspects of privacy in today's
electronic society.  The workshop seeks submissions from academia, industry,
and government presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical
aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded
systems. We encourage submissions from other communities such as law and
business that present these communities' perspectives on technological
issues.

POST-CONFERENCE WORKSHOPS (October 21, 2011)
http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2011/postworkshops.shtml

Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence (AISec)
This workshop is to facilitate an exchange of ideas between these AI and
Security and promote security and privacy solutions that leverage AI
technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to AI-informed
approaches to: Spam and botnet detection, malware identification, insider
threat detection, incentives in security/privacy systems, phishing, and
others.

Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW)
Large-scale computing and cloud-like infrastructures are here to stay.
How exactly they will look like tomorrow is still for the markets to decide,
yet one thing is certain: clouds bring with them new untested deployment and
associated adversarial models and vulnerabilities. It is essential that our
community becomes involved at this early stage. The CCSW workshop aims to
bring together researchers and practitioners in all security aspects of
cloud-centric and outsourced computing

Workshop on Digital Rights Management (DRM)
The ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management is an international forum that
serves as an interdisciplinary bridge between areas that can be applied to
solving the problem of Intellectual Property protection of digital content.
These
include: cryptography, software and computer systems design, trusted
computing, information and signal processing, intellectual property law,
policy-making, as well as business analysis and economics. Its purpose is to
bring together researchers from the above fields for a full day of formal
talks and informal discussions, covering new results that will spur new
investigations regarding the foundations and practices of DRM.

Workshop on Digital Identity Management (DIM)
This workshop will explore crucial issues concerning interoperable identity
management technologies for the information society. With the growing
spectrum of identity-enabled client devices - ranging from electronic ID
cards, smartphones, TV sets, Tablets, PCs all the way to server backend and
cloud services - identity management plays a critical role for the overall
security, privacy and success of the emerging paradigms.  Comprehensive
solutions to digital identity management require addressing multiple
challenges and striking the best balance between usability, security, and
privacy. Existing solutions are not necessarily interoperable or
complementary - and sometimes overlap.  Moreover, they may not integrate
well with the legacy systems that constitute majority of the state of the
art. It is important to lay foundations for a holistic understanding of
problem areas and establish guidelines, methodologies and tools to achieve
interoperability between different solutions to foster healthy progressive
adoption by industries and users. The goal of this workshop is to share the
latest findings, identify key challenges, inspire debates, and foster
collaboration between industries and academia towards interoperable identity
service infrastructures.
