www.compusa.com and www.tigerdirect.com are Akamai'zed.  They play DNS games to
point you at the "nearest" Akamai cache server (technically speaking, they use
the one nearest your DNS resolver).   So for www.compusa.com, it goes something
like this:

www.compusa.com.        60      IN      CNAME   compusa.syx.com.akadns.net.
compusa.syx.com.akadns.net. 300 IN      CNAME   www.compusa.com.edgekey.net.
www.compusa.com.edgekey.net. 300 IN     CNAME   e3531.b.akamaiedge.net.
e3531.b.akamaiedge.net. 20      IN      A       173.223.190.102

(The final akamaiedge.net address will depend on where in the Internet you are)

The fact that bh.georedirector.akadns.net got referenced in the ping most
likely means "Akamai got confused where you are and has no *clue* which cache
is closest to you".
