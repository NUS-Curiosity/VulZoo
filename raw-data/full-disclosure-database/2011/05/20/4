Subject: [framework] Looking for a method to get a PDF
 version of Metasploit Unleashed


 
Hi all,

I'm new and very interested in the Metasploit project.

I'd like to get a PDF version of the Metasploit Unleashed ressource. I've been spending hours on their site and on Hackers for Charity, but I can't help to find out how to get it.

Can anyone help me?


Thanks in advance,
