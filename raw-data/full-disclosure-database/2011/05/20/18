Then just sent an email to FD with a message body of "Hey guys try to
think seriously about possibilities how to avoid this and other shit
that is going on every day.". Not that it wouldn't sound as whining.
Instead you mixed stuff to justify a self-sustained argument.

The point is that the self-sustained argument was already well known
and countless people had worked on it for decades. The SPAM problem is
not new and rendering domain registration a "certified" (omg) process is
both unrealistic and probably not going to fix the root problem at all.

My feeling is that your research would have needed more time and clarity
in order to highlight it's usefulness:

- How it's a useful and novel technique;
- How it can be called efficient (it's not efficient);
- How it protect bots anonymity (it doesn't);
- How it's better than simply sending UDP packets, spoofed or not.

Else for me it's just hype (I mean, read the Subject of the thread:
"New DDoS attack vector"). A deja vu of a Cervantes novel.

I understand your point and disagree, do you understand mine while still
disagreeing?

Cordially,
