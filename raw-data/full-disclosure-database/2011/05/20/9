Subject: WindowsSCOPE hardware analyzer for rootkits?

Has anyone tried this WindowsSCOPE hardware before? The video talks
about how they used it to detect/analyze Shadow Walker rootkit. Also,
seems you can make memory snapshots in time and see how kernel
SSDT/IDT ptrs change, among other things. Also shows colorized
differences in code pages between snapshots.

I heard they are giving away free demo devices to the technical
reviewers that call them up to ask for it. I am somewhat skeptical
though that it is any different than what you can already do with
existing software/hardware tools. Anyone use it before?
