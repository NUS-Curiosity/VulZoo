Subject: Re: New DDoS attack vector

As far as i can tell you are going through a load of trouble to to
create a mail server that will make  a bunch of DNS request.
 * how is this a DDoS if it is just ne server (the mail server
producing all the traffic)
 * Why go to all this trouble when you could just do something like
the following (replacing dig with something faster)
    - while true ; do dig $(</dev/urandom tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c
10 ).example.com MX  ; done
