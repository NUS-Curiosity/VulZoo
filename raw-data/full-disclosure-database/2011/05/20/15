sending a spam campaign does not cost millions on today, right?

please note, that the variable 3rd level bypasses the caching.

imho it's hell about time to do finally something with the point that
somebody at the icann accepts the fact to have a profit from the spam
domain registration and other such things. you can blame me that i am
lame (and this is to all who want to tell that the attack is lame),
but instead of bitching on me, try to think seriously about
possibilities how to avoid this and other shit that is going on every
day. thanks god for all the ppl i've been in touch, we already
discussed some other workarounds. if you want to contribute, you're
welcome.

yes, 14.000 bots took down the DNS server. no kidding! consider that
bot sends spam messages to multiple MX, and they perform a hell of
lookups.
