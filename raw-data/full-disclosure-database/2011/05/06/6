i used APF for years - is pretty good for those without a good grasp of  
iptables.  i personally stopped using it a couple of years ago but i  give props 
to ryan for all the effort he's put into it.  well done.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] rfxn tools.. anyone tried them?

Just came across this:

http://www.rfxn.com/projects/

APF (Advanced Policy Firewall)
BFD (Brute Force Detection)
IRSYNC (Incremental Rsync)
LES (Linux Environment Security)
LMD (Linux Malware Detect)
LSM (Linux Socket Monitor)
NSIV (Network Socket Inode Validation)
PRM (Process Resource Monitor)
SIM (System Integrity Monitor)
SPRI (System Priority)

Anyone tried any of these tools out? Gonna have a play around with them tonight 
:)
