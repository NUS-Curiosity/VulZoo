Subject: Re: Cookiejacking attack technique

Great work!

Technique can be used to stealing any data.
In example, content from remote iframes.
And from any local file, i.e. browser cache, configs and other.

But there is problem to open urls in file:// zone from http:// zone.
Recently i founded Chrome vuln, which provide that.
See https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcm4kmp7_18w8945rdw slides
20-23.

In your work, you say about redirect in IE9, but it is didn't work for me
(9.0.8112.16421).

If it is possible to open file:// from http:// in IE9, then possible to
stealing any local file without user actions :)
