Subject: Re: MySql Password Auditor v1.0 Released

If noone finds a tool to do this, I'd have no problem developing one.
MySQL has to be run with the --log[=filename] option to capture querys,
but the format appears to be quite usable.
I'd appreciate feedback as to whether or not this would be useful.
Have a good one.
