Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.

This advisory is posted at:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110525-iosxrspa.shtml

Affected Products
=================

This vulnerability affects any device that is running Cisco IOS XR
Software Releases 3.9.0, 3.9.1, 3.9.2, 4.0.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, or 4.1.0
and has a SPA interface processor installed.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects all Engine 5 Line Cards on the Cisco XR
12000 Series Routers. The engine 5 line cards are the SIP-600,
SIP-601, SIP-501, and SIP-401.

To determine the Cisco IOS XR Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
show version command-line interface (CLI) command to display the
system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running
Cisco IOS XR Software by displaying text that is similar to "Cisco
IOS XR Software". The software version is displayed after the text
"Cisco IOS XR Software".

The following example identifies a Cisco XR 12000 Series Router that
is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 3.9.1:

To determine if a SPA interface processor is installed in the device,
administrators can log in to the device and issue the show platform
command to display the system line cards. The output confirms that
the device has a SPA interface processor installed by displaying text
that is similar to "L3LC Eng 5".

The following example identifies a Cisco XR 12000 Series Router that
has an Engine 5 Line Card installed:

Details
=======

Cisco IOS XR Software, which is part of the Cisco IOS Software
family, uses a microkernel-based distributed operating system
infrastructure. Cisco IOS XR Software runs on the Cisco CRS, Cisco
12000 Series Routers, and Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services
Routers. This vulnerability only affects the SPA interface processors
on the Cisco 12000 Series Routers that are running affected versions
of Cisco IOS XR Software.

More information on Cisco IOS XR Software is available at the
following link: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps5845/index.html

This vulnerability affects any device that is running affected
releases of Cisco IOS XR Software and has an IPv4 address configured
on any of the SPA interface processor interfaces.

When the SPA interface processor receives specific IPv4 packets
destined for either a network or a network broadcast address of a
configured interface, it will reload and produce an error message
that is similar to what is shown in the example that follows. Transit
traffic through the device does not trigger this vulnerability.

    RP/0/4/CPU0:Example#LC/0/1/CPU0:Apr 26 17:16:31.745 : tx_xbma[85]:
    %L2-E5EGRESSQ-4-INTERRUPT : WIM error: reg 0x200000

Workarounds

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.

Using Infrastructure Access Control Lists (iACLs) may help limit the
attack surface of this vulnerability. Although it is often difficult
to block traffic that transits a network, it is possible to identify
traffic that should never be allowed to target infrastructure devices
and block that traffic at the border of networks. As a network
security best practice, iACLs should be considered a long-term
addition to good network security. Because some of the packets used
in this vulnerability could utilize UDP as a transport, it could be
possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that
permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses.
Unicast RPF should be considered to be used in conjunction to offer a
better mitigation solution.

For more information on iACLs, consult the document "Limit Network
Access with Access Control Lists" at the following location: 
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/CiscoIOSXR.html#19
