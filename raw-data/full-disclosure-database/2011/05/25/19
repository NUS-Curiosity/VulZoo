Subject: Re: Cookiejacking attack technique

Hi Vladimir,
using my approach only files in the Cookies folder can be accessed, being
them cookies or not.
You cannot escape that sandbox.
About IE9 I've tested it on the same version and it works, MS has confirmed
the vuln by the way ;-)
About opening arbitrary files, pay attention to 2 issues:
1- one thing is displaying a file in a frame, a different thing is accessing
them, that's why drag&drop is needed...have a look at my slides ;-)
2- not any file, just files in the cookies folder

regards
Rosario
