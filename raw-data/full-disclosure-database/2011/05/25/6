Subject: Cookiejacking attack technique

Hi,
last week, in two security conferences I showed a new attack technique
called Cookiejacking that allows to steal session cookies without any XSS
vulnerability.

All previous approaches on the same topic used at least an XSS or a Man in
the middle attack (eg Firesheep) to steal cookies.
In this approach I use a 0-day vulnerabilty affecting all versions of IE on
every Windows OS and an advanced Clickjacking attack in order to trick users
in dragging & dropping their cookies.

You can steal any cookie (http only, secure cookies, whatever the website)
of every Win user!

If it is interesting, on my blog you can find a writeup and a couple of
videos.
