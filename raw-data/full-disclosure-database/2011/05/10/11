--------------------------------

The stateless ACLs would not prevent ACK tunneling (http://ntsecurity.nu/papers/acktunneling/). 

Although your infrastructure would be stronger against DDoS attacks, your environment would be more susceptible to covert channels and backdoors. If the organization security concern is mainly availability, I could agree in deploying a packet filter to protect external servers. However, if an external intrusion or sensitive data leakage would cause more damage to the organization's business or reputation, I would not recommend it. Additionally, the organization may have different DMZ's or external networks with different security levels.
