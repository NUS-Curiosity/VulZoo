Or, to paraphrase Sony BMG's (then) Global Digital Business President 
Thomas Hesse*:

   Most people, I think, don't even know what patch management, threat
   assessment or a firewall is, so why should _we_ care about them?

This group of companies clearly has DNA to prevent them from learning. 
Maybe a good reaming by the legal system this time will finally 
penetrate their corporately-ignorant ways?  (And yes, somewhat 
ironically, I am sending this from a Sony laptop...)
