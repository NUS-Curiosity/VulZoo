I agree - You can chalk that one up to the auditors.  There was mention of that in the article, and I too would be interested in what auditing firm signed off on that one.   I too am in the list of people hosed, and it is this type of thing that makes me happy that I practice what I preach when it comes to using a separate card (and account) for internet purchases as well as an assigned PO box.  I'm *really* glad I used a fake birthday, but I do that all the time.  

SONY ORD stock has also dropped 10% since the 26th of April.  Pretty harsh.   This will end up costing everyone quite a bit.
