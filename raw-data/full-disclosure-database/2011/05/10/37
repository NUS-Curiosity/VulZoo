HTTP may be stateless, but the TCP connection isn't.  The purpose for my firewall in front of my web server is that if you get on the box, or can somehow try to initiate an external connection (e.g. SQL injection), you will not be able to do so.  My web server will only respond with return HTTP traffic if the session has already been initiated.  You can't make any outbound connections from it no matter what your source port is.   How is a simple ACL allowing anything from 80 outbound secure?

Which is why we have security in depth.  The old "there are 10 ways to do it anyway so why bother" argument just don't hold water for me.   My above response could easily obviate 5 of those ways, so there is value add.   Your stance of "irrelevant" and "unnecessary" and other superlative postures is far too heavy handed in my opinion - and just because ops likes something doesn't mean it has anything to do with security.  I'm not sure who you are talking to, but no one in my org ever considers a firewall a security panacea, nor any single technology for that matter.

Of course there are firewalls in front of some of these services, and if it is trivial for someone with a small bot to take down the firewall, then someone is not doing their job.

The fact that someone was able to navigate through firewalls speaks to the configuration, not the technology.  Sony actually said they didn't have firewalls, and only had ACLs, so you're point is lost there, I think.
