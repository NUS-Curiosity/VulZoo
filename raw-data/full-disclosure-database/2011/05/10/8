The PCI SSC requires a stateful firewall in front of servers processing credit
card data. Not only to block inbound access to any ports or services
accidentally exposed but the outbound policy must also be default deny to make
it more difficult to exfiltrate stolen data. If you have traffic going out to a
high numbered port and you are not keeping state how do you know if that is a
reply packet to an existing inbound connection or if it is an unauthorized
outbound connection?

Of course, the network should be properly segmented so that only the servers
processing payment data are in-scope. You may be right about not putting a
stateful firewall in front of the gaming servers (in Sony's case).

If you don't have a stateful firewall blocking outbound connections why would
the traffic even have to go through mod_security?
