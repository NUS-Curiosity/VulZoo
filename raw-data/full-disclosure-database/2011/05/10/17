You can if you require authentication, which I do even here at the HoG labs.  Well, except for rules specifically created for other devices such as, ironically, my PS3. :)

Mike Kaeo's presentation is interesting, and certainly has merit where it applies - but saying "stateful firewalls have no place in front of servers" is far too generic of a statement.   There are any number of topological deployment scenarios where firewalls certainly provide security in depth and added security, irrespective of what Mr. Kaeo's opinion on the matter is.  If one can design a secure access model using router ACLs then right on, but that doesn't mean that other models don't work.

I'm unclear as what you mean by "no state to inspect in the first place" in regard to firewalls in front of servers - my TMG box most certainly inspects state when I access assets via the firewall.   I think I know what you really meant by that statement, but can you explain your point a bit more?  I want to make sure I'm not missing something.
