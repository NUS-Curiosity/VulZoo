You use stateless ACLs to filter outbound traffic as well, only allowing traffic originating from required well-known ports to ephemeral high ports.  This is a basic network access policy Best Current Practice (BCP).  'Client-side' traffic originating from the server, such as DNS lookups and so forth, should be channeled through a completely different NIC on a completely different, isolated segment with proxies and so forth.  And all management access should take place via an OOB/DCN management network, on yet another NIC/segment.

And mod_security will pass PCI DSS audits just fine.

As PayPal's head of opsec was quoted recently, PCI DSS is too vague in many places, and is overly-specific in others.  It should be re-factored to an outcomes-based model, IMHO.
