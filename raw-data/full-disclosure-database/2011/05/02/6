TeamSHATTER Security Advisory

April 21, 2011

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
Oracle Enterprise Manager 11g Release 1


Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martinez Fayo of Application Security Inc.

Details:
SQL Injection works by attempting to modify the parameters passed to an application to change the SQL statements that are passed to a database. SQL injection can be used to insert additional SQL statements to be executed.
The 'targetType' parameter used in web page /em/console/target/svclvl/slrule and 'serviceType' parameter used in web page /em/console/target/svclvl/sldetails are vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. These web pages are part of Oracle Enterprise Manager web application that is included with Oracle Database 11g Release 1. It may be possible for a malicious Enterprise Manager user to execute a function with the elevated privileges of the SYSMAN database user in the repository database. This user has the DBA role granted.

Impact:
This vulnerability allows an Oracle Enterprise Manager web user with VIEW (or more) privileges to execute a function call with the elevated privileges of the SYSMAN database user.  This may also be exploited by an attacker that convinces a valid user to click or open a malicious link.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2011 available at Oracle Support.
