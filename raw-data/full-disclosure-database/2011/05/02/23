Subject: ff4 app

Not much of a find, but the firefox4 app for android transmits your google
accounts email/password in plain text when receiving an email from the gmail
application service. This is viewable with the DOM-inspector add-on, and can
also be seen by anyone using wireshark, ettercap, etc.

Still, not much of a (new) risk imo, seeing as you have to already be  on
the users network to sniff the packets.
