Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] XSS in Oracle
	AS Portal 10g

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2010-007
- Original release date: August 11th, 2010
- Last revised:  May 1st, 2011
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 5.0/10 (CVSS Base Scored)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
XSS in Oracle Portal Database Access Descriptor

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Oracle AS Portal is a Web-based application for building and deploying
portals. It provides a secure, manageable environment for accessing
and interacting with enterprise software services and information
resources.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Has been detected a reflected XSS vulnerability in Oracle Application
Server, that allows the execution of arbitrary HTML/script code to be
executed in the context of the victim user's browser.

The code injection is done through the DAD name. A DAD (Database
Access Descriptor) is a set of values that specifies how a database
server should fulfill a HTTP request.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Original request:
http://<oracle-application-server>/portal/pls/<DAD>

Malicious request:
http://<oracle-application-server>/portal/pls/<XSS injection>

Example 1:
http://<oracle-application-server>/portal/pls/"<H1>XSS vulnerability<XSS

In this scenario, the attacker has the difficulty of being unable to
close the HTML tag because he's can not add the character "/" as part
of the code injection (DAD name). However, it is possible to generate
that character without appearing in the injection. Below is an example.

Example 2:
http://<oracle-application-server>/portal/pls/"<img src=""
onmouseover="document.body.innerHTML=String.fromCharCode(60,72,84,77,76,62,60,72,49,62,88,83,83,60,47,72,49,62,32,60,72,50,62,86,85,76,78,60,47,72,50,62);"><XSS

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a targeted
user's browser, this can leverage to steal sensitive information as
user credentials, personal data, etc.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Tested in Oracle Application Server Portal (Oracle AS Portal) 10g,
version 10.1.2. Other versions may be affected too.

VII. SOLUTION
