Subject: Got an iPhone or 3G iPad? Apple is recording your
	moves

All iPhones appear to log your location to a file called
"consolidated.db." This contains latitude-longitude coordinates along
with a timestamp. The coordinates aren't always exact, but they are
pretty detailed. There can be tens of thousands of data points in this
file, and it appears the collection started with iOS 4, so there's
typically around a year's worth of information at this point. Our best
guess is that the location is determined by cell-tower triangulation,
and the timing of the recording is erratic, with a widely varying
frequency of updates that may be triggered by traveling between cells
or activity on the phone itself.
