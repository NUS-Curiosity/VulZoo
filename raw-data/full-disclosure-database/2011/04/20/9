Subject: Vulnerabilities in multiple themes for
	ExpressionEngine

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse
of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities in multiple themes
for ExpressionEngine.

SecurityVulns ID: 11601.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next commercial themes (by WooThemes) for
ExpressionEngine: Fresh News, Inspire, City Guide, Delegate, Optimize,
Bueno, Headlines, Daily Edition, Coffee Break, The Station, Over Easy.

Vulnerable are versions of these themes with TimThumb 1.24 and previous
versions. Besides these themes from WooThemes also can be vulnerable other
themes for ExpressionEngine (with TimThumb) from other developers. The name
of affected script in the themes can be thumb.php or other.

----------
Details:
----------

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08), Full path disclosure (WASC-13), Abuse of
Functionality (WASC-42) and Denial of Service (WASC-10) vulnerabilities are
similar to those in earlier mentioned 90 themes for WordPress and 10 themes
for Drupal. Because these themes contain TimThumb, about vulnerabilities in
which I wrote earlier
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-April/080258.html).

Developers of themes for ExpressionEngine, like developers of themes for
WordPress, Drupal and other engines need to take it into account and attend
to security of their themes.

------------
Timeline:
------------

2011.02.01 - informed developers from WooThemes about holes in their themes
for WordPress.
2011.03.06 - reminded developers from WooThemes that these holes also exist
in their themes for other engines.
2011.03.08 - announced at my site.
2011.04.19 - disclosed at my site.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4985/).
