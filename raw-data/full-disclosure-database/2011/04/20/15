TFA says the researchers searched the android code for a similar
functionality and didn't find it. Doesn't mean it's not there, but since
anyone can git the android repository and look at the source, it's a lot
more likely to *be* found if it did.

While Android doesn't write the info to local storage, there is a lot of
interesting information stored in the debug log (RSSI, etc.) that could
be used to determine a coarse location/track. Get the SDK and put your
phone in USB debug mode and run 'adb logcat -b (whatever)' .. relevant
options documented here :
