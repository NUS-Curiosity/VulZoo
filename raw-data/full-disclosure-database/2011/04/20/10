Vulnerability  : incorrect ACL processing
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1499
Debian Bug     : 621493 

Christoph Martin discovered that incorrect ACL processing in TinyProxy, 
a lightweight, non-caching, optionally anonymizing http proxy could 
lead to unintended network access rights.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-2

We recommend that you upgrade your tinyproxy packages.
