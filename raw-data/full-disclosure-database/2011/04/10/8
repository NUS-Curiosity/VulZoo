You always need \Omega(l) operations to check a value where l is the
number of its significant bits (i.e. of the cert's serial number).
It cannot be less than \Omega(l) because you need to read and consider
every of those significant bits (they would not be really significant if
you did not have to do that).

Any set of values having (at most) l significant bits can be represented
by a bitwise trie whose depth is (at most) l. The presence of any value in
the set can be checked in \O(l) operations.

\Omega(l) + O(l) = \Omega(l).
