Sorry to quote a meme, but

O'RLY???

A week ago an BSc student presented stuff like that at a security
conference in Austria [1], including a Live hack of an "unattended"
iPhone, and Google Maps integration. And that was a students project,
not a self-nominated security "expert".

Honestly, if that's your biggest problem better not look at what the
Softkeypad saves in information...
