I guess context is for the weak, since Android 2.3 (the latest non-3.x
version) source is out (
http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-releases-gingerbread-source-code-i9000),
and the source was also released for all previous versions --
specifically, every version except 3.0. So, it applies to Android 3.0, sure,
but that's the only version it applies to, and Google indicates they will be
releasing source when it's actually finished and ready to be released on all
the platforms Android currently runs on.

Well, considering every version prior is more prevalent than 3.0 is, and
Google will be releasing source... yeah. But keep clutching that teddy-bear
of spiteful vindication that Google didn't release the source code for *one*
version of Android!
