Subject: [USN-1120-1] tiff vulnerability

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1120-1
April 21, 2011

tiff vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

The TIFF library could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

Software Description:
- tiff: TIFF manipulation and conversion tools

Details:

It was discovered that the TIFF library incorrectly handled certain JPEG
data. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially
crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with
user privileges, or crash the application, leading to a denial of service.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libtiff4                        3.9.4-2ubuntu0.4

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libtiff4                        3.9.2-2ubuntu0.7

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make
all the necessary changes.
