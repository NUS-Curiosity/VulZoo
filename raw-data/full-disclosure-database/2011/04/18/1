	updates on Windows Phone

Is there anyone know the further update information regarding to fraudulent
digital certificates for Windows Phone a.k.a Windows Mobile? Anyone know the
microsoft's timeline for the update schedule? Or, any plans??
AFAIK Windows Mobile is still vulnerable to the fraudulent digital
certificates. Or please mock me and proof me wrong.
