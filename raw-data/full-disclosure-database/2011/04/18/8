	Sumner Wind turbine Control SCADA was HACKED

He is crazy. BTW I checked, the BUG in FLP is real. Check it out:

try cisco:cisco on

1) 161.154.232.2 (external FLP IP)
2) 65.14.117.30 (ISP alias)

interface Vlan1578
 ip address 65.14.117.30 255.255.255.252
 load-interval 30
 no clns route-cache

Seems to be that after it he targeted on SCADA objects in internal networks ...
