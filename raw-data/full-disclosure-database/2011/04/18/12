Subject: Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) v1.2 release


New features in this version:
-g              Generate LM & NT Hash.
                Parameters: <password>.
-K              Dump Kerberos tickets to file (unix & 'windows wce' format)
-k              Read Kerberos tickets from file and insert into Windows
cache

Description:
Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) allows to list logon sessions and add,
change, list and delete associated credentials (ex.: LM/NT hashes and
Kerberos tickets). This can be used, for example, to perform
pass-the-hash on Windows, obtain NT/LM hashes from memory (from
interactive logons, services, remote desktop connections, etc.) which
can be used to perform further attacks, obtain Kerberos tickets and
reuse them in other Windows or Unix systems.

WCE v1.2 supports obtaining logon sessions and NTLM credentials just by
reading
memory without performing code injection.

Dumping Kerberos tickets and adding them to the Windows cache was tested
on Windows 7; your feedback is welcome.
