Subject: [USN-1113-1] Postfix vulnerabilities

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1113-1
April 18, 2011

postfix vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 9.10
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

Summary:

An attacker could send crafted input to Postfix and cause it to reveal
confidential information.

Software Description:
- postfix: High-performance mail transport agent

Details:

It was discovered that the Postfix package incorrectly granted write access
on the PID directory to the postfix user. A local attacker could use this
flaw to possibly conduct a symlink attack and overwrite arbitrary files.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2009-2939)

Wietse Venema discovered that Postfix incorrectly handled cleartext
commands after TLS is in place. A remote attacker could exploit this to
inject cleartext commands into TLS sessions, and possibly obtain
confidential information such as passwords. (CVE-2011-0411)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  postfix                         2.7.1-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  postfix                         2.7.0-1ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 9.10:
  postfix                         2.6.5-3ubuntu0.1

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  postfix                         2.5.1-2ubuntu1.3

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS:
  postfix                         2.2.10-1ubuntu0.3

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
