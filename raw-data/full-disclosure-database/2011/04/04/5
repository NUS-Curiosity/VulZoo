Subject: [HITB-Announce] HITBSecConf2011 - Malaysia Call
	for Papers Now Open

The Call for Papers for the 9th annual HITBSecConf in Malaysia is now
open! The event takes place from the 10th - 13th of October at the new
Intercontinental Kuala Lumpur.

As always the first two days will be dedicated to hands on technical
training sessions followed by a 2-day quad track conference featuring
keynote speaker Kenneth Geers (CCD CoE) and Jennifer Granick (Attorney,
Zwilinger Genetski LLP).

This years conference will also feature a brand new attack-only Capture
The Flag - Tower of Hackf00 Madness, an updated lock picking village set
up and run by members from TOOOL US (now includes impressioning!), an
industry exhibition and technology showcase and last but not least the
HITB Labs and SIGINT sessions.

==

As always, talks that are more technical or that discuss new and never
before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has
been covered several times before.

Submissions are due _no later than 15th July 2011_
