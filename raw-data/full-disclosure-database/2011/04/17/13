You're welcome to go ahead and break into a house, and use the excuse "but the
door facing the street was unlocked".  Let is know if the judge is amused.

Most of the applicable statutes are worded in such a way that the "but it was
wide open and unsecured" claim won't do any good, as they are phrased in terms
of "exceeding authorized access".  You go in knowing you don't have an
authorized access code, you're screwed.  Oh, and many of the statutes *do not*
include "intent" in them.  So whether you're a black hat doing something evil,
or a white hat investigating so you can tell them they have a problem, you're
still in trouble.
