I suspect this case closer to: you walk into an Office Depot, which is
OK, and then pass through a door, which although unlocked, has an
"Eployees Only" sign on it.  You'll have a hard time arguing in court that
www.fpl.com and scada.fpl.com are both "open to the public" by design.

On top of that, you *can* get yourself busted for trespassing in an Office
Depot, if you insist on doing stuff like ignoring the "No Soliciting" sign, paying
an inordinate amount of interest in their security cameras and alarm systems,
and otherwise being present with absolutely no plans to conduct commerce.
