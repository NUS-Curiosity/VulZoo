Hi All,
Here we are with our 15th Issue of CHMag. March witnessed the launch
of the much awaited Mozilla Firefox 4 so we dedicated this issue to
Mozilla. Due to overwhelming response of "Call For Articles", we have
good number of articles and so we will continue with same theme for
May issue.

For articles checkout:- http://chmag.in
The PDF version can be downloaded from:-  http://chmag.in/issue/apr2011.pdf

In April issue we have the following articles:-
Tech Gyan - Mozilla Firefox Internals & Attack Strategies
Tool Gyan - FireCAT
Mom's Guide - Being Invisible on the Internet
Legal Gyan - The Information Technology Rules, 2011
Command Line Gyan - Configuring Apache SSL
Matriux Vibhag - Introduction Part 2
Poster of the month - Happy and Safe Surfing.

Thanks,
Abhijeet Patil,
Team ClubHack
