Subject: Re: Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) Fort
 Sumner Wind turbine Control SCADA was HACKED

My guess is that irrespective of accuracy, validity, intent, or disposition, someone at the FBI, etc. is already investigating this and is viewing it as encouraging the exploitation of SCADA/nuclear facilities, and that it in itself will be treated as an act of terrorism (regardless of that being right or wrong).

I wouldnâ€™t be surprised at all if we hear about someone getting their little pee-pee spanked for this.

Nothing illegal has happened then, the dude is just highlighting his access hadn't been taken away and has decided to pretend he hacked the system as some sort of prank.

I hope this is the case and is the most likely thing to have happened.

Or, maybe this is the real thing.
