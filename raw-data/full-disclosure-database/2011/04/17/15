I was thinking more along the lines of an Office Depot, Sports
Authority, Verizon Wireless, etc - public businesses which
automatically open the sliding glass doors for you. I don't expect
these businesses to claim a 'comparison shopper' was trespassing after
the fact.

One cannot know these things for all public IP addresses 'a priori'.
If the network is not meant to be accessed, it should not be
advertising services, or it should be on a leased line.

Anonymous logins are available for many services - for example, FTP
and WWW. Its a mainstay of the internet, and has been so for many
years.

Intent has nothing to do with using public services (I'm not sure how
to articulate it as a legal argument - sorry). If they are available
and used, don't complain after the fact. If a company does not want
them used, they should not advertise the service, or they should
purchase a leased line.
