Subject: Vulnerabilities in multiple themes for Drupal

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse
of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities in multiple themes
for Drupal.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next commercial themes (by WooThemes) for Drupal: Fresh
News, Inspire, Spectrum, Delegate, Optimize, Bueno, Headlines, Daily
Edition, Coffee Break, The Gazette Edition.

Vulnerable are versions of these themes with TimThumb 1.24 and previous
versions. Besides these themes from WooThemes also can be vulnerable other
themes for Drupal (with TimThumb) from other developers (and there are many
such themes). If in themes from WooThemes the file called thumb.php, then in
other themes other file names can be used, timthumb.php in particular.

----------
Details:
----------

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08), Full path disclosure (WASC-13), Abuse of
Functionality (WASC-42) and Denial of Service (WASC-10) vulnerabilities are
similar to those in earlier mentioned 90 themes for WordPress from two
developers. Because these themes contain TimThumb, about vulnerabilities in
which I wrote earlier
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-April/080258.html).

------------
Timeline:
------------

2011.02.01 - informed developers from WooThemes about holes in their themes
for WordPress.
2011.03.05 - announced at my site.
2011.03.06 - reminded developers from WooThemes that these holes also exist
in their themes for other engines.
2011.04.16 - disclosed at my site.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4982/).
