Subject: Launched DirectoryScanner - Free Directory Server
	fingerprinting tool

Hi all,

We have released new tool -   DirectoryScanner -  Free Directory Server
fingerprinting tool. It can help you to remotely detect the type of
Directory servers (such as Microsoft Active Directory, Novell eDirectory,
Open LDAP etc) running on the local network as well as on Internet.

Also it can be used in penetration testing while evaluating client
environments where multiple Directory servers are deployed. In addition to
this, it can greatly help administrators to remotely keep tab on Directory
Servers running in their network.
