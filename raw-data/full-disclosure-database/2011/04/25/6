Hi Steven Pinkham,

I think this is an old questions that have been answered. You can make
settings in Pangolin main panel.

"Edit->Setting->Oracle", Change the "Remote Data URL" and "Remote Info URL"
as you wish. Exit pangolin and run it again to take effects.

Here is example settings

Wish you guys happy.

BEST REGARDS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY

I tried Pangolin 2.5.2 and the latest one. No data will be transfered to the
server you mentioned in "

Why don't you trust your eyes and try this one?

Does it still steal your exploit details without asking?

I think I'll stick with sqlmap, thanks.
