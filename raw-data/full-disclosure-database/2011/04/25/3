OK let have a bash - literally.

Hmm this shows the URLs used to pass data and call SWF apps used to run md5 cracks etc.
A trace from a vm shows DNS request and a post to oracle_data and a get from oracle_info etc.
I mean how clueless do you have to be to not encode the URL's so even a dumbass strings can
find them?

OK, anyone who actually uses a tool like this (in a windows box) is pretty dumb anyway especially as the
data seems to end up in shenzhen,Guangdong - deffo not omewhere to trust your data goign to.

Thankfully work blocks all incoming and outgoing .cn traffic!

It seems the app tries to crack local password files as well - via a remote (chineese) system - not exactly nice...
