18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2011)
CALL FOR PAPERS
OCTOBER 17 - 21, 2011
SWISSOTEL Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA 
http://sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2011

The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference is
a leading international forum for information security researchers,
practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas
and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The
conference seeks submissions from academia, government, and industry
presenting novel research on all practical and theoretical aspects
of computer and communications security. Papers should have relevance to
the construction, evaluation, application, or operation of secure
systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing argument for the
practical significance of the results. All topic areas related to computer
and communications security are of interest and in scope. Accepted papers
will be published by ACM Press in the conference proceedings. Outstanding
papers will be invited for possible publication in a special issue of
the ACM Transactions on Information and System Security.

Paper Submission Process

Submissions must be made by the deadline of May 6, 2011, through the
website: 

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ccs2011

The review process will be carried out in two phases and authors will
have an opportunity to comment on the first-phase reviews.  Authors will
be notified of the first-phase reviews on Monday, June 20, 2011 and can
send back their comments by Thursday, June 23, 2011.

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference
or workshop. Simultaneous submission of the same work is not allowed.

Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be
presented at the conference.

Paper Format

Submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (note:
pages must be numbered) excluding the bibliography and well-marked
appendices, and at most 12 pages overall. Submissions must NOT be
anonymized. Only PDF or Postscript files will be accepted. Submissions
not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of
their merits.

Tutorial Submissions

Proposals for long (3-hour) and short (1.5-hour) tutorials on research
topics of current and emerging interest should be submitted electronically
to the tutorials chair by May 24, 2011. The guidelines for tutorial
proposals can be found on the website.
