Heh -- did anyone else just get spammed by these jokers?

In any case: even if you change this setting where they tell you to, does
the code actually honor the change or is it just a farce for the user's
benefit? And, perhaps more importantly, why should I have to grab it,
blindly trust it and run it to find out?

Besides even that, assuming the change was actually honored, how would one
go about creating a page that would work with it?
