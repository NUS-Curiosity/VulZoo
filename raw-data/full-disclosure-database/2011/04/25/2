I tried Pangolin 2.5.2 and the latest one. No data will be transfered to the 
server you mentioned in 
"http://laramies.blogspot.com/2009/05/pangolin-and-your-data.html"

Why don't you trust your eyes and try this one?

Does it still steal your exploit details without asking?

I think I'll stick with sqlmap, thanks.
