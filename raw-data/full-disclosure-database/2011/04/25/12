In the example you cite, those functions are contracted out to private 
parties (e.g., EZPass) in virtually 100% of the cases, at least in the US. 
Even if that was not true, why do you assume that a government employee 
would never capture and sell that information to another party for 
personal gain? Because government employees as a group have proven to be 
so virtuous, honest, and incorruptible?

i'm more worried about private parties tracking these days...  say set up 
high res cameras with a good view 
of the major highways and scan all of the license plates.
