This made me larf :-)

I wonder if peter(address redacted) is told ;-

  1) when email is blackholed like this
     given the amount of "rudeness" on FD, I suspect he never gets to see two thirds of the posts :-)
  2) that his email address is given out in bounces - nasty bit of a disclosure...

Given the reply-to: is in the headers and the email did not come from
my addr but originated from the FD listserver, this is open to abuse
and could easily be used to flood some poor sods mailserver with what would seem
"untraceable" bouncebacks.

evidently du and mba then ss is profane enough to block email and let me find valid addresses on a mailing list.
