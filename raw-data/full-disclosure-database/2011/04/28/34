Who cares?  You got code executed on the remote box, that's the *hard* part.
Use that to inject a callback shell or something, use *that* to get yourself a shell
prompt.  At that point, download something else that exploits you to root - if
you even *need* to, as quite often the Good Stuff is readable by non-root
users.
