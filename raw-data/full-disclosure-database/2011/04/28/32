Tomorrow Barracuda gets pwned and this turns into a cascade failure.

Oh wait, that happened two weeks ago:

Let's be careful though: just because your system stopped working 
doesn't mean it has a backdoor. It could have been implemented as simply 
a periodic "phone home for updates" which received some type of 
"license expired" message. A remote kill switch, for sure, but not 
necessarily the same as a back door.

It raises the question though of how many companies have that particular 
combination of ethics and self-discipline to implement one and not the 
other. It sometimes takes extra work to build a product that performs 
security functions in a customer's network without granting yourself 
unnecessary privilege on that network.

As we saw with RSA SecurID, many admins didn't realize that the vendor 
might be keeping a copy of the keys. Sites with products on their 
networks may want to consider if Barracuda as an external vendor falls 
under the scope of their PCI requirements.
