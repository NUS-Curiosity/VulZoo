 Heap Buffer Overflow in xMatters APClient

This isn't a zero day. This is a vulnerability. Being able to crash
the system is nothing compared to the effort needed to actually write
the exploit. What function is the heap overflow in? Did you guys even
bother to find out? How do I know this is even a heap overflow? Heck
you couldnt even overwrite a single register! How effective are
standard mitigations on the target? Are there even any?(if there isnt
and you couldnt overwrite a single reg theres something wrong with
you).

Cool fuzz story bro, tell it again, but a quick fuzz doesn't drop zero
days. A smart exploit WRITER drops zero days.

Come back once you stop being an amateur.
