OK... That's hardly surprising, given the high-quality software engineering
that Barracuda is known for.. ;)

And I should believe this claim, why?

Strong claims require strong evidence.  It's well-known that Barracuda turns
off subscription services if you don't pay - and even charges you back coverage
for years you skipped.  See the thread starting here:

http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2011-April/035067.html

Now the question is - given that *that* Barracuda was at least semi-functional
even when off support, do we have any indication that your unit was in fact
intentionally disabled?  It could very well be the symptoms you are seeing are
the unit being just plain *broken*.
