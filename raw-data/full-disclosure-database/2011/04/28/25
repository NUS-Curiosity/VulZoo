Why is everyone ripping on this fellow just because he chose to
purchase a 'solution'? That's not the issue here at all. Sure he
should've done something more custom and open source, but that doesn't
change the fact that Barracuda has done something likely bad here. A
vendor should make it explicitly clear when they have the capability
to disable remote products that have already been purchased. Maybe
their ToS allows it, maybe not. Either way it is highly unethical.
