Subject: Requesting/Reserving CVE Question

Hello all,

First off, if this isn't the place to ask this question, I apologize, and
feel free to ignore this e-mail.  

I've found a couple vulnerabilities in a web forum/portal/etc. product
called IP.Board.  I was looking to reserve a CVE number, and I attempted to
contact the address Mitre lists for reserving one, however, it's been
nearly a month and I have not received anything back from them.  This is
the first vulnerability I have found, and have never requested/reserved a
CVE before, so I am a little unfamiliar with the process (although based
off of the following website, it looks like all I need to do is send an
e-mail to them - http://cve.mitre.org/cve/obtain_id.html).  

I've sent follow up e-mails and I've received no response.  What my
question to you all is how long does this process take?  Is there something
else that should be done, or someone else the request should be sent to? 
What's time normal time frame from requesting a CVE number to hearing back
from them?

Thanks for any help/info/advice.  I appreciate it.

Chris
