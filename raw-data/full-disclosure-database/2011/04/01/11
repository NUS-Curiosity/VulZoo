Come on guys!! I think they are not trying to reinvent the wheel here!

As far as i can remember they never said they created a new product
better than msf (or the other tools you mentioned) they packed a bunch
of really good tools and made it easier to those who dont like using
console, or complicated things...  they also have some own native
exploits

BTW, do you guys always use your time for replying to all the threads
you dont like?? What a waste of time!

I tried it and i think it is really usefull, thumbs up for insect pro!!

Cheers :D
