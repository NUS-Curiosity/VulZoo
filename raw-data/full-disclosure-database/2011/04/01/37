Subject: Re: INSECT Pro 2.5 Release - Web scanner tool

Actually, when the tool was originally released it wasn't "free" (strings
attached or not), but they tried to charge $500 per license as a closed
source product.

So at any rate some people have been complaining over and over for the use
of the word "free" since version 2.0.

BTW I do not mind people making yet another UI for Metasploit, but this
"free but not free" thing creates a dishonest image that could have easily
been avoided by following the same practice every other donationware
follows: let users download it freely and decide whether to donate or not
based on their experience with the software.
