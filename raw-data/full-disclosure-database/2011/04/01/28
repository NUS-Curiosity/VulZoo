Yes i do agree with you! everybody can comment and disagree as much as
they wish.... what I am trying to say is that there is a bunch of
people that always complains about the same things that have been
already answered, if you decided you don't like the tool just don't
use it and find a better one, at least that is what i usually do. I
read the same people saying the same things that have been said when
the tool was released (1.0)
