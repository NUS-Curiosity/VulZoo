MustLive - just for the record, no one cares about who you blacklist or not.  No one cares who anyone blacklists.   If you blacklist someone, but then go out of your way to publically tell everyone else that you've blacklisted them, you sound like a 12 year old yelling last words at someone from behind their mommy's door before they slam it. 

Just add them and be done with it...

Hello Valdis!

The one thing which John didn't missed for sure it's to get into my blacklist. As I already informed him earlier this day.

Because it's what I always do with e-mails of not serious people. And I drew attention to it many times last year, but maybe John missed it or just forgot :-). But from today he'll be certainly know it.

>>From other side, it's possible that he's celebrating April Fools' Day 
>all
year long ;-). In any case we'll wish him good luck in celebrating the 1st of April - his favorite and professional holiday.

Best wishes & regards,
