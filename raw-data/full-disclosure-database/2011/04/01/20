ZDI-11-041: (0day) Multiple Browser Node Processing Stack Overflow Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-911

April 1, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-C000-00FD

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft
Google
Mikul
Apple
ISC

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Internet Explorer
Google Chrome
Mikul Links
Apple Safari
ISC Lynx

-- Vulnerability Details:
Multiple vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to remotely terminate
mission critical web applications on vulnerable installations of Apple
Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mikul Links, and ISC
Lynx. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that
the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaws exists within the handling of node attributes, specifically
nodes with large quantities of attributes or large values within such
nodes. When handling these objects, several functions are called
recursively for each value provided defined within. The functions use a
shared memory region referred to internally as the stack. The size of
the stack is not properly verified during processing which can result in
the consumption of all the its available address space. This process is
extremely exhausting for the application and it cannot continue
functioning. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
terminate web applications under the context of the Internet.

-- Vendor Response:
Vendors claimed to be unable to respond due to unexpected browser termination upon accessing web form.
