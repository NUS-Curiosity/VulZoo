Hello Valdis!

The one thing which John didn't missed for sure it's to get into my
blacklist. As I already informed him earlier this day.

Because it's what I always do with e-mails of not serious people. And I drew
attention to it many times last year, but maybe John missed it or just
forgot :-). But from today he'll be certainly know it.

>>From other side, it's possible that he's celebrating April Fools' Day all
year long ;-). In any case we'll wish him good luck in celebrating the 1st
of April - his favorite and professional holiday.

Best wishes & regards,
MustLive
