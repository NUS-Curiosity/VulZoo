+1.

I've come across countless companies who had idiotic technical directors who
didn't even want you speaking up in meetings about how bad their network
was, let alone in public.

A lot of it comes down to pride/image, if someone starts questioning their
job worth, they get all pissy about it, plus a lot of people find it
*extremely* difficult to take constructive criticism and/or advice
within their own remit.

Personally, I'm completely honest and open when I fuck something up. If a
clients network goes down cos I accidently plugged a 12v cable tester into
core switch gear causing a site wide telecoms outage for 20 minutes (lol),
I'll come right out and say "Yeah, I did bad.". Where as most people try and
cover it up.

Different scenario, but same principle.
