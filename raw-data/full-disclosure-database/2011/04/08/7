Thank you all, guys!

Valdis, Cal,

I'm almost there. ;)

Here're some more examples:

dummy@...mple.com GGobQ2bsqd64PXVAmaDiDBg=
eummy@...mple.com GWobQ2bsqd64PXVAmaDiDBg=
dummy@...mple.co  GGobQ2bsqd64PXVAmaDiDA==
dummy@...mple.@ex GGobQ2bsqd64PXVAmaDBBg0=
dummy             GGobQ2Y=
dumm              GGobQw==
eummy             GWobQ2Y=
eumm              GWobQw==
example.com       GWcXQ2/AqYi6P2g=
dxample.com       GGcXQ2/AqYi6P2g=
11111@...mple.com TS5HHy7sqd64PXVAmaDiDBg=
11111             TS5HHy4=

Looks like a base64+xor, am I right? And that's enough information for me. 
:)

Thanks again!
