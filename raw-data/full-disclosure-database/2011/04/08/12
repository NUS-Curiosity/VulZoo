Package        : x11-xserver-utils
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0465
Debian bug     : 621423

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the xrdb utility of x11-xserver-utils,
a X server resource database utility, is not properly filtering crafted
hostnames.  This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges given that either remote logins via xdmcp are allowed or
the attacker is able to place a rogue DHCP server into the victims network.


The oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3+6.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.5+3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.6+2.


We recommend that you upgrade your x11-xserver-utils packages.
