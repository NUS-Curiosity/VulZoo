Yes, it is looking like a fixed key stream XORed with the plaintext.
Note that this could mean they're using any number of "good"
encryption algorithms (block cipher in OFB mode, stream cipher) with a
fixed IV.  This means the encryption is very broken, but it doesn't
necessarily mean they are using some half-baked custom obfuscation
technique.  They could be, but be careful with your accusations.

HTH,
