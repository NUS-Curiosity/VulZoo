Well, if you take a secret key of 7C 1F 76 2E 1F AC CC A6 D9 50 05 2C
FC 8E 81 63 75(hexed code of a string of binary), xor it with
dummy@...mple.com and base64 the result you will get the exact result
described. With another string+result I could probably tell you if its
for sure. I used a simple python script I used for a simple decryption
challenge on a site for this.
