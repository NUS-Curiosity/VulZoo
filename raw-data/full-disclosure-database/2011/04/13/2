It certainly did when I first reported that URL back in Sep 2007.

A far from exhaustive bit of testing just now shows that it appears 
that Google is doing a Referer check on just those search terms (not 
just on the order), as you can do an "I'm feeling Lucky" search _from 
Google_ for those terms and get auto-redirected to the top search 
result, but if you just hit one of those search URLs with the IFL flag, 
you get the search results rather than an auto-redirect.

Did you think to try some less well-publicized URL abusing this 
functionality?

I wonder which other (if any) IFL abuse URLs that have been used in 
spam, scams and such Google blocks?
