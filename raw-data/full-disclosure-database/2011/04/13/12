Hmm, you shouldn't have had a parse error, this is a chunk of obfuscated js
that we currently have in production :s May I ask what the parse error was
and which browser? I've just checked it in ff/chrome/ie and it worked fine..
(assuming you've loaded in the jquery libs lol)

Other than a parse error? Nothing.
