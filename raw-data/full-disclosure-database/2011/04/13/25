Tough note to communicate today: Automattic had a low-level (root)
break-in to several of our servers, and potentially anything on those
servers could have been revealed.

We have been diligently reviewing logs and records about the break-in to
determine the extent of the information exposed, and re-securing avenues
used to gain access. We presume our source code was exposed and copied.
While much of our code is Open Source, there are sensitive bits of our and
our partners' code. Beyond that, however, it appears information disclosed
was limited.

Based on what we've found, we don't have any specific suggestions for our
users beyond reiterating these security fundamentals:

* Use a strong password, meaning something random
(https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm)  with numbers and punctuation.
* Use different passwords for different sites.
* If you have used the same password on different sites, switch it to
something more secure.

(Tools like 1Password (http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password) ,
LastPass (http://lastpass.com/) , and KeePass (http://keepass.info/)  make
it easy to keep track of different unique logins.)

Our investigation into this matter is ongoing and will take time to
complete. As I said above, we've taken comprehensive steps to prevent an
incident like this from occurring again. If you have any questions or
concerns, please leave a comment below or contact our support
(http://en.support.wordpress.com/contact/) .
