 Heap Buffer Overflow in xMatters APClient

Precisely. The poc triggers the bug by passing a very long command line
argument, so it's assumed the attacker already has executed code. The only
way this is exploitable is if the binary has suid (then the attacker can
elevate privileges) or the command can be executed remotely (and the
attacker additionaly cannot execute any other commands, but can mysteriously
control the arguments). Unless either scenario is researched (and nothing in
the advisory tells me so) I call bullshit.
