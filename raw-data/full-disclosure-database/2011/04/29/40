FWIW, exact same weakness confirmed in Linksys AG241v1 with firmware
1.00.23 (the AG241 is the same animal as the WRT54G but without the
WiFi).

I don't suppose Cisco will ever release updates to address
vulnerabilities in these products, simple (and cost-effective for
customer goodwill) though it would be.
