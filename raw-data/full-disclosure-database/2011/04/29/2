For starters, every anti-spam company ever.  I should know, I've worked for half of them.  At the very least you cannot get upgrades or patches of any kind.  Most of them disable anti-spam updates, all of them disable anti-virus updates, and some even disable anti-spam scanning entirely.  The anti-spam SaaS vendors I know of will disable accepting your mail after a grace period if you haven't moved your MX records.

Hmm, let's see.  Firewall vendors won't let you apply updates, some of them cripple VPN functionality when your license has expired... really, do we need to go on?  There's a long precedent for products going into a degraded mode if your subscription or license expires.
