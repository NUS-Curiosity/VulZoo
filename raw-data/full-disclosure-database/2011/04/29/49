The funnier with that thread, is that if you tell us that as a normal  
user, then that mean that you are a local admin, and most of user must  
be local admin if they sent that policy to everyone. Kinda a security  
issue just there, the computer name is just not important. who care  
your computer name when netbios traffic stay local on your lan. (ex,  
your co-worker must already know your name, i hope so)
