Subject: Computer name should match with your real
	identity?

Hi,

Recently got a policy from admin to change your PC name with your "name" +
organisation name.

I am not doing it for a long time as I feel it could be case of
"information leakage" .

So need any ref./case study/security policy referencing not to have real
name .
