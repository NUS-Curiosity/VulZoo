Regardless of whether they are given access or not, the major concern isn't
that, but rather whether they *can* or *can't*. Subpoena or not, they *can*
get to the server - and everyone knows this.
On the other hand, having a browser, devise or anything keep logs away from
prying eyes, is a completely different problem altogether.
Personally, I'd rather everyone that keeps a log also warns people about it
(like how CCTV should be), than hassling over whether police should be given
personal info or not (not saying the latter is unimportant).

As they say, knowledge is power. Knowing what someone knows / could know
about you doubles the points.
