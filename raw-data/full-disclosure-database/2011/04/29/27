Subject: Re: Barracuda backdoor

Everything you have mentioned there are when you have 'leased' a product, so
if the license runs out, of course it's going to terminate those 'leased'
services.

However, I was under the assumption that the OP had purchased the Barracuda
outright from a reseller, and the license was just a piracy check? Am I
mistaken OP??
