-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Data Protector. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

This specific flaw exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe).
The Backup Client Service listens on TCP port 5555 for communications
between systems in the cell. The process has insufficient bounds
checking on user-supplied data in a fixed-length buffer on the stack.
Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by
sending malformed omniiaputil message packets to the target, which could
ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the
SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
