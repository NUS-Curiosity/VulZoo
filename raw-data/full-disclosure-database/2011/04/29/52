In some scenarios (HTTP/s protocols), SIEGE might be a nice tool!

I have generated around 4G of attack using Hping from 6 servers, and I could have still increased it but that was all I needed. So I think hping does good job..

I've been using a combination of Mausezahn ( http://www.perihel.at/sec/mz/index.html ), Tcpreplay ( http://tcpreplay.synfin.net ) and some times Scapy ( http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/ ) for our 1G/10G network stress testing needs ( mostly for probing and checking the resilience of new network appliances ). 

I noted that these tools were not updated recently (for one year aprox). Do you guys have any suggestions on better approaches / really good new tools to do this? ( note that currently our budget does not allow the use of hardware based solutions ).
