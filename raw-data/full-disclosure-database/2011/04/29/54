Internal NETBIOS/DNS names are generally helpful for identification of
machines, and most places follow some soft of template of
location+type+model+serial .. just so the IT department doesn't have to
figure out some UNIX admin's scheme-de-jour of colors/gods/planets/whatever.

Really .. what's easier to find the location/function of .. the machine
named CORPHQWWWDEV1 or the one named "Aristotle".
