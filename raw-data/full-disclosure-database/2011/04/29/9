This is one of those places where details count.  In some jurisdictions, LEO's
get access upon request.  In other places, LEO's get access upon subpoena
signed by a judge.  And in some places with wishy-washy spineless providers,
LEO's legally need a subpoena, but get access upon request anyhow. We'll just
skip over the whole US "National Security Letter" thing and pretend it's just a
hallucination. ;)

The *real* problem is if you're in a jurisdiction like Michigan, which seems to
think it's OK to hoover all the data out of electronic devices at a traffic stop.
