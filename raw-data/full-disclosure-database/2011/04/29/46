-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Borland Interbase. Authentication is not
required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

The specific flaws exists within the database service, ibserver.exe,
which binds to TCP port 3050. When a specially crafted "connect" (opcode
0x01) message is sent a stack-based buffer overflow can occur. If
properly exploited this can lead to remote compromise of the system with
SYSTEM credentials.
