 Heap Buffer Overflow in xMatters APClient

Im with ya there, Insect is a joke... i mean, open src tools, sure, we can
use those... but, a non open src, non free tool,. being posted ATALL
surprises me.. so, why berat up on him ? your lame app missed shit, simple..
even if your a good coder, does not mean YOUR product will 'rule'.
Sorry but, ichib0d, is in the right, he should -not- be flamed for his
willingness to participate, in something wich most lister's agree with..
your the minority here sherlock.. trying to sell an app, on FD... whats
next!
xd
