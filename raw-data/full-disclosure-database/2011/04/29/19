Subject: Re: Barracuda backdoor

fwiw, I've run into a Barracuda instance that had an ssh connection (reverse
shell) open to an address in XO address space.  The user (owner of the Barracuda)
indicated that it was expected, as it was how they were getting support through 
the company.  Not sure I'd permit that without a real demonstration of value and
assurances of limits on that access.

As to what changes they can make when or why, I have no idea.  No matter what
the case, it's always hard for me to trust a vendor when it comes down to production
services.
