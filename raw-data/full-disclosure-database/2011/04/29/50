Subject: Re: 
	Code Execution vulnerability Ð² WordPress

Just for your (and everyone else's) information, Wordpress allows
Administrators to Edit Template code, as you may or may not know, is nothing
but plain PHP code.
Besides, Wordpress can be made to upload rogue addons (under this same
role), among many other things malicious Administrators might want to do.

At this point I don't think it makes the least sense to call such a feature
a vulnerability, not because it's not exploitable, but because of the simple
reason that when you're dead you should call it quits and stop fcking
pretending nothing happened to you. If that didn't hit, let me state it
plain and simple, if your server is compromised, there are ZERO reasons you
would want the attacker to not be able to install plugins simply because it
can't be done.

Yes, I'm in a mode and simply can't student clueless idiots trying to make
headlines with fancy irrelevant titles.

While at it, MustLive, here's a clue, PHP is one huge exploit; it can run
code(oh noes)!!
