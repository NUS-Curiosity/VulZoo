Every appliance I've ever heard of or sold personally is sold, as in ownership is transferred.  The physical unit belongs to the party who purchased it.  The continuing fees or subscriptions cover:

EIther/both.  In the case of VM, customer generally pays a one-time license for the right to run a VM (in perpetuity).  A few were sold based on size of the pre-configured VM (disk space, vCPUs, etc), but my understanding is most of those are transitioning to a perpetual VM license scheme (due to the obvious fact that customers can change the virtual hardware).

If you don't like remote support from vendor, ask them how to disable it.  If you don't believe them, block all the egress traffic and look at the firewall logs to see where it's sending SYNs.  Almost any product these days needs to download updates, but you should be able to tell the difference between downloading updates and opening reverse shells.  I don't know of any vendors yet who do their shell over HTTPS (although it would make sense if you want it to be covert, ssh really stands out).
