Subject: [USN-1115-1] language-selector vulnerability

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1115-1
April 19, 2011

language-selector vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10

Summary:

Local users could gain root access via the language-selector.

Software Description:
- language-selector: Language selector for Ubuntu Linux

Details:

Romain Perier discovered that the language-selector D-Bus backend did not
correctly check for Policy Kit authorizations. A local attacker could exploit
this to inject shell commands into the system-wide locale configuration file,
leading to root privilege escalation.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  language-selector-common        0.6.7

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
