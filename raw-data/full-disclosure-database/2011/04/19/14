Dear Sir, I would very much like to be a partner and I think this is an exceptional product that not only offers more than what is already available in the open source community but it is also very well marketed.

Would you be willing to wave the initial "Donations Appreciated" hurdle to becoming a partner?Â  Also, some time ago I ordered your product (I think back when it was "free" but it wasn't, or something, yawn) and I never did get a nifty box like the one depicted in your image.

Kind Regards,
John "I see what you did there" Jacobs
