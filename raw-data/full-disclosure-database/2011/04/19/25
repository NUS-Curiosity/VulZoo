Subject: [USN-1117-1] PolicyKit vulnerability

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1117-1
April 19, 2011

policykit-1 vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 9.10

Summary:

Local users could gain root access by using the pkexec tool in PolicyKit.

Software Description:
- policykit-1: framework for managing administrative policies and privileges

Details:

Neel Mehta discovered that PolicyKit did not correctly verify the user
making authorization requests. A local attacker could exploit this to
trick pkexec into running applications with root privileges.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libpolkit-backend-1-0           0.96-2ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:

Ubuntu 9.10:
  libpolkit-backend-1-0           0.94-1ubuntu1.1

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.
