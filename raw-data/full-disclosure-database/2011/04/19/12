Subject: Insect Pro - Looking for partners

Insect Pro is actively looking for partners to expand the frontiers of
Insect Pro and grow our penetration testing tool at a competitive
level worldwide.

We are located in Argentina and we are currently two developers with
low-level knowledge and desire to make a profitable business.

We need a company to be our economic support so we can work full time
to the development of the tool.

Please contact us to jsacco@...ecurityresearch.com with the proposal.

By phone at +541144334778 or 549111534303024
