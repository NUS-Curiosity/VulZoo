 Description
_______________

Up.time Systems Management software is used by over 700 customers
worldwide to manage, measure and monitor mission-critical server
performance and maintain IT service availability.

Up.Time performs systems management and monitoring on remote machines
via the Up.Time Agent which runs on each system. All agents are
controlled and managed through a central web administration interface
which runs on TCP port 9999.

_______________

 Details
_______________

One of the pages included in the admin interface contains a function
designed to set the administrator password when the interface is loaded for
the first time. After this task has been completed the code which processes
this request is left in the page. 

By sending a specially crafted request a remote attacker can abuse this
functionality to bypass the servers authentication mechanism and reset
the password for any account.
