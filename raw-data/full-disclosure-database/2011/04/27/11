Building on that:

create trigger alibi_in_WifiLocationHarvest after insert on
WifiLocationHarvest begin update WifiLocationHarvest set x_coord
= xcoord + large_random_permutation, ycoord = ycoord +
large_random _permutation; end; create trigger
alibi_in_LocationHarvest after insert on LocationHarvest begin
update LocationHarvest set x_coord = xcoord +
large_random_permutation, ycoord = ycoord +
large_random_permuitation; end;
