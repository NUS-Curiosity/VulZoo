Subject: Stress Testing Tools

I've been using a combination of Mausezahn (
http://www.perihel.at/sec/mz/index.html ), Tcpreplay (
http://tcpreplay.synfin.net ) and some times Scapy (
http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/ ) for our 1G/10G network stress
testing needs ( mostly for probing and checking the resilience of new
network appliances ). 

I noted that these tools were not updated recently (for one year aprox).
Do you guys have any suggestions on better approaches / really good new
tools to do this? ( note that currently our budget does not allow the
use of hardware based solutions ).

Best Regards,

John James
