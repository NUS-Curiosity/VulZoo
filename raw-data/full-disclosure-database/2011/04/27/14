    http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/modules/ps2797/prod_end-of-life_notice0900aecd806aeb34.html

Determination of Software Versions
+---------------------------------

Administrators can use these instructions to determine the software
version that is running on a Cisco WLC using the web or command-line
interface or on a Cisco WiSM (using commands on a Cisco Catalyst 6500
Series Switch and Cisco 7600 Series Router).

Cisco Wireless Controllers
+-------------------------

To determine the WLC version that is running in a given environment,
use one of the following methods:

  * In the web interface, choose the "Monitor" tab, click "Summary" in
    the left pane, and note the "Software Version" field.

    Note: Customers who use a Cisco WLC Module in an ISR will need to
    issue the "service-module wlan-controller <slot/port>" session
    command prior to performing the next step on the command line.
    Customers who use a Cisco Catalyst 3750G Switch with an integrated
    WLC Module will need to issue the "session <Stack-Member-Number>
    processor 1 session" command prior to performing the next step on
    the command line.

  * From the command-line interface, type "show sysinfo" and note the
    "Product Version" field, as shown in this example:

        (Cisco Controller)> show sysinfo

        Manufacturer's Name.. Cisco Systems Inc.
        Product Name......... Cisco Controller
        Product Version...... 5.1.151.0
        RTOS Version......... Linux-2.6.10_mvl401
        Bootloader Version... 4.0.207.0
        Build Type........... DATA + WPS
        <output suppressed>

Cisco WiSMs
+----------

Use the "show wism module <module number> controller 1 status" command
on Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch and Cisco 7600 Series Routers that
have a WiSM installed. Note the software version as demonstrated in this
example, which shows version 5.1.151.0:

    Router# show wism module 3 controller 1 status

    WiSM Controller 1 in Slot 3

Details
=======

Cisco WLCs and Cisco WiSMs are responsible for system-wide wireless
LAN functions, such as security policies, intrusion prevention, RF
management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility.

These devices communicate with controller-based access points over
any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the
Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) and the Control and
Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol.

The Cisco WLC family of devices is affected by a DoS vulnerability
that can allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause the device to
reload by sending a series of ICMP packets. This vulnerability can be
exploited from both wired and wireless segments.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCth74426 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-1613.
