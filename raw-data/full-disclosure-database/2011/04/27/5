 Description
_______________

IGSS (Interactive Graphical SCADA System) is a complete automation
software - a SCADA system for process control and supervision. It
was developed by 7-Technologies and is the first world's first
object orientated, mouse operated SCADA system.

A remote stack overflow vulnerability exists in the IGSS ODBC service.

No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

_______________

 Details
_______________
 
The ODBC service component of IGSS listens on port 20222/tcp by default. 

The application layer protocol runs over TCP and reads an initial packet
that specifies the amount of data to follow. A second read then takes
place and the data is copied into a variable length buffer. Next the data
is parsed and during this process a buffer overflow occurs on the stack.

At minimum this vulnerability leads to denial of service though remote code
execution may be possible.

 Solution
_______________
