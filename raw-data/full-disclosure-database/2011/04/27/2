Subject: Re: Warning - t00ls.org hidden callback in shells

Just an update to the previous post on this topic. The attacker has
been moving around his datafile containing the list of urls with shell
scripts installed.

His old one:
http://xmors.byethost7.com/mynameisahmed..html
has been shutdown.

Did some investigating, and found some other places this guy has
hidden his data he collected.

This link is one he used before the first one I posted. It was working
until a few days ago, when it looks like he shut it down. You may be
able to find a cache somewhere.

Here's his new live one. As you can see, the list is... quite long.
http://97.79.238.155/~data/mero..html

Obviously I can't tell you what to do with this info. I share this
with the hopes that some kind soul(s) will take the time to notify the
affected websites, or alternatively go through and delete the shell
scripts. I've deleted a lot of them myself, but quite simply don't
have the time to sit there and delete thousands of these shells one by
one. (I considered writing a script, but lost interest rather fast).
