Subject: New malware research posted on Resources at
	InfoSec Institute

The InfoSec Institute published an in-depth article on their Resources
website this afternoon about a prominent new player on the malware scene.

The series discusses the first malware to reliably attach x64 operating
systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. This technically advanced
malware bypasses various protective measures in various operation systems
and exploits the normal boot process.

You can find the first article, in the series of three, here:
