I can see how it can be stored securely, but how would distribution
after recovery be accomplished?

In an envelope? Or by sending me a one-time random https-link where I
can retrieve it myself? Sounds like more trouble compared to what can be
gained from it. Wouldn't it be just as easy to send a one time password
that needs to be changed... Too impracitcal to be implemented in a
real-world situation...

This is probably why I still wouldn't hesitate to say that it is
insecure if it is in clear text. Even though I must give you credit for
having shown a way to do it. ;-)

I am sure someone will come and beat me with saying that they already
did this. :-p Ppl do all sorts of crazy stuff just because they can...
