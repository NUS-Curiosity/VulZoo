lol thor ;p

Max, can you give a little more information as to the source of this? Are
you able to give us more samples? (preferably, dummy@...mple.comm,
dummy@...mple.co, and test).

If it's using a one time pad, you've got no chance lol, but sometimes these
things just use realllllly heavily obfuscated lookup/convert tables, which
can be reversed most of the time.
