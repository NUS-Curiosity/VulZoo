Subject: Re: INSECT Pro 2.5.1 released

Hola Juan,

There must be a bug on your website I can't download the product, I only
see a 'buy now' button which redirects to paypal and sets the amount to
$100.

If it isn't a bug, would you mind to stop using FD as an advertising
mailing list ?

Regards,


kralor.
