I would argue that something like this is the best for full
disclosure.  Afterall, if you release a tool, your techniques are not
really fully disclosed if you keep the source code closed.  

Note that open source != free (example: commercial PGP), but I would
think the source code should be made publicly accessible, even if the
licensing is more restrictive.

However, in the case of "INSECT Pro", the frequency of posts is far
too high, regardless of other considerations.
