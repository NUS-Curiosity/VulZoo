Subject: Re: Google Search Feature Exploitation Scenario

@Cal Try this...

http://www.google.com/search?q=esploit&btnI

http://www.google.com/search?q=esploit+zeus&btnI

http://www.google.com/search?q=0x+t35&btnI&safe=active

some of them didn't work aswell..

http://www.google.com/search?q=0x+t35&btnI

http://www.google.com/search?q=hello+hacker&btnI

but funny "hello human" works..

http://www.google.com/search?q=hello+human&btnI

I bet there's some keyword filter/check at Google's side (but I
believe which can be bypassed)
So, it's all about playing with the keywords.
