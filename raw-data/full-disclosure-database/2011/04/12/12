 INSECT Pro 2.5.1 released)

Just keep that simple, the post hit the non acceptable content.

"Gratuitous advertisement, product placement, or self-promotion is forbidden."



My opinion, but if the product could be free, like it was, then I  
don't mind seeing those kind of post, but for anything commercial FD  
is not there for that.
