Subject: Re: INSECT Pro 2.5.1 released

John,

The following line is within the list charter: Alterations will be made
after consultation with list members and a consensus has been reached.

I would like to suggest that advertising for products and tools (free or
otherwise) be limited to just an initial announcement to tell people about
the tool.
Sending updates for every single minor update made is just useless spam for
the majority of people seeing it, the people who are interested in a product
beyond the initial announcement can and will keep upto date on changes
themselves.

Cheers,
Pete
