You're kidding, right?

Revealing the names of forum users is practically core functionality. There's no expectation whatsoever that they be kept secret - they're displayed all over the site, and a member list (giving you the ability to download ALL USER NAMES ON THE FORUM OMG) is enabled by default.

The first one requires an activation code sent by email. I suppose you could *try* to brute-force it, but you'd probably have better luck brute-forcing the password on the email address you sent the activation to.

The second one... well, I suppose you could use it to try to determine whether email addresses belong to anyone on the forum, or send annoying password reset emails, but adding a CAPTCHA wouldn't really change that much.
