Subject: Re: inject sql in utn.edu.ar

Long time ago, I have found a Remote Code Execution, Remote File Include and a LFI into the "mincyt" webpage (mincyt.gov.ar or something like) and I reported these vulns to the webmaster and to the "contact" and "info" mail address but don't receive any answer, so I proceed to make  public full disclosure. Then, people from ArCert (arcert.gov.ar) contact to me and they tells me that they are the "responsable team" and for the next time "please" contact with him.

So, if you want, contact with him :-) may be, they can help you and help to UCN 

Cheers,
Zerial
