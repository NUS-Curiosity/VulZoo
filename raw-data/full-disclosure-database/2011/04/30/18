This stupid f-wit is now sending linkedin invites to full-disclosure
posting addresses  - following his abusive adverts for his POS wrapper.

The cluelessness astounds me - so the big question is - who is going to be the first
person to find a backdoor into any ofthe servers listed in his zipfile?

I initially thought this may be just some cheap attempt and network infiltration
by the chineese authorities but even they cannot be that clueless.
It is looking more and more like a desperate one man band touting for business.
