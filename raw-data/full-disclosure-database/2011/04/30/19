118 hits I see.  Most of whom probably Didn't Get The Memo.

However, for bonus points, can you think of a plausible scenario(*) where posting
the private key actually makes sense?  (Hint - what are the crypto implications
of doing this as opposed to posting a revocation cert?)

(*) Besides the obvious "proof I pwned the owner of this key, hard" - I mean
cases where the legit owner intentionally does it for a reason.

Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped
