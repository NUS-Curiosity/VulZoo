Subject: Stress Testing / DoS Tools comparison

First of all, thanks for all the feedback! 

I have done a lot of extensive lab and real world (worldwide) testing
last weeks and I´ve found that many of the pretentious/experimental
tools do nothing more than anoy you and make you loose your time (ie:
'dark ddoser' and t'50' are jokes with unnecessary fake 37337ness and
kiddie videos added). 

Huzeyfe, Gaurang, Glowing, Shinnok, Aaron and Xavier - I have followed
your savvy advice and now I´m having the best results with with these 3
tools:

Ddossim, Mausezahn and Tcpreplay

peace out, 

John James
