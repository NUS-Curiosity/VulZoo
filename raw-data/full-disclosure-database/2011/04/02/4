FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

1 APRIL 2011

DEFCON CTF QUALIFIER ANNOUNCED

Defense Diutinus Technologies Corp (ddtek) is pleased to announce the round
of qualification for DEFON 19 CTF.

Bigger, badder venue = bigger, badder CTF.

DDTEK <3 pwnage[1]

Get your supply of Tiger Blood Chronic handy and get your mangina ready to
be pwned...the competition for these coveted spots will be held over 53
non-stop hours 3-5 June (US time zones).

The qualification round will yet again be in the style of game board, but
answers need not be in the form of a question.
Categories will require teams to demonstrate the superiority of hacking
across a vast realm of security knowledge and practice, and their ability to
form coherent questions.

Quit "playing" with your shake-weight on leatherchapsroulette.com long
enough to visit ddtek.biz to register.  Only those that pre-register for
quals are permitted entry.  Each individual should register, first team
member to register will receive a team code to share with other mates before
they register.

Registration site:  https://www.ddtek.biz/reg/dc19_reg.jsp
Registration opens: 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 UTC
Registration ends:  03 Jun 2011 00:00:00 UTC

Qualifications open: 03 Jun 2011 19:00:00 UTC
Qualifications ends: 06 Jun 2011 00:00:00 UTC

In hysterical fashion ACME Pharm will be automatically be permitted contest
entry.  NEW THIS YEAR!  We are also pre-qualifying teams from two other
worldwide CTFs!  We have scientifically chosen the iCTF and Codegate
contests as potentially worthy qualifiers for 2011.  The winners of said
competitions have reserved seats at this years show.  As     always,
pre-qualified teams that don't participate in quals should be ashamed by
their weakness and apply to be a CEH or SANS instructor / cyber security
poser.  Depending on how these teams fare, future winners of these contests
may or may not be invited again, so you bitches better represent!

It wouldn't be fair to reduce the number of spots available to the public at
large, so we're upping the number of tables in Vegas to 12 total.  Yes, when
the dust clears the _12_ best will be invited to join us this summer in sin
city for the annual DEFCON deathmatch.

Also, DDTEK is tired of this bullshit[2] and has decided to fix it by
jumping on the certification band wagon!  Be sure to swing by the CTF room
to attempt to obtain the GIAC-OFFENSIVE certification in person.  It is
_certainly_ the only cert anyone wants to be affiliated with. HR panties and
manties are definitely gonna get wet over this one.


More infoz will follow via your registered email address.
