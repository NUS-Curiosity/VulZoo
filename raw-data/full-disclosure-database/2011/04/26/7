I agree that it was interesting, and raised some pertinent points. 
However, the scope of the California Penal Code statute that he cites does 
_not_ appear to include PED such as smart phones or pads. It clearly 
appears to be directed at tracking devices "permanently" attached to a 
vehicle (e.g. LoJack).
