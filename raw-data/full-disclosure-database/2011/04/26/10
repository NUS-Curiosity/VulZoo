Subject: Default config bug leaves 394,
	000 computers open proxies

A flaw in the PPLive video streaming software leaves quite a lot of
computers open as proxies for clickfraud, clickjacking and spam. 

 

A new port, TCP port 9415, was appearing regularly on websites that list
open proxies. Most of these open proxies were based in China. However, some
were also based within Taiwan, Hong Kong and there were small a small number
within the United States. Within a year, more than 394,000 instances of open
proxies listed with the TCP port 9415 being open were documented.
