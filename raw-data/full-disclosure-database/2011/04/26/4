Subject: Re: Got an iPhone or 3G iPad? Apple is recording
 your moves

*Q*: Steve,

Could you please explain the necessity of the passive location-tracking tool
embedded in my iPhone? It's kind of unnerving knowing that my exact location
is being recorded at all times. Maybe you could shed some light on this for
me before I switch to a Droid. They don't track me.

*A*: Oh yes they do. We don't track anyone. The info circulating around is
false.
