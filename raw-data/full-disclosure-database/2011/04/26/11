CA20110426-01: Security Notice for CA Arcot WebFort Versatile
Authentication Server

Issued: April 26, 2011

CA Technologies support is alerting customers to multiple security
risks with CA Arcot WebFort Versatile Authentication Server. Two
vulnerabilities exist that can allow a remote attacker to potentially
compromise web user security.

The first set of vulnerabilities, CVE-2011-1825, occur due to
insufficient handling of request parameters sent to the Arcot
Administrative Console. An attacker, who can convince a user to
follow a URL or view a webpage, can potentially conduct cross-site
scripting attacks.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2011-1826, occurs due to insufficient
filtering of a request parameter sent to the Arcot Administrative
Console. An attacker, who can convince a user to follow a URL or view
a webpage, can use redirection to potentially carry out additional
web based attacks.

Note: These vulnerabilities only affect the Administrative Console
and do not apply to end user facing pages.
