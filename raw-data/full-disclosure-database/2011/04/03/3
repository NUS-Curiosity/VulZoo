Subject: Facebook URL redirection issue

Hi all,



URL redirection vulnerability observed in Facebook. Facebook
application has not sanitized the “redirect” input parameter. if you provide
"redirect" parameter to any third party site then the web page is
redirecting to the third party site. This would aid phishing attacks by using an attacker's dummy site (providing
redirect value to the dummy site).


URL: http://www.facebook.com/ajax/set_as_homepage.php?uid=<<any value>>&assoc=SetAsHomepageAssocInterstitial&action=cancel&redirect=<<Any web Site URL>> 



Reported this issue to Facebook team on 03/22/11 and Facebook
team acknowledged this issue on 03/29/11 and fixed this vulnerability.


Status: Reported this issue to the vendor and vendor fixed this issue.

Best Regards,
Kiran Maraju
