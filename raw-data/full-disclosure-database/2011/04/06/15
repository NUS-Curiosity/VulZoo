Subject: ISC DHCP Client [3.0.x to 4.2.x] Arbitrary
 Command Execution (CVE-2011-0997)

Hey guys,

It was recently discovered (NOT by myself) that the ISC dhclient was vulnerable to certain shell metacharacters in the hostname parameter specified by *any* DHCP server, causing it to potentially run arbitrary commands as root. I haven't seen anything else on it here, so I figured I'd make everyone aware. 

There's only one real phrase that comes to mind => WTF?
