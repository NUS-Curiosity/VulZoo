The only scheme where there's a semblance of security is if the decryption
key was stored in memory only. (Provided on startup perhaps?)

Or the server stores a one way hash of the password for verification, then
the encrypted version, and queues them up on the X for decryption, an admin
grabs the packet and decrypts locally.

Neither of those schemes are likely to have been implemented on any site,
ever.

In which case plain-text is equivalent to encrypted text with an easily
recoverable key.
