At that point, the security is exactly equal to the security of the keyring
your private key is on (plus whatever security is in the combo of your
passphrase and the means used to enter it).  If it's on a well-hardened
laptop, probably pretty secure.  You put the keyring on a multi-user
system where you don't trust the root user, you get what you deserve.
