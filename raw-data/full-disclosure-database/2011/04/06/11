This isn't necessarily true - without knowledge of how the data may be encrypted and what processes are involved in decrypting the data, one can't make the "it isn't secure" statement.

That being said, it is probably safe to argue that sites that do not require PCI, SOX, HIPPA, etc would be less inclined to engage in this level of security.  But that doesn't mean that it is not being done.

Actually, if they can get the data back (be it because it's stored in plaintext or in obfuscated plaintext) then it's not secure. Obfuscation doesn't make it more secure, or any less plaintext.

Hi Full-Disclosure,

Just my two cents but ... the fact they can give your password back doesn't mean it's stored in cleartext, just that it's not hashed but encrypted with some way to get the original data back, this doesn't mean at all it's not secured, even though in most case it's not.
