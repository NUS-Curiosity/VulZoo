Debian Bug     : 640966

The linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux upgrades from DSA-2303-1 has caused a
regression that can result in an oops during invalid accesses to
/proc/<pid>/maps files.


The text of the original advisory is reproduced for reference:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-1020 

    Kees Cook discovered an issue in the /proc filesystem that allows local
    users to gain access to sensitive process information after execution of a
    setuid binary.

CVE-2011-1576 

    Ryan Sweat discovered an issue in the VLAN implementation. Local users may
    be able to cause a kernel memory leak, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2011-2484 

    Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the number of exit handlers that
    a process can register is not capped, resulting in local denial of service
    through resource exhaustion (cpu time and memory).

CVE-2011-2491

    Vasily Averin discovered an issue with the NFS locking implementation.  A
    malicious NFS server can cause a client to hang indefinitely in an unlock
    call.

CVE-2011-2492 

    Marek Kroemeke and Filip Palian discovered that uninitialized struct
    elements in the Bluetooth subsystem could lead to a leak of sensitive kernel
    memory through leaked stack memory.

CVE-2011-2495 

    Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the io file of a process' proc
    directory was world-readable, resulting in local information disclosure of
    information such as password lengths.

CVE-2011-2496 

    Robert Swiecki discovered that mremap() could be abused for local denial of
    service by triggering a BUG_ON assert.

CVE-2011-2497

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an integer underflow in the Bluetooth subsystem,
    which could lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2011-2517 

    It was discovered that the netlink-based wireless configuration interface
    performed insufficient length validation when parsing SSIDs, resulting in
    buffer overflows. Local users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2011-2525 

    Ben Pfaff reported an issue in the network scheduling code. A local user
    could cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by sending a
    specially crafted netlink message.

CVE-2011-2700 

    Mauro Carvalho Chehab of Red Hat reported a buffer overflow issue in the
    driver for the Si4713 FM Radio Transmitter driver used by N900 devices.
    Local users could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or
    potentially gain elevated privileges.

CVE-2011-2723

    Brent Meshier reported an issue in the GRO (generic receive offload)
    implementation. This can be exploited by remote users to create a denial of
    service (system crash) in certain network device configurations.

CVE-2011-2905 

    Christian Ohm discovered that the 'perf' analysis tool searches for its
    config files in the current working directory. This could lead to denial of
    service or potential privilege escalation if a user with elevated privileges
    is tricked into running 'perf' in a directory under the control of the
    attacker.

CVE-2011-2909 

    Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that a programming error in
    the Comedi driver could lead to the information disclosure through 
    leaked stack memory.

CVE-2011-2918 

    Vince Weaver discovered that incorrect handling of software event overflows
    in the 'perf' analysis tool could lead to local denial of service.

CVE-2011-2928

    Timo Warns discovered that insufficient validation of Be filesystem images
    could lead to local denial of service if a malformed filesystem image is
    mounted.

CVE-2011-3188 

    Dan Kaminsky reported a weakness of the sequence number generation in the
    TCP protocol implementation. This can be used by remote attackers to inject
    packets into an active session.

CVE-2011-3191

    Darren Lavender reported an issue in the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
    A malicious file server could cause memory corruption leading to a denial of
    service.

This update also includes a fix for a regression introduced with the previous
security fix for CVE-2011-1768 (Debian: #633738)

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-35squeeze2. Updates for issues impacting the oldstable distribution
(lenny) will be available soon.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+35squeeze2

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
