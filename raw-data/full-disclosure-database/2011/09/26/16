This is a bit old (2007) but it shows this kind of bug perfectly well.
http://securitytracker.com/id/1018588

So I can imagine one scenario in which DLL hijacking would make sense - if
the developers neglected to properly set the directory permissions and it
got reported as a vuln, the patch *could* have been to properly set the
permissions on *files* and forget to set them on the directory.

It'd be an extremely stupid way to patch. Then again, it's an extremely
stupid bug to begin with, so... :)
