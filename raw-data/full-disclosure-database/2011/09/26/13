Introduction:
=============
The IAEA was created in 1957 in response to the deep fears and expectations resulting from the discovery of nuclear energy. Its 
fortunes are uniquely geared to this controversial technology that can be used either as a weapon or as a practical and useful tool.
The Agency s genesis was US President Eisenhower s Atoms for Peace address to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 8 
December 1953. These ideas helped to shape the IAEA Statute, which 81 nations unanimously approved in October 1956. The Statute 
outlines the three pillars of the Agency s work - nuclear verification and security, safety and technology transfer.
