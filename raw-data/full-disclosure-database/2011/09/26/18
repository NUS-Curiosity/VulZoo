Have you checked the integrity of sshd binary? It could be replaced with a
copy that "forgets" to log so you don't get the sshd logs (possibly after
receiving a specified password).
However the above logs are from pam (pam_unix does the logging on behalf of
sshd) so it's not possible to disable this in the sshd binary itself.

cheers,
