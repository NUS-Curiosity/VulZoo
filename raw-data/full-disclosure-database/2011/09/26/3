Maybe he can trick the user into installing on a FAT32 partition first, and THEN get the to execute from a remote share!

To replace a service executable you usually need administrator access anyway.

Imagine a situation where I have a Windows system with the restricted
user access and want to get the Administrator access.

There are many services in Windows which run with SYSTEM account.

If there exists even one such service whose executable is not
protected by Windows File Protection, isn't it possible to execute
malicious code (such as gaining Administrator access) simply by
replacing the service executable with malicious one and then
restarting the service.

As a restricted user, what's stopping me to do this ?

Is there any integrity check performed by services.msc or service
itself before executing with SYSTEM account ?
