Just remember - NBC advertised its summer reruns as "If you didn't
see it before, it's new to you..."  That, combined with the fact that
there's always new people entering the field, means we're stuck
with a "September that never ended" scenario.

The sad part is that for the people entering Benoit College this
fall, it has *always* been September.
