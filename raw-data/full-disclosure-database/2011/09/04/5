Subject: Re: Reverse Proxy

Thanks for your help.
I managed to find it, there seems to be about 4-5 image files coming 
from another IP, after changing my hosts file to point the domain there 
it appears to have the whole website on, I'm assuming that this is the 
actual web server as it appears to be with a hosting company so looks 
promising. :)

Not too sure why they would pull a few images directly though...
