Subject: Re: FreePBX Unfounded RCE PoC or rather Misguided
 PoC maybe ?

Hello,
    Thankyou for your input regarding this, the issue is not a matter of
where to put files, nor of LFI, it is more of 'why is this PoC made for
non-user accounts,and can it be used remotely by attackers'.

I have written 3 or so PoC's for this and also for another bug in this, they
can b found here:

Then i found it did not work , and i KNOW there is a bug affecting things
for this area of boxes... I cannot say alot more about that but i will only
say, there is bugs still affecting this, and im trying to secure one box
only for a client... so what credentials do i need?
anyhow, there is also one wich i tried in perl wich i have now made connect
to both ports 80/443 and try, this seems to be pretty accurate...yet again
it does nothing..

In the php one i tried using a different folder... what is it , the server
is NOT patched.

I may have missed something, but i was able to replicate the EXACT header
shown in the spiderlabs, and on this system, nothing showed. It is hand
patched, so im beginning to wonder if somehow the owner has fluked this one
:? (thatd b great really), but there is a bug still, if not this one, then
another one wich is allowing problems for me.
i will have to read as there seems to be a few more emails on this, thankyou
for your input, i will have to test again or look at the code and makesure
it is right.. i hurried this but the python exploit code, was already made
for this PoC, i was given that.
This box is just VOiP of headaches.
Thanks for your assistance,and thankyou for those xss bugs, i may have to
test for those also, altho the problem seems more serious than that.
