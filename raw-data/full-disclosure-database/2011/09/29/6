Subject: GSC Chat Server Authentication Bypass

Product: GSC (Game Servers Client)

Version: 2.00 Build 3017

Website: http://getgsc.com

 

By sniffing the traffic of the chat client one can easily discern that it
uses IRC to back its private messaging system. From there, you can simply
issue commands such as NICK and switch your nickname to any other user's
nickname on the network while they're offline, bypassing chat
authentication. From this point, you can utilize the client's interface to
send messages from the new nickname. With this, you can also avoid being
kicked out of a "chat channel" (IRC channel) when you're banned from a voice
chat server; you'll be able to speak in chat still.
