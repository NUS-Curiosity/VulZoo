I dont have the link but there is a really neat image search engine. You point it at an
image (file->save image as?) and it will hunt down the URLs referencing similar images.

Have seen it used to find sites using "stolen" images - not sure if it would work
with fb image archives but worth a try.

Could prolly automate the whole thing with 20 lines of perl :-)
