Subject: Trusteer Rapport and anti-keylogging

All - It has been a few weeks now since I demonstrated the following at
44con (http://www.44con.com) and thus time to just dump the details here.

The following are what can only be described as 'design flaws' in
Trusteer Rapport's anti-keylogger protections, that is Rapport provides
the functionality to decrypt keys to *everyone* along with the ability
to 'switch-off' anti-keylogger protections all together. However, I
should say that in the latter case, Trusteer aren't the only ones to
provide such functionality, KeyScrambler does also.

This is somewhat documented in the following post,
http://www.digit-security.com/blog/?p=47

The following are for OSX *only*, but you can extend these to Windows
trivially (the ioctl obfuscation layer is easily bypassed by using
Trusteer's own code),

http://wwww.digit-security.com/files/exploits/rapport-switchoff.c
- switches off anti-keylogger protections on OSX allowing your already
existing keylogger to function correctly once again.

http://wwww.digit-security.com/files/exploits/rapport-listen.c
- uses Trusteer's own functionality to 'decrypt' keys directly.
