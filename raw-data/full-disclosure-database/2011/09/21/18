It's intentionally difficult.  It *is* possible to generate a key to match a given key ID,
or even match a given key fingerprint - however, the resulting key will have odd values
for key length (for instance, it may be a 25-bit DSA key or 1,343,342 bit RSA or other
wild stuff).

The tricky part will be getting the person to accept that the key is from who it
purports to be - this will probably involve some social engineering, especially if
the target already *has* a trusted key from the person you're trying to forge.
