I dont see why someone would know how to use '--' for touch and not for rm...

[jacqui@...ter test]$ touch -- -f -r
[jacqui@...ter test]$ rm *
[jacqui@...ter test]$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jacqui jacqui 0 Sep 21 12:53 -f
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jacqui jacqui 0 Sep 21 12:53 -r
[jacqui@...ter test]$ rm -- *
[jacqui@...ter test]$ ls -l
total 0
[jacqui@...ter test]$
