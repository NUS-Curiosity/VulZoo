Subject: OT: help generating gpg key with prescribed key ID

i know i am dumb.

for a fishing expedition i need to generate a gpg key with prescribed key ID.

is there a relatively easy way to do this?

(don't feel like spending much time on this, RTFM failed, opportunistic
hex editing failed, couldn't  locate where to patch gpg in 1 hour)

10x.
