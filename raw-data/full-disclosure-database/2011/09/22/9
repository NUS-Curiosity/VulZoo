Subject: TLS/SSL Compatibility Report 2011


Hey,
I  though  it  would  be  worthwhile  to  let you know about my recent
updates to the "TLS/SSL Compatiblity Report". A Document that tries to
give a complete overview over  what  TLS/SSL protocols and  what  ciphers
are  available on different platforms and browsers.

The 2011 version was updated notably with the following items :

* Chrome moved away from SCHANNEL to NSS offering better
crypto on lower end systems (XP, 2003). Loosing however the
TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 capability of the latest Microsoft Operation
Systems.

Especially  with  the  release of the BEAST we might want to know what
platforms actually support TLS 1.1 (or 1.2).

The blog post and document is available here:
http://blog.g-sec.lu/2011/09/ssltls-hardening-and-compatibility.html

Should  you  be  aware  of any missing or wrong information, drop me a
mail.

Regards,
Thierry
