 DLL Hijacking

If it's a trusted .vbs then how would you drop a .dll in the same directory?
If you have write permissions it's easier to just modify the .vbs.

You might as well claim the added value is to backdoor a .vbs file
subrepticiously so it doesn't show when inspecting the source code. But it
doesn't add that much, really, since a new and misterious .dll file would
also draw the attention, so it's probably easier to hide malicious intent
into the source code by obfuscating it.
