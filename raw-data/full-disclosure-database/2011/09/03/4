hi, hope you are well,

Prediction 3: Until spammers learn PROP use of english, things wont change,
the spam will still ahve speeling errors.

thats about the only thing saving some of us i think...
thats my own observation, and seems to go back to when i was phreaking
'engineering' via telephone, using at&t pbx cards, to act like a security
engineer at at&t to get more cards, wich, lasted many years... the people
who could NOT phish, and relied on the few who could, were all europeans,
wich yes now this has changed.
originally, and in general, the better use of language wich is what prevails
with most social engineering in any format and will always continue to,
however, the use of english is also nowdays becoming easier to learn, people
are becoming smarter from each failure, wich is why computers failure rate
dissolves.
Social engineering was the basis of many hackers/black or white, in some
form, many years ago... there is not much documented on it but hey, im just
yer avergae Eric jones.
Anyhow, have a good day sir, interesting topically, in 2011..
cheers,
xd
