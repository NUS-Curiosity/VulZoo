Subject: Cyberwar between Israel and Turkish Hacker

Turkish hacker "*TurkGuvenligi*" hijacked some 350 Israeli websites on
Sunday evening, launching a Domain Name System (DNS) attack on at least seven
high-profile websites<http://www.thehackernews.com/2011/09/theregistercouk-biggest-news-site-got.html>
including
The Telegraph, Acer, National Geographic, UPS and Vodafone as well. Visitors
to some of the sites were diverted to a page declaring it was â€œ*World
Hackers Day.*" Hackers calling themselves the "*TurkGuvenligi group*" calimd
the cyber-attack. "TurkGuvenligi translates as "*Turkish security.*"

"*The hack represents a 10%-15% spike compared to the average number of
daily hacks of Israeli websites*," Shai Blitzblau, head of Maglan-Computer
Warfare and Network Intelligence Labs, explained. Israel's military and
security establishment has invested significantly in cyber-warfare programs
in recent years and is considered one of the most advanced cyber-warfare
forces in the world, both in attack and defense modes.The Stuxnet virus that
downed systems at Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor to a halt for over six
months is widely believed to have been the result of an Israeli
cyber-attack, although Israel has not admitted it.
