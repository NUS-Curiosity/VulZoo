- Cross Site Scripting
This vulnerability affects /cgi-bin/te/o.cgi.

The impact of this vulnerability
Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML or Flash into
a vulnerable application to fool a user in order to gather data from them.
An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account,
impersonating the user. It is also possible to modify the content of the
page presented to the user.

Attack details
The GET variable s has been set to <script>alert(507691789232)</script>.

- CRLF injection/HTTP response splitting
Affected items
/cgi-bin/te/o.cgi
The impact of this vulnerability
Is it possible for a remote attacker to inject custom HTTP headers. For
example, an attacker can inject session cookies or HTML code. This may
conduct to vulnerabilities like XSS (cross-site scripting) or session
fixation.

How to fix this vulnerability
You need to restrict CR(0x13) and LF(0x10) from the user input or properly
encode the output in order to prevent the injection of custom HTTP headers.


- SSL 2.0 deprecated protocol
Affected items
Server
The impact of this vulnerability
An attacker may be able to exploit these issues to conduct man-in-the-middle

 - Cookie manipulation
The impact of this vulnerability
By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker may conduct a session fixation
attack. In a session fixation attack, the attacker fixes the user's session
ID before the user even logs into the target server, thereby eliminating the
need to obtain the user's session ID afterwards.

How to fix this vulnerability
You need to filter the output in order to prevent the injection of custom
HTTP headers or META tags. Additionally, with each login the application
should provide a new session ID to the user.

Disable TRACE Method on the web server.

- URL redirection
Affected items
/cgi-bin/at3/out.cgi
The impact of this vulnerability
A remote attacker can redirect users from your website to a specified URL.
