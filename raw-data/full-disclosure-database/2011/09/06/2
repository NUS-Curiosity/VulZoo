There is actually plenty one can do with "normal user" scripts, but as you've pointed out, many of the options admins require scripts for need escalated privileges.   This is obviously be design, and it helps to keep admins aware of best practices when choosing to deploy solutions via scripting.  There are, of course, many many other ways once can accomplish system maintenance in a more secure way such as WMI, PS (which can require signed scripts) and of course GPO and/or any other number of solutions.
