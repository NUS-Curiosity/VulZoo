Hi All,

We are pleased to announce the release of the GlobaLeaks Prototype Demo.

You are all invited to take a look at it and try how it feels to a Node
Administrator, Whistleblower and TULIP receiving target.

GlobaLeaks is the first Open Source Whistleblowing Framework.

It empowers anyone to easily setup and maintain their own Whistleblowing
platform. It is also a collection of what are the best practices for
people receiveiving and submitting material. GlobaLeaks works in all
environments: media, activism, corporations, public agencies.
