Right there.  Hope that helps.

They also didn't issue a CVE to match the CERT advisory CA-2001-04, so I expect
the guys at Mitre to do the same this time, for the same reasons (namely, that
a procedural error or compromise of a CA, although a security problem, isn't in
the class of things that CVE is tracking).
