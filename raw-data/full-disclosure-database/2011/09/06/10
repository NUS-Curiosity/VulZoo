Subject: Permutation Oriented Programming - Part 2.

Just to let you know that new example codes and a demonstration video is now
available.

The new example codes is capable to bypass a MS08-078 workaround recommended by
Microsoft, proving the power of a Permutation Oriented Programming approach.

- Video:

- Codes:

_Bypass.zip

For further details and extra documents/codes, please, refer to:

Best regards.

PS: The vulnerability itself is not the key component, but the way it is
exploited is that so.
