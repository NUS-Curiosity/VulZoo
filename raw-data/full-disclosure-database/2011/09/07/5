As a practical matter, nobody sane cares if you use OpenSSL anymore.  If you're
lving in an insane country, or doing crypto other than OpenSSL, you may have an
issue.

If you live in an insane country, good luck. If you're doing crypto other than
OpenSSL, again, good luck - hope you got enough cryptographers to look at it to
make sure it's actually secure. ;)
