Hello list!

This is my first time posting software on sourceforge, and I see this:
"This project DOES incorporate, access, call upon or otherwise use 
encryption. Posting of open source encryption is controlled under U.S. 
Export Control Classification Number "ECCN" 5D002 and must be 
simultaneously reported by email to the U.S. government. You are 
responsible for submitting this email report to the U.S. government in 
accordance with procedures described 
in:http://www.bis.doc.gov/encryption/PubAvailEncSourceCodeNotify.htmland 
Section 740.13(e) of the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") 15 
C.F.R. Parts 730-772."

I am in Canada, so i assume this does not apply to me. But are there any 
paperwork I should do in Canada?

thank you
