Subject: OWASP AppSec USA 2011 - Two Weeks Away

The OWASP AppSec USA 2011 conference in Minneapolis is only two weeks
away. Classes are filling up fast (the OWASP WTE class is full, mobile
security class almost full), and the conference talks lineup is
impressive. Sign up today for the training on September 20-21 and the
main conference talks, CTF, showroom, and Open Source Showcase on
September 22-23!

OWASP is in its tenth year, and application security is on everyone's
radar. And this year we have some wonderful new initiatives as part of
OWASP AppSec USA 2011. For the first time, we're:

* Funding the conference experience for two women in college through
the OWASP Women in AppSec grant. Congratulations to Tara Wilson and
Chandni Bhowmik on securing these grants! And thank you to The Wells
Fargo Foundation for its generous seed funding.

* Raising funds for science education for inner city youth with the
5K/10K for Charity.

* Hosting a University Challenge offense/defense competition.

* Running an Open Source Showcase during the conference proceedings.
Open source community members will demo their terrific work.


Additionally, the OWASP Chapters Committee and the ESAPI and AppSensor
teams will be meeting September 21 to build upon their great work in
OWASP.

Be a part of AppSec USA 2011, where OWASP propels itself into the next
ten years. Lots of cool talks and training. And many opportunities to
learn, grow, and give back.

We would like to thank the OWASP AppSec USA 2011 donors and sponsors
and the many conference contributors for helping us to build an
awesome event for the application security and development community.
