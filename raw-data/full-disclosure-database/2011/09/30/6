Subject: VPN providers and any providers in general...

Dude, If you really want to be 'invisible' this is not hard todo..
if you expect to, jump around on peoples servers, illegally, for long
amounts of time, ie, daily/wekly/yearly,and are a pest, who would want to
make you or help you even be invisible.
there are KNOWN places, i have used, and known places wich will not store
data, or maybe, provide a proxxy but, they can certainly hide a botnet...
but ofcourse, these things dont come cheap :)
there are forsure places, go ahead and try and screw over a server in say...
panama ? ever checked theyre laws ?
ONLy people who commit ANY crime in THEYRE country, will be arrested...ever
noticed the main BIGGER servers are hosted there, even chat ones ?
Thats just how it has and always will be, where and if you wish to pursue
this method..as you said yourself, do it yourself..and thats fine, for me..
I also speak from someone who does not believe in using vpn providers, but,
i know wich countrys i could rely on, for a secure box.
Thats just laws..wich is all online... Panam, is only oen of 10 i can think
of offhand... thats pklenty of servers.
cute eh
cheers.
