Subject: Re: VPN provider helped track down alleged
	LulzSec member

err, you are limited in those countries dude... id really checkup on that
... maybe some but, yea i agree, i dont think any hosting is anon, but, i
sure know i have kept an anon dedis in past, and was VERY easy to avoid
handing anything over. Unless they had personally seized from my company, i
was allowed to basically get away with, and if i want to, again, could do
the same  'anonymously' and, indeed keep those details, away.
it is not frigin hard dude, where did Yyou get the idea, that is not hard to
move a user around boxes :P
 and rename them, etc etc etc, always change ipv6 tunnels... there is somany
ways, you obv have not ran a dedicated server in a company environment coz
boi, they hide nets on legit hostin now, legit apparently* companies...and
they do it using those simple means, and, even show logs of them 'removing
and deleting' files of the apprent 'bad user' , this is, a whole different
level than even needing to deal with cops.. so, you are scared too much by
laws  wich can be smokescreened.
Run a dedis, or simply ask a admin, howmany abuse they get, and howmany
users they actually rm ;)
you would want this service, on your vps ?
i surely wouldnt,. i know, with me, if i offer anon, you stay damn anon, if
you bring cops to MY HOUSE, then i may have to try and, simply keep my darn
data secure ey ?
how about that ?
simple methods, defeat simple plans benji.
