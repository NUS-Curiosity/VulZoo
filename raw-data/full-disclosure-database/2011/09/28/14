Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software IPv6 over MPLS
Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110928-ipv6mpls

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 September 28 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS Software is affected by two vulnerabilities that cause a
Cisco IOS device to reload when processing IP version 6 (IPv6)
packets over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) domain. These
vulnerabilities are:

  * Crafted IPv6 Packet May Cause MPLS-Configured Device to Reload
  * ICMPv6 Packet May Cause MPLS-Configured Device to Reload

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-ipv6mpls.shtml.

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that
correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as
well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software devices (hereafter both
referenced as Cisco IOS Software in this document) that are running
vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software and configured for MPLS are
affected by two vulnerabilities related to IPv6 traffic that
traverses an MPLS domain. The two vulnerabilities are independent of
each other.

Note: IPv6 does not need to be configured on the affected devices
themselves. The vulnerabilities do require the MPLS label switched
packets to have specific IPv6 payloads to be exploited.

To determine whether a device is configured for MPLS, log in to the
device and issue the command-line interface (CLI) command "show mpls
interface". If the IP state is "Yes", the device is vulnerable. The
following example shows a device that has MPLS configured on
interface Ethernet0/0:

    Router#show mpls interface
    Interface       IP           Tunnel  BGP  Static  Operational
    Ethernet0/0   Yes (ldp)    No      No   No       Yes
    Router#

The following two examples show responses from a device with MPLS
forwarding disabled. The first example shows a return of no
interfaces:

    router#show mpls interface
    Interface              IP            Tunnel   BGP Static Operational
    routers#

In the second example, the device provides a message indicating that
MPLS forwarding is not configured:

    router#show mpls interface
    no MPLS apps enabled or MPLS not enabled on any interfaces

    router#

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco
product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the "show
version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco
IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by
"Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices
do not have the "show version" command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Devices that are not configured for MPLS are not vulnerable.

The following products have been confirmed not to be affected by
these vulnerabilities:

  * Cisco IOS XR Software

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The packet handling nodes in an MPLS network are called provider
routers (P routers) and provider edge routers (PE routers) and are
configured with MPLS. Both P and PE routers are vulnerable to both
the vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory.

In networks that have MPLS enabled and could carry MPLS label
switched packets with IPv6 payloads, the device may crash when
processing MPLS label switched packets with specific IPv6 payloads.
Typical deployment scenarios that would be affected by either
vulnerability would be Cisco IPv6 Provider Edge Router (6PE) or IPv6
VPN Provider Edge Router (6VPE).

Crafted IPv6 Packet May Cause MPLS-Configured Device to Reload
+-------------------------------------------------------------

A crafted IPv6 packet may cause the device to crash when the packet
is processed by Cisco IOS Software because the MPLS TTL has expired.
The crafted packet used to exploit this vulnerability would be
silently discarded in Cisco IOS Software if received on an interface
where the packet did not have an MPLS label.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCto07919 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3274.

ICMPv6 Packet May Cause MPLS-Configured Device to Reload
+-------------------------------------------------------------

A valid ICMPv6 packet may cause the device to crash when the packet
is processed by Cisco IOS Software because the MPLS TTL has expired.
The packet used to exploit this vulnerability would not affect Cisco
IOS Software if received on an interface where the packet did not
have an MPLS label.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtj30155 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3282.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes.

Cisco IOS XR Software
+--------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by the vulnerability disclosed
in this document.

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by any of the vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 bundled publication.

Workarounds
===========

For both vulnerabilities the following workaround applies:

Disabling MPLS TTL Propagation
+-----------------------------

Disabling MPLS TTL propagation will prevent exploitation of these
vulnerabilities. MPLS TTL propagation will have to be disabled on all
PE routers in the MPLS domain. To disable MPLS TTL propagation, enter
the global configuration command "no mpls ip propagate-ttl". If only "no
mpls ip propagate-ttl forward" is configured, the vulnerabilities could
still be exploited from within the MPLS domain.

For more information about the MPLS TTL propagation command, refer to
the configuration guide at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/mpls/command/reference/mp_m1.html#wp1013846

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/
tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html for additional TAC contact
information, including localized telephone numbers, and instructions
and e-mail addresses for use in various languages.
