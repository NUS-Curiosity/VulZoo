 DLL Hijacking

LOL.  "Warning, if you get the user to execute code, then it is possible to get the user to execute code!!  All you have to do is get files on their system, and then get them to execute those files!   Note that once you get the user to execute the code, it will actually run in the context of that user!!  This is remote code execution vulnerability!"

Welcome to today's Infosec!

Are you guys seriously reporting that double clicking on a malicious .vbs file could lead to remote code execution? :P

Either I'm missing something (and I'd welcome a rebuttal here!) or you might as well add .exe to that list. All those extensions are already executable.

Any running Windows Script Host v5.6

Researcher:

Vendor Status:
Acknowedged

Reference to Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
: http://www.cybsec.com/vulnerability_policy.pdf

Vulnerability Description:

DLL Hijacking takes advantage of the way an application dynamically

loads dll libraries without specifying a fully qualified path. This is

usually done invoking the LoadLibrary and LoadLibraryEx functions to

dynamically load DLLs.

In order to exploit this vulnerability a user must open a file with an

extension associated to the vulnerable application. A malicious dll,

named exactly as a dll the apllications loads using the vulnerable

function, must be placed in the same directory as the opened file.

The application will then load the malicious dll instead of the

original, thus executing the malicious code.

The following application loads external libraries following an insufficiently qualified path.
Application: wscript.exe
Extensions: js, jse, vbe, vbs, wsf, wsh
Library: wshesn.dll

Exploit:
Option 1 - Using the "msfpayload" Metasploit module as shown below:

msfpayload windows/exec CMD=calc.exe D > exploit.dll
Option 2 - Using the "webdav_dll_hijacker" Metasploit module.

Impact:

A successful exploit of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution.
