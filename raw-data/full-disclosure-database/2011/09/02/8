>>From the Editor,


Well folks, after this issue and the obvious intensity of the insecurity of
the net, I have a few thoughts on the unfettered access to knowledge.

It is more than apparent we all live in a time where the extensive
dissemination of opinions, thoughts and ideas and information are done
through a modern method of transmission. The simplicity and effectiveness by
which computers and networks are used to assemble, store, search, associate,
recover, and share information make computer technology especially risky to
anyone who wishes to keep personal or protect information from the public
sphere or out of the clutches of anyone who is perceived as a probable
threat.

As this issues explores, the evolving and more advanced capabilities of
computer viruses, phishing, fraud schemes, spyware, and hacking activity
springing up from every corner of the globe and the diversity of
privacy-related issues engendered by computer technology has led to a
reassessment of the concept of privacy and of computer ethics.

Originally, a hacker was identified simply as any individual who wanted to
understand every thing humanely possible about computers. But it wasn’t long
before hacking came to be linked with phreaking, (The skill or science of
breaking the phone network. Example; to make illegal, free long-distance
calls). It wasn’t long before a plan for “hacking ethics” originated from
the activities of the so-called “original hackers” in the 1950s and 1960s at
MIT and Stanford University. Technology writer Stephen Levy has summarized
those “hacker ethic” in this way.

1.     Access to computers should be unlimited and total.

2.     All information should be free.

3.     Authority should be mistrusted and decentralization promoted.

4.     Hackers should be judged solely by their skills at hacking, rather
than by race, class, age, gender, or position.

5.     Computers can be used to create art and beauty.

6.     Computers can change your life for the better.

The understanding of “Hacker Ethics” has three main functions:

1.     It promotes the belief of individual activity over any form of
corporate authority or system of ideals.

2.     It supports a completely free-market approach to the exchange of and
access to information.

3.     It promotes the belief that computers can have a beneficial and
life-changing effect.

Without a doubt, unreserved access to the resources and information on the
Internet is clearly an essential mechanism for business and business
opportunities, medical services, educational opportunities, and employment
and many other requirements of modern life around the world.

But more important than material or monetary requirements is the
uninterrupted access to uncensored life giving, freedom sustaining knowledge
of events and discourse. It is more than wresting a few dollars worth of
free phone calls from the phone company. The stakes are far higher. “There's
a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so
sick at heart that you can't take part! You can't even passively take part!
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon
the levers, upon all the apparatus -- and you've got to make it stop! And
you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it --
that unless you're free the machine will be prevented from working at all!!”
Though perhaps cloaked, hacking is a universal form of civil disobedience.
It is a form of laying bare the truths our betters deign to trust with the
rabble of civilization. Why else are the national security apparatus’ of
nations across the globe sentenced to fitful restless nights?  Transparency
/Sunlight are the best disinfectant.  When the last forest and indigenous
peoples of the earth are ground into dust beneath the heel of militarism and
materialism it will be too late. Hacking, exposing the minions of mammon is
a key component of sustaining the planet and the mind of man.

Unfettered access to knowledge, oh yeah!
