I forgot to post list yesterday after testing.

|NiX| Checked 135440 proxies in 0 days 4 hours 11 minutes 57 seconds.
Threads used: 125 Working proxies: 429

429 working out of 135k is not that bad from an old list.

Here's the list: http://pastebin.com/sEuxdV8f

You may want to recheck it since it's about 15 hours old.

Neither do I but it's likely a botnet or bad progamming. I mean just like
the port 27977 proxies, there were a ton of them and afterwards it proved
to be botnet.

What kind of tips you're looking for? How do I do it? Im hard worker and
usually if I do something, I do it as good as I can or I don't do it all.
That's my motto.
