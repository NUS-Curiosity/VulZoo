4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in InduSoft
ISSymbol ActiveX control, which can be exploited by malicious people 
to compromise a user's system.

1) A boundary error when processing the "Open()" method can be 
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long
string passed as a parameter.

2) A boundary error when processing the "Close()" method can be
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long
string passed as a parameter.

3) A boundary error when processing the "SetCurrentLanguage()" method
can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly
long string passed as a parameter.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of
arbitrary code.
