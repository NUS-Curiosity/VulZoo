Subject: Re: Cybsec Advisory 2011 0901 Windows Script Host
 DLL Hijacking

but if you execute a trusted vbs, you would successfully exploit anything
wouldnt you ?
id would be like running a dll using rundll32.exe my.dll , cept a vbs :s

to me makes no sense, never has, and i know what loadlibrary does, i looked
at the implications of theyre advisories, i remember when we were swarmed by
about 100 dlls wich were not 'unloaded' rproperly... lol... ok anyhow, this
makes no sense, executing a trusted vbs is 'script' many viruses have been
named .vbs and run vb script...right? so why would we need news on this...
xd
