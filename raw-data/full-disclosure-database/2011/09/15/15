Subject: Re: Microsoft's Binary Planting Clean-Up Mission

Plus: pretending that you're on the same page as Microsoft (from a security
standpoint) to further your own argument is more damaging than it is
beneficial. The entire "binary planting" concept was flawed from the very
beginning. If you can drop a binary file on a user's machine - make it an
executable and be done with it. There's nothing fancy or innovative about
forcing applications to use specific DLLs - script kiddies have been doing
it for over 10 years to inject custom code in multiplayer games.
