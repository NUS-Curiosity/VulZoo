Hi Thor,

Microsoft is maintaining a list of binary planting bugs they've fixed here:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2269637

You will find our name in some of these advisories.

Calling the above effort a "Binary Planting Clean-up Mission" was merely a benign
poetic exercise, and this is *not* an official name of any internal mission at
Microsoft to the best of my knowledge.

You can learn something about our interaction with Microsoft here:

Cheers,
Mitja
