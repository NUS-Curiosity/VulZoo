Hi Mikhail,

Whether the first part of this statement was meant as a compliment or not, I would
give black hats much more credit than that. Whatever we're able to find with our
small-scale effort, highly skilled and motivated black hats working in the multi
billion-dollar cyber crime "industry" have either already found or are able to if
they tried. We give some of our research to the public and those who want can learn
from it. If they choose to learn, they can possibly make software for their users a
little bit more secure tomorrow than they did yesterday.

Best,
Mitja
