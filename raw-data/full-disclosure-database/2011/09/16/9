Subject: understanding the botnet C&C..

hi
an area that I am basically "stupid" on is botnets. Not what they are
but "how" they work through IRC as the control center. Not just that
but the various modern programs used. I am aware for instance LOIC can
be used to connect to an IRC channel.. but, how then does the "herder"
do the job from IRC..how does he issue commands that all the computers
connected act upon, etc. ? My curiosity has just got the best of me
and I would like some pointers to good material that can feed it.

Sorry for the "troll" like post but I really would like to understand
this further. Have done a number of Google searching but have hope
someone here has done personal research.

been great, thanks
