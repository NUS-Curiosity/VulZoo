Dear Mitja,

In your blog

you wrote:
  Change #1: No "file://" Inside "http://"
    Microsoft changed the behavior of Internet Explorer such that a web
    page (served via http://) can't display the content of a shared
    folder (served via file://) in a frame/iframe. This is good ...
  Change #2: No "file://" From "http://"
    Not allowing a web page loaded via http:// to open a file:// URL
    blocks this attack vector and this is good. ...

When were those IE changes made: as part of MS11-057 maybe?
I could not find any references to such a change.

Thanks, Paul
