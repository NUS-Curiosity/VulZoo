Quick summary:

1) botherder gets on channel #my_botnet_C&C
2) Bots all joing #my_botnet_C&C
3) Botherder sends a message to channel "<secret_pw> crispy_critter nn.nn.nn.nn"
4) Bots receive the message, and contain code that says:
if (word1 == expected_pw) && (word2 == "crispy_critter") then ddos(word3);
