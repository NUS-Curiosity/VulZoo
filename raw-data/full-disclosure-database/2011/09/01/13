No agenda.  He's providing a proxy list based on his continual research in the area.   He didn't ask you to block anything.

2011/9/1 Mr. Hinky Dink <dink@...inkydink.com<mailto:dink@...inkydink.com>>

In July, hundreds of Chinese proxies on port 8909 started showing up
every day on public proxy lists.  In August the daily numbers were in
the thousands.

Here is the list I collected during that period.  There are >135K
proxies in this file (text, tab delimited, ~8 megs).

You may want to right-click and "save as".  This is offered as data you
may be able to use for forensic purposes or router block lists.  Most of
these proxies are currently offline.  When they are online, they're very
good proxies.

You maybe just want us to block this IP since the most are "offline" and we will not be able to verify it's existens...

What is your agenda?
