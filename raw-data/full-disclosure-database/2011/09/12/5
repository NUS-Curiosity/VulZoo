Subject: [TEHTRI-Security] Facebook Security Issues
	through HTML Iframes

Gents,

Here are humble thoughts about potential security issues against
facebook end-users, thanks to html iframes and evil crafted profiles/pages:

http://www.tehtri-security.com/en/news.php?id=73

We also shared a tiny proof of concept with javascript stuff, tracking
issues, and phishing simulation to grab login/password of some facebook
users.

Notice that we didn't share offensive source code, as we don't want evil
people to play against facebook end-users. We just want to help people
at being more paranoid when they are on Internet, and Facebook is a
great place for that.

Best regards.

Laurent ESTIEUX (CTO TEHTRIS) & Laurent OUDOT (CEO TEHTRIS)
