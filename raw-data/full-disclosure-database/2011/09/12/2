Debian Bug     : 611495


Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in ffmpeg, a multimedia player,
server and encoder.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:


CVE-2010-3908

   FFmpeg before 0.5.4, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
   via a malformed WMV file.


CVE-2010-4704

   libavcodec/vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted
   .ogg file, related to the vorbis_floor0_decode function.


CVE-2011-0480

   Multiple buffer overflows in vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg
   allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
   application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
   WebM file, related to buffers for the channel floor and the channel residue.


CVE-2011-0722

   FFmpeg allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory
   corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
   malformed RealMedia file.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.4-1.

Security support for ffmpeg has been discontinued for the oldstable
distribution (lenny).
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.


We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
