Subject: Western Union Certificate Error

I recently got this error "You attempted to reach
www.westernunion.com, but instead you actually reached a server
identifying itself as wumt.westernunion.com. This may be caused by a
misconfiguration on the server or by something more serious. An
attacker on your network could be trying to get you to visit a fake
(and potentially harmful) version of www.westernunion.com. You should
not proceed."
Attached is a screenshot of the error and certificate info. SHA-256=9F
26 1E 37 F3 6A 34 88 AD 65 54 88 E0 5C 8A 13
C6 69 D4 FE 2A 25 0F DA 2C 51 13 1E 08 F8 DA 6F

Cert was issued by Comodo

A google of the SHA comes up with ICANN but other sites come up with
nothing... And then I read from comodo themselves they got breached
and fraudulent certs were issued...
