LANGUAGE OF THE PRESENTATION

While the 28C3 is an international conference that aims to present
lots of content in English, we would rather have a good presentation
in German than a bad one in so-called Denglisch. So please be honest
when judging your language skills and choose your lecture language
accordingly.

the congress, please refrain from submitting company propaganda.
