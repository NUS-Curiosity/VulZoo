Subject: Recent claims that windows update is broken

"I'm able to issue windows update," he [Comodohacker] wrote. "Microsoft's statement about Windows Update and that I can't issue such update is totally false!"

The original Comodohacker statement is at: http://pastebin.com/85WV10EL

Is this true?
