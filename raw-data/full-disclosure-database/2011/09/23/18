 apt-get update related)

Aha, sounds like typical (unfortunately), the case of the 'sads' on Ubuntus
behalf.
 This is what unfortunately stops somany people from reporting, just that
BIT of acknowledgemnt, even just a thanks on theyre webpage, but instead
they people think "oh well, this guy has probably raped 5000 boxes then
given us this" , it must be the approach of some companies, or they have
very pathetic secteams, (in ubuntus cause, -no comment rofl).
anyhow thx for clearing that up.
cheers,
xd
