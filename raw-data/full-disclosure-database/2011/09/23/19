Dear all,

Sorry about the confusion I may have caused. I guess my comments apply
to some older version sshd (or maybe old, wrong configs): surely that is
when, wanting better logs, I put in that hosts.allow logger. Perusing my
logs more carefully, I now see lines like:

DATE SRV sshd[PID]: Connection source HOST port PORT
DATE SRV sshd[PID]: Accepted keyboard-interactive/pam for USER from IP port PORT ssh2

where the second line came from sshd itself.

Cheers, Paul
