Finding: Vulnerability in Pantech Web Browser SSL Implementation

Pantech Link/P7040P browser SSL certificate parsing contains a flaw where
it fails to check the Basic Constraints parameter of certificates in the
chain.

By signing a new certificate using a legitimate end entity certificate,
an attacker can obtain a "valid" certificate for any domain. For example:

-TrustedCA
--somedomain.com (legitimate certificate)
---api.someotherdomain.com (signed by somedomain.com)

Using this technique any SSL traffic using the api.someotherdomain.com
certificate can be intercepted transparently to the end user if the
attacker is in control of the network.

Revision History:

09/23/11 - Advisory Published

Remediation Steps:
This vulnerability has not been addressed at the time of this advisory.
Mobile users should be aware of this issue and proceed with caution when
transmitting SSL traffic.
