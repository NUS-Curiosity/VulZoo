Subject: Re: sshd logins without a source

Guys,

Let's not complicate this.

op: that looks like a line from /var/log/secure - this file only logs sessions, escalation and setuids, not ips. It is useful, in this situation, for tracing.

What do /var/log/[b|w]tmp tell you? Use the last command.

If this has been scrubbed then fine- these files can be scrubbed with a simple perl 2 liner, or rm'd completely.

Cheers.
