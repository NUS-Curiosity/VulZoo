hi GloW,

the bug appears real to me. ubuntu released an advisory [1] 
and debian have a bug [2].

ubuntu's advisory moderately hurt my narcissistic ego 
by not mentioning my humble name :(

i suppose they have a corporate policy to give credit to "whores only"
(this might be checked by examining which distros give credit 
and which write ``it was discovered'')

as a minor boost to my narcissistic ego, ubuntu's advisory 
didn't contain CVE(R) ID :) 

next time ubuntu hurt my narcissistic ego, i will try the black market for the bug.
