Subject: Re: Twitter URL spoofing still exploitable

Actually, I'm not sure if their first patch added this new exploit I
mentioned in my blog or it it was already there unnoticed,  but
twitter's last fix sure did break stuff.

They sort of fixed my URL spoofing method by disabling their URL
spoofing that made t.co's links look like the original URL posted in
the tweet. Now every link in twitter displays as http://t.co/something
!!!

Ok, now nobody can spoof a URL, but how come a user will tell good
URLs and bad ones apart? Oh boy!

I have updated my blog to include these details: http://ximen.es/?p=534
