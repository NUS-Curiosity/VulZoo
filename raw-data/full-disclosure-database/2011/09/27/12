	LulzSec member

Hope this sends correctly, new email client and all... But seeing as it is
an international investigation many people have been bending over backwards
to assist LEO on this. HMA and perfect privacy were the VPN's of choice for
them it would appear, oh, and he was part of the #pure-elite channel on that
IRC server, and hence, considered by LEO and others as "Part of LulzSec".

TL;DR, this is nothing new.
