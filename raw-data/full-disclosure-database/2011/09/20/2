The.. request.. has.. already.. been.. processed.  *facepalm*. ;)

The most obvious way to screw this up:

	if (request_not_validated())
		send_error_page();
	else
		execute_request();

and somebody forgot the 'else', making the execute a fall-through.
But how does something like that slip through basic testing?
