Subject: Re: Using QR tags to Attack SmartPhones (Attaging)

I like the idea of advertising a 'free * for your phone' around interesting
targets, perhaps posting fake adverts in the DC subway system? I think
people will trust print more than web and jump at the opportunity to scan
and install anything.
