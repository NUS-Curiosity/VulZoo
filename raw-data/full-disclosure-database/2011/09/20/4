Subject: Re: understanding the botnet C&C..

There were some trojans back in the day that would imitate normal browsing
(proxying cnn.com for instance) and it'd stuff a encrypted command packets
in there.
Combine that with a load balancing check-back time in the response, you can
probably support a very large number of bots on a single webserver.
