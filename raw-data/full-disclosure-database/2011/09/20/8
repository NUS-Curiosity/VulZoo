Subject: Possibility to exploit bash "*" processing


Brought this up a year ago. Seems that no attention has been given to
this so far.

See this screenshot for PoC:

here's a non-destructive PoC:

One solution would be to modify "*" processing so that it ignores
filenames that start "-" similarly as it ignores filenames that start
with "."

Or we could just train users to always type "--" before the list of
arguments. :)
