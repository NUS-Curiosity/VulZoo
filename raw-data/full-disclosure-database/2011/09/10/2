Subject: Re: Recent claims that windows update is broken

I don't think anyone actually believed this;  It sounded more like Joro was trolling on behalf of the blog monkeys :)

It really does make me wonder if the publish-whatever-we-see-posted-elsewhere-while-abandoning-journalistic-integrity-to-drive-ad-clicks model is actually working for these people.  I suppose it must be, otherwise these guys wouldn't be selling off little pieces of their soul with each article.

"I'm able to issue windows update," he [Comodohacker] wrote. "Microsoft's statement about Windows Update and that I can't issue such update is totally false!"

The original Comodohacker statement is at: http://pastebin.com/85WV10EL

Is this true?

For the record, no.  Windows Update doesn't just depend on WinVerifyTrust, it also calls CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy with the CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_MICROSOFT_ROOT flag, documented here:
