Erm, in March 2010 John Cartwright (list owner) had to introduce a
sort of "moderation-lite" procedure to deal with the way (it seemed
that) n3td3v avoided his ban by just signing up new user IDs with
which to spew his nonsense once his primary ID was banned.

*New* users are now moderated for a while after their initial signup
(not sure whether "a while" means time, or post-count), until they
have shown they're not an idiot.

See http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Mar/459

[Very good idea, IMHO, given the idiot factor that seems to show up
here from time to time]
