 security basics?

Hi,

No offence, I think you have a wrong perception with these companies, They
are not into Zero day !!! They are just vendor specific support companies.
you cannot expect an vendor specific support company to find Zero day and
handle operations support both at same time. Sorry buddy that aint possible.

I am working with the one you have mentioned what ever Vulnerability we
identify are either for our vendors and we are not allowed by contractual
agreement to published identified vulnerabilities to public
domain. secondly If  I am identifying some Zero day why would I share it on
behalf of the company name .

Hope this clears your doubt about security basics.

thanks,
