Secunia doesn't care about little fish no matter which pond they're in.

If an Indian software vendor created a browser and shipped as many copies as
IE or Firefox has shipped, I'm sure Secunia would show some hits.

Pick a few dozen Indian prodcuts that have shipped in fairly high volume.  Then pick
a similar sized sample of non-Indian products that shipped in similar volumes, and
see what the expected number of Secunia entries would be for each sample.
