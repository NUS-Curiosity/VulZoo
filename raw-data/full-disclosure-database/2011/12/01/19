Wonder guy, the basis of your conclusion are as ridiculous as your question. 

Microsoft and Google are products companies. Atleast TCS and Wipro are not. They are into offshore and managed business domains. Infosys is also into making custom solutions and they are all closed source. And none of the companies that you mentioned cater to the such a large audience as MS and Google do.

Are you going to start looking for every single company in secunia and come up with such preposterous  conclusions?
