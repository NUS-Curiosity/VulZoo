You are in a tough spot.   In general, the level of access you granted yourself in an unauthorized testing of the site would be considered illegal.  You may recall the whole 'or 1=1 thing.   So your approach to the client is all he would need to contact authorities if he so chose.  

Arguably, the best thing to do here would be to contact the owner and just give them the information for free, and do so in a way that does not implicate you in any wrongdoing.  Or simply drop it.  Moving forward, you might want to consider changing your business model so that you are hired to perform web app assessments before you start breaking laws.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Client aproach

Hi List,

I found some major design flaws and vulnerabilities on a local webstore, but now i would like to tell the owner nicely and maybe profit from it?!
Does anyone have some tips on how to inform a potential client of their vulnerabilities?

Thanks in advance,
Miguel Lopes
