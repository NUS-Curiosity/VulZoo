Infosys is also into making custom solutions and they are all closed source. And none of the companies that you mentioned cater to the such a large audience as MS and Google do.

Hi TAS,

I never made any conclusions. I only asked a question and it was not a
loaded question but a curious one. In case you missed it, here is the
question once again:

"I am trying to verify this by using Secunia. I can find plenty of
Microsoft and Google security vulnerabilities [
http://secunia.com/advisories/search/?search=Microsoft+Google ] but
none for Infosys TCS or Wipro [
http://secunia.com/advisories/search/?search=Infosys+TCS+Wipro ]. What
is the matter here? Indian software vendors are the best in the whole
world in security matters or Secunia simply doesn't care about Indian
software vendors?"

Thanks for the clarification that TCS and Wipro are not product
companies. But I heard that Infosys makes banking products. But
anyway, from all the replies to my email I am able to understand that
Secunia is not listing vendors catering to small part of the software
world. So that answers my question. Thanks TAS and everyone.
