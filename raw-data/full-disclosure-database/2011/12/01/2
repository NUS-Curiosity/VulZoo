Subject: Is FD no longer unmoderated?

A colleague of mine subscribed to FD recently and tried posting to it
but every time he gets this message:

"Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.

The reason it is being held:

    Post to moderated list

Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive
notification of the moderator's decision."

But the message neither gets posted, nor does he ever gets the
moderator's decision in a notification? What's the matter? Since when
is this list moderated?
