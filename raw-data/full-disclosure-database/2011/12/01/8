Subject: Client aproach

Hi List,

I found some major design flaws and vulnerabilities on a local webstore, but now i would like to tell the owner nicely and maybe profit from it?!
Does anyone have some tips on how to inform a potential client of their vulnerabilities?

Thanks in advance,
Miguel Lopes
