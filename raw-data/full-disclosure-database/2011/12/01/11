Subject: Infosys TCS Wipro like companies don't know
	security basics?

Hi Security Experts,

I have a question about the security track record of Indian IT vendors like
Infosys, TCS, Wipro etc. An article about Indian IT vendors by an
ex-employee of one of these companies is circulating in the different NITs
(National Institute of Technology) of India today.

My doubt is about this part of the article from
http://susam.in/blog/re-infosys-tcs-or-wipro/#engineers :

"Many claimed that I am wrong about the poor standard of training in
Infosys, TCS, or Wipro. I must tell them that I have attended some of
these training programmes. Among the many horror stories pertaining to
training in these companies, I'll share only one with you to make my point.
In the training assessments, the instructors set question papers
containing problems with code that invokes undefined behaviour and ask you
to predict its output. 'It Invokes undefined behaviour' is not provided as
an option you can select as the correct answer. Such training and knowledge
is not only inaccurate but also very dangerous if you care about robustness
and security of the software you create."

I am trying to verify this by using Secunia. I can find plenty of Microsoft
and Google security vulnerabilities [

but none for Infosys TCS or Wipro [

<http://secunia.com/advisories/search/?search=Infosys+TCS+Wipro%C2%A0>].
What is the matter here? Indian software vendors are the best in the whole
world in security matters or Secunia simply doesn't care about Indian
software vendors?
