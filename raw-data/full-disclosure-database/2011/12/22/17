Introduction:
=============
Small and medium enterprises are as much at risk as large enterprises from the targeted attacks of today. They need to protect their networks 
effectively from external and internal threats without a large security budget. Cyberoam CR50ia, CR100ia, CR200i and CR300i are powerful 
identity-based unified threat management appliances, delivering comprehensive protection to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with limited 
investment in financial and technical resources. Cyberoam gateway security appliance offers protection from blended threats that include virus, 
spam, malware, phishing, pharming. Its unique identity-based security based on Layer 8 technology protects enterprises from internal threats that 
lead to data theft and loss by giving complete visibility into and control over internal users.
