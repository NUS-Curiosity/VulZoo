Introduction:
=============
Whois.Cart() is a client/administrator tool that facilitates the many tasks involved in running an efficient
webhosting and domain registration business. The system will surgically undertake every aspect of your client
transactions; first the sale (which is most important and most overlooked), the collection of money, the
registration/transfer/renewal of domains, the provisioning of hosting space, and lastly the maintenance of all
these. A cumulation of countless development hours and thousands of user suggestions, Whois.Cart() is a
full-featured system that has retained the clean and simple ethic that most of its equal-featured competing
products have lost. It will undoubtedly become the most natural and effective resource with which you will
ever complement your business.

Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected on the Whois.Cart Hosting Billing Solution Software.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker or local low privileged user account to inject persistent script code like JS/HTML.
Successful exploitation can result in session hijacking, phishing & persistent content manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
								[+] hostinginterfaces
								[+] domain ordering
