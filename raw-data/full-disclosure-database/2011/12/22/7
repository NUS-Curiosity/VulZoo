December 22, 2011

CVE-2011-4167

- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

Hewlett-Packard



- -- Affected Products:

Hewlett-Packard Managed Printing Administration

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Managed Printing Administration.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the MPAUploader.dll file. An extended
length string can be passed into scripts within the management website
on port 80 (the 'uploadfile' multipart form data 'filename' parameter in
Default.asp) and ultimately to MPAUploader.dll. As a static stack
allocation is used to store the buffer and the string length is not
handled properly, a remote attacker may overwrite the stack and
ultimately execute remote code.

- -- Vendor Response:

Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
