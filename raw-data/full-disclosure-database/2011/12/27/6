'Hardware involved wetware attacks'

Abstract

Password recovery and information disclosure attacks involving
hardware resources are under-represented within the security industry.
With a growing number of attackers moving beyong pure cyber attack
scenarios into blended hardware on flesh methods combined with
automated software strategies to fully realize world class exploit
trees for maximum effect, this hardware involved wetware attack can be
ignored no longer. This paper introduces and details a wide variety
methods from simple brass knuckles or fist packs to elaborate mental
models of exploitation implying pain to the genitals, elaborate set
pieces, and trained performances. we show how this taxonomy of
coercion can be leveraged to extract passwords and obtain information
with great efficiency and efficacy according to a framework we put
