in infosec they call this "putting your mark on the world"

for those who play the game this is a feature, not a bug!

*yawn* when was the last time physical or emissions security was interesting?

even side channels are second tier these days. the microcomputer is a
microcosm of distributed systems, with rich attack surfaces at every
layer from bios to firmware to embedded components and offload systems
(themselves a fractal iteration of general purpose computing, within
general purpose computing, within...)

all before you even get to the software interfacing with this
malleable hardishsoftyware or the applications running top side.


turtles all the way down!
 with vuln crumbs or exploit feasts spanning decades, depending on
specialization and isolation of the technologies at hand.

your analysis is succinct and sane!
   this, however, is a negative sign given the subject at hand...
