Subject: Re: VLAN Hacking Tutorial at InfoSec Institute

This tutorial just rehashes ancient techniques in a general way in spotty
english.The insecurity of ARP among other issues listed are problems on any
layer 2 network and have little to do with VLAN. ARP flooding to make a
switch go into hub mode hasn't been an issue in decent switches for quite a
few years now.

The Cisco whitepaper referenced at the bottom is worth a read though
because proper configuration is indeed important:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/products_white_paper09186a008013159f.shtml

The @Stake VLAN security whitepaper is a good read also:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/si/casi/ca6000/tech/stake_wp.pdf

Most importantly, it says:

"The results of @stake’s test sequences clearly demonstrate that edge
technologies,
including tools such as VLANs on Cisco Catalyst switches, when configured
according to best-
practice guidelines, can be effectively deployed as security mechanisms.”
