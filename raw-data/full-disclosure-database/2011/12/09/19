Whilst I agree with what you have said the majority of computer users today are just consumers.
They expect their nice new shiny Win 7 laptop to behave just like their washing machine. Push a button and it does what is expected, they don't
expect to have to understand how it works nor do they expect it to do "bad things" when they are not looking. Occasionally a scam may make head
line news, but the attention span and memory of the average consumer is measured in days or weeks not a lifetime.

The marketing blurb from software providers be that OS or application does nothing to dispel this expectancy. In fact the marketing blurb does
it's best to hide any possibility of detriment from using the product from the user.

The user does blame MS or the Internet and very rarely their own incompetence in using the computing device. Why? because all the marketing
blurb for such devices avoids any indication that using said device may result in the compromise of identity or bank account.

Where does the advertising for computing devices state that the system is flawed? Nowhere. The consumer is given this image of a wonderful
device doing wonderful things. A device that would never bend them over when they least expect it.

The solution is either make the Internet and computers totally secure, or educate the user that the system, be that OS, application or Internet
is broken and they need to be on their guard against what may happen for every click they make.

I like to think I am somewhat competent. The last virus I had, the last compromise I faced was the Saddam virus on my Amiga. My confidence
doesn't make feel I that I will never be owned or compromised. There are far smarter people out there than I. The average consumer does not
think this way, they are drunk on the kool aid.
