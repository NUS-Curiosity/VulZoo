Whatever the case, the fact that this software *can* monitor and record the I/O (regardless of what it may or may not ignore) of a device means
it should be removed/blocked or fed noise by anyone who values their privacy.

If one doesn't have total control over any device that one uses to process info/data that one would rather not be shared, then who does have the
control and what will they do with that information? Targeted advertising is the least innocuous of possibilities....

But hey, I am talking to a list of people that should know this ;-) Sorry for not telling you something you don't know.

I use a Nokia 6170, must be getting on for 7 or 8 years old now.... battery is getting a little tired.

Take care... watch ya back

Dave
