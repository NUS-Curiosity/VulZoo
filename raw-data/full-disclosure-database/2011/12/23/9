Usability.

To begin with, most people click through the DANGER SCREEN warnings 
about bad TLS certificates. With this in mind it is obvious that a 
developer can't expect the average browser-using population to even know 
what a script is.

However, the string("not responding") + situation("browser gets stuck") 
resonates with the average retard, so this approach is sensible from a 
usability standpoint.
