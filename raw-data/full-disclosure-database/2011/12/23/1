Subject: Re: New awstats.pl vulnerability?

Here is an update on this:

Over the past week, we have seen the awstats activity continue, but
morph to include other vulnerabilities.  Details of this are at
http://foxtrot7security.blogspot.com/2011/12/attacks-against-awstats-also-includes.html
-- but the summary is that we have seen activity change to include
Local File Inclusion and command injection in phpAlbum and other
components written in PHP.

We started seeing today some activity related to phpthumb and
CVE-2010-1598...  Details of this are at
http://foxtrot7security.blogspot.com/2011/12/new-attempts-to-exploit-old-phpthumb.html

I am really curious as to the motivation of the parties deploying
these types of scans.  I understand that they would like to find
vulnerable systems to compromise... but for what purpose?  Sending
spam?  So far, based on what I am seeing, it looks like they are
compromising systems just to have those systems look for more systems
to compromise.  At this point, I have to assume that they are still in
the construction and building phase...
