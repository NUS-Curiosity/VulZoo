"Follow the steps below to download the magazine:

    Register, accept the Disclaimer and choose subscription option.
    Attention!
    By choosing the Free Account option you will only be able to download the teaser of each issue.

It isn't free.
For the price of an email address one can get a teaser of the full 23 page content.
It costs at least $220.40 for full copy.


Your post is misleading to say the least.
