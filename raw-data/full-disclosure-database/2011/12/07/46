ahh . lol, i think i misunderstood the post, because i was actually
thinking you meant that the *next* post up, was stating there was
23pages, and, this is indeed misleading.. lol, i totally agreed with
you, it is how the posts are structured i think i mustve seen your
'misleading' as meaning, the person who had originally said it was
misleading, was lying... thats why i said that :s , yea, i hate the
way this list is structured,well, maybe i just gotta get used to it..
top posting crap, sometimes pms get into it to wich gets even more
annoying. anyhow, sorry bout that, but, yes i agree, 1005 it is
misleading.
a. you must submit a 'real' email
b. it is 23 'snippets' not pages/full pentest kit like stated...

its another Insect pro, only, in a different form..
