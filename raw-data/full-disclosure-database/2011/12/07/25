Subject: Google open redirect

Problem:

Google suffers from an open redirect that can be used to trick users into
visiting sites not originating from google.com

Example:

http://www.google.com/local/add/changeLocale?currentLocation=http://www.bing.com

http://www.google.com/local/add/changeLocale?currentLocation=http://www.tubgirl.ca
