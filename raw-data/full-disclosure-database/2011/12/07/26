I'm very courious to know why Google is not taking caring about Open
Redirection issues.

I know what Chris think about it:
http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2010/06/open-redirectors-some-sanity.html

Anyway, IMHO I guess it's better and stealthier, from an attacker point
of view, to use an open redirection in Google encoding the redirected
domain than register goooogle.com and phish his victims with that fake
domain.
