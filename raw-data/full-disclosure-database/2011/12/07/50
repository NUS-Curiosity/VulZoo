haha well, good stuff...another flawed seller/spreader of shit is
uncovered, good work tomy ..

That bug is not one wich is , say, 0day, it is one wich auto updates
would have handled... i guess the guy dont know how to configure auto
uopdating, or , maybe likes his plugins for WP tomuch... wp has a bug,
but it aint there...lol... that bug, i believe, is due to not
updating... if im right...
Sad, that these are actually people who are making a magazine, about a
scene.. shows how bad the scene really has gotten..
good bughunt dude.. good stuff, you made a very valid point.
anyone who is selling or, trying to spread theyre word of ezines etc,
should ceertainly be ontop of webskils.. i know i am not, but i would
never try to publish a pemtesting mag either.. lol, crazy stuff!
