Hi Gage, thank you for your reply.  What you are missing is that by disabling kernel module loading you are applying a defense-in-depth strategy to prevent a *vulnerable* module from automatically loading in the first place resulting in root compromise.  I believe you may not be aware that some modules are loaded automatically if a corresponding special device is accessed.  Usually the userspace modprobe utility is executed though this can be controlled by the value of /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe

Preventing module loading has historically be a valuable way to prevent privilege escalation or further root compromise.  Such an example would be the 'ptrace' exploit, see http://www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/Ptrace.php

Historically there have been various kernel modules that are vulnerable that could be loaded by userland non-root programs or access.  Ubuntu likes to automatically load modules.

Removing CAP_SYS_MODULE or kernel.modules_disabled=1 make good security sense.  See http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=3d43321b7015387cfebbe26436d0e9d299162ea1 and http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=25354c4fee169710fd9da15f3bb2abaa24dcf933 and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#block-modules

The goal here is defense in depth.  Revocation of loading the kernel modules cannot be undone unless a system reboot is effected which should be highly suspicious.

The goal isn't about protecting ones boxens from a theoretical boogie-man it is to leverage all available and sane methods for properly securing ones box.  I see no point to to use these options.

Thanks,
John
