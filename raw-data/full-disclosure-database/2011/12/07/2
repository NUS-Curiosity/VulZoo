Just to play devil's advocate: this application has the potential to
do a lot of harm. Should we treat it like 'location data' from the
recent past? Recall that many companies denied using location data
without consent, yet one major operating system provider was using it
despite their claims. It spurred a number of lawsuits
(https://encrypted.google.com/#sclient=psy-ab&q=apple+lawsuit+unauthorized+use+of+data).

I really enjoy reading Dan Rosenberg, but I'm not sure its safe
because he has not observed any suspicious activity (and the carriers
say so). And I'm not sure I am buying Apple's "we distribute it but we
don't use it" claim (its sounds very fishy to me).
