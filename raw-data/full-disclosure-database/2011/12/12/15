Subject: Firefox forensics with SQLite Manager at InfoSec
	Institute

Hello, a recent article here on how to perform forensics investigations on
Firefox with SQLite Manager:

 

http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/firefox-and-sqlite-forensics/

 

This is relevant because it is easy to install, doesn't require you to buy a
$4,000 forensic software tool (Encase, FTK, etc.), and gives you lots of
good data on forms, cookies, addons, extension, SSL sessions, etc.

 

Your thoughts?
