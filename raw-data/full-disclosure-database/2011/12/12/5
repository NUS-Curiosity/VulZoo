I have not tried much, but I have not get ouside of glibc scope after the overflow within a controllable environment. In your video, It seems you overwrite the file structure used in __tzfile_read. Is this a constant and controllable behaviour?

I have not looked this yet, I'll take a look as soon as I have some time. But thanks for the additional information.

One important thing to note is in Fedora and RHEL, when running SELinux, vsftpd runs confined by default, and can be configured by the following booleans:

[rcvalle@...alhost ~]$ getsebool -a | grep ftpd 
allow_ftpd_anon_write --> off
allow_ftpd_full_access --> off
allow_ftpd_use_cifs --> off
allow_ftpd_use_nfs --> off
ftpd_connect_db --> off

[...]

[rcvalle@...alhost ~]$ 

And unless the boolean allow_ftpd_full_access is enabled, vsftpd may not be allowed to read this file by default. Could you cause this running the vsftpd installed from packages distributed with CentOS, Fedora, or RHEL? I'm copying Dan Walsh so he can comment on this.

Thanks for forwarding my message to the list. It seems that my Red Hat email address has not yet been approved. John, can you approve this email address please?
