INTRODUCTION

After 5 very successful editions we are off to the 6th edition of the
you Sh0t the Sheriff security conference and we are sending this off
so you send us the coolest stuff you've been working on.
The conference will happening on May, 7th, 2012 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
This is your chance to speak about that cool research you’ve been
working on, to those whom matter in the Brazilian Information Security
realm.

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE

you Sh0t the Sheriff is a very unique, one-day, event dedicated to
bringing cutting edge talks to the top-notch professionals of the
Information Security Community in Brazil.

The conference’s main goal is to bring the attendees to the most
up-to-date state of the information security world by mixing
professionals and topics from different Infosec segments of the
market.

yStS is a very exclusive, mostly invite-only security con. Getting a
talk accepted, will, not only get you to the event, but after you
successfully present your talk, you will receive a challenge-coin that
guarantees your entry to yStS for as long as the conference exists.

Due to the great success of the previous years' editions, yes, we're
keeping the same
format:

* YSTS 6 will be held at an almost secret location only announced to whom
it may concern a couple of weeks before the con
* the venue will be, most likely, a very cool club or a bar
(seriously, see pictures)
* appropriate environment to network with great security folks from
Brazil and abroad
* since it’s a 1 day con with tons of talks, we provide to everyone
coffee, lunch and booze


CONFERENCE FORMAT

Anything Information Security related is interesting for the
conference, although we strictly do not accept commercial/
product-related pitches. Keep in mind though, this is a one-day

We do like shorter talks, so, please submit your talks and remember
they must be 30 minutes long. (yes, we do strictly enforce that)

We’re also opened to some 15-minute talks, some of the smart people
around might not need 30 minutes to deliver a message, or it might be
a project that has been just kicked-off.
15 minutes might be your thing and that's nothing to be ashamed about.

you Sh0t the Sheriff is the perfect conference to release your new
projects, other people have released very cool research before they
presented it at the bigger cons.
And yes, we do prefer new hot-topics and, yes, "first-time" speakers
are more than welcome.
If you got good stuff to speak about, that's all that matters.
