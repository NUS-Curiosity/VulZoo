Sure thing. Complaining about patches that don't do
anything<http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2011/12/x-frame-options-or-solving-wrong.html>is
a plus to your reputation, I guess, right? Finding tangible solutions
to your problems means that eventually you'll loose the job.

Indeed, you didn't mention Firefox. Someone else did.

It's harder to predict how much it would take for a page to load,
as well as your caching concept will fail when the target in question
can only be invoked by the user. Also, there's the situation where
a simple click won't get you anywhere, for instance, in cases where
a user has to enter his credentials as well as to confirm the action.
