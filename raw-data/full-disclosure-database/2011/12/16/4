Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2778 

It was discovered that Tor, an online privacy tool, incorrectly computes
buffer sizes in certain cases involving SOCKS connections.  Malicious
parties could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially 
allowing execution of arbitrary code.

In Tor's default configuration this issue can only be triggered by
clients that can connect to Tor's socks port, which listens only on
localhost by default.

In non-default configurations where Tor's SocksPort listens not only on
localhost or where Tor was configured to use another socks server for all of
its outgoing connections, Tor is vulnerable to a larger set of malicious
parties.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.32-1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.35-1~squeeze+1.

For the unstable and testing distributions, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.35-1.

For the experimental distribution, this problem has has fixed in
version 0.2.3.10-alpha-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.

Please note that the update for stable (squeeze) updates this package
from 0.2.1.31 to 0.2.2.35, a new major release of Tor, as upstream has
announced end-of-life for the 0.2.1.x tree for the near future.  Please
check your Tor runs as expected after the upgrade.
