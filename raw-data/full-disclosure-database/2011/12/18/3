Subject: Re: pytbull update!

Hi,

I just released pytbull v2.0 alpha 1, which is a significant improvement
since last stable release (v1.3):

   - creation of a conf/ dir to store configuration files
   - dedicated configuration file for backtrack (SF #3439537)
   - configuration file is now dynamically specified as arg in CLI
   - sqlite3 support (results are saved in the database)
   - dynamic report with search and graphs (SF #3308695, SF #3306761) based
   on Cherrypy web server
   - bruteForce module rewritten, old multipleFailedLogins (SF #3310130)
   - new module: ipReputation (SF #3306115)
   - new module: normalUsage (SF #3439544)
   - status updated (SF #3439541)
   - denialOfService module updated (SF #3439539)
   - reverseShell sync issue fixed (SF #3450032)
   - offline option added (SF #3438624)
   - warning banner added (SF #3310129)
   - part of interactive menu implemented (SF #3310123)
   - support of pattern matching for all modules (SF #3308727)
   - support for ftp, sftp and ftps (SF #3306961)
   - verbose switch for debugging (SF #3306837)
   - grouping of all modules in a dedicated modules directory (SF #3306836)
   - tests syntax improved (SF #3306114) based on environment variables
   defined in configuration file
   - split between modules and classes (creation of a dedicated classes/
   dir)

I'm looking for *beta* testers before releasing the official v2.0 :P

To test, please use the new Mercurial repo:
http://pytbull.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/pytbull/pytbull

Thanks for your support :)
