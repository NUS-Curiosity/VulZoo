Vulnerability  : incorrect permission check
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4613 
Debian Bug     : 652249

The Debian X wrapper enforces that the X server can only be started from
a console. "vladz" discovered that this wrapper could be bypassed.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.5+8+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:7.6+10.

We recommend that you upgrade your xorg packages.
