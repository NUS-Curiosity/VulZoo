Subject: Re: WiFi Protected Setup attack code posted

WPS could have been fine, in that it would have forced an online attack that took an infeasible amount of time. 

It just didn't accomplish that.

My thinking is that they'll get this property back into WPS with some sort of blinding of the half-break state, but I haven't dug into the vuln enough to be sure.
