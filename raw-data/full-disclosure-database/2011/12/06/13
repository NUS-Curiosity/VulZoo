If I ever stated that, it means I misused my poor english for sure... I DO 
have root access and I DO own the server, where the server means the *guest* 
OpenVZ instance. I DID configure iptables yesterday in order to block 
outgoing connections. What I can't do is upgrading the kernel because OpenVZ 
is a limited "paravirtualization" system where the guest kernel it's more 
like a stub on top of the only shared host kernel. I have no control over 
the host kernel, so I can't upgrade it.
