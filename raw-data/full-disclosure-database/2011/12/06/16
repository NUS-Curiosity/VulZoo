Nothing is impossible, security wise. However I'd talk about likelihood 
instead. I own two other OpenVZ containers hosted in the same host OS. They 
haven't been compromised, though they're very similar systems (Debian based 
instead of Ubuntu).
The one that has been compromised is the only one having a online shop and 
greater network traffic.
