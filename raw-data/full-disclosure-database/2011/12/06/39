This is an advance notice that security support for Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 
(code name "lenny") will be terminated in two months.

The Debian project released Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 alias "squeeze" on the 
6th of February 2011. Users and distributors have been given a one-year 
timeframe to upgrade their old installations to the current stable 
release. Hence, the security support for the old release of 5.0 is going 
to end on the 6th of February 2012 as previously announced.

Previously announced security updates for the old release will continue 
to be available on security.debian.org.
