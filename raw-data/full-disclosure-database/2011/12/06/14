Subject: Re: one of my servers has been compromized

I'm not sure if this has been said in this thread yet, but is it
possible the host O/S was compromised? I have not used OpenVZ but I
assume it's the same as Virtuozzo in the respect that you can just
'vzctl enter <ctid>' to get a root shell inside the container with no
password (assuming you have control of the parent O/S). I have come
across a Virtuozzo server before that has been compromised. When I had a
look, as far as I could see the only thing they appeared to do was copy
a Perl script to each container, execute the script then delete it.
