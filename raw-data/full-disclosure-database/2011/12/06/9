Thank you for the kind words and I consider it an honor to have been helpful.  I do not have a blog.  I have enjoyed this thread, sharing what I know, and learning from it.  Perhaps one day I will start a blog and it may be a house along the road where I can share what I have learned.

Thanks,
John
