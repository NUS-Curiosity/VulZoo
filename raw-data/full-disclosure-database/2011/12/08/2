Subject: [HITB-Announce] HITB2012AMS Call For Papers Now
	Open

The Call for Papers for the third annual HITBSecConf in Europe is now
open! This year, we're moving to a new, bigger and better venue -- the
award winning Okura Hotel right in middle of Amsterdam with easy access
via public transportation. #HITB2012AMS will be a quad-track conference
featuring keynote speakers Andy Ellis (Chief Security Officer, Akamai)
and Bruce Schneier (Chief Security Technology Officer, BT)!

#HITB2012AMS will also feature a brand new attack and defense Capture
the Flag game aptly called "BankOverflow" run by the HITB.nl CTF Crew in
collaboration with the OWASP Netherlands team!

In addition to all this, there'll also be a new CommSec Village -- an
area aiming to bring together not only the various Benelux hackerspaces,
but also participation from the open source communities (Ubuntu, OWASP,
Mozilla, Gentoo etc) alongside the usual Lock Picking Village run by
members from TOOOL.nl and of course the HITB SIGINT sessions - 15 minute
talks held during the coffee and lunch breaks with a focus on
highlighting up and coming research and researchers.

As always, talks that are more technical or that discuss new and never
before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has
been covered several times before.

Submissions are due _no later than 18th February 2011_
