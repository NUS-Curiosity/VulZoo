There are decent solutions to lock down some classes of open
redirectors (and replace others with direct linking), but "Referer"
checking isn't one of them. It has several subtle problems that render
it largely useless in real-world apps.

There are also some classes of redirection / content proxying problems
that you can't quite eliminate until you give up on offering certain
functionality to users (e.g. page translation, cached document views,
embeddable <iframe> gadgets) - and that's actually an interesting
conceptual struggle.

I actually wrote that bit, and as far as I remember, it's not a
half-assed attempt to justify incompetence ;-)

We have a vulnerability reward program, and it's just about not paying
$500 for reports of that vulnerability - along with not paying for
many other minimal-risk problems such as path disclosure.
