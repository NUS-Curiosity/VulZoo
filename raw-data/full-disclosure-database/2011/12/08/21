Though it's easy, it's a fun example to see how PHP can behave. Such
behavior might sometimes lead to security issues.

A: Keep it simple. Choose yourself. Explain us your choices when needed.

Q: Huh, may I do fuzzing, bruteforce & other l33t techniques: antiSEP..?
A: Pfff. Bro, let's do it with your own style. You don't need advices.

Answers will be accepted till next Sunday noon GST [Gulf Standard Time].

Q: Why a so quick challenge ?
A: Cause it's just a quick (&dummy) PHP challenge.

A: Cause.. Well, I know what you did last summer.
