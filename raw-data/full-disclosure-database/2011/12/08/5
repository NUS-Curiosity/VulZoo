Subject: Re: Google open redirect

As for minimal risk I personally don't agree. I have leveraged Unvalidated
URL Redirections in the past to attack clients of sites all the time. It's
highly trivial to point to a site with a metasploit browser bug patiently
waiting and amass quite a large number of sessions in a short period of
time should your spam campaign be efficient and actually draw users to the
vulnerable site.

Just like with XSS, being able to drive clients from one site to another is
a huge security risk, not for the company, but for the clients of that
company which will quickly point fingers at the company for putting them at
risk in the first place and while I agree that the researcher shouldn't get
paid the full 500 bucks some sort of compensation for keeping Google's ass
out of the fire should be presented to the researcher; even if it's just a
friggen $100 Adwords coupon to help the researcher drive traffic to their
site at the very least.

In the end, until someone leverages one of these vulnerabilities in a large
company and pisses off a lot of clients and causes the media to go after
the company, I don't see many product vendors or large websites giving two
shits about vulnerabilities such as this which is both sad and a fact of
life.
