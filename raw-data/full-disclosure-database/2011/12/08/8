I run with no script. So the links showed on the initial pages and when clicked. The same address as the links appeared in the address bar when
I clicked the links.

Running with scripting enabled and clicking the do it button caused this to appear in the address bar: "data:text/html;np.cx/beaver/"

I do online banking and being paranoid I do check the address bar and look for https and the "verified by: VeriSign, Inc" popup when mouse over
the domain. If anything even slightly suspicious occurs when connecting to my banking logon I will inspect the certificate and may even examine
the page source depending on how suspicious I am that my bookmarks may have been compromised or the page is not what I expect it to be.

Obviously many users are not this paranoid else wise phishing would not be as successful as it is.

Dave
