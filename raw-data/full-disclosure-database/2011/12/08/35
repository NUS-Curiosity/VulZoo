I was assuming web vulns found in Google´s Infrastructure, and not
vulnerabilities in general as I imagine Google wouldn´t condone selling
vulns on their systems to the highest bidder.

As far as crimes commited during the process of discovering the vuln
itself, Google expressly authorizes security testing in the program:
http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/rewardprogram.html

But for vulns in general, I totally agree with you.
