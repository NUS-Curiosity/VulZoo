Well, I usually support adopting business models into processes that help
society, so I would agree with you on the "monetary philosophy".

But the strategy here isn't (as I understand) driving pro's into the
program, but getting rid of unilateral vuln disclosures that happen mostly
without direct monetary compensation. So, I thing Google's program is
directed to those that already are willing to gain no money for their work
in disclosing vulns. Again, this is just my point of view.
