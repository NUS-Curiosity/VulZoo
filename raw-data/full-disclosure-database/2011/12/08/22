Don't be strange, was I not specific enough?

I think people should be encouraged to do the work,
if they are good enough to find something that nobody else has noticed yet-
and all of these "cash for bugs" programs have me a bit annoyed.

Not offering the money for issues that they claim to offer for issues
is not only dishonest but it is discouraging to beginning researchers.

I've personally seen it happen.
