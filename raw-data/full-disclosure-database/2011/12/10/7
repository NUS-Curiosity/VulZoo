Looks Like I won Michal. Where's my prize?

Clever stuff.

This kind of thing has occurred to me as system and indeed network/broadband speed have increased. One time a flashing of a neon on a router or
modem or the a flash of a window on a desktop gave some indication of data ingress or egress. Nowadays it's done and over with before the user
even realises something is afoot.

I had to enable Javascript though. I guess I trust you not to burn my ass. There are not many links posted on this list which I would click with
javascript enabled.

Thanks for your insights and the education

Dave
