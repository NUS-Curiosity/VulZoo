Subject: NiX API CLI/Online version - A powerful free IP
 Reputation Lookup API

Querying IP-address against the NiX database will help you in case of
abuse. The following information will be provided if the IP is listed:

IP Country/Region/City
Data Center Details (Currently over 68 million hosting provider IP's are
listed)
Satellite Provider Details
Open Proxy Details
Tor network association

CLI version download: http://nixapi.com/NIX_API_CLI.txt
CLI version screenshot: http://nixapi.com/NIX_CLI.png
Online version: http://nixapi.com/ip-reputation-lookup

If we look at sources for exploit scanning, forum spamming, fraudulent
activity and so forth, this IP is likely listed in the NiX database. IP
Reputation Lookup feature should catch most of the unlisted IP's that may
have a bad IP reputation.

Hopefully some of you find it useful, it has been over one year work to
create this system.
