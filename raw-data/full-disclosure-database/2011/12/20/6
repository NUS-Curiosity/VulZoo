It's neither, but could be construed to be a security feature.

It's a warning to indicate that a javascript included on the page is taking
an excessive amount of time to return control back to the UI.

Unlike the sandboxed javascript model in Chrome, when scripts spin out of
control in FF, they could take the browser down with them. This check
attempts to shutdown scripts that are consuming a crazy amount of resources
and/or are no longer functional.
