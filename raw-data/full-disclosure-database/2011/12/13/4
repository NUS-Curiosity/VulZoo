Exactly the point - that's how most transitions are done.

However, if you want to start off in an SELinux context that can read locale_t,
open the file, chroot, and then change to another context that can't reade
locale_t, then you're going to need to use setcon() in the process rather than
just letting execcon based transitions letting it happen.  And at that point,
you just bought a hole bunch more headache, because now you need to do setcon()
*securely* rather than just get transitioned into an ftpd_t just by getting
exec'ed.

No, but if user A and user B are in different sensitivity levels, it's even
more loads of fun to make sure that the ftpd can get to the proper sensitivity
level for each user via setcon() without botching it.
