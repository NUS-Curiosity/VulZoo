Signons – this is a repository of all places that the user has kept
their username and login stored in the browser. All the passwords are
hashed, but using rainbow tables they can be guessed depending on how
the user manages password security.

Can you elaborate on that?
I thought  that just extracting the profile directoy and loading it on a
portable installation is enough to view saved passwords..
Firefox needs to be able to use their plaintext-version when logging on
a website form, so it needs to use two-way cryptography.
I guess you just mean "if the user set a master password or not", or am
i missing something?
