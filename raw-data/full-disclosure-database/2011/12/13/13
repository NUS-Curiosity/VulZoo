4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Sterling Trader,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in Base.exe when
processing network requests (code 176). This can be exploited to cause 
a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted packet sent to 
a certain TCP port.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but
requires guessing the TCP port, which is dynamically assigned.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Restrict access to trusted hosts only.
