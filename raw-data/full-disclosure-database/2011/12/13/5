Subject: Re: New awstats.pl vulnerability?

Hello,

It certainly happens. It's very random who scanners decide to hit. You may
have JUST been crawled and passed around several lists as possibilities. To
put some perspective on what you're seeing, the company I work for has
about 3k clients and within the past hour (just checked now), we got abut
5,122 attempts for this one vulnerability in our environment.
