Nice.

That's a bit like the "backlink" ("bl") one from the settings page on 
the mobile page that Google fixed a week or so back after the spammers 
had been hammering away at it for a month or more.

That is the very long-known "I'm Feeling Lucky" search open redirector.

Again, the spammers used that for ages, but I was fairly sure that it 
had been fixed.
