Does anyone have additional information about this vulnerability?

It looks like it can be exploited by requesting:

http://[X.X.X.X]/admin.cgi/[any or no filename string].css

Although http://gregsowell.com/?p=3428 states: "The exploit appears to be a
flaw in the admin.cgi file(CORRECTIONâ€¦IT IS ALL PAGES SO WE WILL BLOCK ALL
CGI)."

However, this last runs counter to what I've seen so far ...

Thanks,
-Chris
