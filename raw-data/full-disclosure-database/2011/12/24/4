Subject: Using hardware to attack software

Folks on this list may be interested in a recent whitepaper talking about types of attacks that leverage PC hardware to attack local software.  Hardware reflected injection, anyone?

Paper is available at http://www.forristal.com/material/Forristal_Hardware_Involved_Software_Attacks.pdf

Thanks, and happy holidays!
