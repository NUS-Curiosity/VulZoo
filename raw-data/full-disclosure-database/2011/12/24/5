Hi Tomy,
After you wrote us now the second e-mail we want to make something very
clear to u and everyone @ vs-db.info & ariko-security

1. Your website is serves no point other then records of the databases
that u dumped... because of the fact that you guys hack illegal into
web-servers and dump the databases and do not notify the vendor.
You guys tell the researchers around you that you do some security stuff
... i think you guys are just fucking criminals. Thats why nobody
respects the work you do anywhere.

2. Some weeks ago another ariko-security member asked us ...  why we do
not work with you guys (vs-db.info & ariko-security)? He also asked us
multiple times for selling the dumps of hacked databases!?
To answer that once more we are not interested in selling stolen
information as said many times before.
Why ?!  Mainly due the fact that this is a *criminal *offence.
And so a no go in our vision for the future of vulnerability-lab.com

3. Also if you view in context what we do vs what you do there is no way
we want to work with you.
*We*
- *Inform *vendors
- *Verify* vulnerabilities/bugs to ensure validity
- Disclosure after *contact *with vendor or after multiple tries to
contact the vendor
- Discolsure policy
- Try to *protect *vendors and customers of those vendors

*You*
- *Dont* inform vendor
- *No* Discolsure policy
- *No* verfication other then a picture
- Selling of *illegally* dumped databases/information to make money

4. If so that you say that you are all that good an you are so awsome in
what you do why is a 1.5 year old bug (if this infact true) still
unpatched when we found it!?
Sounds to me that u dumped the database then probably sold it off and
then forgot all about it. Instead of contacting the vendor/webmaster etc.
So clearly you have no idea of what working in security is about. Your
are only trying to rape the benefits of a trick that you know.

I hope that you see this as a *wake up call* and *warning* as next time
we might not be as friendly.

Best Regards,
The Vulnerability-lab Team.
