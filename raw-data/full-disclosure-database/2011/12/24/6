Subject: Re: Sunny WebBox Default Password

I like in the description of the product, "The Sunny WebBox is a multi-functional, energy-efficient data logger which offers a wealth of options for displaying, archiving and processing data, even in networks with strict security regulations."

                                                                                                                                ^------- Neat.ï»¿
