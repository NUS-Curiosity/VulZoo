thats indeed true, nevertheless I have seen boxes in the wild
with vsftpd running with anonymous and write access in
/var/ftp, maybe because this security measure was built into
vsftpd in newer versions ? I am not sure.

I think it is not the default setting but many admins will make use of it in
hosting environments.

I havent checked that but as you said in a private conversation
cacheing the zoneinfo file through glibc beforehand makes the zoneinfo file
usage disappear in my strace output.

For me it is a miracle why this bug was not patched in glibc back in 2009.

Here is the patch by you Chris I hope I can go ahead and post it here
on full disclosure
as this might get into a new release anyways (use at your own risk!):

Add this to the very bottom of vsf_sysutil_tzset():

---snip---
 p_tm = localtime(&the_time);
 if (p_tm == NULL)
 {
   die("localtime #2");
 }
 p_tm = gmtime(&the_time);
 if (p_tm == NULL)
 {
   die("gmtime");
 }
---snip---
