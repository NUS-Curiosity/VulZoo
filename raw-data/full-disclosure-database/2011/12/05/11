Subject: Re: one of my servers has been compromized

You could ch-root your apache process/webserver going forward. This would
effectively stop the malicious process when/if your machine is compromised
via web based vulnerabilities to spread to entire machine.. meaning your
area of investigation is more isolated.

I'd expect if its automatically spread to your box the vuln would be some
sort of exec via PHP or similar -- do you have php/many client sites with
outdated software/forums/message boards/image uploaders/ anything like that
on there? .. or just badly coded bespoke dynamic/cgi scripts generally..

Ps. Did you take a copy of the bot code before you deleted it? :) would
like to see it.
