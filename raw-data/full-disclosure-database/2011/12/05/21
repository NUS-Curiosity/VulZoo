Well, I actually made 2 mistakes and the second compensated the harm the 
first did...

My second mistake I did not mention before was to overlook various other 
folders in /tmp that were older than /tmp/.m and contained lots of other 
crap (so they are even more useful in finding the original attack vector, 
being older).

However I did save the original launcher found in /tmp and all that older 
stuff too for analisys.

Using dd on /dev/mem and piping results through netcat it's not that 
difficult, and a bit of google explains how to do it the right way, but in 
my case there are two other problems:

1. The attack took place several days ago and it's likely the system ram has 
been overwritten several time since then

2. My server runs in a OpenVZ container (it's a hosted vps)... /dev/mem 
exists but it's obviously not accessible.

However I understand your point.
