I'm conflicted here, though I do agree with what you say.  A simple attack lacking any sophistication whose goal is simply to drop an IRC bot and nothing more may result in undue expense through effort and analysis.  Conversely, assuming that former does not confirm the scope of attack or impact...  I'm conflicted but I agree with your assessment.

Perhaps in this situation one would be more likely to fall back on the output of the defense in depth tools previously recommended.  In this case they are not available so perhaps caution is wise as you have suggested.

I think it reasonable to assume a documented and vulnerable out of date world-accessible version of PHPMyAdmin is likely the initial attack vector.  The Apache/PHP logs should prove this to be the case, so rebuilding a box and disabling PHPMyAdmin may be a reasonable response to this incident without the need for forensic analysis... depending on the organization.  If this box is a singular VPS I think it reasonable, if it's a part of a larger system which could be leveraged as a launching platform to attack other LAN or organizational-owned boxes then by all means a comprehensive analysis should be undertaken.

Tim thanks for your thoughts and reply.

Thanks,
John
