Subject: Re: one of my servers has been compromized

In addition to the tips given (chroot, disable shell_exec,etc), you
should also use open_basedir with DocumentRoot as path on each
VirtualHost. In case of a compromise via webapp, this will reduce the
compromised zone in the filesystem to the DocumentRoot of one
VirtualHost instead of the whole chroot jail.
