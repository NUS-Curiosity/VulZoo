That's not a bad generic suggestion, but it won't do a thing for this hack. 
They deposit perl scripts in /tmp/.m and then run them by calling perl, 
which is not in tmp.  This is a very common hack of a poorly written web 
application.  I doubt seriously that the "box" has been hacked - only the 
webserver is affected - especially based on his description of how he found 
and got rid of its elements.  (IOW, they didn't get root on the box - they 
only compromised the web application and then ran shells in perl off of 
that.)
