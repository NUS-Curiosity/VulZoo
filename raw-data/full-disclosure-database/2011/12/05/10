No, it's just common saying. I apply patches, change password regularly, 
move ssh to nonstandard ports, disable remote root access and do all the 
rest I've learnt about security in years of running linux servers, also if I 
couldn't believe they would hack my server. I only overlooked a piece of 
unknown-third-party php code. It's just experience that makes you stronger.
