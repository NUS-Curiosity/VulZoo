anyone who said "security feature" is an idiot and/or not thinking clearly.
your security is harmed by malicious script in milliseconds.
this does nothing to protect you from anything.*

it is purely a usability feature in response to shitty developers
writing shitty webapps leading to excessively long script execution
(which can thus be terminated if desired once this warning presents)


* someone may say "availability is a security requirement!". true, but
then a modem link to web 2.0 is a DoS, and there's simply no point
going down that road...
