Subject: Re: Large password list

I am at a lack of words for this, why pay $4.99 when you can just do
some simple googling? You can even search pastebin and get a mass
collection of password lists from dbases. Add a dash of awk and maybe
a pinch of sed and viola!

If you are like me I always download and store the various dbase leaks
because it makes an awesome dictionary. Some more simple magic and you
have a cut down list of all the common passwords used.

I'd rather spend the money on some coffee to drink while I do the
above examples.
