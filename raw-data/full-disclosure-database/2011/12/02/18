Subject: Re: New FREE security tool!

Thats not the main one :P

Checkout INSECTPro tool ;) but, thats metasploit v2 nd v3 i
believe...and alot nicer than this,...same author... i have a copy,
but he wont let me know, if i can use my copy, to pull updates from
git ;'(
I assume that means, the pirated copy i have, must work fine, aslong
as it is just that...pirated...and checkout his
explitpack.com/downloads/ very interesting files there yesterday...
hehe... pentesting the testers... i guess we all get that... but,
insectpro is available waresd....im sure of it.. alot bigger than his
exploitpack tho.. i would not mind if exploitpack stays in python, it
might inspire many coders who do code but, only py, to code more...so,
i see some of his stuff as cool but then, he made insectpro, a drect
rip off of msf ,wich is the bad side...
