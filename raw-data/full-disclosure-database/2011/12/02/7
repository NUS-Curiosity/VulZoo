Subject: Re: Large password list

This is what whitehats would probably class as a 'blackhat' , the sad
thing is, i bet NO blackhats, really like this.. not serious ones.
Its sad, your a pathetic person, resorting to online theft, to cover
your bs demands, as pointed out, what 'costs', for keeping, stolen
data... ? ONLY the cost, You are, to the community.
your called a bad scourge, and bad example of a hacker.
I wish you and your website and service, are overthrown, your a fool,
and, you suck. i hope feds are pulling you apart. amigo.
go fk yourself, rot.
your NO hacker, your 'wanker' go whack d1ck sum more.
Bad sad kid with some sqli...well, sadly, you should NEVER post
criinal activities, to a list like this, are you stupid or, just
fucking REALLY STUPID??

Idiot....
You are NO blackhat,and NO hacker.
