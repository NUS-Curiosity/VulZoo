Subject: Re: Large password list

Very true... most hashes like, 'lol' and such, are usually around,
12345 is, all the main weak ones are google'able...
I do like people like openwall.com, BUT, they do A. contribute BACK to
community through owl linux, and, provide lists free, you can
optionally buy 700megs for about 20bux, I know i did buy theyre cd, so
im guilty of supporting owlOS , and tho, we are also speaking 700megs,
and access to gigabytes of lists here... 4bux for 20megs is a joke :P
