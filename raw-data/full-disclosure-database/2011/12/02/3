Subject: Re: Large password list

There are many password lists already available for free out in the wild
but mostly lack the quality.

The minimal fee for UNIQPASS is necessary to help:
- keep ongoing effort to improve the quality of the list over time
- ensure frequent updates, i.e. when new leaked databases appear (existing
users of UNIQPASS get updated copy for free)
- cover cost of upstream bandwidth, the list is currently at  64MB
compressed and new versions are likely to only get larger
- reduce abuse
