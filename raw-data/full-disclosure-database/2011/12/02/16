Subject: Re: Large password list

Or simply, use openwal.com who atleast do something and have an
oyutstanding os... they do not charge on that basis, and also the
socalled hash, if you look in the 3 offered fiiles, theyre all same
length of digits, i am not even sure what hes offering, because, i
assume that is a decrypted list...not encrypted, yet he has *_hash.txt
there,wich is same length as other txt files, same ne line, 5 digit
kinda list... not even a 1234 :s lol... its very ambiguous, and id
beware that it is just not a flare, to get ppl to visit, to infect,
other ways...
be careful guys...

l,theyre cdlists, and a million others linked to them :s
its kinda stupid.... and, hopefully it dies... like, shutdown.
