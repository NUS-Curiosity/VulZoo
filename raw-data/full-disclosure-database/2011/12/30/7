Vendor description:
-------------------
".NET is an integral part of many applications running on Windows and
provides common functionality for those applications to run. This
download is for people who need .NET to run an application on their
computer. For developers, the .NET Framework provides a comprehensive
and consistent programming model for building applications that have
visually stunning user experiences and seamless and secure
communication."

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The null byte termination vulnerability exists in the
CopyStringToUnAlingnedBuffer() function of the webengine4.dll library
used by the .NET framework. The unicode string length is determined
using the lstrlenW function. The lstrlenW function returns the length
of the string, in characters not including the terminating null
character. If the unicode string containing a null byte is passed, its
length is incorrectly calculated, so only characters before the null
byte are copied into the buffer.

This vulnerability can be leveraged into an authentication bypass
vulnerability. Microsoft ASP.NET membership system depends on the
FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(username, false) method for certain
functionality. By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker is able to
log on as a different existing user with all the privileges of the
targeted user (e.g. admin).



Proof of concept:
-----------------

Detailed exploit information and source code references have been
removed from this advisory.

An attacker is able to bypass authentication in certain functionality
using null bytes and log on as another user, e.g. admin.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerability has been verified to exist in Microsoft .NET Framework
Version:4.0.30319; ASP.NET Version:4.0.30319.237, which was the most
recent version at the time of discovery.

More information regarding affected versions is available within the
advisory of Microsoft:
