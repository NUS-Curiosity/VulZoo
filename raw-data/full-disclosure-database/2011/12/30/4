Advisory DSA 2363-1 did not include a package for the Debian 5.0 'Lenny'
suite at that time. This update adds that package. The original advisory
text follows.

It was discovered that Movable Type, a weblog publishing system,
contains several security vulnerabilities:

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code in a logged-in users'
web browser.

A remote attacker could read or modify the contents in the system
under certain circumstances.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.3-1+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.5+dfsg-2+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and for the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
4.3.6.1+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.
