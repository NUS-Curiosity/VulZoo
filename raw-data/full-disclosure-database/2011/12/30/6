1) Introduction
===============

>>From vendor's homepage:
"Golden GatewayÂ® software is designed to run on Texas Instruments (TI) Digital Signal Processors (DSPs). The software, which powers voice, fax and data modem transmission over the Internet, is inside products made by industry leaders such as Cisco Systems, 3Com, Nortel Networks and many other leading voice and data communications equipment manufacturers. "

==========================================
2) `show rctp_info`
==========================================

Executing `show rctp_info 1` results in system failure due to a critical process being terminated. The show command is normally used to display system information and should not result in application termination.

$ nc 172.16.1.1 4159

The DoS can be initiated remotely by simply sending "show rtcp_info 1" to the MXP shell. During some of our tests we were unable to regain internet connectivity until the device had been unplugged. In the event that connectivity is restored spamming "show rtcp_info 1" to the MXP shell will ensure the device stays offline.

3) Impact
===========

As mentioned on the vendors site the Golden Gateway Remote Command Processor MXP Debug Application is included in many embedded networking devices. "The software, which powers voice, fax and data modem transmission over the Internet, is inside products made by industry leaders such as Cisco Systems, 3Com, Nortel Networks and many other leading voice and data communications equipment manufacturers." This remote denial of service was discovered in an SMC D3GNV DOCSIS 3.0 Multimedia Voice Gateway which provides voice, wifi, and cable internet capabilities. This vulnerability _may_ be found on any device that allows unauthenticated access to the MXP Debug Application shell.


#######################################################################

==============
4) Workaround
==============

Restrict access to port tcp/4159 on devices that are allowing unauthenticated access to the MXP Debug Application.
