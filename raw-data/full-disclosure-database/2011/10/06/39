Please note that one of the biggest complaints about the GPL is that it is
pretty much impossible to legally combine GPL code with code that has a
non-GPL-compatible license (which includes most proprietary code).  So you need
to be careful about the origins and licensing on each and every line of code
that you include from other sources.
