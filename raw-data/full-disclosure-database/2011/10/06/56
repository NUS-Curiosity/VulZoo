One of the good things about the GPL (as opposed to the BSD license), is that
you *can't* take GPL code private - if he's adding it to the proprietary app
and shipping the result under a non-GPL license, he's in violation of the GPL
and could end up in court.  A lot of embedded hardware people have gotten
into trouble that way.  The *vast* majority have cleaned up their act and complied
with the GPL requirements by either removing the GPL code or releasing source
as required by the GPL.  A few have been silly enough to let it get to court,
and have universally been handed their butts by the judge.
