exposed! and it is rubbish.
5 exploits, i even pointed him, (in pvt) to a million py files he can now
deface... and he acting like, hes all for the author being in the
sploit..right..ye.. and nice use of xml ...

this is worse thing, i have seen, i have seen better made bash exploit
packs.
sorry, again your stuff is a complete fail.
not even the main exploits, who the heck cares about ftpds like, 10 students
use.. you are maybe in need of guidance, wich, i doubt anyone will give
after these lies your pulling... telling ppl, your doing the RIGHT thing,
when your git pull says different!
i alsio have a giot hub, and understanmd how it works,. so stop trying to
stooge people dude, your stuff sux.
and when i tried to seperate links, into different downloads, like your
download page specifies.. it does not work and always gives the base, wich
is linux. only. i believe...unless osme, small tweaking/batfile made for
win32..but, you advertise the win32 binarys..so, your just fake.

....pls explain..why your acting like, i am a liar, when, your removing the
author, from even the exploits now... cheeky,and very rude to me personally.
screw u and ur pathetic crap, open or closed,it is a waste of time.
