Re: putting things in the public domain: Daniel J. Bernstein and Lawrence
Rosen (of Creative Commons fame, I believe) seem to disagree with you on
that: http://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html

Plus, pretty much the only 'license' djb uses is public domain, so qmail,
djbdns, etc. are all public domain. Incidentally, SQLite (*not* written by
djb) is *also* public domain, and very widely used, too.

As for being sued for public domain code... I would say it is hard to sue an
owner that does not exist (which is what public domain seems to do). Plus,
they would probably have to prove malice or something.

(I personally still wouldn't do it though!)
