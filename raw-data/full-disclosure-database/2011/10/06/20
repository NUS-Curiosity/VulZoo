Subject: Re: New open source Security Framework

As you might know, or not know, Exploit Pack is working without any
foundation, company, governement and money-giving guy.
There is no professionnal coder, programmer that is paid to develop this
program.

I have tried to ensure that the name of the exploit author is seen in all
the software.It was my bad pasting the license there, but hey! Im human give
me a break you troll.

The next time would be better if you post it in the right place, GitHub.

And in fact youre trying to blame here.

Exploit Pack is licensed GPL let me copy & paste the 4 freedoms. I hope to
do it well this time.

The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom
2).
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
(freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
this.

Let me ask you why you are spending so much time annoying this GPL software?

I hope next time get a patch of code from you and no nonsense again.

Like I said to lroot. The same goes for YOU. If you want the right to demand
certain things from the program, then go BUY a program and do not harass
people who are writing software for free, or go and help the developers by
writing the functionality yourself.
