Subject: Re: Strange Lenovo x121e

hrm...
I have known of this structure aplied, usually when a user is a 'newbie'
and, it is usually still done by shops or, workers at them... and, i was
originally thinking, maybe since i have also got blade IBM,but, I bought it
FROM MS directly and, nothing on it but empiness, and this is 2 machines we
bought at once...
IBM x342 PIII 1.4ghz 3U Rack Server - IBM 86695RX
-3U rack, small but as the MS emplyee told me, it MUST be completely
shredded,and sits on now just cmd prompt, and there is absolutely no files,
even for scsi, wich was first my thoughts.
I am really wondering what it was used as, like possible ex test/demo....
but, I know 2 pl other than me who can attest to this, and they have not
seen these files before, not in theyre blades from IBM.
I have not used Lenovo x series, although, i only can think of those things
added, if they think your a noob, in wich case it would have been specified
that it came with 'system utils to make it save itself.." or sum such other
infos.. but, i assume thats not the case atall.
Anyhow, i think this box was preused, but, i think if it was, to a minor
degree..altho, my blade, has NOT a scratch on it, and was pre used to..
hehe..so i really wonder, what does it take to even scratch a x1 :s
Theyre thick...and, a scratch could be nothing but, attests to wear n
tear... so i qwould be questioning my seller, for sure, and getting somekind
of discount, id also show them these files, and, even quotes from the FD
list, and i bet you they will say some kinda excuse, and refund you abit ;)
this should be wiped, on any sales, it should never be more than a cmd
prompt, and then, you would fdisk it and format it to use it perfect, you
should never have 13gig on windows os, considering those are also used for
windows ofc, but, still the seller should say that, "15gig taken up for the
system checking/saving/admin files..." , but clerarly they have tried to
cover something up.
I would expose this one hd. 100%.
You can..
regards,
xd
