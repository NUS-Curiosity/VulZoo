Subject: Full-Disclosure - sick of your nonsense

Dude, I think many people including myself are sick of your 
nonsense on top of trying to provoke fights on full-disc.

This list is not for chatting and 90% of what you've written is 
subpar.

Please keep the nonsense to yourself. You will now be added to the 
n3td3v e-mail black list.

Cheers!
