Juan,

You don't have the faintest idea of how licencing works. You cannot slap
a GPL v3 license to any software you see, much less erase the author's
names. If you find a code in the internet without any license, you
pretty much can't touch it, and must re-implement it completely.

Software business steal code all the time, but they don't release the
software for everybody to see!

Next time instead of a few laughs at a list, you may get sued and lose
real money, you fool.

Please learn how licensing works and just then republish all your code.
