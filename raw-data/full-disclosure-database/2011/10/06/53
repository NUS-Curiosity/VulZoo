Hi Valdis,
it is more complex than i thought...
I do support open src, and am going to try and help the exploit pack, so, i
hope that the maker is reading all of this and making some adjustments
perhaps... alot of them actually.
I did not think it was as complex as it has shown to be, but it indeed is.
I am still abit worried though, of the actual NON free prouct, and then,
what if you add to that, and he adds it to his paid-fopr app, or worse,
doesnt even put it into the exploit-pack but, rather puts it into ONLY the
paid product.
Being .py script based code, it really has potential but the author has to
get the GPL/lisencing in order and, make Insect pro and this product cleared
up,asin to where your exploit code goes, will it stay there, or will it be
added to his paid app... he could even be doing this, to get cheap exploits,
to indeed put into the paid app... it is another possiblility, but, i do see
he is putting in the hours, asin trying to make some changes to this app so
it does work... so, for now, it is in public.
cheers.
xd
