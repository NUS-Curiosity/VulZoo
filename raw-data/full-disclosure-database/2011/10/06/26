Subject: Re: New open source Security Framework

root_@...ertel.com : I know you don't have any experience with open 
source projects, but this is not the right way.
Next time you should try doing it well.

Go to GitHub and write the change your own. The community will moderate 
it and then you will see your proposal applied.
To be clear. The license on the script you mention is the license for 
all the software not only for the script. Oki Dokie?

1. This is not a chatting room
2. This is not Exploit Pack Dev list

Having that in mind:

If you feel like you have to really make another nonsense question 
after you read all the thread.
Then and just then. Send a email to Exploit Pack Dev list.

Please check: http://exploitpack.com/faq
And: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html if you continue having 
question about GPL v3

I already make a change on the git repository for you root 
root_@...ertel.com.ar and your friend xD 0x41  secn3t@...il.com, hope 
next time you expend two cent for this project.
