GPL V3 is encumbered. Software released under it should not be
considered 'free' because of the entanglements. Its why Apple is stuck
at GCC 4.2 (and the reason they bought LLVM). Its the reason OpenBSD
and other projects don't want use GPL V3. Its simply not free software
under GPL V3.

Perhaps an Apache or BSD style license would be a more appropriate choice.
