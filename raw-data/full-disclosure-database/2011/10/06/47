I think you came close buddy, but noway do you come close to that n3td3v
dood...Although, you are usually one of the people i look to on this list
for some guidance, ie, you, thor, halfdog,madirish,and many other
older/better trained to this, and that one did let me down, but no way would
i scrap you for a n3td3v :)
cheers.. just gotta b careful nowdays, specially if your in .au where, there
is basically no racism... not to the extent of gangs etc setup who are
attacking other people for race...color,etc.. well, not yet.
stay cool buddy
