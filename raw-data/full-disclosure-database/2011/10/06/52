By that I take it you mean, systematic genocide? Where I grew up the school mascot (high school) was Benjamin Logan, an in(?)-famous Indian killer who not only murdered Indians, he wiped out entire villages massacring men, women and children in most of the villages in the area to eliminate the "native threat" for the white settlers.
