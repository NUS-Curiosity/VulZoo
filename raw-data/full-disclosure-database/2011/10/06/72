Hrm very good point there.
It is obviously monitored, but really, would the mnitors, even get involved
in things... i dont know if that is just part of how to stay under, but
could be.
I do not know how mi5/6 works but, i have heard rumors, that he is wsome
form of undercover something... wich is kinda cool with me.I would prefer to
know that, or even think that, than think he is a bad guy and, just being an
arse because he can be...
i would love some independant input from people who are working as
operatives, as Valdis said,it is good to see these peoples input, especially
on some topics like ITsec and exploits/pocs and anything wondeful in this
area.
I know i am fine with that but, amazing to howmany actual results point at
n3td3v as this... i certainly wont be using crazycoders.com/.us for any
posts for n3td3v,but sertainly other peoples blogs, are full of him/he ?
Anyhow.. enough for me, cappucino time.
cheers,
xd
