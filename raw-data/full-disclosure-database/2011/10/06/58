Well, I guess then people nowdays should be keeping more watch on ANYTHING
they release into public... It is just going to get more complex i assume,
with adding more lisences, as creative commons has kindly done.. however i
do like theyre lisence, as it actually covers a .txt file, or even a .c
file... wich is mainly why i have used it once in past for some code, so I
could then keep an eye on it, but never have looked atall, at GPL.
Anyhow, thx Valdi for shedding more light on things.
