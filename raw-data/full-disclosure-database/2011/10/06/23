Subject: Re: New open source Security Framework

Hey.. I already gave you an answer about this.

AGAIN. For the last time.
I respect the author's name of all the exploits added to Exploit Pack, like
you suggest in a terrible and way.. Insulting and posting like 10 mail to
the this list. I will add a " # Thank you [AUTHOR NAME ] for let us use your
public script " in the top of all new exploit added to Exploit Pack
Framework.

** Also, I created a mailing list to discuss this kind of things, report
bugs and much more ( But sorry, NO INSULTING is allowed there )  **

As other people told you stop doing chatting here. This is not a forum.
