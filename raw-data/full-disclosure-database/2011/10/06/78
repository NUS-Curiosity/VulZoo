Yep. Though some are probably not nice people, the Guantanamo Bay
detainees were denied US Constitutional Rights (so said the US Supreme
Court, 3 times).

The folks who perverted our highest laws and precepts were not brought
up on charges, or even censored. Sparta had it right: put the
politicians on trial for their [alleged] crimes when their term is up.

Who are the real terrorist against our [US] democracy?
