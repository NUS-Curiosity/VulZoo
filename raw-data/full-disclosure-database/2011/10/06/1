Hrm this one is tricky, but smells so bad of preuse, specially when you said
this;

* Inside seal on plastic bag also intact, but glue is suboptimal, I
opened the bag without damaging the seal

Thats a clear sign of tamperage...thats when they tell you "do not buy" ...
so i wonder :s
I know it could be any -THINK pad/box, but i also know that Lenovo did buy
IBM boxes, wich still bore the seal of IBM and IBM hardware,then i believe
when Lenovo started pumping these out (in have about 6 of the P4 dual-cpu
ex-demos here), i saw on a complete wipe i did, nothing, no files left, and
these are actually lenovos, disguised as Ibm, or, so it should be according
to the dates.. IBM name must be able to be used also on lenovo products, i
just wiped 4 IBM wich were only one yr old, and they seem clean :s, so, i
went thru fdisk etc, nothing weird...
Is it perhaps something being leftover, from some badly warezd ISO Windows
install...wich can lay dormant, even after a format but, not after fdisk
usually... strange, i cannot figure this one.
It smells of pre-use, or ex-demo, but, i have got, 3 ibm netvista 2cpu
boxes,1 3.3gig awesome IBM thinkcentre,fastest box i have as in loading/swap
access,and IBM Blade,IBM laptop, and not one has those files...i even paid
for ex-demo on the laptop, and it was installed...
i can only see *no* good reason for .exe to be on the drive, after a sale.
It should have always been wiped/fdisk/shredded, as I know i have had done
withthe ex demos i have here, and, they are part lenovo and part IBM and
still, not one of those files exits on any box, and the laptop wich, i
thought would forsure have something, if any of them did... but nope.
I dont know this one, but, i will try and ask a friend who works with IBM
and see theyre practices, and try get his own quotes.
Anyhow, cheers.
