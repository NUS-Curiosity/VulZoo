In particular, if code was written in a country that's a signatory to the Berne
conventions, it's usually somewhere between very difficult and impossible to
actually place a software work in the public domain - at least under US law,
even putting an explicit "This work is hereby placed in the public domain"
quite likely does *NOT* suffice - the only two clear ways to public domain in
the US are expiration of the "lifetime of the author plus 75 years" copyright,
and "works for hire by a US federal government employee as part of his duties"
(so, for instance, NASA photographs are public domain - but photos of NASA
activities taken by non-NASA photographers probably aren't).

Also, smart programmers *don't* release their code into the public domain -
that means that anybody can do anything with it. And that includes stealing it,
using it to make tons of money, and then suing you if they discover a bug.  The
original reason for the BSD and X11 licenses was because you can't stick a
"hold harmless" clause on something you public-domain.
