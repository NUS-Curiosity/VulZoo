Subject: Net SAPO flaws and vulnerabities

There is several flaws in the SAPO internet service in portugal that allow
certain tasks to be made.

. Unautorized internet access
. Obtain sapo username and password
. Obtain subscriber phone number
. Obtain name, address, tax number, etc
. Activate aditional sapo services

REMOTE ADMINISTRATION

. Target a specific device
. Block sites (antivirus for example)
. Read user info via DHCP (mac, pc name)
. DNS Hijack
. Open internet to anyone via fake WAN

Since i dedicate a few days on this one i will not disclose in detail
(software + technics used). More info via mail or phone.
