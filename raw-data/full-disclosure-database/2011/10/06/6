Yeah, but I've also got trained fingers. And applying stickers on
completely fresh plastic surfaces can be tricky, especially when
plastic foil was surface-treated, so that it does not stick to itself
before being manufactured to plastic bags.

I think, I have a good explanation: I looked through the files and
found quite a mess, even for MS-system. Even c:\ is loaded with
various nonstandard files. Many of these files are around testing
(testplan xy, fantest, modemtest, mark3d, ..) and test orchestration
scripts, one of them setting the clock back to 2010-01-01, so file mod
dates should be meaningless.

It seems, that the machine contains at least 13G of windows-OS and
testing software. I found some test reports (dated 2010-01-01), that
contain the hardware tag of the machine. The BIOS seems to be
2011-06-21, that is also proof for clock manipulation during testing.

What could be interesting: Although I found some tools via google,
e.g. rw-everything, a "hardware configuration reader/dumper", there
are also some tools I do not know, that might deal about branding or
special hardware initialization, e.g.

./WWAN/Leadcore/BAK/IMEI.TXT
./WWAN/Leadcore/IMEI.TXT

with different IMEI in it. Perhaps the disk contains some new tools
that allow to reset broken hardware/firmware internals to any state
you like, e.g. perhaps the imei of your modem.

I do not know, if all systems have this "testing" image on it or if
just one device was lost during quality control, but to me it seems
highly likely, that somehow a test-branded disk made it out of the
lenovo (or partner) production site.

I've put a file-list at
http://www.halfdog.net/TmpData/sda1-filelist.bz2, so that you can make
up your own picture, if you want to.
