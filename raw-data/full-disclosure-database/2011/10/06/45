So what you complaining about? The fact that you follow the rules and the statement that you quoted is correct, that what he said is obvious to
those with an IQ in double figures and need not be uttered or that the pres of the USA is not a redneck?

I hope you are not a racist and this was a poor attempt at humour for the world sucks because of those who want to persecute others for not
being the same colour, sex or facing the same way when they pray.
