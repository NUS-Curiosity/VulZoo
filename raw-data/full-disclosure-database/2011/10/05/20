Definitely agree there. Some of the civil cases are disgustingly bad, due to
there being no media attention and no real oversight. The civil case
mentioned above is a good example, and all of the excessive child support
orders even further that.

On topic: I haven't read every single reply here, but from what I've seen:
no one has mentioned the VPN provider being held personally responsible.
Being that the attacks originated from machines they own, if they failed to
turn over user information, could it really be that difficult to pin the
attacks on them and convince a judge that they were responsible?
