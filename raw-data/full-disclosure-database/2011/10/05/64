Dont be angry about it, but, you could atleast give credit to those, your
paying a whole 2$ to, or even if NOT paid, you should leave AUTHOR name
INSIDE the exploit, maybe thats why it is being molested ?
GPL is fine, but, you are seen as a bad dude, simply coz you dont give
simple credit, and rather, add a patch for the thing to remove the autho, i
mean, why not allow let ppl atleast see authors nickname/name.. it is not
nice to those who put in theyre time, to help YOUR project, for whatever
reasons, and, i love github, and, this has nothing todo with github, but, i
am saying, you should never rename stuff, just take a look at 1337day.com,
or , is that yours also ;p
have a lovely day, i will look at the project, if i think it is decent, i
would even buy, a pirated version... etc...etc... you know how it is, one
copys out, 100 copies is really outtt ;)
its all good bro, keep up the good work, just leave authors names maybe,
remove email is fine, but you shuld leave author name, so ppl know maybe,
wich things will be better/more reliable code, or stabler code, perhaps,
than other authors... or, is that wrong to assume... i sure, would not like
to see some code i have wrote, on there, without atleast saying #Thanks to
xd for this one.
it is one line dude.
take it easy, dont flame up.
