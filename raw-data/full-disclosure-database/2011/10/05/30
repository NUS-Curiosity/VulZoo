Subject: Re: VPN providers and any providers in general...

I still think press drives many and more takedowns, and bends the arms of
others to.. for sure.
I know of a case here of petty crime, but is relevant ok, the guy had many
many, and big charges of murder,manslaughter, in other states within
australia, but was asked for his name, in 'vic' , wich (about 10yrs ago -
pre babybrother to usa) , draconian like laws enabled police to yes, put ppl
in jail for this.
So, he took the temporary jail, and monthly, would b brought b4 the judge,
and asked again eveytime for the name/address so his infos could be checked.
each time he would return... waiting for laws to change.
evtually, they just had no room, and threw him out with a slap ion wrist
fine... then later, they could not do crap about his murder etc, and he is
still free t this day, simply by doing alittle bit of that time, and, not
taking the *definate 15+* :P
Smart, and only would happen NON usa, but yes, USA and USA press has TOO
much power in court, altho online, I think the press if it gets involed* it
is always seen as big, because since when is ITsec involved?only wen you
hear of mass fraud...etc....so, any case would become classed as "oh must be
fraud or sumthin BIG for them to get arrested..."... is indeed fact... but,
it does take sometimes the press, or others, to simply expose it.
many cases are, self explanatory but, some cases are really interesting...
although, laws change somuch in usa, it is scarier than the other scary bits
;p
cheers,
xd
