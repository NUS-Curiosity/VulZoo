Pre-use is strange:
* Cardbox says: manufactured 2011-08-04
* Cardbox seems authentic (YUEN FOONG YU PAPER SHANGHAI PLANT CO., LTD.)
* Thinkpad sticky plastic tape could not be removed without cardbox
surface damage, was not damaged before opening
* Inside seal on plastic bag also intact, but glue is suboptimal, I
opened the bag without damaging the seal
* Bought in Austria 2011-09-23, seems that those machines were already
on stock for some days.

So 50 days with shipping (15000km oversea?) seems quite narrow for
pre-use, but one can never known ...

Also nice: Power on hours: 15 (now its 1:20, I started 18:30, so I
should have caused about 7h power-on time). How long would factory
equipment take to put 320GB image on SATA?
