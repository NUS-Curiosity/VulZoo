Did you actually read the link you pasted?

[...] and "criminal penalties *may not be imposed on someone who has not
been afforded the protections* that the Constitution requires of such
criminal proceedings [...] protections include the right [..]

Then take a look at the actual rights being referenced. Most of which *would
be violated* as a result.

In response to 0x41 "This is ONCE you are actually in front, of the
judge...remember, it may take some breaking of civil liberty, for this to
happen... "

No, you're absolutely right. That's the point here. Contempt is attached to
the previous court order, there wouldn't be a new judge/new case for the
contempt charge alone. All of it is circumstantial anyway, especially due to
how much power judges actually have (in both criminal AND civil
proceedings).
