tl;dr: Doesn't matter, you can end up in the slammer anyhow.

Actually, the general rule is that if it's a civil proceeding it's only civil
contempt.  Refusing to comply with warrants or subpoenas pursuant to a criminal
proceeding could very well get you criminal contempt.  And even in civil
proceedings the judge can stick you in jail till you decide to change your
mind.

And we're certainly discussing a criminal proceeding here.

Journalist Judith Miller got to spend 4 months in jail for refusing to cooperate
with a grand jury investigation.

And this dude spent 14 years in jail on a *civil* contempt charge:
