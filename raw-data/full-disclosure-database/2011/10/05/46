Attrition stopped making their lists of defaced sites years ago, and it was
pretty damn accurate - it was *kind* of like a Zone-H of sorts. (I quite
like Attrition).

Sony incident is interesting, how badly they handled it. They should have
just fessed up right away, and apologised, bringing network back online ASAP
rather than piss off people as much. However, it did not affect them too bad
in the end.
