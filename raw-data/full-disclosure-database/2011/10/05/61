Subject: Re: New open source Security Framework

Out of interest, I was considering asking - what is all your opinions on
using Metasploit (via RPC) as the "shell handler" in an exploitation
framework? I was considering writing a fork of Fimap that used one.

Well here, i can say, I have recoded theyre whole fingerprinter for rpc/smb
and it r0x. In windows, is worth doing 10x. Awesome handler for exploiting,
and the updated ones look even better... although, i am mainly using a cpp
fork of theyre rpc-smb fingerprint host-attack... very very good.
