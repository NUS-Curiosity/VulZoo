Subject: Re: New open source Security Framework

When I saw this I too thought "Insect". Though still, I dont recall Insect
having an exploit editor or ANY way to add modules (insect used a Metasploit
install IIRC), but it DOES remind me (scarily) of CANVAS. Might check it out
later.

Out of interest, I was considering asking - what is all your opinions on
using Metasploit (via RPC) as the "shell handler" in an exploitation
framework? I was considering writing a fork of Fimap that used one.
