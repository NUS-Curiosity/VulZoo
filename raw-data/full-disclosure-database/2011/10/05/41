OK, I'll bite.  What percent of Attrition listings are of sites that didn;t actually
get hacked? (Serious question there - I've never actually done a check of their
accuracy.  Anybody got numbers to back up Robert's claim?)

And I'm not sure that an Attrition listing is sufficient to ruin a good reputation.
Heck, Sony won a Pwnie Award and it didn't do squat to their stock price.
