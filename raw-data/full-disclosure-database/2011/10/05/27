Agreed. I know the ACLU gets a lot of flack for stepping on peoples' toes,
but no matter what their *alleged* agenda is - they've done a whole lot of
good that would have otherwise never existed. Same with the EFF. It gives,
even if only a tiny amount, some hope in situations where you'd otherwise be
completely helpless.
