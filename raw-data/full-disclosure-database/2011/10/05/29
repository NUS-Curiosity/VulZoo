Subject: Re: Apache 2.2.17 exploit?

(using an old account I must have set up a while ago named w000t).

err..but, you ran it didnt you... so why would u need any old account :P
hehe... just... something wich i find strange.
I dont see any support would be good here :) lol.... i betting he does ONLy
patch to stop the thing being re-rooted, as it has become public since
posted onlist ;)
hehe.... you shuld really not let him do much, if thats even true, wich i
really am doubting... specially since u named this old account...when, also
saying u tried to run it..wich would, exec shellcode...so i guess.. once
cleared up, and if true, i know this is done by MANY smarter hax, and, your
IP if it was ran, prolly also gets emailed somewhere, somehow... or, some
alert made, or maybe, not.. but, if he was so fast to login then i wonder...
but, then, he is only stopping it, frok other hackers, not from, other nice
guys :)
