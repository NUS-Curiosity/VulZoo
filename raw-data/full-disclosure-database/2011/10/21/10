Interesting. Clear write-up.
I'm not a Windows guy but the article led me to research this:

http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=windows+file+dialog+changes+cwd

Isn't that the most significant contributor? An application carefully
puts its CWD somewhere sane and then the underlying operating system
flips it around later? Might that also cause non-determinism for
multi-threaded apps? Does the problem affect Mac, Linux users?


Cheers
