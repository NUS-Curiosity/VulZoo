Depends entirely on circumstance and the severity of each crime, also
depends on country A's stance on all of it. It's entirely possible that the
person be tried and convicted in country A and then on release, be
extradited to country B and C for the crimes committed there.

No one can say definitively though, especially without knowing exactly what
crimes had been committed, the severity of each crime, and specifically
which countries were involved.
