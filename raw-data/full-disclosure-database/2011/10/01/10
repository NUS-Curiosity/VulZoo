Wikileaks will likely end up being the exception (not the rule), so I'd take
the entire case with a grain of salt.

Also, an example (though not cybercrimes) is Frank Abagnale's extradition.
Twelve different countries wanted to extradite him, but only a handful of
them were actually able to. It's also very interesting how he ended up back
in the US. His passport was revoked, thereby forcing Sweden to deport him
back to the US - where he was able to avoid prosecution from Italy and other
places where he had committed fraud.
