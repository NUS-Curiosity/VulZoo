Iraq, for all its problems, is still a place with a somewhat functional
judicial system. The court system may be broken, but you in general *will* at
least appear in a courtroom with a judge and be pronounced guilty before you're
punished.

I was actually thinking more along the lines of  totally failed states such as
Somalia, Sudan, or the contested parts of Afghanistan, where you can't be tried
for murder because there isn't a court to try you *in*.
