Good q,
I think B and C would have some juristiction, depending on crime impact ofc.
yes indeed, if one of those countries is say USA and the hacker has used X
to rip off A for huge huge amounts of say crecitcard injections... then
forsure something is there, or, they would make it on the spot i am sure, if
it were usa :)
I wonder though, about australia, and uk and some other  smaller countries,
they may not... wich is, the greyish area still... but, i think it is crime
impact on this one, and country a or b, being a power,politically,press
wise, especially..
It is a good case to watch the Assange, as theyre basically doing just that
now with him, creating the laws needed to create the extraditions... or so i
believe.
Although his case is abit cloudy , the rape being connected with, wikilkeaks
for example..
But, that is where they make things up even, to create press,crime
impact/victim impact, is taramount.
regards,
xd
