Subject: Re: VPN providers and any providers in general...

Quick question regarding the extradition stuff. Say hacker X was caught in
country A, for cyber crimes in country A, but had also comitted crimes
against servers in countries B and C. Would B and C have any right to
extradite him/her or would they merely be tried for said crimes in country
A? (assuming country A brought them to trial in the end).

Anyone have a definitive answer?
