Subject: [Tehtri-Security] SPIP CMS fixed (0days)

Gents,

Our CTO discovered two vulnerabilities in a well-known CMS product named
SPIP :
	- a local path disclosure (all SPIP version)
	- and an SQL injection (SPIP 1.9.2 branch)

Technical information were notified to the SPIP-Team for fixes
(responsible disclosure, with fixes included). SPIP is now patched and
latest version can be downloaded (see further).

If you want more 0days and more offensive tricks, check how to join us
through the end of this email ;)
