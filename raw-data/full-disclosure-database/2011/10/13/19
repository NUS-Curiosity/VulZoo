I simply acknowledge the fact that some people work hard to get "obscenely
rich", but I just can't stand people that cause damage for the fun of it.

Yes, I stick for everyone that minds his business, instead of ruining
others' for the fun of it.

What bothers me is the fact that those hypocrites (protesters) are crying
out loud against some people they're highly envious of with the excuse of
"the depression".
Well, here's the news; the famous depression has been brought about by these
same people!

If someone above is collecting free money because of incentives for people
to spend money (and which seem to work well), I can't blame him.

How many times in your life have you paid back something you received by
mistake and which wasn't yours?
While I would foremost applaud anyone that would right such a wrong, I just
can't ignore the fact that those people out there representing the "99%" are
big-time hypocrites.

On a different argument, since you seem to know well enough how some of the
1% are doing immoral things, why don't you start by handing out names
instead of talking air just as the "99%" crowd has been doing up till now?
