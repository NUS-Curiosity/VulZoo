List'
Sorry for taking a role of "moderator".
Pretty often we see discussions around politics on this list. It seems to me that it is natural. It reflects that we are the people and have certain concerns which live in us together with professional stuff. We cannot avoid outbreaks of such discussions. This list is a part of our life though.
Suggestion: assign one day of a week to "release steam" and talk whatever we want to. "Purists" can just ignore discussions on that day.
And as usually: "you are right, and you are right too".
Cheers and be patient.

Mikhail A. Utin, CISSP

Very nice.

All the pictures make it very easy to take in quickly. It should help those who don't want to take a detailed look at the issues. If I could only get it on my etch-a-sketch....

Nicely put.

Too bad folks in the other OT thread on this list (and around the world) don't feel the same way about economics -- and other things, like healthcare, for that matter...

Its all about manning up and making yourself secure in whatever way that means to you, no matter how futile everything ultimately is. As we exist within a thin, delecate biosphere wrapped about a rocky conglomerate hurtling through cold, uncaring space and have only arrived in our current state after millions of years of lethal evolutionary struggle it is shallow to think that we have somehow arrived at a special point in time and struggles no longer apply -- and that now all that must be done is write a few laws and freedom, liberty, information privacy, jobs and free bags of money will come pouring in.

Nobody cares about your problems, your health, your liberty, your freedoms, your life or your privacy but you. And nobody can be compelled to be concerned with such things, they themselves being in the same situation. Laws are a fancy way of attempting to coerce the government monopoly on violence to enforce a sense of caring within society, and this always fails (and is usually, in the ultimate irony, centered on money and materials, the very things that "caring" isn't made of in the first place).

This applies whether we're talking about "my online privacy" as if it were a right, "my healthcare" as if it were a right, or even child education or employment.

Hi Guys,

First and foremost, apologies if you feel this is spam- don't mean to, just trying to harvest some knowledge... I am looking into the overall cost of a hack, trying to figure out what kind of actual costs are incurred by businesses when they are hacked, so a few things:


   1. Do you have any real world figures you would be able to provide me,
   officially or unofficially- that would reflect the real cost to business of
   hacking? These Include:

                   A. Any cost for personnel repurposing.
                    B. Any cost of resources for Bandwidth, Cloud Computing Cycles Consumed, or other miscellaneous expenses associated with an active attack.
                    C. Cost of regulatory compliance updates ( So, say someone is inside of PCI compliance during an attack, the cost of re-upping their compliancy and any associated costs.)
                    D. Hard losses due to product stolen/destroyed/rendered useless
                    E. Projected losses due to customer turnover and/or loss of customer trust relationship.
                    F. Customer Interaction/Trust Relationship Costs (Notifications,Call Center Volume Redistribution for Questions regarding breach, Discounts)
                    G. Losses due to fines and lawsuits
                    H. Cost of Public Relations Management

I am trying to come up with some idea of what the real cost is, not just the cost that corporations cite when they want to look like they are paying the price already for their "sins" but not enough that stockholders take notice...

Thanks for any/ all help and or flames

Similar was recently asked on SecurityFocus mailing list. See "financial loss estimates? ", http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/105/520013/30/0/threaded.

Funny how accurate your statement is about those who "don't want to take a detailed look at the issues." Those are the ones making all the noise.

I would like to draw your attention to the Featured Comment at the bottom of the article. It is spot on and a critical counterpoint.

The entire article is full of leading indicators and trailing indicators, but arguing them as if their meaning were reversed. The most interesting part about all this is looking at them with an eye to predictive analysis. The charts show that we are not in uncharted territory, and that corporate profits in a down season is a leading indicator in a sharp reduction in unemployment (that is, job creation) and another prolonged boom cycle. This will eventually be interrupted by a sharp, short recession, like the one now. The charts used in this article do tell a story, and its not the one the whole 99%/1% argument crowd is about.

That is a good point Jeff, all the more reason to push for change and reform.
