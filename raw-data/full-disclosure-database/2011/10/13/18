I would say that the life we have is significantly less than the 1% and 
pretending otherwise is just silly, the 1% have a majority of the money 
and power and have manipulated the system to give them even more at the 
expense of the 99%, its gotten to the point where those in power are 
blatantly doing illegal and immoral things because they know they can 
get away with this. They quite literally destroyed the economy for the 
99% just to make themselves a profit *and* they won't be held 
accountable for it. I don't care if someone is wealthy or even obscenely 
rich, what *does* bother me is to knowingly cause so much damage to the 
global economy for their own personal gain, that is just *insane* you 
are the first to complain about the cost of damages that people like 
lulzsec/antisec do but you don't blink an eye at the people who quite 
literally destroyed the economy...in fact your sticking up for them.
