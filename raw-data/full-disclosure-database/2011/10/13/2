Nicely put.

Too bad folks in the other OT thread on this list (and around the world) 
don't feel the same way about economics -- and other things, like 
healthcare, for that matter...

Its all about manning up and making yourself secure in whatever way that 
means to you, no matter how futile everything ultimately is. As we exist 
within a thin, delecate biosphere wrapped about a rocky conglomerate 
hurtling through cold, uncaring space and have only arrived in our 
current state after millions of years of lethal evolutionary struggle it 
is shallow to think that we have somehow arrived at a special point in 
time and struggles no longer apply -- and that now all that must be done 
is write a few laws and freedom, liberty, information privacy, jobs and 
free bags of money will come pouring in.

Nobody cares about your problems, your health, your liberty, your 
freedoms, your life or your privacy but you. And nobody can be compelled 
to be concerned with such things, they themselves being in the same 
situation. Laws are a fancy way of attempting to coerce the government 
monopoly on violence to enforce a sense of caring within society, and 
this always fails (and is usually, in the ultimate irony, centered on 
money and materials, the very things that "caring" isn't made of in the 
first place).

This applies whether we're talking about "my online privacy" as if it 
were a right, "my healthcare" as if it were a right, or even child 
education or employment.
