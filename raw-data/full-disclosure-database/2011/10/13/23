Sparta in the Classical age and earlier was not a democracy. They were
a set of invaders who had enslaved the native Hellenes in the area (as
opposed to buying slaves or capturing slaves in battle, which is what
the other Hellenic city-states did), and which had kings and enforced
military servitude from approximately ages 8 to 50 or so. And,
actually, Athens, though it was the Western birthplace of democracy,
free speech and all that, wasn't a very pretty society itself. Aside
from the primitive state of technology, they were a religion- and
superstition-bound society to a degree that most modern cultures would
have difficulty comprehending.

Not something I think we should emulate.
