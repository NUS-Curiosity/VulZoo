Well, you said "nor do I care" so I too am confused.   However, since you did ask, there is an important aspect to your retort that you seem ok with dancing over, and that is the fact the "taxing millionaires and billionaires" would be *additional* taxes.   Mine won't go down, and in fact, will probably go up.   And I guarantee, without question and as definitely as the sun will rise tomorrow, when whatever "x" population is taxed more, and whatever "resolution" these people think will come from all of this noise, that they will CONTINUE to bitch and moan when other people have more than they do.  

The premise of "I am the 99%" or your use of "average" is specious.  Average what?  Income?  No, that can't be it.  Education?  No, that's clearly not it.  Average tax payer?  Certainly not.   "Average" person bitching about how they don't have what they want and think it should magically be given to them?  Well, that's more like it, isn't it?  

The entire movement is a waste of time, and the "let them eat cake-ers" will find that out, as they always do, when they become the ones that have to start baking.  

The reason I posted the link is because it's freaking FUNNY to call out the ME-TOO'S!  Now if you'll excuse me, I must get back to my job so that I can try to afford the taxes taken out.
