This isnt only the issue for the passwords. But also for the screen 
images. Those IPMI controllers have a option to capture the actual server 
screen. And this isnt password protected either.

We reported this ~ 3 years ago to them. And is available in about any 
version.

My advise, put those IPMI's on private networks only. Or firewall them.

Bye,
Raymond.
