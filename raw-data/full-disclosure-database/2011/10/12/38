In the US, we have the legal protections (on paper). The laws are not
enforced; the checks are balances are lacking; and there is no
accountatbility for public officials.

There's not a lot we can do when a public official disregards the law,
and subsequently goes unpunished. The ACLU and EFF do a great job, but
until public officials spend time imprisoned for their actions,
nothing will change.
