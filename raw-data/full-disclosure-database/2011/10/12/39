Don't focus on the 1%/99% idea. Its much larger than who deserves
what, and what are the demographics.

When the economic terrorists on Wall Street committed their crimes,
they affected you (and Thor) also. Right now, your savings and
retirement accounts are probably not growing as expected because the
economy is depressed.

If any of the perpetrators face securities related civil charges, they
will pass on the cost to the share holders. So your retirement account
(regardless of whether you hold shares directly, or indirectly through
a fund) will absorb the losses. $100M to litigate, and a $300M or
$500M fine is a lot of money taken away from the 99% for the benefit
of the 1%.

Criminal prosecution is probably out of the question. PAC
contributions has purchased a lot of political protection. Its readily
apparent in Obama's statement that started this thread.

To play devil's advocate: why do you choose to endorse or protect
those who are effectively stealing from you?
