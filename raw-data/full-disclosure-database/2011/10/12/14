Subject: Supermicro IPMI documentation omission: presence
	of second admin account

The IPMI functionality of some Supermicro mainboards comes with two admin
accounts by default, which are labeled in the webinterface:

"ADMIN"
"Anonymous"

The official documentation only tells you to change the password of the
"ADMIN" account:

==
Note: The manufacturer default username and password are ADMIN/ADMIN. 
Once you have logged into the BMC using the manufacturer default password,

be sure to change your password for security purpose. 
==

Because of this, and because it does not seem to possible to login with
"Anonymous" in the webinterface, many admins do not bother to change the
password of "Anonymous".
However you can login to this account through SSH by specifying an empty
username (default password "admin" in lowercase).

==
$ ssh -l "" -o PreferredAuthentications=password,keyboard-interactive
xx.xx.xx.xx 
@xx.xx.xx.xx's password: 
Auth User/Pass with PS...pass.
