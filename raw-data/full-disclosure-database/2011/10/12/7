Subject: Re: Bypassing Windows 7 kernel ASLR

Other methods are useful for user land but not in kernel land. In this paper
I have bypassed ASLR and DEP too, not just one protection. Read it again ;-)

Thats cool... id like to see more about using rop chains or other methods to
bypass dep+aslr in one go... rather than just take out one protection..

Hi !

 

I have recently discovered a method to bypass Windows 7 kernel ASLR.

You can find the paper here:
http://www.nes.fr/docs/NES-BypassWin7KernelAslr.pdf

 

In this paper I explain every step to code an exploit with an useful kernel
ASLR bypassing. I perform successful exploitations on Windows 7 SP0 / SP1.

 

Good reading,

 

Best regards,

 

LE BERRE Stefan.
