Darren's and indeed many other people's lame excuse is that they're too
humble to be greedy. As if!
If anything, most people are greedier than that 1%. The only difference is
that people are bad at it, unlike that 1%.

Just consider the fact that Average Joe would be just too happy to evade
tax.
Richer Joe, instead, might be doing the same with his $1bn business.
In both cases, they're breaking the law.

The "occupy wallstreet" movement is simply hypocrisy.

Did I happen to mention that I'm far from rich? In the coming years, I'll be
struggling to get my own drop of land.
The only unfair part I see is people complaining while buying iPads and
iCrap over Facebook, Twitter etc..
