I saw this on FB and thought I would pass it along:

It's the exif data from the photos the 99%'ers are posting - showing the $1000 systems, cameras, and software they are using to post.

Regarding who's doing the most damage to US economy, I'll just say I won't comment.

I take issue with the 1%/99% idea; ie, the excuse that some people deserve more just because they are allowed to lie - even if it makes them hypocrites.

Its not about greed - pursuit of wealth is fine. You just can't harm
others while doing it. (Well, apparently you can in the US).

One of the funniest things I ever read regarding Bin Laden's little
war was a boycott of the US dollar to reduce reliance [on the dollar]
and to harm the US economy [1].

Thought experiment: terrorist wanted to ruin the US economy. US
Financial institutions threw the US (and world) economy into a
recession (again). The US financial institutions responsible must be
terrorist organizations.

Thank {insert higher being here} that Bin Laden did not make a PAC
contribution on 9/10.
