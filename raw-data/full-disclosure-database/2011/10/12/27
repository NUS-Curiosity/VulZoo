What makes it different (and this is just me speaking, I don't really
know how others 
feel or what current political thinking is on this)is that the internet
represents a new,
unregulated medium that can redefine some traditional standards and ways
of doing 
Things in order to do them better.  For me, as a conservative, less
regulation an more personal responsibility is better.

I will say something probably a bit unusual, especially these days,
reasonable men may differ on this view. A very credible argument for
regulation can be made, I just keep coming back the reality that
virtually every regulated medium of communication becomes a point of
control. To shamelessly steal and warp a phrase, "The power to regulate
is the power to destroy."

I would prefer to be responsible for my own privacy and pit my skills
against the Feds at keeping it that way rather than "trust" them not to
abuse their access to my "protected" email.

I work in the phone business and we have CALEA requirements which
supposedly allows law enforcement to carry out their sanctioned wire
taps anonymously to protect suspects' right to privacy. I may be wrong,
but it seems pretty abusable (if that's a word) to me.  I do NOT want
that on the Internet. 

Cheers,
Dan Sichel
