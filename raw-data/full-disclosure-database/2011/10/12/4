Just a little bit of creative thinking here... If the communications 
between the base and the drone are not encrypted and these 
communications have successfully been intercepted - Is it possible that 
in addition to the ability to collect videos transmitted by the drone, 
data could be sent to the drone while it's airborne? and perhaps the 
malware waits until it receives a signal from the perpetrator on the 
ground before it transmits its collected data? The drones are rumored to 
carry out airborne network attacks so if this is the case theoretically 
it would be communicating with more than just the operation centre and 
someone could have exploited this?

I also view this article with great skepticism. It's "exclusive" with an 
unnamed source. If the source is credible why have they chosen to speak 
to Wired? and why on earth would these technicians be following "removal 
instructions posted on the website of the Kaspersky security firm"?

Perhaps this is a precursor to the hunt for "weapons of mass disruption" 
or perhaps it's just a cleverly disguised advert... how many product 
placements can you spot in that article? ;)

If it's something more destructive then maybe they need to call in someone more experienced. But it does not sound destructive and it does sound like it is on a disconnected network.

"oh, we decrypted it"... etc...
