You're an idiot.

If you think that Obama is a Muslim, that Obama care will bring upon  
death panels, that Obama is a socialist, and that all millionaires and  
billionaires (including Thor), will move out just because they're  
called upon to pay more taxes and help America out of debt, you're an  
idiot.

Please don't call me *stupid* just because you disagree with me politically.

If you're not a millionaire or billionaire, how *would you know* that  
the 1% are packing getting ready to move?

Did you pick this up from Fox News?
