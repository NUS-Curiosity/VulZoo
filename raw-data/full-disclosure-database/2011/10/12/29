I don't know where you're getting at or what political stance you take  
nor do I care.

If you don't think the people who are protesting against the greed of  
wall street are average Americans, then you need help.

Tell us then, since you cared enough to post a link trying to  
discredit the anti-wall-street movement based on exifs. Who are the  
people who need the help?

Corporations? Cause I've heard opposing arguments by *average*  
Americans that corporations are people.

Last time I checked, Obama's Job Act gives even more tax breaks to  
companies and extends unemployment benefits to *Americans* with out  
jobs by taxing millionaires and billionaires.

You have me confused.
