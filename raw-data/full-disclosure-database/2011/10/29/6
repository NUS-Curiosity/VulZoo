                 CVE-2011-4140 
Debian Bug     : 641405

Paul McMillan, Mozilla and the Django core team discovered several
vulnerabilities in Django, a Python web framework:

CVE-2011-4136

  When using memory-based sessions and caching, Django sessions are
  stored directly in the root namespace of the cache. When user data is
  stored in the same cache, a remote user may take over a session.

CVE-2011-4137, CVE-2011-4138

  Django's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by
  issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service
  is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the
  connection open indefinately or fill the Django's server memory.

CVE-2011-4139

  Django used X-Forwarded-Host headers to construct full URL's. This
  header may not contain trusted input and could be used to poison the
  cache.

CVE-2011-4140

  The CSRF protection mechanism in Django does not properly handle
  web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers,
  which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged
  requests.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze2.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
