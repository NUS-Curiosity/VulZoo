Is this bind server used as authoritative server for some DNS 
domains? Or does your configuration allow to be queried from the 
whole internet for resolving?

For me this above log messages looks like a regular answer from 
your DNS server to the client (or a resolving DNS server) running 
on the destination IP address.

A DNS request runs like this:
A client (or resolving DNS server) does a query through UDP from 
his source port 5060 (could be any other random port) to the 
server on port 53. As UDP is connectionless, the server is 
sending the answer back from his UDP port 53 to the destination 
port 5060.
