So? That's their problem, not yours.

The moral thing to do is to work with them on a responsible disclosure in hopes
of a bounty.  Then when it becomes apparent they intend to ignore the issue,
you've at least tried to do the right thing - so publish and at least score
some reputation points. ;)

Of course, the devil is in the details - for instance, how long is it "responsible"
to wait if you discover a zero-day that's already being exploited on a large
scale?
