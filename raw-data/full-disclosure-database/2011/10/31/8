Subject: Re: Facebook Attach EXE Vulnerability

Oh hey, 3k is great!
I saw that they just made it look abit cheap... no wrath but, it is
still a MULTI billion now, dollar company, so they shoukld be trying
to make SURE they can out bi ANY underground payers.. thats all i had
to question.
thanks for clearing it up, but sure, if theyre paying better now thats
cool, i should have said to, it is atleast a step in the right
direction :s  Still, they ARE*** a mutil frigging million dollar
company lol, so why wouldnt they give say, 1k minimum and make sure
they get people more than interested but even fuzzing for bugs wich
could potentially be in use already... this is something theyre not
covering atall really with 500bux.
It is tho, a start...
cheers for clearing up theyre rce payout, wow, so they maybe read
googles hall of fame and did it in accordance ? Maybe im wrong but....
this company, is not really the same thing as a google, and i guess a
bug on this site, would be actually worth 5million pcs to anyone
buying it... im just saying for them being so rish, they could do
better, and definately, the comapnies who offer nothing, should get
nothing back, simple, thats why blackhats sometimes are blackhats,
they got rooted around tryin to help some pig headed company who makes
millions yet will screw you around so badly, you do realise they tried
to reproduce the bug YOU made even, in order to _NOT_ pay you shit.
remeber that.
But then again, your in theyre pocket now, and really CANT do shit now
but say yes sir no sir two bags half fkn full sir.
am i rite.
cheers tho.
FB still sux hairy ones.
