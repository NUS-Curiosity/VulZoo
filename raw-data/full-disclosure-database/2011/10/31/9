no syn cookies for TLS  :(    yet, they mention proper fix on page:
 disable renegotiation. use hw accel.



speaking of GPUs: http://shader.kaist.edu/sslshader/

there are HSM+Accel cards that do 70k+ sessions/sec if you want the
hardware protection for your secrets in addition to performance.



what i really want to know!

when does thc-ssl-dos get GPU support?

"Taking on larger server farms who make use of SSL Load balancer
required 20 average size laptops and about 120kbit/sec of traffic." -
what kind of shitty LB was this?  an old as dirt F5 BigIP?
