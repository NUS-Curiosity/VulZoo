Synopsis
========

The GPGSM utility included in GnuPG contains a use-after-free
vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, is a free replacement for the PGP suite
of cryptographic software. The GPGSM utility in GnuPG is responsible
for processing X.509 certificates, signatures and encryption as well as
S/MIME messages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/gnupg            < 2.0.16-r1              >= 2.0.16-r1
                                                                < 2.0

Description
===========

The GPGSM utility in GnuPG contains a use-after-free vulnerability that
may be exploited when importing a crafted X.509 certificate explicitly
or during the signature verification process.

Impact
======

An unauthenticated remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GnuPG by enticing them to import a
crafted certificate.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuPG 2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/gnupg-2.0.16-r1"
