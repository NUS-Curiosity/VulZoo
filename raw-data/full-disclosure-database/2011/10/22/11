Only a fraction of apps uses /tmp... vendors can fix their own
distros: grepping for "/tmp" isn't complicated, and almost every
package usually ships with a handful of vendor-specific diffs anyway.

You will break some third-party stuff people download from the
Internet, but that's a self-correcting problem, and not exactly a
horrible prospect: Linux distros break crappy software with almost
every major release anyway, often due to far more fundamental changes
(e.g. different /dev or /proc semantics, or moving libraries and
includes around).

The namespace / pseudo-fs approach is fairly ancient and works, but
it's sort of ugly: it makes the filesystem behave counterintuitively
in the rare case somebody actually has a legit use for /tmp. Not a big
deal, but seems like an overcomplicated solution IMO.
