Excellent suggestion, and you've piqued my curiosity. What distros exist
that implement tmp dirs in such a way? I haven't come across any, and
the more I think about it, the more I wish that this is something I
would see.

If you had your way, would you see it implemented as /tmp/<USER>
/<USER>/tmp, or some other way?

Cheers,
B
