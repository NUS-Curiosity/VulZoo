Fedora's had the pam_namespace stuff for a while now - it got added about
the same time as SELinux. It's also in RHEL 5 and later.  It also appears to
be in current Ubuntu and SLES 11.1.

So it's a good question of what distros *don't* have the tools to implement this?

Why they don't do it by default?  Because if you screw up the config, things break
in strange and mysterious ways.  Those of you old enough to remember the first
2-3 years of "/etc/shadow is a separate file from /etc/passwd", or even further
back to when the Sun-3 created "Not all the world's a Vax", know why distros aren't
enabling it by default yet.  But in 2-3 years, probably...

It should be site-configurable - some places may have a large fast /tmp area
and they want a per-user directory on that disk space.  Other places may want
to have /tmp redirected to /home/${USER}/tmp so disk quotas apply, etc etc.
