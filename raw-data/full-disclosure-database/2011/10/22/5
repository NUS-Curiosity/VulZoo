That would result in counterintuitive behavior, I suppose... /tmp is a
fairly stupid and largely unnecessary artifact of the old.

If you are in charge of a distro, it would not hurt to nuke it
altogether and change all packages in your control to use per-user
$TMPDIR. Some third-party stuff will break - but it breaks every now
and then anyway.
