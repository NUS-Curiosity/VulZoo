There's also the issue of mounting /tmp noexec and nosuid on a separate 
filesystem that many people choose.  Location of per-user tmp filesystem 
would also be impacted by that.

At first sight, the best option from that point of view seems to be a 
per-user tmp under /tmp/$USER/ and mount /tmp noexec, nosuid.  If you 
choose the ~$USER/tmp option, you'll probably have to do some userfs 
jugglery to achieve the same objective.
