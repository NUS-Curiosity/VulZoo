1.1
An anonymous Researcher of the Vulnerability Laboratory Team discovered a multiple sql injection vulnerabilities on eFronts Enterprise CMS v3.6.10.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker or local privileged user account(low:trainee) to inject own sql commands/statements over 
a vulnerable param. Successful exploitation of the sql injection vulnerability can result in dbms & cms compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			                         	[+] survey

Vulnerable File(s):
			                         	[+] professor.php

Vulnerable Param(s):
			                         	[+] ?ctg=survey&surveys_ID=
                                                        [+] ?ctg=survey&screen_survey=

1.2
An anonymous Researcher of the Vulnerability Lab Team discovered a database disclosure vulnerability on eFronts Enterprise CMS v3.6.10.
Successful exploitation can result in a database steal after upgrade or installation of the CMS.

			                         	[+] Install

Vulnerable File(s):
			                         	[+] install.php

Vulnerable Param(s):
			                         	[+] ?step=2&upgrade=1
