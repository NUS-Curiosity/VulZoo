To clarify:  the list itself is (to the best of my knowledge), in fact *not*
moderated, which involves somebody actually looking at all postings and doing a yes/
no check on the enclosed content.

That is *different* from *certain user addresses* being set to permanent
moderation status.

There's unfortunately some people that are still fuzzy on the difference, and
some that insist on conflating the two.

tl;dr: No, the list isn't moderated, Andrew is (and other individuals may or
may not be at any given time).

Byron: Having said that, I have no idea what delayed your original posting to
the list.  Your follow-up appears to have cleared the list in about 6 seconds
from arrival to queued for delivery, so was almost certainly unmoderated.
