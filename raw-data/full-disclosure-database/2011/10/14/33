So now we're equating murdering people by beheading them simply because you 
don't like them or see them as your enemy with legally executing people who 
were lawfully convicted of a crime, had multiple appeals all of which

Your moral confusion is stunning.

I suppose in your world blocking exploits on your network, which is your 
job, justifies students hacking into your computers?
