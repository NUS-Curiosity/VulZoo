Crossed what line?  Frankly if black folks can call each other nigger 
it's reverse discrimination for white folks to not be able to say it as 
well.  If you don't want the word used..don't use it at all.  If you 
want the racist card to stick to a word don't use it yourself when 
referring to members of your own ethnicity....not race..we are all of 
the human race..ethnicity.
