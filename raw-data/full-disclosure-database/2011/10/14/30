Subject: Re: Supermicro IPMI documentation omission:
 presence of second admin account

It seems that as user Anonymous there is not a lot to do on the CLP/2
interface.  You can, however, access serial over lan as anonymous using
IPMI:

    ipmitool -I lanplus -H 192.168.0.1 -P admin -U "" sol activate

Moral: consider the serial port to be untrusted on these devices.

Supermicro?  Are you listening?  Please also can we have a standards
compliant KVM that is not dependent on a hacky java app.  VNC would be fine.
