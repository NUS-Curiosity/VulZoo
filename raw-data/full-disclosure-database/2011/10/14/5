Here , i would have doneso initially, but was not sure if / whatt you have
done to maybe pissoff the bosses of the list :P
So im doing this blindly, with faith in just the right to speech, and
nothing more in mind.
I hope i dont get 500 links of threads about you, or your posts, and i hope
i dont see 500 posts, wich are all shitty :P
this is, merely my opinion on freedom to speak, and sofarm, seen no malice,
although i see many others, do see malice to yowards you, wich is, unusual
for *no reason*, so, this is asking the list "what did n3td3v do, exactly*
that got him banned :s
I wont diagree with it, but id like to know why... lol.
cheers.
xd
