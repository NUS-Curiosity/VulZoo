Subject: Bypassing Windows 7 kernel ASLR

Hi !

 

I have recently discovered a method to bypass Windows 7 kernel ASLR.

You can find the paper here:
http://www.nes.fr/docs/NES-BypassWin7KernelAslr.pdf

 

In this paper I explain every step to code an exploit with an useful kernel
ASLR bypassing. I perform successful exploitations on Windows 7 SP0 / SP1.

 

Good reading,

 

Best regards,

 

LE BERRE Stefan.
