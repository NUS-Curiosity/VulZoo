How about illegal? Check out the Hobbs Act [1]. I'm not making this
crap up - the US has laws on the books for negatively affecting
commerce (which the crash did), and using fear to peddle their warez
(how financial institutions market their instruments). There's
probably provisions in the PATRIOT Act, too.

The last tine I checked (about a year ago), the SEC had opened fewer
than 100 civil investigations. No criminal investigations, despite the
fact that some of the financial institutions created spurious ratings
companies just to rate their instruments 'good'.
