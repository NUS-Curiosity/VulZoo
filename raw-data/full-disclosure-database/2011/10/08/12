When people avoid publicly saying stuff like this, that kind of hacks
live for much longer time.

Still iodine, when not used with direct raw socket but using resolver as
a relay, DOES NOT randomize source port.

That means that it's blocked by most statefull firewall like Cisco PIX
that, for a specific DNS session, doesn't allow you to do more than X
query every minutes.

For example UK T-Mobile doing DNS stateful inspection, basically allow
you to make "dns tunnelled traffic" for 2-3 seconds every minute.

Probably because on the "virtual UDP/DNS session" there is a limit of
"how many query can be done within 60s".

If iodine would randomize the source port for the DNS query, it would
probably works also in such conditions.
