 Non-Persistence Cross-Site Scripting

nice find.
Please, put your FULL PoC within the email BODY when you are sending out
disclosures..It would make some of us certainly feel abit better about
reading them... specially when gmaqil refuses or has problems scanning, that
should not happen, it should pass straight through... do your own testing,
send from anywhere to gmail/googlemail and watch what the AV scannner says
9and believe me they have a very cool scanner)...
