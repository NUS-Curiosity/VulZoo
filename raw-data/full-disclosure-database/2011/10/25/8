Hello,
    Your 'race condition possibly leading to root'is a myth...
Yes thats maybe because race condition or not, it is ASLR wich will prevent
from ANY rootshell,and Yes, it has bveen tried... You can do better, go
right ahed ;-)
I am betting you thats why it aint being ptached in any hurry, because obv
if you read some notes about it in the committs, you will see they must have
reproduced the said bugs, in and with, more than JUST bzexe even... but
anyhow, your PoC is bs. Make it then ill believe it, ask others, you wont
beat aslr on even vanilla,. So, stop complaining you did not get into patch-
halll of flame.. it was not really going to be ever exploited, or you would
surely not be the one posting this ;)
Anyhow, nice try but no banana.
xd
