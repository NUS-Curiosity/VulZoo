Subject: Re: Symlink vulnerabilities

I do know, this is quite confusing,
I have reproduced this, so has another well known exploit-eer on this list,
and both failed, altho, i have been able to use actually, parts of YOUR
poc's from debian, to gain root to almost anything, but it is not so
straight forward as just the actual scenaro of the PoC, it needs some tweaks
to make it bypass some parts of secuirty.
I will try to use the same methods and make this compressed bad.bz files,and
see if i can make the poc better,
I should not be so arrogant :)
I will altho try and test this, as it states now, vendor is not patched.
I will see what happens in bash, then ill try and just add some code to
something i already have wich might be able to atleast 'lever'
the bug in bzexe, i believe the bug still exists in other compression utils,
i recall there being many ways to create enormous file sized bz2 files wich
could basically cause overflows and d0s eveytimes, those are mostlikely
patched, but if these utilitys conme shipped with our default kernel etc,
then many people should be made well aware of such a bug, so small, wich can
spawn rootshell in 2mins, every 2minutes.
It is possible, but sofar, i have had 0 success using this actual bug
itself... it just keeps sigfeaulting, i will try a couple of approachs, but,
i do not think a race condition can be won , and, would challenge anyone to
do it, it is not something wich is hard nor private, it is on a public list,
so could be fixed in 0minute of tme, possibly, the best place to post any
bug, because they are spoken about thoroughly.
I will try my best to match the scenario Vlad has pointed out, and rremake
it, but seriously i cannot see it happening. Not yet.
cheers,
xd
