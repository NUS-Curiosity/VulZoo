Nope. It can't, because ASLR doesn't enter into the picture. But then, *who
cares*?  Are you going to make it make it through a passport check too? Because
that's as relevant to this exploit as ASLR is.

No. It has to pwn the target.  If it does so without bothering to do anything that
requires ASLR bypass doesn't matter.

Or are you also going to insist that anybody breaking into your house has to do
so by picking the big shiny lock on the front door that says ASLR, and they're
not allowed to use a window, or an air conditioning vent, or a skylight, or
that old coal chute leading into the basement, or mail you a package that opens
itself inside the house to reveal a robot that opens the front door from the
inside, or social engineering you to demonstrate the awesomeness of the lock,
and sneaking in while the door is open, or....

tl;dr: "Bypass ASLR" isn't the metric for an exploit. pwnage is.
