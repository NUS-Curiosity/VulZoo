Even if bzexe is not used that much, I found similar configurations
(compressed binaries launched via crond) on embedded systems (I think
this is why bzexe was made for).

This is true, your correct , but then, you dont have to even use a
compression agent.. there is still many other holes not even being
discussed.. that will 100% give you root I guess thts why theyre not being
discussed tho eh ;)

You dont even have to go *this* far to gain root...i mean, using some
compression agent, etc etc, and rely on a bug in the binary of a compression
agent, although i have said that there has been MANY bugs in this softwares
for many years now.. in some earlier post, so i am really wondering why this
one is even gone to seclists about it, where there is no proof it gains root
atall.

just a friendly blackhat tip of the hit to you.
cheers.
