One problem I can foresee with this is a way to scale this in a secure
manner. At one end of the spectrum you could have Grandma on her little
1.something ghz atom and on the other a mutli processor system or maybe
even GPU. It could take many years to crack for a GPU but then unless
ther is a way to scale that back to make it possible for the little atom
(without being able to use the GPU for the weaker challenge).

I have never actually looked at doing this and would be interested if
there is actually a way to do this without it being weak in some way.
