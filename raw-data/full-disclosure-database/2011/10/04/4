Subject: Re: VPN providers and any providers in general...

maybe they are law abiding companies? :)

Who were advertising themselves, and acting like they would NEVER do the
dirty by handing over any payment records etc... wich is half the reason i
believe the people use theose ones, advertising to protect you.. not to give
your infos up, for really, no reason. as they did.
Law abiding or not, then they should be advertising as a law abiding
company, and not acting like some hackers-oparadise vpn service.
