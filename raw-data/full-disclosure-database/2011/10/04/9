Subject: Free Koodhz Initiative

Well, you should know that Koodhz is a great guy, a young man with lot of
ideals and he doesn't deserve to suffer the sentence. Koodhz has contributed
a lot to black hat hacking. Software as w3af could not work'd without the
active (but quiet) participation of this guy. So we ask you to help us
continue our work so that more people know about this cause and help us free
our friend. For your participation we will send a self-adhesive sticker for
free.
