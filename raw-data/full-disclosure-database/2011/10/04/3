Subject: Re: VPN providers and any providers in general...

Using an external VPN provider to cover your trace clearly shows your
incompetency and your idiot assumption.
Trying to blame the VPN provider rather than accepting your mistake and
learning from it clearly show your 3 years old mentality.

Also, could you please stop posting as GLOW Xd as well ?
We do not need your schizophrenic script kiddie "lolololol", "xD", hugs,
 spamming on this mailing list.

You being on this mailing list is once again not the best idea.

Thanks,
Antony
