Subject: Re: Apache 2.2.17 exploit?

Are there any ideas how to make the code more robust (currently
raciness due to frequent syscalls is problematid), smaller or add
features (I thought using the libc GOT, but this made code larger and
I do not know if that would make code much more portable)?

What about using libcurl/curlsetopt_url and the other curl options
