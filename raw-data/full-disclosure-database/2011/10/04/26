Subject: Re: Privilege escalation on Windows using Binary
	Planting

Unfortunately, on W7 and any other box with proper restrictions, you need to
run that command as admin to get the full result set.

If you are an unprivileged user looking for a process to escalate to:
tasklist /v /fi "USERNAME ne %USERNAME%"
or
tasklist /v| find "Unknown         N/A"

Will give you a good place to start looking.
