Subject: Re: VPN providers and any providers in general...

In my eyes, a couple of "offtopic" messages is ok, but a train of several
messages in less than an hour is what spam is...
I must admit I was pissed off at that time, and the fact that some people
failed to deal with such discussions appropriately only made it worse.

Next time, launch your own thread for such discussions, so that people can
easily manage/ignore what they don't need, instead of filling up legitimate
threads with crap (imho).
