Subject: Canadian ISP Website - SQL Injection Vulnerability

Canadian ISP Website - SQL Injection Vulnerability

Introduction:
=============
Canadianisp.ca - Is a wholly owned project of Marc Bissonnette /
InternAlysis.
It was originally created as a joint venture with Bob Carrick of Carrick
Solutions, with sole ownership
transferring to Marc Bissonnette on February 16th, 2004. Canadianisp.ca
is the only website that allows
you to search for an Internet service provider (Dial-up, ISDN, DSL,
Cable, Satellite, Point to Point, Wireless
and Voice Over IP (VoIP)) anywhere in Canada. Customers can post
reviews, and ISPs submit their own services.
All for free. CanadianISP is also one of the most accurate and most
up-to-date ISP lists on the net. There are
many ISP lists out there, but the vast majority of them (as far as we
have seen and we last searched and looked
in April of 2011) are out of date, listing companies no longer in
business, no longer providing connectivity
or simply pages of ads with no relevance to the users  search parameters.
ISPs can submit and edit / update their own services at all times, free
of charge.

Affected Products:
==================
Canadian ISP Website - 2011/Q2-3


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on canadians isp website. The
bug allows remote attackers to inject/execute
own sql statements/commands over a vulnerable applicataion parameter on
the main web service. Successful exploitation
of the remote sql injection vulnerability can result in database
managemtn system compromise & website manipulations.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                        [+] ispsearch.cgi

Vulnerable Param(s):
                        [+] ispid

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user
inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
