I'm talking more about their engineers than their network.

If I had my network infected with a virus, I'd immediately deploy some form
of logging/monitoring tool (eg, wireshark).

Honestly, it all sounds like they're employing inexperienced engineers.
Which is again strange, considering the field they're in.

Regarding your bet, see that's already something. Why exactly can't they
verify your bet? It isn't like viruses suddenly became invisible, is it?

I'm just curious to these questions. It's strange to hear someone saying "we
basically have no idea what's going on".
