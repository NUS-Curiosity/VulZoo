I will say, with Botnets, and bots in general, i dont see much talented
people on FD... although, seems many can decrypt them, so, makes me wonder ,
it is a train-of-thought also, i guess this is where hat colors take
control.. black hats would say, go read some bot src and wake up FD, while
white hats would say, "but we can just kill it anyhow...' "oh, we decrypted
it"... etc...
another pintless neverneding arguement..
