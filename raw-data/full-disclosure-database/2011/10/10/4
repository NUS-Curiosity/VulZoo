YEP!
When ya do it right, dang right it is!

I did never reproduce the EXACT ethod wich made the x41's happen... but, i
dun really care for that bug, or you call it a feature..well, i dont know
feratures wich have x41's al;l over the emails when made in a special way...
so, it was low-level to :)
anyhow, no, i wont bother to recreate the email body, without using any
'features' of googles, for you.
It is possible to exploit rich text editor, i have said.. the dll itself..
so maybe go investigate and stfu :)
now back to the backdoor.
