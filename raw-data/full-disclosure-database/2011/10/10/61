Is obvious, this is a very well made executable :)
Or, set up well to spread and then hide, and doing so with even its phone
home, wich is normal nowdays, for example consider an ircd, it uses
PING/PONG, what if you change the rfc, and use ascii characters,then do this
to the bot, remove USER mode completely only allow it for set modes/opers,
and then try take the thing down, if it is connected thru about 40 different
ips and does not rely on dynami dns...
it is not impossible, it is happening now, and, it is also visible, however,
these c7c centres are so advanced, Ids are just not getting enough
info...you cannot do a thing on the properly modified control centres, and,
i have seen that code, it is extremely modified version of ircd... it cannot
be used by a NOn operator, and uses a totally different rfc to phopne home
etc, thus making conventional methods used atm, useless... as they will
loook for the strings that they know, and always ids will perform some
string of commands, and, then slowly the operator sees the servers, and one
by one he blocks YOU out of his network.
This is a dog eat dog world, bot masters can be exceptionallt ingenious when
it comes to these things, and masking an exe nowdays, is not as simple as
some peoples SFX rar kits :)
So even kits nowdays, can be way more advanced than 2008/2009 even...
there has been a burst of tech, so there is also a burst in virus numbers...
but, smart c&c centres, you wont take down so easily, and they will move
before you can even decrypt theyre settings... wich is exactly why stuxnet
is non stoppable.. unless the owner shuuts it down, it wont  be killed..
