Well, it SHOULDN'T happen to people that are supposedly trained to overcome

It's like engineers are inexperienced prior to a nuclear reactor meltdown.
While I wouldn't expect the engineers to have first-hand experience in
dealing with such issues, it still doesn't excuse them from know what
they're doing.
