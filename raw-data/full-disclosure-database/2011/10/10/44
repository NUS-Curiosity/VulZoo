	“We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back”

By the way, to reply to a certain n3td3v... "locating anything" does not
imply being "clueless on what's going on", which seems to be their on-going
issue.

While at it, a reply to Thor, just to switch subjects for a bit; shield law
doesn't apply when a journalist/reporter falsifies information to get low
against the AA (in this case).

Since the judge and the prosecuted are one and the same (the AA), I think it
is a considerably dangerous situation to go against them.

That's the only notch of credibility I'm giving to the article. A response
from the AA could easily crush that trust.

Cheers,
Chris.
