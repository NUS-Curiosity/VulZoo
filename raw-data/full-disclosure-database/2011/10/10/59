If its bot net code and it is behind an air barrier then it will never phone home. They can take their time to kill it because it will never get instructions to do anything. If it's something more destructive then maybe they need to call in someone more experienced. But it does not sound destructive and it does sound like it is on a disconnected network.

I will say, with Botnets, and bots in general, i dont see much talented people on FD... although, seems many can decrypt them, so, makes me wonder , it is a train-of-thought also, i guess this is where hat colors take control.. black hats would say, go read some bot src and wake up FD, while white hats would say, "but we can just kill it anyhow...' "oh, we decrypted it"... etc...
another pintless neverneding arguement..

Doesn't sound funny to me, happens to me all the time. That's how I
learn.
