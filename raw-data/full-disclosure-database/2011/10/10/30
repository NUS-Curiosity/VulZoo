Consider the source.  It’s “someone close” to the operations, and that only according to this guy.  It could very well be a slot-puller in the casino across the street…   I’m always dubious of the reporting of this type of thing where the source is some “secret” person, and where there is never any ability to refute claims.

I'm talking more about their engineers than their network.

If I had my network infected with a virus, I'd immediately deploy some form of logging/monitoring tool (eg, wireshark).

Honestly, it all sounds like they're employing inexperienced engineers. Which is again strange, considering the field they're in.

Regarding your bet, see that's already something. Why exactly can't they verify your bet? It isn't like viruses suddenly became invisible, is it?

I'm just curious to these questions. It's strange to hear someone saying "we basically have no idea what's going on".

It's a network that's 'detached', or 'segregated', or whatevered from the rest of the world, so it's 'largely immune to viruses'.  That likely means they have:
1. NO logging
2. NO anti-virus
3. NO hardening

The very fact that these systems are on a segregated network means they are probably more frail, and more susceptible to viruses, than a normal person's laptop.

Immune to viruses...  What a crock of shit.  My bet is that it's coming from the planes.

This is news to me.

Moreover, I'm a bit confused as to how they don't track how it's coming back.
I mean, how is it possible that no one stepped in and analyzed how the virus acts and where it came from?

It sounds fish if you ask me.

Chris.
