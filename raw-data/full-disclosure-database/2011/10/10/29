We all are guilty, that is true. I can admit to that. Though what I intensely dislike are those who think they are better than us - because they are more successful at being greedy pigs.

He who believes the 99% are not guilty of greed is a downright fool.

The 1%? I don't care. Honestly, I don't.

Fun quote (from the 99% crowd): "Why does the 1% deserve a Ferrari and I don't?!"

The day may come when Wall Street is finally silent, the slowly rotting carcasses of the power hungry "elites" swinging silently from the trees in Central park, the lynch mob finally satiated... But will anything change?

Greed will always exist, there will always be those who think they can get away with this kind of thing.
Funny how it finally has the President interested, maybe we can have change now?

>>From the article:
   : President Obama on Thursday called the "Occupy Wall

   : about how our financial system works" and pledged to
   : continue fighting to protect American consumers."
I seem to recall what Obama said at a banker's luncheon after he took
office (to paraphrase): "My administration is the only thing saving
you from the pitchforks of the American people".

It seems to me he took great pride in the protection he provided to
the economic terrorists. I hope he chokes on the money the industry is
stuffing in his pockets.
