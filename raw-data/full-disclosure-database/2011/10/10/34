The report states that they have been using flash drives for map
and video data transfer. The source is probably some flight
operators personal drive which never came under the microscope,
that and "well...it's an *isolated* network so proper security
posture is moot" make for an easy target. I still like the fact
that real-time drone video can be viewed using SkyGrabber, don't
most local LEO use the same technology(albeit on a smaller scale)?
I'm sure many criminals and organized crime can afford a DVB-S
card...
