My worst nightmare is that it's something like this

"We wipe the virus from the network, then when Bob uses his flash drive for a map update we get it again, weird huh?"

Well, it SHOULDN'T happen to people that are supposedly trained to overcome such issues.

It's like engineers are inexperienced prior to a nuclear reactor meltdown.
While I wouldn't expect the engineers to have first-hand experience in dealing with such issues, it still doesn't excuse them from know what they're doing.
