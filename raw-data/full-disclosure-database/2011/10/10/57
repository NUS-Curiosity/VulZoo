 with WikiLeaks and Stuxnet

Stuxnet is *not* stoppable....
If you have seen any of its real code, i guess you would see why ...
wikileaks will stop... goodluck with stuxnet, that stops when the owner says
so,... not before... i dont think anyone or anything could , thats just how
it is coded, even if the maker is arrested, the worm will be fine.. it has
been updated alot since the early days of it, i know that much, it doesnt
even need human interaction more than maybe once in a year if that, and can
spread somany ways... the real stuxnet wont stop... maybe clones of it
will..
