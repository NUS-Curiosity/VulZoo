Subject: Is this for real.. http://n3td3v.org.uk/

Hi n3td3v,
I just decided to see, exactly who you are, calling me a kid.
Now i run a site, crazycoders.com , very small, I have, apparently, a lot
more knowledge in IT sec, than yourself and your credentials.
i dont put anywhere, i am some 'security consukltant' , why, because
security is ever evolving, unlike your website layout..
http://n3td3v.org.uk/
Your website is pathetic, and mirrors your own self, usually thats how it
goes, but i could just be wrong.
Also for an IT consultant demanding things, you only have published, useless
and false PoC's, i could point probably 100 of those out atleast, your
seemingly not well liked by *everyone* in the sec world, yet you dare to
call people such as Valdis, benji,me , kids. ?
your really pathetic, I pray you just *poof* dissapear.. but, I guess that
would just be tooo easy nowdays, wouldnt it ?
How is that linespeed now, on your n3td3v ,is it as secure, as you seem to
want to portray ? can i see if it is ? i will pentest you, you cry, sounds
good to me.
Have fun!
xd


PS: You seem to be the kid here, not us people discussing a very legal
problem.
