This is rather fascinating, http://crazycoders.com/sdk/tut.htm . Your
grand tutorial on building/making botnets aye? I rather like the
pirated version of VC 6.0 Pro. You do seem to have a fine assortment
of pirated software in that directory and I do believe it is rather
illegal to distribute Microsoft Products like that.

You, sir, are very pro at what you do. I rather like the Windows
Server 2003 SP1 CD though. I'm not sure if Psychz Networks
http://www.psychz.net/ would enjoy such piracy.

Have a good day sir
