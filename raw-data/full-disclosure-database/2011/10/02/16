Subject: Re: Is this for real.. http://n3td3v.org.uk/

gawwd, is this how pathetic some people are about some warez... wich is for
making some nice tools :)
lols......
it is only alittle bit of the magic that i have , why concentrate on
wares... ms will annoy me if it is annoying them, am sure of that. i dont
put my shit around, for people to use on wares scene, i only allow it for
users of the site.
So, when my hoster, asks me to remove it, then, i shall ask him for the
warrant, if the warrant encapsulates *me* then, i will have no choice but to
rm it right ?
Until then, i will remove NOTHINg.
Move on to, who the hell is this n3td3v , acting like some fed, a fat one
to.
I was all for the VPN arguenement, funny how this popped up about the
website so soon, and so similar like...almost like this topic what it was,
right.
I waited for someone who acts like authority to showup, n3td3v was the first
to enter the honeypot.
now, qwho else who fell for it, we can see that, clearly... the smarter
people on the list, did not even visit that page :)i saw who exactly
visited, and exactly whaere they went, ip/domain and hosting provider to.
So, i am saying to n3td3v , "Make me fatty".
Simple.
