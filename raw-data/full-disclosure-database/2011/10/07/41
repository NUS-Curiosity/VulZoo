	jacking

Hi,
Another security expert... sheesh... and they cannot do simplest of tasks,
makes me wonder really how do they get anything atall coded, but then again
i doubt there is code... I bet theyre all some persistent xss etc... wich
would req some fuzz tool... well, cewrtainly see better people like kcope
who does not call himself any senior security, yet has made many of remote
exploits, and he posts them in his <body> so, it should be i think put in
the email-bdy, responsibly that is.
That would be good to have but since everyone company takes ITsec so
differently, i know MS and Google have great disclosure policies, but this
is supposed to be on theyre end, not ours... so i guess its another good
question.
cheers
xd
