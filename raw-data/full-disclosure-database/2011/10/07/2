Just because you've written "no offence intended" doesn't mean
people aren't going to take offense! Considering how global and singular
everything is these days, isolating ANYONE out (not just
"minorities") because they are "different" is both pointless and archaic.

It's just depressing that this is one of the most active topics. Although
thankfully NOT in your favor.
