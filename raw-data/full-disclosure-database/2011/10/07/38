 understand that not everybody's been following the rules"

How about we all agree that the word itself, should not be used ever, it is
not a very nice thing to call people, i mean, you dont see chinese people
calling each other yellies... skin color should have no place on the list,
so how about just, forgive and forget.... it is abit easier, or, rather just
keep opinions to a consensus wich most of the list can agree upon , then you
can speak to George however you like... I am just saying, it is enough about
racism.. there is no place, and no talking it, it just plain sucks when it
is done, we all know this, we all dislike when people would pick on things
sometimes not in our control.
I forgive George for his wording, i hope many others can also.
cheers
