And that's true even if you actually trusted the Comcast binary.  If they were
able to get a binary to get run, probably others have as well.  It either got
automatically run by the browser without your intervention, or it *did* prompt
for execution and you (probably blindly) said "OK".  Either way, you're probably
pwned by something else that got run the exact same way the Comcast binary
did.

Thanks for nothing, Comcast.  At least we've finally gotten most banks to not
send out phishy-looking email.
