Subject: Re: Verizon Wireless DNS Tunneling

I wouldn't say I blindly clicked it, but truth be told, I was not overly
concerned about it (annoyed, but not concerned).  The machine gets wiped and
reinstalled every few months, doing so does not disable my Internet access.
It is dedicated to another purpose, it's not for email, banking, etc.
Sometimes the kids play games on it.  That's about it.  Even my kids have
Linux on their laptops.  Thanks for assuming otherwise, I appreciate your
concern about my home network :)

Why all the hate on Comcast?  I see this a lot on various lists, and besides
their DNS servers being flaky at times (I stopped using their DNS servers
long ago because of this), I personally have not had trouble with them.
Even bittorrent works (gasp) using default settings.  Are they just too big
to be loved?  :)


Thanks,
James
