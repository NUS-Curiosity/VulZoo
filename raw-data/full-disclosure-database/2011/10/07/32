Why do you say that?  I don't doubt that there are other ways, but it has
been that way for a while, I've used them as my home ISP for a few years
now.  I don't prefer that method, but you can remove their program after and
you do not lose connectivity or anything.  It just validates your account
number with Comcast and sets your DNS (probably fiddles with other settings
too, not really concerned about it).


Valdis, I have exactly 1 Windows machine, dedicated for something else, but
it came in handy when I last moved.  I would imagine that I could get the
link working via a phone call to support.


Thanks,
James
