Subject: Re: Verizon Wireless DNS Tunneling

Yes, I've found that DNS tunneling works well at the college I go to on
their WIFI.  I've never gotten ICMP tunneling to work myself (outside of a
virtual machine),  but I have some code laying around somewhere that can do
it just in case I need it for something sometime.  Just thought it would be
interesting to some people that it works on such a large provider as
Verizon.  The only problem with it that I see is that it's quite slow.  But
if it works, so be it.  Good for checking email and browsing the web and
such on the road.  But I wouldn't try to torrent a linux distro with it,
haha.
