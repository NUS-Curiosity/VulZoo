Subject: Re: LinkedIn_User Account Delete using Click
	jacking

Screw you dude, attaching executable doc files , and then pushing out a few
*0days*
I wont be looking at *any* thing attached as a doc, thats just common sense.
nowdays, and there is abs NO need on this list for it, it is FD, your meant
to put it in the BODY of email, or atleast maybe next time, change the type
to linux 0day and attach .S file... ??
screw u and ur advisorys, fix them into proper order asin written as any
would be, and ill read it, but never ask a dood to open the attachment!
