>>From the article:
    : President Obama on Thursday called the "Occupy Wall
    : Street" protests a reflection of a "broad-based frustration
    : about how our financial system works" and pledged to
    : continue fighting to protect American consumers."
I seem to recall what Obama said at a banker's luncheon after he took
office (to paraphrase): "My administration is the only thing saving
you from the pitchforks of the American people".

It seems to me he took great pride in the protection he provided to
the economic terrorists. I hope he chokes on the money the industry is
stuffing in his pockets.
