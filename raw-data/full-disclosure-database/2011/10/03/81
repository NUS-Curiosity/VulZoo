Subject: Re: Apache 2.2.17 exploit?

I may have to set up such an RSS + REGEX along with a google alerts to get
the best of both :)

Since my lack of computing facilities has gotten worse in the last month I
have actually begun to forget ASM, so decoding shellcode is not so easy for
me :(
Nor do I have (currently) access to a Linux box to test it on - only a
friends W7 laptop (which wants to use Cyrillic) and the college computers
(W7 also... Network booting with Novell, buggy and slow for the win!)

I will keep on posting anything that looks even mildly interesting, may find
something fun in my travels :)
