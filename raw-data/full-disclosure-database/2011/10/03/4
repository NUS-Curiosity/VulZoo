I hardly use google on my own site... i did once tho, and, i did not see
that, but, now it seems to be a problem i think, or, i am taking your word
that it is now cached, well, that took them a whole of, 2days.
Nice work,. They know where traffic going, and are making sure they make
money off things like that... i guess.
Another interesting area...because they actually make backups of files to...

sheesh, have they already cached it :s hrm... lol...well, that was VERY fast
then, considering i linked to it only a cpl days ago :s from the files, and
page itself, i meant, that was there for my own backups for how i like my VS
setup, it just seems to be a great tute for compiling any .cpp or .c file on
windows env... i guess i should maybe take it down now eh.. i have prooved
what i wanted.. did not think google would cache that... dont look on google
atall, n, not for my own site :s
but, i will b sure to try and fix it anyhow, or just delink that page :s
it is no bother now, i did what was intended... the page is no longer
needed.
Anyhow, cheers for pointing that out.
