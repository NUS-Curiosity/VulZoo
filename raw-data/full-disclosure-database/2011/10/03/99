Nice.
Oh, i did not mean hackers and drugs, they are not really what I classify as
a hardcore, criminalised addict who is now at the point where the drug runs
them... most hard non-pc crimes, are this way.
Although, i know of many many people who abuse benzodiazepedines, and thats
where it can get only abit tricky to *speak* with them ;p , however, this
does not classify to me, as a harder tyope, who would rip that computer
outta your hand and take it to sale!
Thats the crims i mean, and thats the reason why PC users have a much higher
chance to not be any kind of 'repeat' addict... simply just they are not
running around, daily, robbing things and people, (how would they use a
pc...) and many actually, work at places.
So, it is a rather good area to look at, because the chances of rehabbing a
PC/IT user, is much much better than any harder criminal who has done say,
20yrs of theyre life (out of 25 yrs on earth), behind jail bars.
Anyhow, i think alot of hackers do *abuse* but, not addicted, to drugs, wich
makes me wonder why they do it, some i know, have to for medical reasons,
and know this, and when under influence, usually jump offline or stay afk
abit..
Some, just abuse at a low level with pills, but if you were to count IV
users amongst hackers vs IV users amongst the public/crime scenes there,
then you would have a very different sizing.
Is good reading to look at a few cases, regarding drugged people committing
crimes, and compare the statistics to the turn-about with jail, wich is
probably 99% amongst the hardcore crims, rotation rate*.
Anyhow, cheers!
