Interesting.... please elaborate Andrew. i ant to see your views on this,
and no, no puns, no hatred, purely, why is FD in *crap* if, they are using
that tag of Hosted by Secunia... YOUR own reasons and, what you would define
as leaving

Your idea leaves grok.org.uk in a bad position "Hosted and sponsored by
Secunia"

Basically, saying that groks would be able to be simply removed, as such..
am i right ?
So, i am seeing more crappage, or, just explain... please.
