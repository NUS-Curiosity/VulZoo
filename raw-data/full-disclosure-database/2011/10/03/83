Vulnerability Description

Metropolis Technologies OfficeWatch enables a web server on TCP port 80 that is susceptible to a directory traversal. An attacker may send a ../ (dot-dot-slash) sequence to traverse out of the web root and access arbitrary files on the host.

Until a patch is released by the vendor, it is recommended to restrict access to the web server to authorized hosts only. Access controls can be configured through Windows firewall.
