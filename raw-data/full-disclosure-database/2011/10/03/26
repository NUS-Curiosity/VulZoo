Subject: Re: Massive Security Vulnerability In HTC Android
 Devices (EVO 3D, 4G, Thunderbolt, Others) Exposes Phone Numbers, GPS, SMS,
 Emails Addresses, Much More

NOTW "Hacking" method for phones is nothing to do with this. Voicemail
hacking in the UK involves calling the victim, hammering the # button while
the phone rings, and being redirected to their voicemail box. Then you just
press 0000 and # and DONE! (sometimes they have a password, but a 4 digit
pass is 10,000 combinations. Most people use easy to remember ones so a
simple bit of SE and some simple "looking at the phone keypad" and BOOM!
done!)

As kids we used to do this to each other and change each others voicemail
greetings for fun... Nothing has changed in the UK and Eire since. IN fact,
I will post agian in an hour to confirm - I will break into my own
voicemails and check.
