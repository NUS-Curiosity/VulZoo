Could just lok at the recent david cecil case here in .au.
It does say alot, because he did breach some bigger networks.. and he was
committing 'smaller' scale fraud but, still fraud, however, his main problem
was what he did to a governemnt site, wich was deface it for personal gain,
not profit.
It is the latest case wich would be valid of this.
still.. intresting infos... good stuff.
