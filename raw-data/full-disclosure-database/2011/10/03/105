Hey Jeff,
I am glad there are people here who understand the need for real privacy
in the modern age.

The US Government has proven *repeatedly* that the more power it has the
less trustworthy it is especially when it comes to privacy concerns.

This is mainly aimed at Jeffs posting, I think i agree 100%.
Thats what this topic is about, hence why, i want answers still, on many
levels.
cheers for your interest and welcome to a decent discussion about privacy,
albeit, those who are trying to ruin things.. it is an area people are
always scared to tackle, yet affects the list more than anyone.
cheers
xd
PS: sorry to cc u laurelai but since we are one and same, well... rofl.
no seriously, i did not have jeffs email in my emailer, dont know why.
tsozz.


Thankyou,
