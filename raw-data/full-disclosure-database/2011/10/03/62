It's a trojan, based on the w00t-shell.c code; the shell code adds a passwordless root account under the name w000t.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Apache 2.2.17 exploit?

I regularly trawl Pastebin.com to find code - often idiots leave some 0day and similar there and it is nice to find. 

Well, seeing as I have no test boxes at the moment, can someone check this code in a VM? I am not sure if it is legit or not.
