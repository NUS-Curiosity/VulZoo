Definetly not true in the past. Confer: Martin Luther King was
subjected to tens of thousands of illegal wire taps by the FBI because
he (and a lot of other people) felt black folks should get the same
rights as white folks.

The guy who did it was honored in death, and the bureau he helped
shape actually carries "fidelity" and "integrity" in their motto.
Twisted but true.
