it's not working like that, you can't expect that the cops/feds won't
chase piracy while there are more serious crimes unresolved.
sadly.

it simply: not worth taking the risk.
if you won't comply, you are risking that your whole business can go
down the toilet, and if and when you can prove that you are right, you
lost your business already.
and usually those customers is the minority of your client base, and
they are a risk for your own infrastructure also(they can hack/abuse
your own servers).

yeah, the net seems to be more similar than the real life, it's much
harder to be truly anonymous nowadays.

I think the problem is more about how you deliver the message, not the
message itself.

you brought this (cat)fight to the mailing list, so of course he
thinks that you personally attacking him.

see above, you can't expect that lesser crimes are ignored because
there are other more serious crimes out there.

see above.

if you allow the small fishes to play, they will grow big.
maybe not everyone, but imo many blackhat started with irc wars,
taking over channels, defacing small sites, etc.
if you see that you can break the rules and get away with it, you will
push for more.
at least for those who really enjoy doing this kind of stuff.
