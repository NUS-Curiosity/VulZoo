Ok, thats plain scary.
I was told of google 'tracking' any popular thread they see in theyre engine
or google words.... so i am assuming that, they have some very strong
filters set for FD for things like, taslking about theyre own system of
cache in google (yet another little test..).
Still rather worrying, as this was only *rumored* before. Now it seems this
is for real, and, that would be a massive infringement of human rights in
general actually.
I am shocked but, then again, understand google control alot of the
internet, so it is no wonder but, also abit of a worry if the trend
continues so fast as it is.
I have already removed the post  or rather modified it, and now, will also
remove the other page but, i guess people dont realise, all those wapps, are
free in ms, and vs6 ok, was my bad for keeping a personal backup, is not
linked to one website i have never put them things up for others,and only
recent for the website itself.
However, the vcredist2005, could work same place as it.. I also renamed it
back to how it was, and should have been from the start... wich is simple,
how to setup a VS6 setup wich is nice to run with, and wuns fine still with
newer versions.
All i did was, remove the original authors links, replaced with .rar and
.tar and bingo, some ppl just thought 'warez' .
Its kinda sad somany sniped at that, or rather, swiped.. when there is cc
fraudsters, i would much rather see go down. and much much worse 'hack'
sites,or 'bot' sites. i did an experiment, it worked, it was interesting.
Now, it is done.
thankyou for those who particpted in a good way, it was very interesting to
learn alot of this like even this recent google cache thing.
I wonder just howmuch we are tracked by google. They are afterall, huge and
then, they are also owned by M$.
cheers Valdis,
