Well, thanks for the logical response :)

Many people want these "evil hackers" locked up and such, but doing so will
only achieve the folowing (in my opinion):
A: Cost money.
B: Turn them into a more hardened criminal.
C: Cost the community a useful person who could be beneficial to them.

Consider that Davis is 18, Cleary only 19, and other people arrested are
about the same age. What the law enforcement and judicial bodies dealing
with them must realize is that they are dealing with intelligent young
people, who simply chose the wrong path. What they need is not a prison
stay, but some rehabilitative treatment, perhaps councilling to help them
find the right path, and a better sense of morality.

Hell, in some cases the mere arrest itself scared people straight. Having a
bloody SWAT team blow the bloody doors off is enough to reangline* most
young mens moral compass!

Of course, jailing them can be used to "send a message" that "this is not
acceptable" and such, but that has *less* merit than *using* them for good.
All one does by sending a message is make those still out there feel more
persecuted, and persecuted people lash out, doing more damage, and the cycle
continues.

*This computers spellcheck is not working, it wants to use Cyrillic!
