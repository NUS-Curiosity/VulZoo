if you allow the small fishes to play, they will grow big.
rubbish.
Complete rubbish.
Thats a very broad spectrum of people here, and while i may not seem
whitehat atall, and am no hat really, I try remain neutral, and, that guy,
decided to show me he was attacking me aand, accusing, for things i simply
have not done, wich, is alot like what you are trying todo.
I have been in IT sec for years, and never once committed any kind of
fraud.How pathetic would that be, if my own business was to flunk, because
of say, cc fraid.. wich, i have personally experinced, and would not wish on
my enemies.
So pleease take the socialist theories elswhere.

PS: In real life, they go after the fishes who make them loose money, not
small nor big, it is VICTIM impact.
always will be. And until there is firm enough laws, this will not change.
Why would they chase me, even, for one pirated iso, not even pirated, a copy
of an original i believe. the rest is pure freeware, from ms, i just removed
the links purposely, but have them safely tucked here.
So, who is silly for assuming that, i am low level at best with piracy not
even a pirate, it was a backup, wich i used as experimental material in the
end..
Your socialist views, probably show where you are from, or shine through
that custms, while we in the real world, tend to belive in the 'law'. ;-)
rofl... you make me laff.
have a good read party boi.
