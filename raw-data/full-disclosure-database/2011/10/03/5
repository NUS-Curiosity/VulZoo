I have on occasion posted to F-D during an ongoing thread, and then Googled for
more info on the thread, and discovered that  Google had already have indexed
my posting and parked it on the first page of results before I even receive my
own copy back from the server.

As for your posting:

http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&scoring=d&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=%22sheesh%2C+have+they+already+cached+it+%3As+hrm.%22

I see 3 hits already for the string "sheesh have they aready cached it"  as contained in 3
different archives of this list.
