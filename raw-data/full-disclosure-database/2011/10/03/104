The media and such often gloss over the human aspects of an incident.

Bang, thats the thing that will get you behind jail, or no jail.
The press pushes it on, the people are always then arrested, because the
public need*answers* even when they do not understand much of the time what
exactly has happened, and wouldnt even if explained it to them..
Tahts the biggest thing affecting it, victims impact and, wether the victims
impact is press would help it, but they could just privately fund the arrest
if there is the right things in place , ie treatys, and leo etc is involved.
Thats kind of irrelevant, and only a small bunch of cases i would assume...
but there is much we do not see nor hear about.
