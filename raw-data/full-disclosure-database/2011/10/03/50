The site is obviously commercial, hence getting the below revoked
should be a doddle via a complaint to enom.

Registrant:
         Andrew Wallace

     Registrant type:
         UK Individual

     Registrant's address:
         The registrant is a non-trading individual who has opted to have their
         address omitted from the WHOIS service.

The above only applies if you are not advertising, selling or trading in any manner.


UK and EU law regarding commercial web sites is quite well defined but very rarely enforced
by uk plod etc. Its pretty easy to quote AUP, UK and EU Laws against this sort of site to
a UK WSP (IIRC google Uk are the WSP).

I suspect the site will break the Google AUP somehow - given the lack of business
contact details and the use of hidden address details I suspect google would
remove the site then ask questions, hence the need to do execute enom/nominet complaint first :-)
