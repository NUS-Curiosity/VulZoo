No surpise... theyre ext4 partitions are completely vulnerable.. try tell an
anddroid user that, tho. Spender 9grsecurity.net0 has exposed the ext4 bug,
wich allows remote user addition to, whatever kernel, i assume runs the ext4
right... with some small changes ofc to code... so, it is strange they dont
patch, i myself use 1.6 , but, wow this rally blows things for many users..
interesting stuff, and maybe is good thing i use the old 1.6 api.. hehe.
seems newer the stuff, more the chances of malicious activity.. i guess NOTW
m anagement mustve known this one forsure.
thx for that, insightful , and,reminds me more that, a phone nowdays is
almost as dangerous as a laptop in your hand.
cheers,
xd
