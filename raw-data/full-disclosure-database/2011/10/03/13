No not the broken window effect, his outlook about how being s asmall
criminal, always becoming a bigger one, is that the same? Oh well.. then...
i beg to differ with you but, i dont believe that statement, ifso, then we
would have alot more arrests indeed.
btw for those thinking there will be any 'fight' with n3td3v , cmon, guys
have faith, i was merely introducing myself to him after he rudely, and, i
do mean that, rudely and invasively started throwing about, words abit to
long for people of that intellect.
When his Iq grows, so will my affection for that mailing list again ;-)
The broken window effect, seems, broken.
or, am i just, thinking, that i am one of a minority here, wich, i doubt if
you were to count REAL FRIGGING LIFE YOU MORON.
Anyhow have a nice day, you are of the intellect iof a n3td3bv, please join
that list for cock-wipphings.
have a nice day, sire.
