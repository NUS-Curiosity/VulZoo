Small criminal can become big criminal if put in current prison system. Not
always, but a lot will. You put (As example) small hacker in prison with
lots of crooks, etc. Crooks see him/her as an asset for future work, and on
the putside they become bigger criminal. Max Butler is a fine example of the
failings of punitative justice.

Also, lol, tag soup it is xD
