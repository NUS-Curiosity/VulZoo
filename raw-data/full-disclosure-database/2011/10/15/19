- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Internet Explorer handles calls
to the method swapNode(). When a call to swapNode is issued on an node
within a document that has two body nodes, Internet Explorer frees an
attribute field for one of the body nodes and then later re-uses the
freed field during the node swap. This behavior could result in remote
code execution under the context of the current user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
