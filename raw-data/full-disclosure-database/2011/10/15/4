 that not everybody's been following the rules"

Except that they weren't obviously unarmed.

Not only where they not obviously unarmed, they appeared to be armed.

Look at the 4 minute mark.

That sure as shit looks like an RPG.

The crew thought the group was armed.  Ergo, they were cleared to engage.

This wasn't a war crime...and the allegation that it was just makes
people look ridiculous.
