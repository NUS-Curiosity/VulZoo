Subject: Re: [OT] Obama said: "American people understand
 that not everybody's been following the rules"

Hai!
Nothing but, that guy makes it look like, a bad anything,wherver he goes..
lol.
I suggest, dont say ANYTHING unless it is atleast ON TOPIC, be an adult, and
stop being such a rude dude,or ppl will just ignore.
Anyhow, no all jokes aside, please, be adult, and stop the abuse, or just
plain nastiness when challenging anothers opinion.
this, is extremely frustrating when trying to also answer or, just read a
decent list... LAately, ive seen wayy to much on this *nigger* and *obama*
craps, I hope it ends about now.
I do not think, terrorism/sitins/wall street and, any of the other things
todo with that whole thread, is anything useful, and, sofar all im doing, is
trashing them emails rather than usually i read, when i see the topic or any
of the little offtopic sidethreads,once again inspired by nonsense, and, non
adult childish acts of simply being *rude* to others, and then not expecting
it, in return.Welcome to RealLife buddy!
I suggest making filter for [OT]: and maybe setting it as protocol..
because, this topic is Nothing todo with FD, IT , nor, do i see many people
who give a damn, and, other newbies, like myself..have to read garbage, wich
has nothing atall todo with whats going on , now, in our real world, where,
there is somuch more IT sec news atm, why be talking about obama bin barak
when you could be talking about, angelina jollie and, immaculate breasts!
thats a better [OT]: , so, out of all the phone hax scandals, Im shocked
NOTHING about it has come to FD lists yet... anyone, sharing pics :P coz,
really, i aint joking but there is ALOT of now public wich were one DEFNOT
public,photos and even claims that, many are actually real.. not by actual
staements but, i see suings so, some of them, are really tue...when here we
probably were thinking , many were cropshots and adjusted photchops.. I am
amazed at howmany women, and men, like to take picks of theyre .. pinkish
bits.
Aalot of plain nudeshots by boyfriends takling snaps on the GF phone, then
transferring to theyre phone ... hehe.. makes sens, take picture on gf
phone, gf feels like "ok no1 else will see but me and him" , then, they
forgt that theyre using a VERY smartphone, to smart for them even!
Alas, there goes those pics, transferred with all the latest tech gadgets,
that makesure it simply takes even random pics, and sends to a websigte, i
mean,how secure are phones when, android are still vulnerable to complete
ext4 partition handling errors/d0s and local root escalation...after what,
2yrs of it being news.... Then, they complain when people make use of
basically a *google* in some cases, picking the right words to show
images/cams, and, thats just online GHD stuff wich is now very old news.

Nowdays It seems phones are overlooked,yet are huge in itsec now, and ipads
are also, being owned.. and, i could easily proove this on any one range,
just scannning vnc port 5900, and watch the amount of macs, thats because
they have still not updated the vnc packge enough to be blocked by scanners,
and, from there your sitting in the server in viewer-vnc.
Ohwell.I will be looking at the recent scandals, alot of them and, one is
very hot model miranda kerr (Orlando bloom's wife i believe).
She was owned, now allegedly many many others, also have been targetted in
simply UDP bluetooth hacks and wifi range hacks.. wich is very clever, as
one picture, could be worth somuch as the News of The World (packer
empire-ex)
Id love accesss to theyre db ;p~
cheers,
xd

ps wtf was this about again... o ye.. that obama guy..
