Subject: [Full-flame-war] There used to be a security
	mailing list at this address.

If you guys are going to continue your little flame war, would you at *least* trim
the non-relevant parts of the mail you're replying to? And at least be *creative*
in your flaming, m'kay?

Oh, and quit top-posting.

(And the person who wanted more pink bits - if you can't find free pr0n on the
internet on your own, you're obviously *waaay* too young to be posting on this
list)
