I hears you chewing ... you just could nor to resist to say anything, i
think this prooves exactly what i said,
you are a sneak and, you go OUT of your way to annoy people.
I found a very sound explanation and find it rather funny, expecially seeing
the bridge-troll vid ;p, this made me deadset cry in laughter... pure
genius.
Anyhow, as i was not saying but some other pest was...
The average troll life expectancy is slowly diwndling so low, due to
inbreeding and such..can be seen on Nat Geo
"The plight of the tr0ll' by 'The crocodile hunter' archives, direct in 3D
animated funography, now available on DVD/BluRay and Cassette...
Now anyhow, after saying and swearing you would not bite, you took someone
elses baiting.. your classical 1on1 pic-to-me tripl- certified geek, and no,
not just a smart guy, your a frigging REAL geek, who actually, acts like the
"troll" portrayals that explain exactly what one does, wich took me awhile
to understand, even when i had not realise, i was doing it myself at
times...luckily this was LONG BEFORE any nonsential rubbish threads like
this one, being left open by, the one and only man of the geek-hour!
Its wait for it...
wait for it...
GeekaZonk!
The solution to all your fucking annoying hardware problems, rolled into one
bad-image file, so you can now load a BSOD ready windows, complete with
christians debugger, wich can find a troll in a hole :-)
T(Mating season, he developed tis...and it still failed...)
yes thats right, total garbage, alot like the thread and any crap about who
and what is a top-posting etc.. asin, like really, wtf is one :s, i assume
thats not picking the right person to send the mail through... or, ill earn
ssoon enough, christi baby will come to my emotional rescue...
/me does a spin and swings his hiops, owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
gnite!
