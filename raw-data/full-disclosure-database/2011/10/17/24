 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2011:152
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ncompress
 Date    : October 17, 2011
 Affected: 2010.1, Enterprise Server 5.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in ncompress:
 
 An integer underflow leading to array index error was found in the
 way gzip used to decompress files / archives, compressed with the
 Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. A remote attacker could
 provide a specially-crafted LZW compressed gzip archive, which once
 decompressed by a local, unsuspecting user would lead to gzip crash,
 or, potentially to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of
 the user running gzip (CVE-2010-0001).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 4.2.4.4 version which
 is not vulnerable to this issue.
