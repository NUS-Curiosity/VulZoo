Subject: Disclosures on YouTube (Onaquad Systems Security)

List,
I'll now be putting up my disclosures on YouTube a day or two before on
full-disclosure.  You can visit them here:
http://www.youtube.com/user/onaquad under the title Onaquad Security.  Hope
you enjoy!  I'll probably start posting the src of the code I use there here
too.  There is already some cool stuff there, tutorials and such, and some
unique code.  If there is anything there you'd like to have, you can email
me about it.
