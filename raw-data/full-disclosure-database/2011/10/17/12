Subject: Re: Breaking the links: Exploiting the linker

CVEs have now been assigned to the two previously reported bugs as follows:

> 1)  http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/downloads.php?id=83 - Privesc attack

CVE-2011-4061.  FWIW I now have a version of the exploit for this working on 
AIX, based on a copy of kbbacf1 from IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6.1.0.6.  It 
therefore appears that the vulnerable version of kbbacf1 isn't just shipped 
with DB2.

> 2) http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/downloads.php?id=80 - Generic attack on

CVE-2011-4060.

Cheers,
Tim
