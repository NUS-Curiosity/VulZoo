I have heard rumors of an instance that would qualify:

Supposedly there was a fellow who knew he was under police
surveillance for bad computing behavior of some sort or another, and
had prepared for a raid by outfitting his residence with video
cameras, and his computer with a kill switch.

Little did he know that he was more literal than expected. He had
packed the computer case full of thermite, rather than simply putting
an ounce or three on top of the hard drive.

He was next to the computer when noticed a raid descending, and he hit
the kill switch. There wasn't much left of the room he was in...

I've not been able to verify this story, but it does come from a
source that I consider reliable.
