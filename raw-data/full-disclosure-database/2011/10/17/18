Hmm.. for computer related ones? Good question.

The Darwin Awards are for those who remove themselves from the gene pool in
*spectacular* ways.  They disallow entrants for reasons of mental disease or
defect-- so failing to reproduce just because you're a troll living in your
parent's basement loses twice - it's commonplace, not spectacular, and
it usually isn't a result of a conscious decision you made.

Having said that. I suppose it *is* possible.  Consider the (hiopefully
hypothetical) example of an expreme overclocker who does something predictably
stupid and ends up with a lapful of liquid nitrogen and a case of severe
frostbite.  Gives a whole new meaing to "shatter attack" ;)

Yeah, *that* would get a Darwin. ;)
