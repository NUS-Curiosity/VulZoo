There's a difference between not having any brains and not using what you got.

"The candidate must be capable of sound judgment.

Humans are generally capable of sound judgment, except those with mental
handicaps that render them unable to fully comprehend the ramifications of
their actions."

Departing the gene pool in a spectacularly stupid way because you *can't*
think it through is just a sad event.  Doing it because you *didn't bother* thinking
it through is Darwin Award fodder.

Somebody mentioned a (probably apocryphal) incident using thermite - that's a
good example. The person was *aware* that thermite burns *really hot*, and
didn't take proper care.  This is a totally different situation from some poor
soul with Down's Syndrome, who sees thermite burn once, and thinks it's
*really* pretty and decides to light some himself...
