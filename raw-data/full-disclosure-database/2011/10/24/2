Subject: Defeating WLAN Security

Greetings,

I would like to ask if there is someone on this list that would like  
to share some insight on assessing, defeating (if any is known) wlan  
security appliances like the Motorola AirDefense.

http://www.airdefense.net/index.php

Insight on assessment, comparison with other WLAN security device,  
performance, etc. will be very much appreciated.

ty,
pknull
