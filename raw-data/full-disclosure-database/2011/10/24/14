It's not news - it's *long* been known that Tor would be breakable if somebody
pwned a sufficient percentage of the nodes.  It's been regarded as a mostly
theoretical attack, because the sort of people that run Tor have up to now been
the paranoid type that tend to secure their systems better.

The only part of *news* in it was this:

"Researchers showed that one third of the nodes are vulnerable,"

So maybe the "people who run Tor are more paranoid" assumption is flawed and
needs to be reconsidered.
