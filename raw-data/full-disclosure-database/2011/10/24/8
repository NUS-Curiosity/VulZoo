Subject: G+ app steals images


FYI, G+ app on Android just steals any images you make using camera. I
just made photo using camera and minute later it appeared on
https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ep3-OdJSCY/TqTL05oMWzI/AAAAAAAAAs4/luE-w5IE3ZE/s800/DSC_0107.JPG without my permission. Google claims that this image is visible only to me. Clearly this is not true.
