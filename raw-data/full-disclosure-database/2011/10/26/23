Denial of Service Vulnerability in Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20111026-camera

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 October 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the Cisco Video
Surveillance IP Cameras 2421, 2500 series and 2600 series of devices.
An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by sending crafted RTSP TCP packets to an affected device. Successful
exploitation prevents cameras from sending video streams, subsequently
causing a reboot. The camera reboot is done automatically and does not
require action from an operator.

There are no workarounds available to mitigate exploitation of this
vulnerability that can be applied on the Cisco Video Surveillance IP
Cameras.  Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the
network are available.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:
