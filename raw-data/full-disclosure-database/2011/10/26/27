Cisco Security Advisory: Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in the Cisco WebEx Player

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20111026-webex

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 October 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+----------------------------------------------------------------


Summary
=======

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx
Recording Format (WRF) player. In some cases, exploitation of the
vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user.

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back
WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting
site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players
can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording
file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be
manually installed for offline playback after downloading the
application from www.webex.com

If the WRF player was automatically installed, it will be
automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when
users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site.
If the WRF player was manually installed, users will need to manually
install a new version of the player after downloading the latest
version from www.webex.com

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111026-webex

Note: Effective October 18, 2011, Cisco moved the current list of
Cisco Security Advisories and Responses published by Cisco PSIRT. The
new location is http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing
You can also navigate to this page from the Cisco
Products and Services menu of the Cisco Security Intelligence
Operations (SIO) Portal. Following this transition, new Cisco
Security Advisories and Responses will be published to the new
location. Although the URL has changed, the content of security
documents and the vulnerability policy are not impacted. Cisco will
continue to disclose security vulnerabilities in accordance with the
published Security Vulnerability Policy.

Affected Products
=================

The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco
WRF players. The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux
versions of the players are all affected. Review the following
table for the list of releases that contain the nonvulnerable
code. Affected versions of the players are those prior to client
build T26 SP49 EP40 and T27 SP28. These build numbers are
available only to WebEx site administrators. End users will see a
version such as "Client build: 27.25.4.11889." This indicates the
server is running software version T27 SP25 EP4.

To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an
affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to
their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads
section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed
on the right side of the page under "About Support Center." See
"Software Versions and Fixes" for details.

Cisco recommends that users upgrade to the most current version
of the player that is available from www.webex.com/
downloadplayer.html. If the player is no longer needed, it can be
removed using the "Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller" or "Meeting
Services Removal tool" available at support.webex.com/support/
downloads.html.

Users can manually verify the installed version of the WRF player
to determine whether it is affected by these vulnerabilities. To
do so, an administrator must examine the version numbers of the
installed files and determine whether the version of the file
contains the fixed code. Detailed instructions on how to verify
the version numbers are provided in the following sections. 

The following tables provide the first nonvulnerable version of
each object.

Microsoft Windows
+----------------
Two dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) were updated on the
Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that
are described in this advisory. These files are in the folder C:\
Program Files\WebEx\Record Playback or C:\Program Files (x86)\
Webex\Record Player. The version number of a DLL can be obtained
by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer,
right-clicking on the file name, and choosing Properties. The
Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details on
the library version. The following table gives the first fixed
version number for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal

Details
=======

The WebEx meeting service is a hosted multimedia conferencing
solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The WRF file
format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been
recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online
meeting attendee. The players are applications that are used to play
back and edit recording files (files with a .wrf extension). The WRF
players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a
recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream
playback mode). The WRF players can also be manually installed after
downloading the application from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html 
to play back recording files locally (for offline playback mode).

The Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) Player is affected by the
following vulnerabilities:

Cisco WebEx Player WRF Parsing Vulnerability
This vulnerability has been assigned the following Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier: CVE-2011-3319

Cisco WebEx Player ATAS32 Processing Vulnerability
This vulnerability has been assigned the following Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier: CVE-2011-4004

The vulnerabilities may cause the player application to crash or, in
some cases, remote code execution could occur.

To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the player application would
need to open a malicious WRF file. An attacker may be able to
accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file
directly to users (for example, by using e-mail) or by directing a
user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered
by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this
document could cause the Cisco WRF player application to crash and,
in some cases, allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on
the system with the privileges of the user who is running the WRF
player application.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

These vulnerabilities are first fixed in the following versions: 

  * T26 SP49 EP40
  * T27 FR20
  * T27 SP11 EP23
  * T27 SP21 EP9
  * T27 SP23
  * T27 SP25 EP3
  * T27 SP28

The client build is listed in the Support > Downloads section of the
WebEx page after a user authenticates. WebEx bug fixes are cumulative
in a major release. For example, if release T27 SP22 EP9 is fixed,
release T27 SP22 EP23 will also have the software fix.  End users
will see a version such as "Client build: 27.25.4.11889." This
indicates the server is running software version T27 SP25 EP4.

If a WRF player was automatically installed, it will be automatically
upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a
recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site.

If a WRF player was manually installed, users will need to manually
install a new version of the player after downloading the latest
version from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html. If the player is no
longer needed, it can be removed using the "Mac Cisco-WebEx
Uninstaller" or "Meeting Services Removal tool" available at 
support.webex.com/support/downloads.html
