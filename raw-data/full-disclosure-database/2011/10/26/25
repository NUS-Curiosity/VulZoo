Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following Cisco UCCX versions are vulnerable:

  * Cisco UCCX version 6.0(x)
  * Cisco UCCX version 7.0(x)
  * Cisco UCCX version 8.0(x)
  * Cisco UCCX version 8.5(x)

Note: Cisco UCCX versions prior to 6.0(x) reached end of software
maintenance. Customers running versions prior to 6.0(x) should
contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a
supported version of Cisco UCCX.

The following Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response versions
are vulnerable:

  * Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response version 6.0(x)
  * Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response version 7.0(x)
  * Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response version 8.0(x)
  * Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response version 8.5(x)

Note: Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response versions prior to
6.0(x) reached end of software maintenance. Customers running
versions prior to 6.0(x) should contact their Cisco support team for
assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified IP
Interactive Voice Response.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

With the exception of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, no other
Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco Unified Contact Center Express is a single/two node server,
integrated "contact center in a box" for use in deployments with up to
300 agents until software version 8.0(x) and 400 agents starting at
version 8.5(x).

The Cisco Unified Interactive Voice Response is a UCCX product package
that provides IP call queuing and IP intelligent voice response
functionality for contact centers.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unified Contact Center
Express Directory Traversal Vulnerability 

Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Contact Center
Express and Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response contain a
directory traversal vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the filesystem.

The vulnerability is due to improper input validation, and could allow
the attacker to traverse the filesystem directory. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL to the
affected system.

The vulnerability in Cisco Unified Contact Center Express and Cisco
Unified IP Interactive Voice Response could be exploited over TCP port
8080 in 6.0(x) and 7.0(x) versions and TCP port 9080 starting in
8.0(x) version of the product.

Note: In Cisco Unified Contact Center Express and Cisco Unified IP
Interactive Voice Response versions 6.0(x) and 7.0(x), port 8080 could
be reconfigured on the server.

This advisory addresses the vulnerability in Cisco Unified Contact
Center Express and Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response, which
is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts44049, and has been assigned CVE ID
CVE-2011-3315.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss


* CSCts44049 - UCCX vulnerable to directory traversal 

CVSS Base Score - 7.8
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         None
    Availability Impact -      None

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.4
