Hello!
I dont know why, but i really enjoyed his talk.
I guess i was abit in tune with the humorous side ofit, but, i think he did
a great, fun job :P
I mean, it was prettymuch a session of , dont use svn/cvs , use git ,but
with abit of fun
for once!
I like this,m aslong as it doesnt become a disturbing trend amongst linux
programmers,i doubt that,
then it was really a cool speech about git, and, although i use both git and
svn, i see no problems with svn sofar, as a simple system that is, in
comparison to gitweb/git , wich is also simple but i guess it has alot more
advantages.
i liked the video!Thanks!
xd
