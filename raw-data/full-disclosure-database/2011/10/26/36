ZDI-11-303 : Apple QuickTime H264 Stream frame_cropping Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-303
October 26, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3219

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Apple



-- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Quicktime handles H.264 streams.
When parsing the Sequence Parameter Set data for a H.264 stream it reads
the frame cropping offset fields. When those fields contain incorrect
data Quicktime will eventually write outside the buffer allocated for
the movie stream. This can result in remote code execution under the
context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
