Subject: noise: Possible skydrive link to gov

Hi.
I recently have heard that police, in some places, are using an app called
SkyDrive to get 'dox' on people, they seem to be hiding it but, i dont know
much yet on this expect, that is ptretty certain, they are using skydrive
9police) in some places... but, to what extent.. i know you can share
folders etc on skydrive... its just curious to me.. nothing big.
If anyone has hard proof would be great.
