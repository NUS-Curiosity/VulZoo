ZDI-11-305 : Oracle Java Applet Rhino Script Engine Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability

October 26, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3544

-- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

-- Affected Vendors:

Oracle



-- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Java handles Rhino Javascript
errors. The built-in javascript engine in Java fails to perform
sufficient sanitation on javascript error objects. The effect is that
untrusted code can run in privileged context. This can result in remote
code execution under the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
