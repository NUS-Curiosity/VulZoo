Impact
======

These vulnerabilities have the following impact on Cisco Show and
Share:

  * CSCto73758: Anonymous users can access some administration pages
    Several administrative web pages of the Cisco Show and Share can
    be accessed without prior user authentication. The impact of the
    different administrative web pages include:

    Encoders Configurations
    +----------------------
    The Encoders Configuration pages have a direct impact on live
    events. If all of the encoders from the encoders' configurations
    are removed, then a live event cannot be created. An encoder or a
    push configuration is required in order for a live event to be
    created. This page also reveals information about the encoders,
    such as Encoder IP Address and associated username.

    Push Configurations
    +------------------
    The Push Configurations and Encoders Configuration pages have a
    direct impact on live events. If all of the encoders of push
    configurations are removed, then a live event cannot be created.
    An encoder or a push configuration is required in order for a
    live event to be created.

    Video Encoding Formats
    +---------------------
    Video encoding formats have a direct impact on the encoders. Even
    with an encoder or a push configuration configured, if no video
    format is specified then the encoder cannot encode the video
    stream for the live event.


    Transcoding
    +----------
    This page does not have a direct impact on live events or the
    encoders. This page will only set a task to be executed for
    transcoding. Transcoding is a process of deriving digital media
    files that use one codec from digital media files that use a
    different codec; the source file is not changed or destroyed. If
    all tasks are removed the set task for transcoding will not be
    executed.

  * CSCto69857: Cisco Show and Share arbitrary code execution
    vulnerability
    An authenticated user may upload arbitrary code that can be
    executed on the appliance with the same privileges as the web
    server.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt 
And any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the software table (below) names a Cisco SnS release
train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest
possible releases that contains the fix (along with the anticipated
date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed in the
"First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended Release"
column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the published
vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory. A device running a
release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a
specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be
vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or later
than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the table.
