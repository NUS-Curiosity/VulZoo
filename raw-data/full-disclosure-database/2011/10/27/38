You might want to try out my tool from
http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2010/FilesystemRecursionAndSymlinks/
from the references section at end of the page. With appropriate
watchcount parameter, it won every race against each backup system
tested back then. As to my knowledge, only tar was fixed so far.
Running it against cpio even triggers buffer overflow, so direct root
escalation might be possible.

I haven't done proof for MS-Systems, does someone have interest in a
joint venture?
