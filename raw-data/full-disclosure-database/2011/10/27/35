Nice thing, but for sure, it can be optimized. 

For example, to save time, I would suggest you to use rename() instead
of using both unlink() and rmdir() functions.  Same thing for your
write_shellcode() function, it contains too much calls.  It would be
preferable to create your nasty shell script first, and then (when it's
time), rename() it as dirname. 

Cheers,
