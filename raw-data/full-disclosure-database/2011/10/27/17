Umm. Maybe in *that step* it's "at most". But what can you leverage
that into?

If you can screw with the code execution of the tar command
enough to get root to untar a file of your choosing, you then have your
entire rootkit installed with no further effort on your part. ;)

(For a wonderful read on leveraging, find the tech writeup from a few years
ago on how a 1-byte overlay in ntpd got leveraged into a total root pwn.)
