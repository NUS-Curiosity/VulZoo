Package        : torque
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-2193

Bartlomiej Balcerek discovered several buffer overflows in torque server,
a PBS-derived batch processing server.  This allows an attacker to crash the
service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the server via crafted
job or host names.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain torque.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.15+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.15+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.
