ZDI-11-313 : Apple QuickTime FLC RLE Packet Count Decompression Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-313
October 27, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3223

-- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

-- Affected Vendors:

Apple



-- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Quicktime decodes flic file.
Flic files can contain FLC Delta Decompression block containing Run
Length Encoded data. When Quicktime tries to decompress this data it
reads a user supplied RLE Packet count field from the file and uses that
as loop counter. A high value for this field will cause Quicktime to
write outside previously allocated memory which could result into remote
code execution.

-- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
