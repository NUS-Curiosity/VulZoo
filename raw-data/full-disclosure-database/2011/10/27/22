It's not the value of the exploit that matters to me at all (not going to
find much using bzexe these days with 1tb disks running around) it's the
thrill of the hunt. I wanted to see if it could be done.

I'm not trying to be an ass, just trying to see if exploiting this would
indeed work.  At first I didn't think it was possible but spoke with vladz

wouldn't intentionally insult anyone.
