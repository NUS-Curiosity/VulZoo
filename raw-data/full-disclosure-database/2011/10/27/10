Skydrive is the Microsoft cloud storage product, for documents, pictures, etc. It is similar to Dropbox, which is already a well-known LE intel source.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] noise: Possible skydrive link to gov

Hi.
I recently have heard that police, in some places, are using an app called SkyDrive to get 'dox' on people, they seem to be hiding it but, i dont know much yet on this expect, that is ptretty certain, they are using skydrive 9police) in some places... but, to what extent.. i know you can share folders etc on skydrive... its just curious to me.. nothing big.
If anyone has hard proof would be great.
