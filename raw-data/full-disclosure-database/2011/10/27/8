Hi everyone,

We're happy to announce that the sixth annual SANS AppSec Summit will be 
held in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 30 - May 1, 2012.

The theme for this conference is "Application Security at Scale".

Billions of records in the cloud. Millions of smart mobile devices. 
Millions of developers writing new code. Hundreds of apps in your 
enterprise. Untold numbers of existing bugs. Unknown numbers of 
"sophisticated" attackers exploiting your software. What cutting edge 
techniques are attackers using? How do large enterprises handle these 
problems at scale? And how do small companies manage it all with fewer 
resources?

We invite you to submit presentations in the following areas:

- Cloud Security
- Mobile Security
- Security in the SDLC
- Secure Coding
- Security Architecture
- Securing Legacy Applications
- Securing Open Source Frameworks
- Program Development
- Security Metrics
- Security Testing
- Penetration Testing
- Cutting Edge Attacks
- Cutting Edge Defense
- Case Studies
- Any topic related to Application Security

Submission Deadline
February 1, 2012

Submit papers via EasyChair (account required). Talks will be 50 minutes 
in length.
