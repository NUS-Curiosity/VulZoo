Hello readers and welcome to issue #7.
It has been a long journey since the first release of the magazine and we have seen a lot of changes and 
improvements overtime and still trying our best to do more.

But as we grow, the amount of work and the time we need to spend working on the magazine have also increased, 
thus requiring us to recruit more people to join our small editorial team. So, if you think you would like to 
do something for the community and believe that we can have a great use of your talent - Feel free to drop 
us an email!

As for issue #7, Jonathan Kent wrote a great piece of article about the current global crisis in the cyberspace 
while Aditya K. Sood and his team on the other hand wrote about extending SQL injection attacks through buffer 
overflow exploitation. We are also very happy to have Jonathan Brossard contributing an article introducing the 
readers to his newly released exploitation framework. We will leave you to explore the rest of the articles and 
we hope you enjoy them. Have fun reading this issue and more to come in issue #8!!

Zarul Shahrin Suhaimi
Editor-in-Chief,
