Too funny:

"Interestingly, it was Ryan who revealed himself as a snitch. We
learned of these emails from the archive Ryan leaked yesterday in the

the archive of September17discuss emails, it appears he accidentally
included some of his own forwarded emails indicating he was ratting
out organizers."
