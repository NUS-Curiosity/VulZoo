Perdue has a top notch infosec program (check out
http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/) and Carnegie Mellon hosts CERT
(http://www.cert.org/) and has an excellent reputation.  Ross Anderson
teaches at Cambridge and working with him is extremely prestigious.
University of Pennsylvania has Matt Blaze (http://www.crypto.com/).
Matt Bishop teaches at UC Davis (http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/bishop/).
Those are the heavy hitters I can think of off the top of my head.

You're right though - if you wanna be the next Rivest, Shamir, Adleman
(RSA) you gotta go MIT.  If you want to be that kind of hacker you're
going to have to stay in school.
