Subject: What are some top universities in Europe and
	States for Information Security

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello List.

I need some help....

What are some top Universities in information security in the
world? Which one is the best?  preferably in the States or U.K ?

I know this sounds strange since most college dropouts are
historically the best hackers in the world!

Im just trying to figure out which are the best schools in this
field.
I already know MIT and Stanford are good for Computer science. But
when it comes to Information Security, im sure there are some top
institutions that employers would love to see them on your cv.


Thanks.
