Dan,

IE allows you to right-click on a folder (but not on a file or on the  
"background") inside a file:// iframe without popping up a security  
warning. No idea why but it does.

I personally think that the "click twice on this web page" exploit  
that we released today requires even less social engineering than the  
"Send to" one.

I can partly agree with this for local attacks where attacker places a  
malicious file - be it .ppt or .exe - somewhere on user's computer or  
USB drive and get the user to double-click it. With a remote attack of  
this type, Windows Explorer will issue a security warning if you  
double-click an .exe on a remote share, but will let you double-click  
a .ppt without such warning. It's hard to say what percentage of users  
would actually be stopped by such warning but I'd consider it a part  
of the security model.

Another case where a malicious .ppt lookalike executable would be  
thwarted but binary planting may not be is with Windows Software  
Restriction Policy or Windows AppLocker. In their default  
configurations, both stop launching EXEs from untrusted locations, but  
don't stop loading DLLs from arbitrary folders. So double-clicking on  
a .ppt lookalike executable would be blocked, but a malicious DLL next  
to a real .ppt file wouldn't be. But again, no idea as to how many/few  
computers use this protection.

Security research is never complete, so we settle for constant improvement.

Cheers,
Mitja
