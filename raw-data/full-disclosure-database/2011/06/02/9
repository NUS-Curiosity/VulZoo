Could someone share the sample with me? It seem that for me the domain does not resolv.

Resolving safetylife2011.org... failed: Name or service not known.

Bit strange..

foo@bar:~$ host safetylife2011.org
safetylife2011.org has address 84.127.74.15
safetylife2011.org has address 71.37.32.247
safetylife2011.org has address 82.159.38.56
safetylife2011.org has address 85.84.60.87
safetylife2011.org has address 46.223.138.2 (TCP 80 not responding)

Every online host is running nginx 0.8.54 web server.

Best regards,
Henri Salo
