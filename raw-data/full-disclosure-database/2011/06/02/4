Subject: FFFjacking

Same web browsers allow to show directory index or content of text-based
file in frame, when it is loaded via FILE protokol. It enables hijacking of
informations from user's local disk by drag&drop methods. I call this
technique "FFFjacking (File From Frame hiJacking)". Combination of Windows
XP and Internet Explorer(6,7,8) allows files downloading or uploading
between user's local disk and shared folder on attacker's SMB server.

 

I published PoC (0-day exploit) which shows the way, how to run executable
program in user's computer.

 

These techniques are described in detail in my article:
