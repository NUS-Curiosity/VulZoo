Sure you can.  Email secure@...rosoft.com<mailto:secure@...rosoft.com> and let them know what the problem is, "real" address or not.  Make a fake one, it doesn't matter.  That would be "responsible disclosure."

Subject: [Full-disclosure] xp sp3 remote bof

Hi guys,

I'm pretty new in these parts, and to the scene in general, but I've been doing low level dev for a while. Anyway introductions aside, I have a somewhat stable remote bof poc for xp sp3 (which I'm not going to go into detail about), and I've signed up to this list to ask the security community what I should do. I figured I can't just email Microsoft from my personal email address, and I wouldn't even know who to email at Microsoft. So I'm open to the advice of those a bit more experienced.
ciao,
chown
