i don't spell skillz  "C I S S P"
  ... and respectable blackhats aren't paid hourly!

(btw, it would take 5-15 minutes, cell phone resellers are great
avenues into carrier networks, and you gotta bait your phishes,

basic competencies and practices are "paranoia" level precautions.
this is what makes infosec great!

however i agree with your premise. it's a business decision; nobody
cares; and it's cheaper to fuck off now and repent later on the off
chance (read: very slim chance) you lose your bet on the pwnies... and
even then you're likely able to pass the buck off on the next vendor
or provider - Get Out of Responsibility Free Card!


now pardon me as i sate this urge to inebriate which you have
masterfully instilled via discourse on the destitute digital denizens
devoid of any desire to deliver themselves from the absurd theater
that is "information security" and the prevalent lack thereof.
