Subject: xp sp3 remote bof

Hi guys,

I'm pretty new in these parts, and to the scene in general, but I've been
doing low level dev for a while. Anyway introductions aside, I have a
somewhat stable remote bof poc for xp sp3 (which I'm not going to go into
detail about), and I've signed up to this list to ask the security community
what I should do. I figured I can't just email Microsoft from my personal
email address, and I wouldn't even know who to email at Microsoft. So I'm
open to the advice of those a bit more experienced.

ciao,
chown
