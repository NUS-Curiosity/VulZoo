Subject: New CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem
	Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of Ukrtelecom's
representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about multiple
vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models also
could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct CSRF
or XSS attack.

CSRF (WASC-09):

This vulnerability allows to conduct Clear Statistics for interface.

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgestatsclearintfstats.html?ImBridge.ImBridgeInterfaces.ethernet

This vulnerability allows to conduct Flush Dynamic Entries for interface.

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgestatsflushintf.html?ImBridge.ImBridgeInterfaces.ethernet

In section Egress Ports
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridge_add_hvmfwdegressp.html?ImBridge.ImQbridgeFdbs.DefaultFdb.ImQbridgeMcastFdbEntries.FWDALLMCAST.ImQbridgeMcastEntryPorts) 
via CSRF it's possible to add or delete ports.

XSS (WASC-08):

In section Egress Ports
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridge_add_hvmfwdegressp.html?ImBridge.ImQbridgeFdbs.DefaultFdb.ImQbridgeMcastFdbEntries.FWDALLMCAST.ImQbridgeMcastEntryPorts)
there are 3 persistent XSS vulnerabilities.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5213/).
