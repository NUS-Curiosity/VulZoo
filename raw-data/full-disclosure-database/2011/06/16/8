Subject: Apache 2.0.63 - 2.2.19 Remote Exploit Fake or not?

Hi, all,
Some days ago I found head -n * of exploit for apache at patebin.com
http://pastebin.com/XEFnG9D6


#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# Apache 2.0.63 - 2.2.19 Remote Exploit
#
# This 0-day exploit will remotely gain root on any apache server from
version 2.0.63 to 2.2.19
# Beta release 2.3.12-beta was also compromised by an affiliate - need
verification...


and a little post on axivo.com
http://www.axivo.com/community/threads/apache-root-remote-exploit-released.125/

look like fake, but if it will true - it will very dangerous!
