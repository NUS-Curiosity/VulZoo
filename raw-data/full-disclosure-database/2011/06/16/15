It was discovered that Movable Type, a weblog publishing system,
contains several security vulnerabilities:

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code in a logged-in users'
web browser.

A remote attacker could read or modify the contents in the system
under certain circumstances.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), no update is available at this

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.5+dfsg-2+squeeze2.
