core und ibm and their stupid, boring, corporate timeline drama.
it's a stupid csrf in the first place. ibm is a big company and it
_will_ have delays patching their many, many shitty products from
their humongous product catalog, and core knows that. Also IbM has
a lot of jew money that could be spent on a jew security team that
would be in charge of fixing vulnerabilities in a very jewy-timely
manner, `see koshersec`.
