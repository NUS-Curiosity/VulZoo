You can do what Thor said, or you can make money by selling it to:
A: the white market, like ZDI (zerodayinitiative.com ) for example (they
will contact MS to fix it)
B: the black market. (they will hack and steal money thanks to you)
C: (if you have the contacts) the government. (they will try to nuke Iran)
money(A) < money (B) < money(C)
if(A || C) is not necessary to be anonymous (A will give you credit for
this)
there is a whole talk about selling 0days from ekoparty 09:
