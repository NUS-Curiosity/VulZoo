7.5, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the TextXtra.x32 module responsible for
parsing text elements within RIFF-based Director files. The code within
this module trusts various length and count values present in the file.
A boundary error exists when processing the data section of DEMX chunks,
which subsequently leads to a stack-based buffer overflow. This can be
leveraged to execute remote code under the context of the user running
the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
