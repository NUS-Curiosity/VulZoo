-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application handles multiple
javascript modifications to the document. In certain instances the
application will free an object due to a modification and then later
access it again when attempting to destroy it. This re-use can lead to
code execution under the context of the application.

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
