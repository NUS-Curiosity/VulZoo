Part of the problem is that your original PoC mail didn't in fact have x41s all
over the place.  Your original e-mail showed up as a multipart/alternative. In
the text/plain part, it had:

PoC1.
Ok, this is a PoC , this actual whole sentence...<http://www.lemonparty.biz>

And in the text/html part, it had (quoted-printable and all):

one, you can make the whole email, a url... i will do this right now..<br><=
br><br>PoC1.<br><a href=3D"http://www.lemonparty.biz">Ok, this is a PoC , t=

All of which makes it rather hard to figure out what you're talking about.  All
anybody sees is perfectly normal HTML anchor text, which is a *feature* that's
probably older than many readers of this list. ;)

See page 4 of the *original* HTML spec from 1993:

http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt

which includes the text:

                   Item one has an
                  <A NAME="anchor">
                   anchor
                  </A>
