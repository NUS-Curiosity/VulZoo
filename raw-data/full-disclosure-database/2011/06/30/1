You don't understand my question.

I'm studying and researching about solution of DDoS detection through
analysis of HTTP responses.

For example,
If only one response is detected several times, this is abnormal.

you're asking the wrong question.

instead of asking "How can I automagically detect exploitation of my

lead to resource exhaustion?"
