i implied that this is less than useful on actual systems than in theory / lab.

if you want to gather useful details you need to instrument analysis
of HTTP requests/responses individually - just culling logs or
counting netflows won't cut it.

for example, measuring long requests at a front-end proxy (haproxy,
nginx, other) separate from measuring the application request/response
relayed to backend. measuring SSL session establishment, resumption
separate from HTTP requests within that session. measuring TCP
congestion control over which HTTP requests are sent. etc, etc...

the list of papers / sources covering large-scale network and
application performance tuning for the web is too large to list here.
good luck!
