Subject: New DoS,
	CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Denial of Service, Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of
Ukrtelecom's representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about
multiple vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models
also could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into 
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this 
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for 
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct DoS, 
CSRF or XSS attack.

DoS (WASC-10):

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?120

At this request the restart of modem occurs.

CSRF (WASC-09):

These sections are hidden (they are not shown in admin panel), but it's 
possible to get to them by setting corresponding number in URL.

In section RIP Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?10) via CSRF it's possible to 
change parameters of RIP port.

In section Advanced RIP Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?10) via CSRF it's 
possible to change parameters of RIP port.

In section Bridge Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?12) via CSRF it's possible to 
change parameters of Bridge port.

In section Advanced Bridge Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?12) via CSRF it's 
possible to change parameters of Bridge port.

XSS (WASC-08):

These sections are hidden (they are not shown in admin panel), but it's 
possible to get to them by setting corresponding number in URL.

In section RIP Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?10) there are persistent XSS 
vulnerabilities in all text fields and some hidden fields.

In section Advanced RIP Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?10) there are 
persistent XSS vulnerabilities in all text fields and some hidden fields.

In section Bridge Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?12) there are persistent XSS 
vulnerabilities in some text fields and some hidden fields.

In section Advanced Bridge Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?12) there are 
persistent XSS vulnerabilities in some text fields and some hidden fields.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5231/).
