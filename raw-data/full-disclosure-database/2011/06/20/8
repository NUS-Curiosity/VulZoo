Subject: Re: ZDI-11-208: Adobe Shockwave rcsL Parsing
 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

I see numerous announcements from ZDI pointing to June 14th updates. Is that what big guys MS and Adobe missed in last week updates? If NO, then we need to stop ZDI from polluting our list with last year news. Anyway, I see repetitive announcements pretty often.
Thank you

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:

For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS, visit:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the rcsL chunk inside Adobe's RIFF-based Director file format. The code within the Dirapi.dll is affected by an integer wrap caused by size values being calculated without proper checking. This can lead to memory corruption which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:
