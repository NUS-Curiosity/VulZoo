While email filters are there for the using, me and a buddy created a
website for this exact purpose. I have not advertised it because it is still
a work in progress (very much so), however it is mostly functional. There
are still several features I wish to add.

The website grabs information from multiple sources like full disclosure and
bugtraq and allows you to create keywords to get alerted on, and only a
message containing the keyword will be sent to you. As a value added feature
of the website, we also offer an RSS feed if you'd rather consume RSS
instead of email. The RSS feed will only contain entries that match your
keywords. Since I don't approve of people spamming links on this mailing
list I will refrain from providing a URL in this message, but if you are
interested in seeing the website just reply to me and I'll send you the URL.

Is there any way to get full-disclosure without all the XSS, CSRF, IAA,
binary planting, PHP, and other non-vulnerabilities?

Cheers,
