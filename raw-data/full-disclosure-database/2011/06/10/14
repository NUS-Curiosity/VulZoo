Package        : vlc
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2194

Rocco Calvi discovered that the XSPF playlist parser of vlc, a multimedia
player and streamer, is prone to an integer overflow resulting in a
heap-based buffer overflow.  This might allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted
file.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze6.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.
