Sure, I'll have a look, but I think you need two very important features if you don't have them yet:
* Message de-duplication, to avoid duplicates caused by crossposts.
* Default include, so the keyword list is an inverse, not an only-if-match.

My rules would look like:
- sql inject
- php
- csrf
- iaa
- binary plant
+ *

The difficulty with email is that the posts don't often clearly indicate what they are in headers.  If they did, they'd be easily trashable.  Still, I'll give some more thorough and reversible filtering a try.

Cheers,
