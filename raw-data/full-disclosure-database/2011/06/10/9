Subject: Re: NiX API

This must be a sales-person, since it took 3 emails to tell us it's a proxy
blacklist.
And to use a phrase as "NiX API is effectily blocking 85% of all open
proxies 24/7/365 fully
automatically".
I would like to see a manualy operated proxy-blacklist that only works 6 h a
day in july.
