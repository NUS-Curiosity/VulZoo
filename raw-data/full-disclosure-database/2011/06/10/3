Again, of course it provides some protection, I'm just not sure about the 'reasonable' part.
The big issue is with the false positives.

One of my points was that many legit users end up using a datacenter's hosting IP.


> web proxies by whole world are hosted of course in hosting providers datacenters


Blocking web proxies would be OK, but you're blocking the whole provider because of it, refusing payments from the maybe hundreds or thousands of IP's that were never proxies and my be used by regular customers.

Blocking servers that have done portscanning in the last week/month would be reasonable too, I guess.
But from what I've seen (again, look at your stats) you put the whole /24 on block (as part of your 'very hard work') and probably leave it there for months.


> We leave this decision to you what to block or allow.


After a while it just seems like with that much effort of always adding/removing hosts one could just use his own blocking lists.

Block them from coming back with a proxy to sign up for free, YES. Blocking paying users, NO. There is a big difference.

If it's a TOR exit node, probably not. If it's some IP that belongs to a data center, probably yes. To make a decision, I would more rely on inconsistency between credit card country, geoip, and where the item will be shipped to. Blocking just based on the IP is a bad idea, and this has been my point all along.

Cool story, bro.

We probably agree for the most part, proxy IP's are suspicious I'm just saying I don't necessarily agree with your definition of what a proxy is and the idea of blocking customers blindly based on your list.
Anyway, the whole thread seems kind of offtopic to FD so no more replies from me. The only reason I replied in the frist place was to share my two cents related to the subject based on my experience with blocking proxies, Paypal chargebacks and to speak out for the legit customers who are 'suspicious' in your list but still pay for TorVPN.
