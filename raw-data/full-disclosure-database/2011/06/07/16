Nowadays more and more people suggest to throw away RSA SecurID tokens,
because its security strength has been weakened. A lot.

But those people forget that these tokens have multipurpose functions!

You can still use the SecurID tokens as: 
1. a nice key ring
2. measuring time - if 10 second granularity is enough
3. if you bought tokens in bulks, the PVC rack is a perfect ice cube maker

4. think about it as a 1.000.000 sided dice for RPG's, or as a simple PRNG
5. bottle opener (because everything is a bottle opener)

Please help to prove that SecurID tokens are still useable by giving new
ideas on reddit!
