Subject: Re: New attack vector for sale, firewall bypass

Yeah, it's a bit like using screen to avoid 're-downloading' something
you find over a remote shell, using a different shell than bash as
part of an exploit so the history file is unset/obscure from the
get-go, adding specific root permissions to a specific user to clone
root under a 'legit' uid like 1003, ect. Just all situational tricks
simple enough to not bother with a whitepaper.
