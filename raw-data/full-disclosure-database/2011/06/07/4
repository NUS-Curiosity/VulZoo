Subject: New attack vector for sale, firewall bypass

Hello,
I am willing to sell a new attack vector I have devised.  The proof of
concept code you will receive has the ability to arbitrarily upload files to
a webserver (tested on Apache), running linux with the well known perl read
pipe vulnerability in many web CGI applications.  This issue can also be
leveraged through PHP LFI and RFI attacks, and through almost any other
remote command execution vulnerability.  The code has been tested on BSD,
and does not seem to work stand alone, but BSD may be vulnerable as well, I
just don't have a box to test it properly on.  The code can upload an ASCII
or binary file to the webserver, even if the firewall rules prohibit
downloading.  For example, if you have a linux webserver running apache and
a vulnerable perl script, this proof of concept can upload a local root
exploit that cannot be downloaded with the remote command execution as a
local user (usually one of apache's users) due to iptables or another
firewall that blocks outbound connections to other
webservers/ftp/whathaveyou servers for download with
wget/curl/lwp-download/ftp and other local downloading utilities, or if
these utilities have been removed.  Once a (modified) local root exploit has
been uploaded, it can modify the iptables as the root user, then bind a
shell, or spawn a reverse shell, or drop another payload as root.  Please
contact me if you are interested in getting the PoC code, and bid a price.
 Please be reasonable.  When you contact me, payment details can be
arranged.  PoC code is written in perl, and is heavily commented.
