Subject: Re: Decrypting SSL for Network Monitoring

I wasn't intentionally being vague, and I don't honestly know much about
wordpress so the "feature" I exploited may very well be a [popular?] module
and not something custom. In any case, the issue is with the section at the
bottom that parses the referer to determine search engine queries (that
resulted in users landing on the page). It's an excellent concept for SEO
purposes, since relevant keywords will be linked together automagically
through user interaction but it's not really worth the trade off when the
"search query" isn't sanitized.

Also, you shouldn't modify files in real-time since it can (and did) lead to
information disclosure (revealed full path of wordpress installation, I
assume during one of your saves).

All in all, something as simple as $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] =
 @strip_tags($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']); at the top of one of the class files
would likely be enough to fix it for the time being.
