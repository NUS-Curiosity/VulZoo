The XSS results are from purely blackbox scan on Mambo 4.6.5.


Joomla (Joomla! 1.0.0) was released on September 16, 2005. It was a
re-branded release of Mambo 4.5.2.3 which, itself, was combined with
other bug and moderate-level security fixes.

>>From that statement, it can be assumed that the code bases of Mambo
4.5.2.4 and higher  are different from those of Joomla! 1.1 and
higher.  As you can say so, we may sync old Joomla! 1.x bugs in Mambo
4.6.x. But it may be time-consuming to analyze the code changes and
validity of bugs in each version of both CMS.
