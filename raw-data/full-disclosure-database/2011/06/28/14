Subject: Re: Decrypting SSL for Network Monitoring

My thoughts?

Before posting a URL to FD, make damn sure that it isn't vulnerable to any
type of injection attacks. Luckily for you, I simply hid everything on the
page. A malicious attacker could have done significantly worse.

Fix that, and *then* I'll read the article.
