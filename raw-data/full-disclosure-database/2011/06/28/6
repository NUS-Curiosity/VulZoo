 SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security

 <form id="category_form" action="?" method="get" 
 enctype="multipart/form-data">
 <p id="ba_content_list_top"><input type="hidden" name="bbs_code" 
 value="news" />
 <span class="floating_left">Category: <select name="ss[cat]"
