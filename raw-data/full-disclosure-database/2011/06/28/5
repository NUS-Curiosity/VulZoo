Wait, so you're telling me that you're running some program to find these
and then just reporting the results to this list? If so, please give some
credit to the program's author for actually finding these!

Or, if you mean you're just blindly throwing XSS attacks at random variables
hoping to find one that sticks... well, why hasn't a script been written for
this yet? (Or if one has, what's it called?)
