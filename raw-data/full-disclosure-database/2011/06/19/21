Subject: Re: Lulzsec as irc warrior 2.0?

Ciao Fabio ;-)

I understand your point of view, and for sure they are using 80% of the time
SQLi as the main attack vector to deface website/stealing data/whatever, 
but not always.
I'm quite sure they used some 0-days when they completely compromised 
some of their
targets that where not running webservers at all.

Some of them would certainly be script-kiddies that uses sqlmap, while 
being lucky enough
to find lame error-based SQLi, others for sure are skilled.

It's also not only a game when you steal hundred of thousand of data: 
you can always
resell it to some agencies/black-market that are hungry of that, as you 
do with CCs.

Ciao
Michele Orru'
