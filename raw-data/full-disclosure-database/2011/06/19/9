Subject: Re: Lulzsec as irc warrior 2.0?

TROLL DETECTED!

a) Not using  complex attacks could be a sign of smartness and the level 
of moronism of the admins! Are you jealous ?

b) And you are not good at it! Are you jealous ?

c)  crowd sourcing and community building is one of the most seeking 
thing currently in this era!

If they are fail trolls as you think, why are you so mad ?
I bet they have more girlfriends and friends than you will ever have!

Regards

Ps: Never send an email before breakfasting, Bon appetit anyway!
