I also experienced hacking and internet addiction in past, i mean when
you're young, you want to feel adrenaline pumping up and get it by doing
14 hours hacking per day!

But before or later that game will became or too dangerous or too boring
and you'll probably just park the boat.

In the meantime, have fun!
But always remember that every game has an end and it's up to you to
decide how your game will end!
