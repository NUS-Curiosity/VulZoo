Meh.  It's not worth hen shit on a pump handle without some details.   Your claim of "quite a few offers" doesn't really make much sense either.  You initially claim that you're new here, and to the scene in general, and that you need MSFT's security alias.  But even as a noob, you claim to have a remote exploit that you won't give any details on.  Do you actually believe that legitimate offers will come pouring in based on this claim?  Giving details would be trivial and can be accomplished without giving away any precious secrets.   An example would be "I have a POC that exploits a vulnerability in the XP SP3 firewall in its default configuration giving an attacker remote, unauthenticated system access."

The value of the list is in the vetting.   More likely than not, given the way you've approached this, you have probably come across something you *think* is a vulnerability that has some dependency on something like "if you get the administrator to run code that turns off the firewall first, it is possible to get them to click this link on a remote SMB share that might trigger a bof, which might be exploitable."

You were obviously aware of the concept of responsible disclosure, or you wouldn't have posted asking for Microsoft's security alias (which in itself tells us you can't use The Google).  You then, on the Full Disclosure list, tell everyone how you would rather keep it to make money and not share any details.   I think you meant to find the "Bull Disclosure" list instead.

Thanks for the advice guys. I've received quite a few interesting offers from some rather shady sounding people (as well as public messages here), and I've begun to realise how much this is worth. So for the time being anyway I think I'll keep it for a rainy day. Cheers again for the input.

ciao,

If you got a real PoC then the guys at Microsoft will listen and will acknowledge you fast...   but if your PoC is not ok, and it just show a small bug, or if you want to remain anonymous then ZDI is the way to go IMO or you will end up waiting for an answer from MS for month before to discover that it has been patched without any thanks or acknowledgement.

Nb, You can email cert (cert@...t.org/soc@...cert.gov<mailto:cert@...t.org/soc@...cert.gov>) too , but you will have no income for that report and they will email MS in the end.


In either case, if MS don't answer you in a timely manner, FD will still be there to disclose the PoC.

Objet : [Full-disclosure] xp sp3 remote bof

Hi guys,

I'm pretty new in these parts, and to the scene in general, but I've been doing low level dev for a while. Anyway introductions aside, I have a somewhat stable remote bof poc for xp sp3 (which I'm not going to go into detail about), and I've signed up to this list to ask the security community what I should do. I figured I can't just email Microsoft from my personal email address, and I wouldn't even know who to email at Microsoft. So I'm open to the advice of those a bit more experienced.
ciao,
chown
