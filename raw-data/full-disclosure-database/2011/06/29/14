 Encryption Key - Originally posted as

As is probably obvious to other readers, I did indeed notify NNT by
email of the vulnerability before making it public - as mentioned in
my initial disclosue. I'm not sure what possible reason anyone would
have to say that if it were not true.

Glad to see you apparently did the right thing and eventually fixed it though.
