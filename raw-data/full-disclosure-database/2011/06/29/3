using the ssl observatory to pre-generate useful certs and a hardware
security module to offload the RSA/DSA handshakes coupled to an i7
with AES-NI for payload transport is even better. like the sugar
frosting on top of these crunchy flakes that are part of your
nutritional breakfast!

YMMV. something tells me *this will be a hot topic this summer, either
with your complicit or exploitive support... :o

[ where "this" == SSL MITM FTW. where "complicit" ==
ca-root-on-demand-by-policy, where "exploitive" ==
ca-root-on-my-demand-by-because-i-said-so, where explanations ==
getting tedious... ]
