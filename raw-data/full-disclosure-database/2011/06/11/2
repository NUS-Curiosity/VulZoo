Hi Nick

Yes I am on the OWASP mailing list, unfortunately the nearest branch meetings are quite a few miles away so I haven't managed to get to one yet.

I did the top 10 and hopefully with my limited experience and knowledge in this field have covered them all.

I would like someone smarter than me, which is probably most who read this list to try and hack my app.

I have done malware research too, played with reversing, captured stuff in a Honeypot, monitored flow through a Honeywall. I know a bit about a
lot of things but not a lot about any one thing in particular. I am pretty pleased with the fact that the last time I had a system infected with
malware, that I didn't infect on purpose, was my Amiga with the Saddam virus. I have always been paranoid ;-) IT isn't new to me, but IT
security is.

I need to focus but there is so much that interests me, I can't do it all but that doesn't stop me from trying.

Cheers
Dave
