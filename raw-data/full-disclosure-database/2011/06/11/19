Subject: New CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem
	Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of Ukrtelecom's
representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about multiple
vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models also
could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into 
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this 
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for 
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct CSRF 
or XSS attack.

CSRF (WASC-09):

This vulnerability allows to change type of login at connection to Internet.

In section Create a new VLAN 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridge_add_vlan.html?ImBridge.ImQbridgeVlans) 
there is a CSRF, which allows to add new VLAN.

In section VLANs 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgevlan.html?ImBridge.ImQbridgeVlans) 
there is a CSRF, which allows to delete VLAN (s).

XSS (WASC-08):

In section Create a new VLAN 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridge_add_vlan.html?ImBridge.ImQbridgeVlans) 
there are persistent XSS vulnerabilities in all text fields and some hidden 
fields

In section VLANs 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgevlan.html?ImBridge.ImQbridgeVlans) 
there are 2 persistent XSS vulnerabilities.

------------
Timeline:
------------

2011.04.14 - informed Ukrtelecom about multiple vulnerabilities in modems,
which they give (sell) to their clients.
2011.06.10 - disclosed at my site.
2011.06.11 - informed developers (Iskratel).

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5203/).
