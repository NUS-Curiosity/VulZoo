wtf?

if someone has working exploit, the probability of breaking is 100% no matter what the constant 95% is claimed to be.

about fighting for 5%: malware like nimbda and code red appear counterexamples - 
i suppose they automatically fought for 100% and got what they could get (quite above your 5%).
