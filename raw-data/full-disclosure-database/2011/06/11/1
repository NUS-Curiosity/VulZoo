Keep that attitude when you are no longer a "noob" web-app developer 
and the world will be a better place.

There are far too many "hack" web coders out there, and the evidence 
suggests that Sony employs quite a few of them...

I'm not a web-app expert at all -- I live and work in a niche 
necessitated by the appalling condition that is "web security" in 
general  (I'm a malware analyst who spends much of my time looking at 
the stuff the bad guys who break poorly configured servers, poorly 
configured and/or written web-apps, etc, etc put on those compromised 
machines to wreak havoc further down the food chain) -- but if you're a 
web-app developer and do not know about OWASP or what the OWASP "Top 
10" is, you're probably a shockingly bad web-app developer (but 
probably well able to get plenty of work at the likes of Sony).
