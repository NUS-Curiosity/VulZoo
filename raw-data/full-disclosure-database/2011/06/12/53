Subject: Re: POC for a simple gmail/possible code
 injection into html wich can be executed in an email,
 i will make the PoC code and explain how here and now...

I'm not sure how you can keep insisting that it's not a feature when it's
clearly been shown to be one. You either need to pay more attention, or get
a better dictionary.

What you're describing is possible directly through the anchor/link feature.
Even if it weren't, you could just as easily switch over to plain text and
insert the anchor tag manually. There is no exploit involved, as the ability
to use hyperlinks is an email isn't an *unintentional bug* but a very
popular *feature*.
