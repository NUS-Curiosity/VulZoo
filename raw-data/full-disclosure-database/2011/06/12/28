Subject: Re: POC for a simple gmail/possible code
 injection into html wich can be executed in an email,
 i will make the PoC code and explain how here and now...

This is NOT coded..  the PoC i am explaining, is possible with simply
copyying text,then using a sequence of keys, to make the actual sentence/s,
appear.
This code is not what shows up when it is dissected.
It shows up with many x41 all over the email when it is done properly .
Regards.
