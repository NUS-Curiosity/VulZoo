Subject: Jailbroken "Theme It" store sends username, pass,
	etc. cleartext

This would be my first write up based off an obvious security hole.  Go
easy on me.

In a nutshell, Theme It has emerged as a store for where jailbroken iPhone
users can go to purchase themes for their iPhone.  Unfortunately, the Theme
It team has not decided to implement server certificates or any sort of
mechanism to encrypt data sent from the iPhone to their servers, or through
their web interface.

I've attempted to contact them multiple times and they have not responded,
except for the first message saying that the reason for their lack of
security was because they "are not a bank".

Theme It's iPhone application sends username, password, UDID, iPhone
version, and iOS version in cleartext.  While their web interface does
attempt to obfuscate a user's login credentials, it is vulnerable to a
replay attack.
