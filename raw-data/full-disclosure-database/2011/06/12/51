Fractal fractal fractal, even us that coined the concept can't keep it going
forever.
Seems evident that each subsystem looses key aspects of its parent, this
might turn out to be a system flaw, or a constrained space.
We might have discovered this flaw already and we might have been using all
this time since nothing tells us the laws of our universe are true to its
container (if at all).
