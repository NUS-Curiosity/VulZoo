This is a business now - albeit illegal, but a well-established, organized, "professional" business.   The compromised machine (or browser) is the commodity.  The longer one can extend the life of the commodity, the more useful and profitable it is.  Probably the best source of evidence of this is the fact that there are currently millions of compromised machines that could easily be exposed via a "Code Red III" event, but they are not - they are being used for fraud instead.   You can only skin a sheep once, but you can fleece it over and over. 

I'm sure Nick can come up with precise examples if he wants to.  He knows what he's talking about in this space.
