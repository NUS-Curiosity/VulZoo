 injection into html wich can be executed in an email,
 i will make the PoC code and explain how here and now...

Somehow, I seriously doubt that.

The point is, broken English or not - this has to be the most laughable PoC
I've ever seen. He originally insists that this is a problem related to (web
based?) mail providers (which would lead anyone to believe is server
related) and then turns around and begins referencing external libraries
(that he can't even name?).

Lastly, before diving face first into his ass - you should have probably
performed a Google search. I'll give you a hint, he's not located in some
third world country.
