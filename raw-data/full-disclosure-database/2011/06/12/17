Subject: Re: POC for a simple gmail/possible code
 injection into html wich can be executed in an email,
 i will make the PoC code and explain how here and now...

Grow up? Jesus fucking christ you think people here care about some
half-assed crap you think you just dug up?

Just dug up ?? I doubt it.. more like, new to the list.

And finally, how does Thunderbird, Outlook relate to Gmail?
Regarding the dll, so it's first a dll-hunt in those 20+ dlls each of those
programs load up and now it's all about an RTF editing dll?
Then let's get back to the POC, which happens to be two crappy links, which
for some reason you'd believe wouldn't normally show up in an email....?

Gmail, was the example mailing system i used.. as ive stated the bug is a
DLL problem.
have a nice day sir!
