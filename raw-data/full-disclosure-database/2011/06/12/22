Subject: Re: POC for a simple gmail/possible code
 injection into html wich can be executed in an email,
 i will make the PoC code and explain how here and now...

Oh,
regarding that ryan1918.com post... that is doctored.

ryan1918, seems to hate me, and, that has reasons behind it..wich go back to
long ago... sofar,all he had done, is make up crap about me, many times now,
because he knows that i have papers here, wich show him as an infommant.. I
guess you must like to visit federal sites.. and, why didnt i use this Poc,
in those mailbombs..hell, that would have made it a REAL
fact then.

What happened to, people being normal on a forum... i guess that died in
1999.

If you think that post, is actually 'mailbombing' then, you must be as
stupid as ryan.Troll no.1 and, informant.

Many people can vouch for that website, if it was such a target for me,
then, why is is not nulled already ?

I guess you just dug up come crap, and must be someone from an IRC channel
on efnet :)

As jeffrey showed in that link of the troll... it is a perfect example of
it... and, even that forum backs it up 1005.
Adam, your a classified-troll. :)

think of the PoC and maybe, try to figure how it is being done.. i have
tried to explain something, wich is VERY hard to explain without actually
making a small video, of them 2 Pocs...
I apologise, next time, i will send you a .mov of 200meg in slowmo, maybe
then you can figure wth it is doing and why the rich text editor dll, is
allowing this kinda crap to be added to any email....

Laters...
