Subject: POC for a simple gmail/possible code injection
 into html wich can be executed in an email,
 i will make the PoC code and explain how here and now...

Systems wich appear vulnerable: EVERY single one i have tried...

How:

I wrote that sentecne, then, i backspaced it and blacked it over with copy ,
then, enter url to wherver i want...
There is 3 ways i have found todo this, when i dissected one of them, the
URL/Sentence, was gfull of x41\x41\x41 , very strange... because it is still
able to be done 3 ways, and the simplest way does NOT require even html
'link' to section, wich is what MST be done, altho on older emailer systems,
I see that it is simple as backspace over the sentence,then type the url, it
a'appears' at first , to be a normal deleted sentence, but when I open and
dissect, it shows URL/41/41/41 then all over the email page, same thing ...
I know this might be confusing,  I traced the problem to a dll or lib wich
is for text editing , and that dll is a VERY common one on any system, sofar
not one mailing system, has NOT had this vuln... yet, i have seen another
'version' of this attack type, but, they can ONLY spoof a URL... This one,
you can make the whole email, a url... i will do this right now..


PoC1.
Ok, this is a PoC , this actual whole sentence...<http://www.lemonparty.biz>
