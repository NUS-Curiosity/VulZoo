I investigated all transactions that paypal reversed due to the
chargebacks or unauthorized account use. Guess what?

A majority of those IP's originated from the blocked hosting provider
IP-address ranges or from open proxies that our system could not detect at
that time (for example botnet proxies are bitch to detect due to various
reasons). Im not saying our system is 100% and unbreachable but I do know
it does give you reasonable protection to address this issue.

We're verifying very carefully those hosting providers ranges before we
add any to the blacklist. I don't go in to details on how we do it but I
can assure you we have very effective way to detect who is a hosting
provider or not. Needless to say, this is very hard work.

Why we're blocking hosting providers? Lets mention two big names, godaddy
and softlayer. Have you ever heard about a web-proxy? All these thousands
of daily freely accessible web proxies by whole world are hosted of course
in hosting providers datacenters for obvious reasons. They attract a lot
of legit users and also abusers. We can also add those hundreds or
thousands of hacked dedicated servers as well to this list that are being
used for scraping, hacking attempts, brute forcing and so on.

** You've the option to choose will you block those hosting providers or
not. ** It does not block anything automatilly unless you configure it to
block something. We leave this decision to you what to block or allow.

Im happy to hear you're using similar technology. You've just said
yourself why you do want to block proxy users.

This is true indeed. But if you would have 50 fraudulent purchases in a
short period. What would you do? You sell TV's. Someone will order a $2500
nice new TV from your online shop. OK, you go and check this client IP,
it's a proxy or Tor exit node. Will you deliver this TV instantly to this
customer? I don't think so. If you accept PayPal. Paypal will charge you a
4% reversal fee from that 2.5k which is $100 bucks is the payment happened
to be fraudulent. So you've just lost 2,6k.

At this point you start thinking will you stop using PayPal and if you do
so, prepare to lose even more renevue because they are the most popular
payment gateway. OK, you've stopped using PayPal and another gateway.
You'll still have the same issue and risk. Of course those gateways have
some sort of security, but there are hundreds of daily proxies from public
lists that can bybass any payment gateway ...

How many times I have to say this?

Im happy to hear it works out to you. A few days ago, i received an email
from https://www.proxpn.com/ admin that he suspended fraudulent user VPN
account due to the abuse. A fraudster used a stolen credit card using
their VPN to purchase a service from us. Needless to say, their CIDR's has
been also added to this list.
