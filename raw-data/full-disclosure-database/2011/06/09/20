Step 1: User wants to visit a website to buy something while at work.

Step 2: Company where that user works blocks access to the website
because it's against company policy using a webfilter

Step 3: User uses a tor or other proxy to avoid corporate webfilter to
visit that website

Step 4: User gets blocked by your service when they go to buy because
they're using a proxy

Step 5: Frustrated user buys same/similar product from another seller
who is not using your service and original website looses a sale.

Clear now?
