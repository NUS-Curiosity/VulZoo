It does provide great protection also to those webmasters who got a clue.

We had fraudulent purchase almost every second day, paypal let every
fraudulent purchase through and the ** next day ** their automation
reversed the payment. ..

Needless to say how much we got frustrated and pissed while filing their
forms regarding unauthorized claims. We were also charged by paypal for a
certain percentage of each fraudulent payment!

This is where NiX API comes in:

In most cases, the malicious user is denied access even before a
fraudulent purchase is made!

Since implementation of NiX API with it's current featuers: 0 fraudulent
purchases in last 2-3 weeks period. It definitely does something.
