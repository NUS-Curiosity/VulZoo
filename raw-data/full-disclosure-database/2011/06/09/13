I don't see how it is possible to tell a fraudulent paypal payment from a legitimate one, unless the IP address used to make the purchase is all
ready known as a source of fraudulent transactions.

Obviously if "John Smith" made a payment from an IP address originating from China, Japan or other non-English/American IP address range then
something is suspect, but this is still not definitive.

How could this system stop a fraudulent payment from a source with an IP address the system has never seen before originating from a corporate
address block or respected ISP, or unlikely but not impossible an IP address that has previously made a valid transaction?

Any smart fraudster would use a device purchased with cash using a spoofed MAC address from a wifi hotspot out of sight of CCTV.

Please enlighten me, or would that let the cat out of the bag?
