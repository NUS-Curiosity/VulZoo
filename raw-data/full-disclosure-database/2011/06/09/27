I started this thread because the API service is free of charge if you
take it in use and put a backlink on your site. This is a security related
mailing list as well, the API improves your web site's overal security as
well.

Im quite confident also that our recent discussion of online fraud has
revealed many interesting facts how paypal earns every day tens of
thousands of dollars by charging innocent merchants for reversal fees
although they were victims of online fraud.
