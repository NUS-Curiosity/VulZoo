OK, I'll bite - how many *lost sales* did you have because NIX false-positived
and rejected a non-malicious user before a valid purchase was made?  Making
something that rejects *every* malicious attack is *easy* - just reject every
request.  Of course, that's not very practical for production use, so you end
up having to trade off false positives and negatives to minimize the total
cost...
