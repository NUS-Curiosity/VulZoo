You don't see it because you have no experience. Let me enlight you a bit.

You're a legit user --> Why in earth you would like to use a proxy or or
anonymizer to do the purchase?

Why I would do so and purchase unless I have something to hide? You have
the option block or allow hosting provider ranges, of course.

You are a fraudulent user --> Of course you want to use any IP that is not
yours and not a surprise; A majority of fraudulent purchases originates
from proxies, anonyminity networks, VPN's (commonly hosted by hosting
providers due to fast speeds) and so on.

After careful verification, we have accurately 'blacklisted' this data
beforehand and this way our API will block the user real-time, not after
the damage has happened unlike the others.

This is one method how a majority of payment gateway protections add a
'fraud score' to the final decision whether or not to prevent the
transaction.

According to experience from my own sites, it has been 85% of times
definitive.
