Subject: Re: IL and XSS vulnerabilities in multiple themes
	for WordPress

Background: As long as developers are taught about the limitations and checks, more like checks and balances, they should be able to ensure that this type of vuln is not pushed out in the final code.

In this case: the very name test.php is indicative of the scenario where the developers leave open backdoors for their testing purposes and forget to remove them during a push for production. This is common in every industry.
