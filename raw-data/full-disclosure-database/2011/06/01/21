This was too good to pass up.  This is a link to sign up for the RSA Webcast for "The State of SSL on the Internet."  It generates a "cert is not trusted" error.  LOLOL.

Live Webcast: 
The State of SSL on the Internet with Ivan Ristić 
Wednesday, June 22, 2011 – at 11 A.M. PDT / 2 P.M. EDT / 7 P.M. BST 


The SSL (TLS) protocol is the security backbone of the Internet, but surprisingly little is known about how it is deployed in real life. In this session, Ivan Ristić, Director of Engineering, Qualys, Inc., will present the results of the first publicly available survey aimed at assessing the state of SSL on the Internet. He will also provide documentation and free tools for testing and improving the configuration of SSL servers. Ristić is a respected security expert, author and a founder of SSL Labs, a research effort focused on the analysis of the real-life usage of SSL and related technologies.
