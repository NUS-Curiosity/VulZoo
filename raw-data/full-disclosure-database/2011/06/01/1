Subject: cherokee server admin vulnerable to csrf

Vendor response: "This isn't an issue."

Problem: the cherokee server admin configuration web interface is
vulnerable to csrf.

Impact: if an admin is logged into the cherokee admin interface and
visits a site which runs "bad tm scripts" cherokee can be reconfigured
to run as $user and set log handlers(hooks) to execute arbitrary
commands (on error and on access).
