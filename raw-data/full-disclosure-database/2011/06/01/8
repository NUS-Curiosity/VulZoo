Hi Fernando,

to quote from your drafts:

this surprised me for two things.

First: Cisco was not aware. So you tell you discovered this issue as
well and you informed vendors, but the only vendor who really has RA
support so far is Cisco, and they did not know. I informed them.
So I recommend that you don't keep your findings to your group but
actively inform the vendors about that, and that not via an Internet draft.

Second: it is always a race who is credited as the finder of an issue.
As anybody can claim he had the vulnerability in his drawers for years,
only the person who publishes it gets the credit, so sorry :-)
I had my attack tool since beginning of January :-) - which is pretty
sure before your group discovered that, and I published first :-)

that being said I have started to inform vendors of two new IPv6
vulnerability types now, and nobody has told them about these before either.

But nontheless - good work, good draft proposals, thats the way to go
with the issue.

Greets,
Marc
