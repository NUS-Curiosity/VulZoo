Subject: New DoS,
	CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Denial of Service, Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of
Ukrtelecom's representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about
multiple vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models
also could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct DoS,
CSRF or XSS attack.

DoS (WASC-10):

At sending of GET or POST requests in sections Ethernet Port Configuration
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?95) and Advanced Ethernet Port
Configuration (http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?95)
long-run DoS of modem occurs. The only thing which can be done in this
case - it's to restart modem manually (by turning him off and on).

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html/edit?EmWeb_ns:vim:6=95&EmWeb_ns:vim:2.ImPorts.ethernet:MAC=00:01:38:83:6f:24

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html/edit?EmWeb_ns:vim:6=95&EmWeb_ns:vim:2.ImPorts.ethernet:MAC=00:01:38:83:6f:24

These attacks will work at default configuration of modem (when it's in
bridge mode) and will not work when configuration is changed (when it's in
router mode).

CSRF (WASC-09):

These sections are hidden (they are not shown in admin panel), but it's
possible to get to them by setting corresponding number in URL.

In section IGMPProxy Port Configuration
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?8) via CSRF it's possible to
change parameters Upstream If and Forward All.

In section Advanced IGMPProxy Port Configuration
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?8) via CSRF it's
possible to change parameters Upstream If and Forward All.

XSS (WASC-08):

These sections are hidden (they are not shown in admin panel), but it's
possible to get to them by setting corresponding number in URL.

In section IGMPProxy Port Configuration
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?8) there are persistent XSS
vulnerabilities in all text fields and some hidden fields.

In section Advanced IGMPProxy Port Configuration
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?8) there are
persistent XSS vulnerabilities in all text fields and some hidden fields.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5228/).
