Package        : libxml2
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 628537

Chris Evans discovered that libxml was vulnerable to buffer overflows,
which allowed a crafted XML input file to potentially execute arbitrary
code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32.dfsg-5+lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.
