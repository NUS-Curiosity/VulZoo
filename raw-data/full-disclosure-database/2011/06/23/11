Subject: Re: [New Security Tool] INSECT Pro 2.6.1 release

I think he should keep advertising here and drag his customers here as
well so they can see how well respect he and his tool are by the
security industry geeks that rant him here.

It's also fun to read about his customers on his own site, they are just
making fools of themselves for admitting to having bought his crap. I
wouldn't even consider spending a dime on it just to try it. Makes me
wonder if his customers have granted that he uses their names as
references. I very much doubt that he even cares judging from how little
he respect this lists opinion about him spamming here.

Sadly he isn't a high profile target, otherwise lulsec could take him
down...
