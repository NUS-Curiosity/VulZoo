*Other:*

   - Using outdated version of SSL
   - Outdated SSL Certificate (2009)
   - Outdated version of mod_frontpage (which may be vulnerable to a root
   access exploit)
   - At *least* a dozen broken links
   - MySQL is exposed to the internet

Blah blah blah. Some of these may or may not be serious but the fact is: it
took less than 60 seconds to find all of it. Imagine what someone who is *
really* bored could find. I think I'll pass on your oh so special *hacker*
 tool.
