	CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto 821+

Dear Valdis!

Thank you for worrying about my MUA, but everything is fine with it. 
Everything is fine from 1998 with every version of OE which I've used.

These postings about vulnerabilities in Callisto 821+ are different letters 
about different vulnerabilities (and are not duplicates). So you've 
mistakenly took them as duplicates (maybe due to similar titles and similar 
intros which these letters had), but they were not. As you can see from the 
list of my postings about holes in Callisto 821+ 
(http://securityvulns.ru/news/ZTE/Callisto/821.html), I'm periodically 
changing titles (slightly) to let people see, that these letters are about 
different holes ;-).

> It's also duplicated your posting regarding WordPress at least 3 times.

What concrete posting regarding WP you are talking about? Maybe it's the 
same situation as with Callisto router and actually there are no duplicates, 
but separate letters.

Best wishes & regards,

Dear MustLive:

Please check the configuration of your MUA - your copy of Outlook Express
appears to have posted this same e-mail 11 times so far this month.  Looks
suspiciously like the problem described in RFC1047.  It's also duplicated 
your
posting regarding WordPress at least 3 times.
