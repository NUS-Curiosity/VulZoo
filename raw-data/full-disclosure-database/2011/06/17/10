Subject: Computer Security For Noobs

Hey List

I started up a website a little while ago. Basically, it's supposed to
be analysis of computer security news and vulnerabilities, for people
who aren't completely familiar with computer security already. Its
likely to be a bit beneath the people on this list but I'd like it if
you could check it out, and give feedback anyway. Like if my
definition of SQL Injection is way off, or something like that. Or
anything really, even if its just kudos. Seriously, kudos would be
nice :p

Address is http://blog.goodvikings.com. If you don't want to post
feedback to the list, send it to ramo@...dvikings.com.

Any comments would be appreciated. Also, please try not to attack it :p

Cheers

Ramo
