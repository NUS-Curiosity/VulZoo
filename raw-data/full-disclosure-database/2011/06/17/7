Subject: DoS,
	CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Denial of Service, Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site 
Scripting vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of 
Ukrtelecom's representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about 
multiple vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models 
also could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into 
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this 
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for 
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct DoS, 
CSRF or XSS attack.

DoS (WASC-10):

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgestatsclearintfstats.html

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgestatsflushintf.html

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgevlanstatsclear.html

At these requests the restart of modem occurs, at which both admin panel and 
modem itself aren't accessible (so connection to Internet is absent).

CSRF (WASC-09):

This vulnerability allows to conduct clearing of statistics of selected VLAN 
port.

http://192.168.1.1/configuration/qbridgevlanstatsclear.html?ImBridge.ImQbridgeVlans.DefaultVlan.ImQbridgeVlanUntaggedPorts.ethernet

XSS (WASC-08):

On above-mentioned page there is a persistent XSS vulnerability.

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2011/Callisto%20821+%20XSS20.html

In this case the code will be executed immediately, and also at visiting of 
pages http://192.168.1.1/system/events.html and 
http://192.168.1.1/shared/event_log_selection.html.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5216/).
