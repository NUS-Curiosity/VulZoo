Subject: New Technique to Exploit Blind SQL Injections in
	MySQL

Hi list,
the last 2 weeks I've been researching a technique to both increase the
speed and reduce the number of requests needed to exploit a blind SQL
injection.
I expect it to be at least 10 times faster than the old benchmark method.

I hope you will find this useful and/or interesting.
