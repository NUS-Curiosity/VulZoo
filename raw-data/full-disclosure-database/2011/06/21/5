Subject: Exclusive Interview with Creators of Tcpdump,
	Wireshark, Winpcap

Hi all,

Here is an exclusive interview with trios – Steven McCanne, Gerald
Combs, Loris Degioanni – who brought in the “Packet Capture
Innovation” with their revolutionary creations (libpcap/tcpdump,
wireshark, winpcap).

One cannot imagine nightmare of network administrator without
Wireshark and all those great network applications would not have seen
light of the day if there was not libpcap/winpcap. In short these 3
folks simply revolutionized the field of packet capture in turn
bringing new light to computer networking field itself.

It gives us immense pleasure to bring forth the ‘exclusive interview’
with these packet capture innovators featuring the real story behind
their creations – it is an interesting insight coming straight from
the heart of heroes.
