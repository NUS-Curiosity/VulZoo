Subject: New CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem
	Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities. Which I've found in your modem. In April I've already drew
attention of Ukrtelecom's representative (and this modem was bough at
Ukrtelecom) about multiple vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems
(and other models also could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities (http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct CSRF or XSS attack.

CSRF (WASC-09):

This vulnerability allows to add DNS server in modem's settings. Which allows to conduct spoofing, phishing and DNS Rebinding attacks on users, which go to Internet via this modem.

XSS (WASC-08):

In this form there are also 3 persistent XSS vulnerabilities.

which they give (sell) to their clients.
