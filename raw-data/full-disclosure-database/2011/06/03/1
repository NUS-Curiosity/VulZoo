If you want to use a community college for some of your undergrad
work, check out Anne Arundel Community College (http://www.aacc.edu/).
Its a nice, laid back county in between south of Baltimore.

In the past, they were one of the top community colleges in the nation
(I'm not sure where they rank now). They also have a security track
and relationship with the NSA. As a community college, they charge $90
a credit hour. Speaking from experience, it sure beats $300 per credit
hour for an undergrad program (Maryland) and $1800 per class for a
graduate program (Hopkins).
