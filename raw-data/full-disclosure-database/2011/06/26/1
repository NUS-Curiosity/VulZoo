Subject: LulzCheck--a tool for checking account security

So, apparently LulzSec is  over and done with. Even so, they’ve left a lot
behind, in the form of more than 100,000 compromised passwords. Cearly, this
is still potentially a problem, especially considering password reuse.

LulzCheck is a Greasemonkey script for Firefox. Basically, whenever you log
into a website, it checks the username that you supply against an updated
list of accounts that have been “leaked” by LulzSec, and gives you a warning
if it finds your login in that list.

Keep in mind, if you get a warning message, it *may not actually apply to
the site that your are logging into. *Because people reuse logins, and the
ultimate origin of some of the leaked usernames/passwords is unknown, it’s
not really possible for LulzCheck to automatically pin down exactly what
accounts you need to change.

*LulzCheck can be downloaded at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/105484*
