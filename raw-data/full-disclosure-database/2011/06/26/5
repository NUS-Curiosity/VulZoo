Subject: New CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in ADSL modem
	Callisto 821+

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in ADSL modem Callisto
821+ (SI2000 Callisto821+ Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting 
vulnerabilities. In April I've already drew attention of Ukrtelecom's 
representative (and this modem was bough at Ukrtelecom) about multiple 
vulnerabilities in this model of Callisto modems (and other models also 
could be affected).

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: SI2000 Callisto821+ Router: X7821 Annex A
v1.0.0.0 / Argon 4x1 CSP v1.0 (ISOS 9.0) [4.3.4-5.1]. This model with other
firmware and also other models of Callisto also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

These attacks should be conducted on modem owner, which is logged into 
control panel. Taking into account that it's unlikely to catch him in this 
state, then it's possible to use before-mentioned vulnerabilities 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5161/) for conducting of remote login (for 
logining him into control panel). After that it's possible to conduct CSRF 
or XSS attack.

CSRF (WASC-09):

Besides earlier-mentioned pages 8, 10, 12, 95 and 96 for configuration of 
ports, there are many other sections in range 1..196 (where there is a form 
with parameters, which is vulnerable to CSRF). These sections are hidden 
(they are not shown in admin panel), but it's possible to get to them by 
setting corresponding number in URL.

Particularly in section Ip App Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?194), last working section, via 
CSRF it's possible to change parameters of Ip App port.

In section Advanced Ip App Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?194) via CSRF it's 
possible to change parameters of Ip App port.

XSS (WASC-08):

Besides earlier-mentioned pages 8, 10, 12, 95 and 96 for configuration of 
ports, there are many other sections in range 1..196 (where there is a form 
with parameters, in which there are persistent XSS vulnerabilities). These 
sections are hidden (they are not shown in admin panel), but it's possible 
to get to them by setting corresponding number in URL.

Particularly in section Ip App Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports.html?194), last working section, 
there are persistent XSS vulnerabilities in all text fields and some hidden 
fields.

In section Advanced Ip App Port Configuration 
(http://192.168.1.1/configuration/ports_advanced.html?194) there are 
persistent XSS vulnerabilities in all text fields and some hidden fields.

------------
Timeline:
------------

2011.04.14 - informed Ukrtelecom about multiple vulnerabilities in modems,
which they give (sell) to their clients.
2011.06.23 - disclosed at my site.
2011.06.24 - informed developers (Iskratel).

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5237/).
