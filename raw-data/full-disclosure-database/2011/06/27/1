Subject: how to detect DDoS attack through HTTP response
	analysis(throuput)

Hello list,

 

I'm looking for meterials or information, research about that how to detect
DDoS attack through HTTP response analysis(throuput).

 

for example, 

if there are many "408 request timeout" responses, we can think this is
slowloris or RUDY DDoS attack.
