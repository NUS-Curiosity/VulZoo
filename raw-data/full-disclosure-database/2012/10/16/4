Well,

you're right because the process sounds antiquated, but for them it's the most trustworthy way and they seem to fulfill their security policy. 

Every step like official announcements, bank statements or password changes that can not be displayed within the banking-portal, must use another (trustworthy) media. This can be snail mail, Post-Ident or in your turn you have to appear at their office.

Cheers,

Christian
