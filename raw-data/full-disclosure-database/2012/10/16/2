 Is it OK to hold credit card numbers in cookies? Santander?

Well, if we talk about Banks...

Hypo Vereinsbank (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HypoVereinsbank) has
kind of a strange security style: The online banking website will
disable your login once you enter it 3 times wrong. Your login is your
BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER. To re-enable it you have to go into one of their
offices IN PERSON and identify yourself by ID card and then they will
send your new password BY LETTER (not email).

Now, PLEASE, when you go to their online banking site and run your
one_script_to_block_them_all.py or whatever, PLEASE, skip my bank
account, ok?

Banking regards,

Alex

Fed up of two years of battling with them to fix issues any other bank would have fixed in seconds, things like XSS on login pages etc. Time to hit full disclosure with some of these issues in the hope they'll change their game and start to take their customers security seriously:
