Package        : cups-pk-helper
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4510

cups-pk-helper, a PolicyKit helper to configure cups with fine-grained
privileges, wraps CUPS function calls in an insecure way. This could
lead to uploading sensitive data to a cups resource, or overwriting
specific files with the content of a cups resource. The user would have
to explicitly approve the action.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.0-3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups-pk-helper packages.
