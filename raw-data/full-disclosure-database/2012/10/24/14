Subject: Re: stealing ssh keys

I think you're over reacting just a bit.  You can give out your private key to whomever/whatever you want to be able to decrypt data encrypted with the public key.  It all depends on the use-case, and what you want done.  Just because its a private key doesn't mean it's automatically some critical security component.   Many times it is, but it doesn't have to be.

I do not see how SSL access in and of itself, helps get at SSH keys, If it does, let me know, I bank at Chase and that would be darn handy to know (believe me, they have it coming)!
