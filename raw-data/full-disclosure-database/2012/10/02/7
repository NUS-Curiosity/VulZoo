Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the OPlayer application v2.0.05 for Apples iPhone, iPod Touch & iPad.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-10-01:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
OlimSoft
Product: OPlayer - iPhone,iPod Touch & iPad v2.0.05


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent web vulnerabilities are detected in the OPlayer application v2.0.05 for Apples iPhones, iPod Touche & iPads.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to inject own malicious persistent script code to compromise the affected mobile application.

The first web vulnerability is located in the OPlayer WIFI Transfer application module in the create/rename folder function with the bound 
vulnerable folder name parameter. Attackers can inject own malicious script code or malware as foldername. The script code will be executed 
out of the main application name listing web context.

The secound vulnerability is located in the OPlayer WIFI Transfer application module when processing to delete a script code tag as foldername.
The mobile device application itself ask when processing to delete a malicious injected script code as foldername. The application did not 
parse the request when processing to display the ask to confirm delete messagebox. Attackers can use the not parsed +filename function to execute 
malicious persistent script code out of the ask to confirm messagebox when processing to delete a folder.

The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account & with low  user inter action. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities result in application compromise via persistent injects, information disclosure (local files), 
persistent malware loads or persistent web context request manipulation. The wifi application needs to be activated because of the remote 
available http interface to upload music for oplayer. The service itself allows to inject remotly without using any permission change or password.
When the mobile iOS device has been opened via jailbreak the attack can also result in a mobile device take over with full control by the remote attacker.


Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] OPlayer - iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch

Vulnerable Service(s):
				[+] HTTP - OPlayer WIFI Transfer

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Create Folder
				[+] Delete Folder

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Foldername - Name (i)
				[+] FileName - +Filename (dls)

Affected Section(s):
				[+] Index Application Listing - Name
				[+] Ask to Confirm  - Delete Message


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker and low or medium required user inter action without privileged application 
user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Solution:
=========
The vulnerability can be patched by parsing the app and interface foldername input mask and output listing.
The secound vulnerability can be patched by parsing the displayed web context in the ask to confirm question.
The input fields should be restricted with the following useful input characters [a-z][A-Z][0-9].


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
