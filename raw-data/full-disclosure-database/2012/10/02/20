At the time I thought this was the "correct" way to report things. I've
since stopped spamming them with every little hole I find.

I couldn't find a n00b's guide to reporting, so I'm making it up as I go
along. If there is a guide online somewhere I'd 1) love to read it and 2)
think it should be better publicised.
