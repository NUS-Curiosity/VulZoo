Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2870 CVE-2012-2871 CVE-2012-2893

Nicholas Gregoire and Cris Neckar discovered several memory handling
bugs in libxslt, which could lead to denial of service or the execution
of arbitrary code if a malformed document is processed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.26-6+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.26-14.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.
