Nope - no such messages received at this Gmail address - I also looked
in the Spam folder back as far as 25th.Sept .. none there either.

Nor have I received any emails with suspicious attachments at this
address .... though I'm bombarded by them at various other non-Google
addresses.  Googlemail seems to have pretty good filtering of
mainstream malware and spam, so I find your story a little puzzling.

NB: the Googlemail support page the link points to says you should
have been directed there by a message "above your inbox", *not* in the
body of an actual email.

As the support page says, they also use other indicators to decide you
may be being targeted, such as "suspicious login attempts".

Maybe your cyber-friend-group is resident in a particularly targeted
geographical region and Google knows it .... or maybe Google *has*
successfully detected _some_ malware on its way to you, and noticed
that the malware is sufficiently mutable in character (polymorphic)
that other variants may have made it through undetected.
