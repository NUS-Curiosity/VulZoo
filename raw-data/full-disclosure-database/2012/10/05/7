Subject: Your account could be at risk of state-sponsored
	attacks

In the last two weeks some of my cyber friends have been getting this
message in their gmail.

http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&ctx=mail&answer=2591015

If you follow the link it says this:

"It's likely that you received emails containing malicious
attachments, links to malicious software downloads, or links to fake
websites that are designed to steal your passwords or other personal
information. For example, attackers have often been known to send PDF
files, Office documents, or RAR files with malicious contents. We
strongly recommend that you avoid clicking links or attachments in
suspicious messages."


I was wondering if this was security related. Google also doesn't say
which Nation State.

Has anyone else gotten this message from Google in the last 3 days?
