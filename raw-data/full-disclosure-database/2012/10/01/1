Subject: BF, XSS,
	CSRF and Redirector vulnerabilities in IBM Lotus Notes Traveler

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Brute Force, Cross-Site Scripting, Cross-Site 
Request Forgery and Redirector vulnerabilities in IBM Lotus Notes Traveler. 
IBM are planning to release their advisory soon concerning these 
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are IBM Lotus Notes Traveler 8.5.3 and previous versions.

IBM fixed the part of these vulnerabilities. XSS in ILNT.mobileconfig were 
fixed in version Traveler 8.5.3.2 already at 29.02.2012, and XSS and 
Redirector in traveler were fixed in version Traveler 8.5.3.3 Interim Fix 1 
(released at 15.09.2012) and Traveler 8.5.3 Upgrade Pack 1 Interim Fix 1 
(released 14.09.2012).

They are not planning to fix Brute Force (because they have said nothing 
about it), and they are still thinking about CSRF. And IBM are still working 
on other vulnerabilities, about which I've informed them.

----------
Details:
----------

Attacks on XSS, CSRF and  Redirector vulnerabilities will only work against 
users authorized at the site.
