CA20121001-01: Security Notice for CA License

Issued: October 01, 2012


CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to two potential risks in CA 
License (also known as CA Licensing).  Vulnerabilities exist that can 
allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands or gain elevated 
access.  CA Technologies has issued patches to address the vulnerabilities.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2012-0691, occurs due to insecure use of 
system commands.  An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to 
execute commands with system or administrator privileges.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2012-0692, occurs due to inadequate user 
validation.  An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to create 
or modify arbitrary files and gain elevated access.

Non-Affected Components

How to determine if the installation is affected

All versions of CA License before 1.90.03 are vulnerable.

The installed version of CA License can be obtained by using the 
“lic98version” program.  Lic98version retrieves the version of CA
License 
installed on a machine along with the version of specific individual files.
The version information is written to the lic98version.log file located in 
the CA License installation location, and is also displayed on the console.


Solution

CA has issued patches to address the vulnerability.


For all CA product installations on Linux, please note these Linux-specific
instructions:

1.	First, make backups of the ca.olf file and the lic98.dat file.
2.	Uninstall the existing/old version of CA License.
3.	Perform the installation of CA License 1.90.04.
4.	Confirm the successful installation of 1.9.04, and then replace the 
        existing ca.olf file and lic98.dat file with the files you backed 
        up in step 1.
