View online: http://drupal.org/node/1802258

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-151
  * Project: Commerce extra panes [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-October-3
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module, an add-on for Drupal Commerce, allows site builders to place one
or more nodes in one of the checkout phases of an order.

The module doesn't sufficiently confirm the intent of a site builder when
taking certain administrative operations. This could allow an attacker to
trick an administrator into unknowingly enabling/disabled a Commerce extra
panes pane.

CVE: Requested

  * Commerce extra panes 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Commerce extra
panes [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Commerce extra panes module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to
    Commerce extra panes 7.x-1.1 [4]
