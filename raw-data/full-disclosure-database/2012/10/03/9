Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-149 - Hostip -
	Cross Site Scripting	(XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1802218

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-149
  * Project: Hostip [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-October-03
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Hostip enables you to query the http://www.hostip.info/ [3] API to get the
country / state information based on the user's IP address or a specific IP
passed to it. The module fails to sanitize data retrieved from an untrusted
third party source, thereby exposing an arbitrary script injection
vulnerability (XSS).

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have either
gained access to that third party source or use techniques such as DNS
spoofing in order to inject malicious data.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Hostip 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.2.
  * Hostip 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Hostip [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.
