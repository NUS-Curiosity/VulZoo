Subject: ANNOUNCE: RFIDIOt v1.0d released and code
	migration

I've migrated the RFIDIOt source code to 
https://github.com/AdamLaurie/RFIDIOt. I realised one of the reasons I 
haven't been doing many updates is because it's always such a faff 
getting a new tarball together, updating the webpage etc., etc. Now, 
should you be vaguely interested, you can simply watch the project on 
github and get notified whenever a change is committed... Even better, 
if you have updates you want to contribute, just fork and create a merge 
request... (The first of which was Nick von Dadelszen's Android support 
package). Sweet!

I will follow my usual practice of 'commit early, commit often', so 
whenever I'm working on something, expect daily updates... Speaking of 
which, I finally got around to bringing libNFC support up to date, so it 
now works with libnfc 1.6.0-rc1.

 From CHANGES:

v1.0c
fix reading unknown block size in readblock()
detect more ACS readers [Keith Howell]

v1.0d
port pynfc to new libNFC API (1.6.0-rc1)
add libnfc mifare command support (TODO: error handling)
*** note that early ACS devices such as ACR122-V1/TikiTag/TouchaTag are 
not currently
     working with native libNFC (V2 seem to work fine). This is a libNFC 
issue.
     However, ACR122-V1/TikiTag/TouchaTag devices can be used if libNFC 
is compiled with
     acr122_pcsc driver support, and then used in conjunction with 
pcscd, in chich case
     they should work as READER_LIBNFC and/or READER_PCSC types.
Android support [Nick von Dadelszen]
