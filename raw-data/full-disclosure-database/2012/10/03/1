 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2012:157
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openjpeg
 Date    : October 3, 2012
 Affected: 2011.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A security issue was identified and fixed in openjpeg:
 
 A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way OpenJPEG, an
 open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language, performed parsing
 of JPEG2000 image files. A remote attacker could provide a specially
 crafted JPEG 2000 file, which when opened in an application linked
 against openjpeg would lead to that application crash, or, potentially
 arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the
 application (CVE-2012-3535).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
