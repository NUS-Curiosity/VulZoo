Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-150 - Twitter
	Pull - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1802230

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-150
  * Project: Twitter Pull [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-October-03
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Twitter Pull allows you to retrieve tweets from Twitter based on a user or
search and display them on your site. It also includes integration with the
boxes module to allow for simple placement of twitter feeds on various pages.

The module doesn't sufficiently filter the data coming from Twitter which
could result in script injection and XSS attacks.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that Twitter is a generally
trusted source and is unlikely to serve malicious content.
