OK, I am a total n00b here but I do not see how having an ssl connection would help reveal an SSH key.  Our organization generates our root certs separate from, and unrelated to SSH keys.. I do not see how SSL access in and of itself, helps get at SSH keys, If it does, let me know, I bank at Chase and that would be darn handy to know (believe me, they have it coming)!
