Subject: favicon

tested this in Google Chrome 23.0.1.1271.6 dev build for linux (debian):
truncate -s 1T favicon.ico
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

google-chrome localhost:8000/

browser tab crashes when trying to load favicon.ico
DoS but not significant because chrome is probably doing what it is
suppose to but maybe possible to cause other problems if i had time to
debug the tab as it crashes.
