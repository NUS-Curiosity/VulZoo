No, if you find one of these in your network, it means you have *bigger*
problems that you *do* need to spend time on.  The exploit is against the
C&C (Command and Control) server, *not* the bot end.

In other words - if you find this one on your net, it means somebody has
been *controlling* a botnet from a host on your net.  Just a tad more serious
than just finding a botted host.
