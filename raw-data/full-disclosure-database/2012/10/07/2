Subject: rubilyn-0.0.1.tar.gz - Mac OS X rootkit

Hi FD,

we are bored and wanted to share something with you:


name
====
rubilyn

description
===========
64bit Mac OS-X kernel rootkit that uses no hardcoded address to hook the
BSD subsystem in all OS-X Lion & below. It uses a combination of syscall
hooking and DKOM to hide activity on a host. String resolution of
symbols no longer works on Mountain Lion as symtab is destroyed during
load, this code is portable on all Lion & below but requires re-working
for hooking under Mountain Lion.

currently supports:

* works across multiple kernel versions (tested 11.0.0+)
* give root privileges to pid
* hide files / folders
* hide a process
* hide a user from 'who'/'w'
* hide a network port from netstat
* sysctl interface for userland control
* execute a binary with root privileges via magic ICMP ping
