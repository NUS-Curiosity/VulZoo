Secure is an immigrant property of the system
(http://www.mail-archive.com/sc-l@securecoding.org/msg03639.html). How
can the program be secure if its not even stable?

Worst, its CompSci 101 mistakes - lack of parameter validation and
failure to check return values - and not some clever attack. To add
insult to injury, compiler warning, static analysis and dynamic
analysis will often report the issues but they are not used or
ignored.
