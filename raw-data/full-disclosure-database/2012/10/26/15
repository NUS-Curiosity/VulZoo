Subject: Re: stealing ssh keys

Actually, the DSA key is used to sign the message in many applications, though I've often wondered exactly what reduction in security exists if the paired private key is used to sign material instead. Do you have any info on that?  I've asked industry leaders in crypto, and while they report it should be avoided, I've never received any quantified answer.

And just to make sure people understand (like the guy you replied to), the *message* is not encrypted with the pubic key - the *key the message is encrypted with* is encrypted with the public key.   While you CAN asymmetrically encrypt some data (116 bytes with a 1024 RSA key), it is the symmetric key (e.g. AES) which gets encrypted/decrypted with PKI keys and th AES key used to encrypt and decrypt the message itself. 

I'm sure you knew ht, but others obviously don't. :). 

Sent from whatever device will keep us from debating which one is better.

This also ensures that the message has not been tampered with (on the question of authenticity, see also message digest).
