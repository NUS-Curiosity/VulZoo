Subject: Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in CorePlayer

Hello list!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in CorePlayer.

This is the same flash video player, which was used at online voting
translations - today, 28.10.2012, on parliamentary elections in Ukraine and
earlier this year on presidential elections in Russia.

Concerning elections in Ukraine. At spending 993.6 million gryvnas (approx.
$124.2 million) for webcam setup (including development of web site for
online translations), they haven't found money for security.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are CorePlayer 4.0.6 and previous versions. At web site
webvybory2012.ru version 1.3.2 is used and at web site vybory2012.gov.ua
version 4.0.6 is used.

XSS (WASC-08):

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site
