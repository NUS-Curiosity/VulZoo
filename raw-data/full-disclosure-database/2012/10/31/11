Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-159 - Password
	policy - Information	leakage of hashed passwords

View online: https://drupal.org/node/1828340

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-159
  * Project: Password policy [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-October-31
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module provides a way to specify a certain level of password complexity
(aka. "password hardening") for user passwords on a system by defining a
password policy.

The Password policy module allows administrators to request users to enter a
new password that does not match any of the previous X passwords they have
used (X is determined by the site configuration). If this feature is enabled,
a malicious user with the capability to view another user's HTTP traffic can
discover the hashed version of their password. This issue is more of a risk
for Drupal 6 sites that use the default md5 password encryption.

This issue only affects sites that use the module's "previous passwords"
feature, and fail to encrypt their users' HTTP transactions with SSL/TLS.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Password policy 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.5.
  * Password policy 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Password
policy [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Password policy module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Password
    policy 6.x-1.5 [4]
  * If you use the Password policy module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Password
    policy 7.x-1.3 [5]

Also see the Password policy [6] project page.
