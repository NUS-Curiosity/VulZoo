Subject: Re: XSS and IAA vulnerabilities in Wordfence
 Security for WordPress

This has been fixed and the release just went out. Version 3.3.7.

The email param is now escaped and we've added rate limiting to the form
with a 3 minute backoff if the limit is exceeded.

Thanks for your report.

Regards,

Mark Maunder.
