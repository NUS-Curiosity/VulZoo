As pequest, re-se w/o references:

Full Disclosure Maillist Admin, please kindly delete the posted email
of "vOlk Botnet Framework v4.0 - Multiple Web Vulnerabilities" posted
in Full Disclosure, for the security purpose.

Understanding the positive purpose of the researchers who expose it ;
Still, this vulns concept cannot be exposed in public, where the merit
of its exposure is not equal to the DAMAGE caused by exposing such
information. The disclosure damage itself is affecting other botnets
takedown process which adding the challange & effort taken, so
takedowns will be harder than before.

VOlk-Botnet 4.0. is a malicious application whose origins have been
traced back to Mexico. The system was designed w/common concept of a
malicious botnets infrastructure.
