Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Due to a programming error, the uStoreLocator module for Magento eCommerce 
platform allows the injection of direct SQL commands, which are executed on 
the backend database server through the web application.



Proof of concept:
-----------------
The SQL injection vulnerability exists in the location search action. The "?"
character (urlencoded representation: %3f) when included in the lat or lng
parameters is converted to the "'contents of the radius parameter'" string
that is added to the SQL query. This breaks the legitimate web
application's SQL query and allows the user to modify the original query.



Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
Version 0.2.5 has been tested, furthermore the vendor confirmed that 2.0.0 is
affected too.
