Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-156 - Search API
	- Cross Site	Request Forgery (CSRF)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1815770

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-156
  * Project: Search API [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-October-17
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to build searches using a wide range of features,
data sources and backends.

The module doesn't sufficiently guard the “enable index” action against
Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks which could allow an attacker to
enable existing search indexes on your site.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker would need to
guess the machine name or ID of a disabled index or server, and a disabled
index would have to be connected to an enabled server for the operation to be
successful. The impact from such an enabled index has little effect besides
using additional resources for indexing because search pages or views related
to the index are not automatically enabled. The enabling of a server has no
effect unless existing indexes assigned to that server are subsequently
enabled as well.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Search API 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Search API [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Search API module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Search API
    7.x-1.3 [4]

Alternatively, you can remove the vulnerability without upgrading by moving
disabled indexes away from servers:

  * If you have disabled indexes, set them to “< No server >” in the index
    settings.

Also see the Search API [5] project page.
