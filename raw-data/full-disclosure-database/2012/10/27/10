Thank you, but we have known about them for several years already.
There are probably about a dozen ways to corrupt the stack for
arbitrary code execution, too.  This is why .hlp files are considered
to be equivalent to .exe files, and so they are considered to be an
unsafe file format.
We don't accept vulnerability reports in .hlp files for that reason.
