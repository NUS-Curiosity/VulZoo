> Santander are a joke when it comes to security. Fed up of two years of battling with them to fix issues any other bank would have fixed in seconds, things like XSS on login pages etc. Time to hit full disclosure with some of these issues in the hope they'll change their game and start to take their customers security seriously:
Not the only ones out there, Bankia also has security issues which
according to their last audits aren't there :facepalm: I'll probably
disclose them later on the future since they seem to consider them not
so important.
