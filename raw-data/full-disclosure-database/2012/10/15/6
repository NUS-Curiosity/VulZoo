> Santander are a joke when it comes to security. Fed up of two years of battling with them to fix issues any other bank would have fixed in seconds, things like XSS on login pages etc. Time to hit full disclosure with some of these issues in the hope they'll change their game and start to take their customers security seriously:


I had to chuckle.
The Spanish banks gave 100% mortgages to people who could just barely finance the interest at ultra-low rates.
Now, they're taking back those houses and flats, evicting the owners (who can no longer pay) and putting them into rented apartments (for slightly less than the interest rates).
The banks were bailed-out by the government, which has now got to be bailed-out by the EU.

Do you honestly think that "customers" actually exist on the radar of those banks?
Hell - who needs customers, when you can have a bail-out?
