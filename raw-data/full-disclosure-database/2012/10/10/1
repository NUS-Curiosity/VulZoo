Subject: Re: Multiple 0-days in Dark Comet RAT

Does 0-day have any meaning any more? It used to mean there were exploits in the wild used to cause damage before the vendor patched it not merely that a security researcher found it and disclosed it to the public before the vendor did.

If a 0 day is everything found by a security team before a vendor then the term will loose all purpose and meaning because almost all work done by such researchers is finding vulns. before the vendor.

End rant.
