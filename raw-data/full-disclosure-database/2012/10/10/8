Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-152 - Feeds -
	Access bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/1808832

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-152
  * Project: Feeds [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-October-10
  * Security risk: Not critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The feeds module enables you to import or aggregate data as nodes, users,
taxonomy terms or simple database records.
The module doesn't sufficiently check permissions when creating nodes on
behalf of a user.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have
control over the source feed, and the Feeds importer must have a field from
that feed mapped to the node's author.

/Note: the Feeds module doesn't have a stable release and therefore a
Security Advisory would not normally be issued, per the Drupal Security Team
policy [3]. However, this issue affects the Mailhandler [4] module, which
does have a stable release. For modules with dependencies, maintainers are
encouraged to create stable releases only for those modules dependent on
stable releases./

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Feeds 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.0-alpha6.

module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

  * If you use the Feeds module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Feeds
    7.x-2.0-alpha6 [6].

Also see the Feeds [7] project page.
