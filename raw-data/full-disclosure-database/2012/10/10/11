  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-October-10
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables integration with the ShareThis [3] web service to allow
social bookmarking amongst your users.
The module doesn't sufficiently filter JavaScript settings before outputting
them.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer sharethis".
