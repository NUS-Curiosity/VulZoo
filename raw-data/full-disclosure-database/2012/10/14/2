Subject: Re: Multiple 0-days in Dark Comet RAT

The cool thing about it is that if you are a net/sys admin, and you notice
one of your computers has been compromised, you can pwn the C+C server.

these are exploits in the C+C server, not in the installed trojan.

that's why its relevant. you can counterhack and pwn the person who pwned
you.


and thats fucking awesome
