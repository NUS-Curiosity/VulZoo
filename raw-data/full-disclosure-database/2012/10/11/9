Subject: Re: Multiple 0-days in Dark Comet RAT

That's because no one particularly cares that it is malware. Botnets,
rootkits, rats, ect are all just as potentially vulnerable as any other
software, except the impact is pretty low. Let's say someone was exploiting
this in the wild. Realistically what are they accomplishing? Most of the
time they'd just be jacking boxes from other people that already got in.
Hardly a feat when chances are you could get in through the same methods
the original guy did.
