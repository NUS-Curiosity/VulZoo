Subject: thc-ipv6 v2.0

Hi guys,

I released thc-ipv6 v2.0 yesterday.

Includes a new tool for alive scanning IPv6 networks (also see
https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2012kul/materials/D1T2%20-%20Marc%20Heuse%20-%20IPv6%20Insecurity%20Revolutions.pdf),
new tools for local network denial of service against Windows and BSD
based systems (not patched yet as it seems), inject into PPPoE and 6to4
tunnels and a lot more! Have fun :-)

available at www.thc.org/thc-ipv6

Greets,
Marc
