* CVE Identifier: CVE-2012-4445


Summary
-------

The internal EAP authentication server of hostapd does not sufficiently
validate the message length field of EAP-TLS messages, which can be
exploited for a denial-of-service via specially crafted EAP-TLS messages
(before authentication).

Hostapd has a function eap_server_tls_process_fragment() used by its
internal EAP authentication server for handling fragmented EAP-TLS
messages. The function (indirectly) calls wpabuf_overflow() aborting
the application in case of potential buffer overflows. Such a situation
can be triggered by an attacker sending an EAP-TLS message with

    a) the "More Fragments" flag set and
    b) an "TLS Message Length" value that is smaller than the size of
       the "TLS Data" field.

The vulnerability can be exploited only if hostapd is configured to use
its internal EAP authentication server, either directly for IEEE 802.11x
or when using hostapd as a RADIUS authentication server. 

Affected is hostapd in versions 0.6 - 1.0. The issue was introduced with
