Package        : hostapd
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4445

Timo Warns discovered that the internal authentication server of hostapd,
a user space IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator,
is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing fragmented EAP-TLS
messages.  As a result, an internal overflow checking routine terminates
the process.  An attacker can abuse this flaw to conduct denial of service
attacks via crafted EAP-TLS messages prior to any authentication.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.10-2+squeeze1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your hostapd packages.
