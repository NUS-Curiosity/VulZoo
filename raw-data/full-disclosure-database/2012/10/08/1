Subject: JSON-RPC Cross-Site Request Forgery little
	exploitation trick

Hi,

During penetration-test contract, we came across CSRF in JSON-RPC based 
web application.
Brief google search revealed some people saying that CSRF in JSON is hard
to exploit, and that these vulnerabilities can be ignored.
In fact, it's not that hard to exploit...
Here is how we exploited it - little trick about CSRF attacks on 
JSON-RPC based web applications.
Maybe it'll be useful to someone.
