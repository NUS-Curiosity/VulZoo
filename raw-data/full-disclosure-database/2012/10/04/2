Subject: Vulnerable MSVC++ 2008 runtime libraries
	distributed with and installed by Ogg DirectShow filters

Hi @ll,

the Ogg DirectShow filters available from <http://www.xiph.org/dshow/>
are distributed with and install vulnerable MSVC++ 2008 runtime libraries
MSVC?90.DLL.

See <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2467174>
and <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2538243>
resp. <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS11-025.mspx>


To make things worse, the vulnerable libraries are NOT installed as
side-by-side components below %SystemRoot%\WinSxS\, but as private
components in the applications directory, where they are not detected
and not updated by tools like Windows Update Agent or Secunia PSI.

Cf. <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/835322>


Additionally, the installer places the 64-bit components into the
wrong path "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Xiph.org\OpenCodecs\x64\".


Workaround:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete all MSVC?.DLL installed with the Ogg DirectShow filters
in "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Xiph.org\OpenCodecs\" and
"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Xiph.org\OpenCodecs\x64\".
