The reaction of a security professional like me to this is, why aren't you 
looking for security flaws on your own site?  Why are you looking for 
security flaws on other people's sites?  If you want to do security 
research, setup a site virtually and bang away at it to your heart's 
content.  Then report your findings.

You missed the point.  It isn't that I think that you're a criminal.  It's 
that, as a security professional, I cannot take the chance that you are 
not.  I am forced to do due diligence, take the server offline, do 
forensics, etc.  That's a lot of work, time spent and disruption of my 
normal duties, all you so you can feel proud about finding a 
vulnerability.  The cost to you is minimal.  To me, it's expensive.

So why do you think it's acceptable for you to do some minimal work to 
force others to do lots of extra work?

Nobody's talking about punishing people for finding security flaws, but 
you're punishing the security professionals for the "pleasure" of finding 
vulnerabilities on their site.  If I find a vulnerability in our assets, I 
can simply fix or remediate the problem.  If you find it, I have to treat 
it as a breach, or I'm not doing my job.

I think thousands of people walking or driving past my house and looking 
at it as they go by is perfectly normal.  What's not normal is for one of 
them to pull over, get out of their car, walk up to my door and check to 
see if it's unlocked, walk around the house checking all the windows and 
doors, etc., etc.

As Valdis pointed out, even public stores have private areas where you are 
not allowed.  You go there and someone is going to question you, maybe 
even arrest you depending upon what you're doing.

It's 2012.  I seriously doubt most sites ignore vulnerabilities any more. 
We HAVE learned a few things over the years.  We are constantly auditing 
for flaws, assessing for flaws and insisting that flaws are corrected.  We 
don't need your help to do our jobs.  I can assure you that we are not 
sitting around waiting for someone like you to help us.

obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
