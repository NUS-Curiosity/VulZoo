you didn't watched properly.
nobody said that you shouldn't report vulnerabilities.
we discussed whether would it help or not if one would hire the kiddies
owning their sites.
and we discussed why is it bad if you report the vulnerability and back it
up with the proof that you compromised that said system.

I always report the vulns that I stumble upon (from my own email and such)
and while I'm doing this in good faith, I would never dare to actively
exploit that vuln for better proof, because if they sue me, they would win.
So I try to keep it that way, that I cannot be held responsible, because I
didn't broke any law.
I also think that for a full penetration testing, one shouldn't act without
prior agreement with the owner and having that written down.
To go back to the irl analogy: even if I'm doing it in good faith, so that
I would report the owner or fix the lock myself, I shouldn't try to open
every door and window on a "random" house, nor should I take a photo of his
belongings that I can prove that I was there.
