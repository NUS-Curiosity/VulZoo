You / your organization's developers wrote your system, perhaps
building on some other systems.  That gives me the intellectual
challenge of trying to find the flaws in *your* design.  It is just a
different sort of game from finding flaws in my own designs.

Meanwhile, your systems continue to be vulnerable, and the bad guys who
want to exploit those vulnerabilities for criminal purposes will
continue to do so.  Unless you system is just a bunch of off-the-shelf
components that you assembled, there are going to be parts of your
system that you wrote yourself, and that in all likelihood will be
vulnerable to some sort of attack.  It helps if someone who is not
familiar with your development process and who is not operating under
the same assumptions that you are operating under tries to attack that
system.

Most places do not already have in-house pen testers for these things,
so the only way they will get any useful information on the security of
their systems is if someone tries to attack them.

It is more that if one person found the vulnerability, then any number
of other people might have found and exploited it.  What makes you
think that the first person to identify a problem is the only person to
have spotted it?  Again, I would be more worried about the people who
might have found the vulnerability and not reported it than the person
who found the vulnerability and did report it.

Or perhaps save a lot of work, by identifying a vulnerability before it
is exploited by someone who creates a big mess.

> Nobody's talking about punishing people for finding security flaws,

That is pretty much how I read a lot of the comments in this
discussion.  People are basically saying that the only way someone
could report a problem without facing prosecution is if they stop at
the hypothetical part -- "You seem to be running an old version of
Apache that could be attacked using this buffer overflow."  It is hard
to convince anyone that a hypothetical problem needs to be fixed, and
it is easy to dismiss someone who provides no evidence.  Just take a
look at the argument between Red Hat's SELinux team and the Mozilla
developers on the topic of writable/executable memory if you think
hypothetical attacks are enough to convince people about security
problems.

> but you're punishing the security professionals

By telling them that there is an exploitable vulnerability in their
system?  Their job is to fix those problems; how is reporting problems
to them in any way a punishment?

So if you found a vulnerability, you would not immediately audit the
vulnerable system?  You have no concerns about all those hackers out
there who might not have bothered to report the problem to you?

Really, you doubt that?  You can still access security cameras in
arbitrary places by entering the right keywords into Google.  A lot of
people run unpatched Wordpress blogs. There are still SQL injection
attacks out there, XSS attacks, and CSRF attacks.  People are still not
salting password hashes, and in some cases they are storing passwords
in the clear.  Many websites are still not using TLS for things like
logins.

These are basic, common, well-known vulnerabilities that people are
ignoring, and these only cover problems related to  websites; plenty
more problems exist with other systems.  We have a long way to go
before we can say that vulnerabilities are not being ignored.

*You* and your organization might be doing that.  All you need to do is
read the details about attacks that make the news to see that plenty of
high profile companies are not doing that.

Good for your organization, but what about all those others who are not
auditing, who do not take security seriously, and who are not going to
listen to people who come to them with hypothetical attacks?
