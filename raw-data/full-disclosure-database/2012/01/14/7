I don't normally go around looking unless asked. However it's rather
hard not to notice sites that display php errors and sometimes in
normal usage sql errors. Some of them are so bad it's like having a
pink elephant in the middle of a room with a sign that says
"vulnerable". A good example which I've personally seen more than once
is during normal website usage is searching the website using their
built in search and noticing it doesn't sanitize it's input. It's
rather hard not to notice that once you have the eye for it.

I have also noticed software that is way too old running and keeping
up with security bulletins I often know it's vulnerable. it's like
another pink elephant.

There is of course an exception to that is a guy trying to come off as
some big hot shot security expert super hacker which I will leave
nameless that I really love tormenting. He loves downloading and
running these really really bad free php scripts from the 90s by how
some of them are coded. It usually only takes 10 minutes tops before I
found a few flaws, point them out by line number, and watch him silent
rage and remove the script from his server. For clarification the
source code of these scripts being freely available and I did not
actively test the located flaws on his server so nothing I did was
illegal.Given the non-importance I did not confirm them on my own dev
server.

I never doubted fixing the problem can sometimes be work intensive in
some situations and if someone else has used it maliciously.

Fixing a problem reported as part of your job description is so...
bad? I would be happier if someone reported it rather than reading
about it in the news.

I would call "punishing people" using the flaw to embarrass and damage
the company rather then discreetly reporting it but that is just me
apparently.

This is still a bad analogy considering the internet is very different
than life. A private area keeping with this bad analogy would be more
akin to a login screen and trying to break it which is no doubt
illegal. However how do you not notice say the key being in the door,
the door being wide open with important things inside, etc. and being
in legal trouble for telling someone that works there about it?

As I said for me personally I don't report anything I come across so I
wouldn't fit the "need your help to do our jobs". Judging by the tone
of "We don't need your help to do our jobs", "sitting around waiting
for someone like you to help us" and from earlier "force others to do
lots of extra work" you rather don't appreciate filling your job
description.
