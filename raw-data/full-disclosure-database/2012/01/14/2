So tell me... who pays for the investigation that makes sure you didn't do
anything else?

Remember that we're talking about people here - and no matter what you consider
"right" in this situation, some poor soul is going to end up saying "I really
wish you hadn't told me about that, because it's 4:45PM on Friday, and my
weekend just got shot all to heck".  For that matter, *you* would say the same
thing at 4:45PM on Friday (and if you wouldn't, you *really* need to get out
more. ;)

That would be the "I spotted a potential vuln on your website" case, which isn't
so bad.

What's a lot more troubling is the "and here's a secret document proving it"
case - at which point they *have* done something with it.
