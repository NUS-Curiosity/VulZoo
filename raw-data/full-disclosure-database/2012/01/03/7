Subject: [TOOL RELEASE] Technitium MAC Address Changer v6
	(FREEWARE)

Hi,

Technitium MAC Address Changer allows you to change Media Access
Control (MAC) Address of your Network Interface Card (NIC)
irrespective to your NIC manufacturer or its driver. It has a very
simple user interface and provides ample information regarding each
NIC in the machine. Every NIC has a MAC address hard coded in its
circuit by the manufacturer. This hard coded MAC address is used by
windows drivers to access Ethernet Network (LAN). This tool can set a
new MAC address to your NIC, bypassing the original hard coded MAC
address. Technitium MAC Address Changer is a must tool in every
security professionals tool box.
