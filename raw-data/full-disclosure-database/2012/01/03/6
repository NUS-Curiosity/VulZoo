The code that generates captcha imagey is top secret proprietary
software.  Only the top software engineers of the global captcha
security firms have access to the source code, and then only when each
one of them provides half of the security key to decode the system.
The code is never actually loaded in memory.  If this code ever got
into the wrong hands then the entire captcha security system would be
broken.
