Because he has a stupid autoresponder that blabs out to the From: address
without bothering to figure out if it's actually addressed to him personally,
or if it's traffic to a list he subscribes to. There's a number of really good
heuristics, none of which his autoresponder actually did:

1) Check Return-Path: and Sender: for the patterns owner-*@, *-request@, and *-bounces@
2) Check for a List-ID: header
3) Check if an address of yours is listed in the To: or cc: fields.
4) For bonus credit, don't send a note if you've sent a note to the same address
since the autoresponder was turned on (helps prevent loops).
