No, the person I *want* to hire doesn't come to me with a secret document,
he comes to me and says "There's a hole in this web page that will leak
secret documents, but I didn't actually download one to fully verify it".

No, it can be restated as "you want to hire someone with a skillset similar
to that teenager".

Would you hire that teenager to take several tens of thousands of cash to the
bank unescorted?  No?  Then why are you hiring them into a position where
they'll have basically unescorted access to similar amounts of valuables?
