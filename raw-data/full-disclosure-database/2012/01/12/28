And if they do that they will get told "Well how do you know it will 
actually leak secret documents since you didn't verify that it actually 
leaks them, stop wasting our time" We have all seen companies ignore 
vulnerabilities because the company claimed it was not exploitable when 
it was. Right now the FBI is claiming that they knew about the Stratfor 
hack and had informed people that their personal data was compromised, 
but we know this isnt true because live credit cards from the data leak 
were actually used after it became public, so again who are you going to 
trust the people who have been proven over and over to lie to the public 
about the state of their security or the people showing the world they 
are liars?
