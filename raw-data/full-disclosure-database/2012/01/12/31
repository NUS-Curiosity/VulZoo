Even if they do have backups (which they might not), does not mean that 
your intrusion isn't going to cost them money. You come across as the 
type of person who could justify marines pissing over afghans by saying, 
"hey - what the hell, the afghans were dead!"
You cannot cite that no lives are lost in a digital intrusion, if you 
were to take down the traffic control systems of a city and there were 
accidents, then I'm afraid, you're plain wrong. Particularly if your 
some hacker unacqainted with a companies internal digital infrastructure 
- you're more like a bull in a chinashop.

Your attitude appears to show to me that you seem to be unconcerned 
about humiliating people, have no concern to what actions a humiliated 
person might commit. There is anger in your tone of script - I would 
have concerns about hiring someone who thinks in this way, it comes 
across to me that they would be overly confrontational and destructive 
to my teams way of working.

The store manager is partly to blame, but if CCTV shows the kids 
stealing stuff then they will still be convicted of the crime and the 
excuse they might give that the 'door was unlocked' would not get them 
off the charge of theft and vandalism (although they might not be guilty 
of 'breaking and entering', they might be considered for 'trespassing'.

Hell NO! Wouldn't trust anyone who broke into my company like that. If 
they contacted me I'd be straight onto law enforcement to report them 
for trying to blackmail me.
