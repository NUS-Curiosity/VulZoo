Bad analogy.  Closer would be if you have a house that's got a driveway on a
public street, and you claim it's not breaking and entering if you walk up the
driveway, try the doorknob, find it unlocked, and let yourself in without the
permission of the residents.  Saying that "anybody could walk up and let
themselves in the door" doesn't make it legal.
