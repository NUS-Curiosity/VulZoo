*Laurelai* I know its a strange spelling but it is spelled correctly in 
my email address, and its than not that. Committing arson is not 
comparable to a digital intrusion, no lives are lost and any enterprise 
system worth speaking of has backup systems so very little real damage 
is done, the most damage that occurs is to their reputation, it injures 
peoples pride and causes humiliation.  The people being humiliated have 
created reputations as experts in infosec, reputations that as its being 
shown they don't deserve. Lets be honest here if it wasn't anon/antisec 
doing it someone else would have eventually (perhaps they already were) 
and they probably wouldn't have made the incident public, they would 
have just quietly stolen user data and credit card information and sold 
them off to the highest bidder for as long as they possibly could. Or 
used stolen credentials to gain access to even more data. You seem to be 
missing the point that anon/antisec is using methods for the most part 
that are simple attacks that any company has absolutely no excuse to be 
vulnerable to. This is more like owning a large store and leaving the 
doors unlocked at night and finding that some kids walked in and put all 
of your stock outside of the store and pinned your internal finance 
documents that show you have been embezzling to the windows, plus they 
drew penises on the pictures in your office just to pour salt on the 
wound. In this case you have nobody to blame but yourself. My suggestion 
that they should hire these kids was meant to imply that as bad as they 
are they probably are more ethical than the people they are attacking 
since they aren't storing all sorts of sensitive user data in plain text 
and telling people its all safe.

We can at least agree on that much. However the only way to show these 
companies that the emperor has no clothes is to show them that the 
emperor has no clothes.
