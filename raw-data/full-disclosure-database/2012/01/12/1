just one question
why should they hire the "skiddies" if most of them only know how to fire
up sqlmap or whatever current app is hot right now?
doesnt really seem like enough reason to hire anyone
besides im not buying the whole "they do it because they are angry at
society" plop
ive been there.. they do it for the lulz
