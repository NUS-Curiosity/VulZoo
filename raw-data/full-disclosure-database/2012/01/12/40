I would also like to point out that "finding the bugs" is not the  same as
"fixing the bugs," and that for all the focus that is placed on finding
them, and lauding the people that do, fixing them is usually pretty
thankless. I think shifting that dynamic would be more rewarding if
"advancing the state of the industry" is really what is valued.
