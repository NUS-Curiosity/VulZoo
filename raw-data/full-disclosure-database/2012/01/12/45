If you go to a website and do a bit of clicking around that's normal 
behaviour, walking past the house, having a look at the front rose 
garden etc...

If you go to a website and do some hand tweaking of the URL to see if 
you get to stuff that shouldn't be there, well that's trying the 
doorknob of the house to see if it's locked etc...

If you write and/or use a tool to mass check loads of potential URLs... 
attempt SQL injections etc... you see where I'm going.

If you use the results of that tool or get lucky with the URL tweaks and 
take confidential documents or alter records on the backend, well that's 
just plain theft and/or fraud.
