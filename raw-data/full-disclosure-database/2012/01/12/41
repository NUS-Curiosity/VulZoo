I am not sure it really counts as blackmail if someone says, "I just
downloaded these secret files from your computer system," unless they
follow up with, "If you do not pay me, I will release this to the
general public."  Frankly, someone who simply releases these documents
to the public is not nearly as unethical as someone who tries to
quietly sell the documents on the black market.  We should not be
making the mistake of thinking that someone who cracks a security
system without permission is necessarily evil or has evil intentions,
and the ethical violation is very minor.

Really, calling it "breaking in" is a stretch.  You connected a
computer to a publicly accessible computer network, where anyone can
send anything to your computer.  If hacking such a system is "breaking
in," you might as well claim that shouting across your neighbor's yard
is "breaking in."  The law is not going to stop the really bad people
from attacking your system, nor is it going to stop them from profiting
from whatever access they gain; sending law enforcement after someone
who reports problems to you accomplishes little and only discourages
people who might try to help you.
