You *do* realie that in the US, most corporations are legally *required* to let
profit margins dictate *all* policy, security and otherwise?  The corporate
officers are required to maximise shareholder value, and in fact can be (and
often *are*) sued if they decide "Project XYZ would make a boatload of money,
but we're killing it off because it's morally wrong" or similar.  The exception
is if they reincorporate as a "benefit corporation", which has only been
available for a year or two, in only several states, and apparently only 100
corporations (out of the hundreds of thousands in the US) have taken this path so far...

Bottom line: In most corporations, the CSO *can't* spend more money on security
unless he can show increased profits by doing so.   So if you're the CSO and want
to spend $15M more on security, you have to show how doing so will result in
a better return for the shareholders.  And as I pointed out earlier in this thread,
even the big hacks at Sony and TJX didn't affect *the shareholders*, so under current
US corporate law, those companies actually did what they were *required* to do.
