Yes. But by Larueli's logic, since I know how to use a Bic lighter,
I'm infinitely more qualified that a trained firefighter. By setting
fire to other people's houses, I'm announcing my intention to join
their ranks, and deserve a job at the nearest station. Nevermind, that
20 people died and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property
damage- if the firemen were true professionals, they would have made
the houses completely fireproof a long time ago, or at the very least
responded and put out the fire before any real damage was done.

Plus, I have a Zippo, which makes me uber-leet.

Anyone who says "you are secure, you are hacker-proof" should be shown
the door. But this is reality. Companies don't WANT to know that the
Emperor is naked. All they want is to fill in the checkbox that says
that they did their due diligence, so they pass their annual audit. If
holes are found, now they have to spend time, money and effort fixing
them, or they lose their insurance/merchant status/some kind of
accreditation. That's why most organizations are happy with some guy
who charges $500/hr to run a Nessus scan and walk out the door. He had
a goatee, and ate all of our donuts, so he must have been a real pro!

Once these businesses start asking for real security professionals and
real assessments, these "white hat" versions of script kiddies will
get weeded out.

One right does not erase a wrong. Strip away the "robbed from the
rich, gave to the poor" mythos, Robin Hood was still a thief, robber
and murderer.
