Subject: Re: Fwd: Rate Stratfor's Incident Response

not my company anymore :) i walked out laughing a long time ago
part of my position was to pentest the different apps
i did and reported flaws but like i said there is no money here and now in
fixing flaws
so resources are allocated for new development instead

hiring a kiddie wouldnt help
youre missing the point
in any profit driven company its ORDER BY $$$
which means your kiddie would be coding crappy wepapps because of random
manager ideas
and usually introducing those very same flaws they like to exploit so much
just going in GUNG HO and fixing flaws outside of release cycles and so on
is also a bad idea for big companies as chaos would ensue
