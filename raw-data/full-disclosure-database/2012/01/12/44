Hello,

This is a pretty classic analogy that I've used many times myself, but
for many years now I've found myself questioning it... I mean good
analogies are valuable, but I think in this case it falls down.

Mostly, there's the expectation of physical security or, at least,
privacy, when it comes to a house. If someone's rattling door knobs,
it's not unreasonable to expect that they could be there to rob or do
you harm, as the human race does not have a significant history of
peaceful/harmless door rattling practices (that I know of).

Now, when it comes to the internet and networks in general, we've
entered a whole new world where many old ways of looking at things,
tempting as they are, don't fit. There's also no real relevance to
fearing for your physical safety if someone's probing your net.

To a good extent I might be talking out of my ass here, but I'd welcome
feedback.

Cheers,
B
