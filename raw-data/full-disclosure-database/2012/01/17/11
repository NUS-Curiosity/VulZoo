Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability-Lab Team discovered multiple persistent Web Vulnerabilities on Zimbras Prism Desktop Application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-11-01:	Vendor Notification
2012-01-12:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published

==================
Zimbra Inc.
Product: Zimbra Desktop v7.1.2 b10978 


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple input validation vulnerabilities(persistent) are detected on Zimbra Desktop v7.1.2. Local attackers can 
include (persistent) malicious script code to manipulate specific customer/admin requests. The vulnerability 
allows an local privileged attacker to  manipulate the appliance(application) via persistent script code inject. 
It is also possible to hijack customer sessions via persistent script code execution on application side. Successful 
exploitation can also result in context/module request manipulation, execution of persistent malicious script code, 
session hijacking(account steal) & application side mailbox phishing attacks.
