Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability-lab Team discovered multiple persistent Web Vulnerabilities on the Barracudas  SSL VPN 480 appliance.



Report-Timeline:
================
2011-04-02:	Vendor Notification
2011-05-07:	Vendor Response/Feedback
2011-12-18:	Vendor Fix/Patch
2012-01-12:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Barracudas SSL VPN 480. Local low privileged user account can
implement/inject malicious persistent script code. When exploited by an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities 
can lead to information disclosure, access to intranet available servers, manipulated persistent content.

Vulnerable Module(s):	
						[+] Create Personal Network Place 
						[+] Network Places 6 Create Network Places
						[+] SSL Tunnels & My Favorites

Affected Product(s):
						[+] Barracuda SSL VPN 480 - Firmware v2.0.1.019 & older versions

Picture(s):
						../ive1.png
						../ive2.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by local low privileged user accounts or remote attackers with via high user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1. Login
2. Open the vulnerable area were the persistent vulnerability is located
3. Include/Insert your own script code and save the content to inject
4. View the injected results which were stored on application side. The code is getting executed in the listing output section


Solution:
=========
2011-12-18:	Vendor Fix/Patch


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
