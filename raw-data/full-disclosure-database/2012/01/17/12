Abstract:
=========
An anonymous laboratory researcher discovered multiple (critical/remote) SQL Injection Vulnerabilities on Duesseldorf-international airport Vendor website/portal.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-04-00:	Vendor Notification
2011-**-**:	Vendor Response/Feedback
2011-12-01:	Vendor Fix/Patch
2012-01-11:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
Multiple SQl-Injection vulnerabilities are detected on the DUS INT Airport Website & Services.
The remote vulnerability allows an remote attacker to execute own sql commands on the vulnerable value or module.
Successful exploitation of the remote SQL Injection vulnerabilities can result in access to all db tables, read server/root passwords, 
access to sensitive information like customer creditcards/bonuscards, identity-listings, flight-number, schedules, tickets, IDs, 
packetnumbers, flightfields, pins, ccs, cvs, emails & company/business details.

Solution:
=========
2011-12-01:	Vendor - FULL Fix/Patch  


Risk:
=====
