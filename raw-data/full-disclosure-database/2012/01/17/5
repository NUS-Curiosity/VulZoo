Subject: [TOOL RELEASE] Exploit Next Generation SQL
 Fingerprint v1.12.120115/RC0

It has been a long, long time since the last public release (more than one
year) of the Exploit Next Generation® SQL Fingerprint, but it is back to
the road.	

For those that are not familiarized with Exploit Next Generation® SQL
Fingerprint, it is a powerful tool which performs version fingerprinting
for:
1. Microsoft SQL Server 2000;
2. Microsoft SQL Server 2005;
3. Microsoft SQL Server 2008; and
4. Microsoft SQL Server 2012.

The Exploit Next Generation® SQL Fingerprint uses well-known techniques
based on several public tools that are capable to identify the Microsoft
SQL Server version (such as: SQLping and SQLver), but, instead of showing
only the "raw version" (i.e., Microsoft SQL Version 10.00.2746), the
Exploit Next Generation® SQL Fingerprint shows the mapped Microsoft SQL
Server version (i.e., Microsoft SQL 2008 SP1 (CU5)).

The strengths of Exploit Next Generation® SQL Fingerprint are:
1. It uses both TCP and UDP protocols to determine the Microsoft SQL
version, making it much more reliable than any other proprietary
(commercial) product and/or open-source software.
2. It is capable to identify multiple Microsoft SQL Server instances and
their TCP communication ports.
3. It does not require any authentication method to identify the Microsoft
SQL Server version.
4. It uses probabilistic algorithm to identify the Microsoft SQL Server
version, combining both TCP and UDP fingerprint.

The Exploit Next Generation® SQL Fingerprint can also be used to map and
identify vulnerable/non-patched Microsoft SQL Server version, and it is
based on some techniques used by Permutation Oriented Programming (f.k.a.
Exploit Next Generation® Compliance Methodology) to perform automated
penetration test. The version 1.12.120115/RC0 includes support to identify
the following Microsoft SQL Server versions:
. Microsoft SQL 2008 SP1 (CU11)
. Microsoft SQL 2008 SP1 (CU12)
