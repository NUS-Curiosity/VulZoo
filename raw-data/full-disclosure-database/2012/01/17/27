Looking at that law, I am not even sure that you need to use a flaw to
extract secret info.  It looks like something as simple as transmitting
a message to each user that dictates what they are authorized to do is
enough to trigger the law.  If I tell you that you are only allowed to
access pages on my site by clicking on links from the index.html page,
and you try entering some other URL, it looks like that would be a
felony -- IANAL though, so perhaps a lawyer can weigh in on this?
