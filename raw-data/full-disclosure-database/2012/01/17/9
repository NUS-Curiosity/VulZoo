Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability-Lab Reseacher discovered a persistent cross site scripting vulnerability on the MegaSWF website.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-12-03:	Vendor Notification
2012-01-12:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected on the MegaSwf website service.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker with required user inter action to hijack customer sessions via persistent cross site scripting.
Successful exploitation can result in account steal, client side exploitation or phishing & session hijacking.
The bug is located on the serve module in-/output of the megaswf service web application.

Vulnerbale Module(s):
                                                                    [+] serve

Picture(s):
                                                                    ../1.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
[1] Create an URLRequest-Object with a JS-Code like : var alert:URLRequest = new URLRequest("javascript:alert('xss')");
[2] Publishing the swf in megaswf.com will exploit a persistent xss-vulnerability and run your JS code.

Full code-example that can be used on a frame as actionscript :

import flash.net.URLRequest;
var alert:URLRequest = new URLRequest("javascript:alert('xss')");
navigateToURL(alert, "_self");
