18 USC 1030 is the governing Federal statute in the US.  In addition, many of the
states have their own legislation.

http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001030----000-.html

"having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding
authorized access, and by means of such conduct having obtained information..."

Note that "protected computer" doesn't mean "secured" - it means "protected under
the terms of this law", which includes any system:

"which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication,
including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner
that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United
States;"

which is basically *any* system on the Internet.

Basically, you use a flaw to extract secret info from a "protected computer",
and you aren't an authorized pen tester with a signed "get out of jail free"
card from the owner of the computer, you just bought yourself a felony rap.

That's part of why CISO's don't want to hire the kiddies that whacked them - if
they come forward they're basically copping to a felony.
