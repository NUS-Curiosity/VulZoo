I would say that we need both types: the skiddies and the others.
If you give to the skiddies enough fun at work they won't do something beyond the scope.
But their scope should be: I have a site/system(of course, the test one, not the production one!) break it!
They do it without being evil, even if they break it....the job was to break it in the first place. 

Then the other security guy should go to the management with the pwnd dummy database/data and show them how bad it would be if it was the real one, and how easily it could be done.
Maybe this way the management provides more funding to the security of the business.

So, yes, hire the skiddies, but keep the other too.

Perhaps Stratfor's competition should hire them. Nothing new, there:
the Eastern Telegraph Company hired Nevil Maskelyne after he hacked
Marconi in 1903 during a demonstration of wireless telegraphy. [1]
(Wireless hacking since 1903!).
