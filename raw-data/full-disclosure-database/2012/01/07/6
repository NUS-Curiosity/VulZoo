O really? PHP 1.8? how would you compile that on a modern linux distro?
how would you run drupal on top of it?

// $Id: default.settings.php,v 1.8.2.4 2009/09/14 12:59:18 goba Exp $
that is a line from the default drupal config file.

I agree that the php app was the most likely source of the intrusion, I
would guess that they didn't kept the drupal core and the contrib modules
up-to-date, and they were owned through some old vulnerability.
