In most shops, the level of competence is barely sufficient to make sure that
the payroll system prints a check for every employee with the correct number on
it. Trying to keep the system running *and* secure is beyond their competence
level, so you have to choose one - running or secure.  Most managers will
choose 'running', because if they choose 'secure', *they* don't get a paycheck
either...

(Vastly oversimplified, but that's pretty much it in a nutshell).
