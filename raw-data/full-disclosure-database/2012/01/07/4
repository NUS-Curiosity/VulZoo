http://bolt.thexfil.es/84e9h!t was an interesting link - it
demonstrated the pwnage.

It looks like these folks gained access via PHP. Stratfor was using a
Linux based system system, but PHP was version 1.8
from 2009 (perhaps with some back patches). Current version of PHP is
5.3.8 (http://www.php.net/).

Two lessons: (1) keep your boxes patched, and (2) don't store secrets
in the plain text, or use [unsalted] MD5 to digest secrets.

Fuck me running - that's been known for years.... I think Stratfor
broke all the major tenets of data security. The company deserves
everything they get in this instance.

And I like the RickRoll - it was a nice touch which really
demonstrated a level of caring not often seen.
