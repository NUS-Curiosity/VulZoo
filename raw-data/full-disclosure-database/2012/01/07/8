Subject: Re: Fwd: Rate Stratfor's Incident Response

All this is true. From time to time, these things happen to businesses that do not take security as bread and butter. Although, I call that statement incorrect as well, because security firms themselves get targeted most of the time.

My question(s) would be: why are people sloppy by nature when it comes to security? Why is security still considered as a blanket as opposed to the core of any system? 

PS: I am totally wrong and I know that ;)

Thank you.
