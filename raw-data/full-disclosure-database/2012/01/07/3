Package        : ecryptfs-utils
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1831 CVE-2011-1832 CVE-2011-1834 CVE-2011-1835 
                 CVE-2011-1837 CVE-2011-3145 

Several problems have been discovered in ecryptfs-utils, a cryptographic
filesystem for Linux.

CVE-2011-1831

  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs
  incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local
  attacker could use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading
  to privilege escalation.

CVE-2011-1832

  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs
  incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local
  attacker could use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading
  to a denial of service.

CVE-2011-1834

  Dan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly
  handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local
  attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly
  unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2011-1835

  Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when
  setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use
  this flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user.

CVE-2011-1837

  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled
  lock counters. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite
  arbitrary files.

We acknowledge the work of the Ubuntu distribution in preparing patches
suitable for near-direct inclusion in the Debian package.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 68-1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 83-4+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 95-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ecryptfs-utils packages.
