Because they pay the kids to own them in a safe manner to show that 
their so called expertsd are full of shit, then they fire said experts 
and hire competent people saving time money and resources, try and 
remember the guys with the certs are the ones getting owned by the 
skiddies with sqlmap so that should show you how broken the infosec 
industry is, want to fix it? Start by hiring the skids because they are 
still more competent than the guys they are owning. If that one gets 
owned you hire the guy who owned him ect... until you actually have to 
know what the hell your doing to be in infosec. Use a Darwinian approach 
to the industry.
