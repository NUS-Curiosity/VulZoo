The industry would self-correct pretty quickly if customers weren't
satisfied with their contractor firing off a quick Nessus scan, and handing
this year's report off along with the bill. A lot of companies don't WANT
to know they are vulnerable, because of the shitstorm it causes.

Because they pay the kids to own them in a safe manner to show that their
so called expertsd are full of shit, then they fire said experts and hire
competent people saving time money and resources, try and remember the guys
with the certs are the ones getting owned by the skiddies with sqlmap so
that should show you how broken the infosec industry is, want to fix it?
Start by hiring the skids because they are still more competent than the
guys they are owning. If that one gets owned you hire the guy who owned him
ect... until you actually have to know what the hell your doing to be in
infosec. Use a Darwinian approach to the industry.
