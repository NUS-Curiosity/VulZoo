Sony has a chronic, progressive problem with data security. Sony (or a
child corporation operating under their name) had been hacked at least
43 times in the past
(http://attrition.org/security/rant/sony_aka_sownage.html).

Adding insult to injury, Sony laid off security folks before the
spectacular breach
(http://techgeek.com.au/2011/06/25/lawsuit-sony-laid-off-security-staff-before-data-breach/).

Sony is the poster child for driving drunk on the information super
highway. Computing is a privilege, not a right. They should have their
privileges revoked.

It cost TJX next to nothing, if I recall. It was less than 1% of one
quarter's earnings. The executives were awarded bonuses for a job well
done, and the loss was passed on to the share holders.

Sadly, you are right.

In the US, we need a legislative change - broader, more encompassing
laws and definitions which benefit the users (whether its a user with
a credit card on file, or a user with PII on file). We need harsh
penalties to act as a deterrent against corporate indifference, and
board members to be held criminally accountable. With harsh penalties
and board accountability, I would argue you could relax legislative
oversight - give them enough rope to hang themselves, and see how many
executives will opt for 'lets spend 10 years in prison' because its
cheaper to do nothing.

Its probably a pipe dream, though (I know it is while corporate
america gets to participate in the oligarchy via bribes (err, PAC
contributions)).
