Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability-Lab researcher discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities on the famous ATMAIL Web Admin Application v6.3.4.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-11-01:	Vendor Notification
2012-01-07:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
ATMAIL
Product: WebMail Admin v6.3.4


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected on the ATMAIL WebMail Admin Application v6.3.4.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to inject persistent malicious script code. Successful exploitation
can results in persistent content manipulation, server-side session hijacking & module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] UserManagement & Listing - FirstName or LastName
				[+] Exception-Handling of the Application - Output
				[+] Mass-Mail Input & Output Listing

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with low required user inter action or 
by local low privileged user accounts. For demonstration or reproduce ...
