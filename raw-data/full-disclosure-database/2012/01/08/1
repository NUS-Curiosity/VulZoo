Subject: Re: Fwd: Rate Stratfor's Incident Response

I would agree to every response in this chain of emails.

Reason: there is no 1 perfect solution. There is no one single mindset that can protect against everything that people ate facing these days. Blended attacks and threats make things complicated. Defense is not as simple as said when it is attempted to be put into works and there cannot be 1 perfect solution that secures everything either.

Thank you.

Start by hiring the skids because they are still more competent than the guys they are owning. If that one gets owned you hire the guy who owned him ect... until you actually have to know what the hell your doing to be in infosec. Use a Darwinian approach to the industry.
