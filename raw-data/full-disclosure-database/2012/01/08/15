I don't know why you emailed this to me, perhaps you were looking for 
attention or something, so ive forwarded it to the FD list so you can 
get all the attention you want.

Cheers.

If this turns out to be the person who hacked your web site, I would 
like a cash reward.

Last email I have from him is 23rd December... same kind of grammar as 
the Stratfor pastebin.

It seems he disappeared just as the Stratfor news broke just before 
Christmas.
