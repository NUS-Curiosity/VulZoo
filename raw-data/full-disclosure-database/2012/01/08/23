CISSP is just the beginning of security skills... Far ranging but shallow.
I considered gaining a CISSP but it only proves that I can pass an exam.
Unfortunately many courses these days only teach one to pass the exam.

Professing to be an expert whilst comparing myself to the average user may well be true.
But in all honesty I am only as good as the scenarios I have encountered and understood.

I have been playing around with computers since I got a ZX spectrum, I know an awful lot about I.T., computers and IT security.
I progressed from from first line support to management during my career, Yet I still consider myself a noob when I read what some of what the
contributors to this list have to say. Thanks for the continuing education guys/gals.

I expect senility to kick in before I consider myself some kind of guru.
The problem lies with those who consider themselves a guru after passing an exam.
