Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium and V8.
Please review the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below
for details.

Impact
======

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted web site or JavaScript program using Chromium or V8, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process, or a Denial of Service condition.

The attacker could also perform URL bar spoofing.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=www-client/chromium-16.0.912.75"

All V8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/v8-3.6.6.11"
