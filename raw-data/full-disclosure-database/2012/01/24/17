If I have a VNC window somewhere on my desktop (in my case a virtual 
desktop or minimized), and continue with my work, 3 hours later when I 
work on some document or use some webapp, I don't remember that I have 
VNC session open and no, it's not obvious at all that this other host 
can read the communication between my local apps.

You misunderstood. The remote machine can see *any* clipboard entries, 
even if I do something entirely different in a completely different 
application. I am browsing or using SSH and paste my password there, 
because the FF password manager failed, or I'm in a word processor or 
email app and write some document, which is entirely unrelated to the 
VNC session. I haven't looked at the VNC host since hours (but I have it 
constantly open for tasks that I need to do with untrusted software in a 
jail).
