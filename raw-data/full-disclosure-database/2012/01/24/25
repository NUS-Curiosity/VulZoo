That is *precisely* what VNC is: an open-source IP KVM.

And please don't turn this into "you're stupid", because I've seen 
others with the same setup. As mentioned, I know of a government agency 
with highly competent IT staff who had a similar setup: normal and 
sensitive work is on the desktop/notebook and Internet access (which is 
considered insecure) is on a remote machine, with a viewer on the desktop.

To make it clear: I take offense in the copying being *automatic*. I 
have nothing against the clipboard feature, per se. But if something 
happens automatically, how am I supposed to know that it happens? The 
user should make a conscious choice. That thinking would also help him 
realize the risk. "Secure by default".
