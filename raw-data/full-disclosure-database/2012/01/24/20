I have done this, and I have understood the risks.

In my personal experience there was a case (a CDE - credit card data 
environment) where clipboard segregation between remote and local 
systems was a requirement. It was in this case that Citrix was chosen 
over other compteting 'remote-application' products because of a feature 
it had to disable the seamless clipboard functionality.

I think it is the case on whether this is a security issue depends on 
whether the VNC viewer in question is a fit tool for what you're using 
it for. Otherwise others may say it's a feature and not a bug, or at 
least your bug is my feature. I would see if you could ask them to have 
it as an optional feature though.

I would confirm that patch functions first - I found it in a thread 
regarding errors connecting to Mac OS X servers, and from the patch 
information, it may only stop the clipboard from server to client and 
not vice versa, but having seen it, I would imagine that you can find 
all the clipboard functions in the source and pretty much comment out 
their code.
