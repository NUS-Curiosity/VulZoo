Yes, I understand. It can be highly useful. That's why I proposed to 
make a "Paste" button in the main toolbar (probably with a keyboard 
shortcut, too). So, the user would have to press one more button / key 
(3 actions instead of 2) to for the information to travel to the remote 
host. Compared to the risk, I think that's an acceptable tradeoff.

Please tell me that you have never ever copied a password (or anything 
else highly sensitive) using the clipboard.

I guess what makes my case and the government agency case different is 
that for you and others, VNC is typically the primary focus, but here on 
my machine it's running all the time, I have several test machines with 
untrusted software running and connected *always*.
