No.

Expected result is to have the clipboard text sent to the remote
machine, if you have your client configured to do so. In a really
security sensitive environment you wouldn't be using the clipboard for
passwords anyway. Or you would disable clipboard sharing. Or you
wouldn't use a cleartext protocol to begin with.

You might as well report that if the user copies the password to the
clipboard at any other point during the session it also gets sent to
the server. I don't see why this should be the concern of the
developers of any VNC client.
