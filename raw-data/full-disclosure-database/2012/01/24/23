Subject: Using HTTP referer for phishing attacks

Hi,

Sorry if this is not new, but I didn't manage to find any mention of
such a technique.

In short: HTTP referer field contains information where the web user
is coming from, which is often a trusted site such as a web search.
Having such information, a malicious web site can use several tricks
to fool the user into thinking that he or she returned to the
referring site. In fact, the user is taken to a generic phishing site
that intercepts all data exchanged between the user, the referring
site and sites visited from the referring site.

More detailed write up with few examples is here:

Cheers,
Jan
