Yeah, you really weren't, you were telling us how you would have handled it, with all the buzzwords and terms you could have thought of.

Hell, I'm surprised you didn't manage to get the word 'synergy' in there.

" I would do a dns lookup and then compare those results to that of a public web service, and save the links for the AVs to check if they have any malicious history associated with them."

Reads like s bad Hollywood script

"First I would ping the phone number and see if I could telnet to the ICMP, then get the PTR of the MAC address and use an ARP overflow and spoof the TTL of the Window Size and..." (etc. etc.)

What are you suggesting; take a look at where the request is coming from and make a decision based on that whether the software is being punted by facebook or a third party?

Fine- just say that; make your suggestion and get on with your life. Its a little trite as advice goes, but if thats all you can contribute then go for it.

Coming in with your Marky-Mark talk of "First I'd get the first hijacker and use his head to kill the second hijacker and then I'd be all like 'yeah, lets land the plane here- let me drive'" is not very helpful
