Abstract:
=========
An anonymous researcher of the Vulnerability-Lab Team discovered multiple critical SQL Injection Vulnerabilities 
on the famous RheinMetalll AG Vendor, KSPG & Defense Website.

Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
Multiple SQl injection vulnerabilities are detected on the official website of Rheinmetall & RDefense. Remote attackers can 
execute own sql commands via injection to compromise the web server or the affected dbms. Successful exploitation can result 
in sensitive information steal by dumping all application web databases of the main , kspg & defense website.
