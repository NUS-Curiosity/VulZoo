Subject: Windows Phone App Analyser v1.0 releaed today

Hi,
I've released a small tool today called the Windows Phone App Analyser. The
first version is pretty basic but it should help people find security flaws
in Windows Phone apps with or without the soruce code.

The major features are listed below:

1) Analyse app source code and have keywords highlighted/explained which
might need further investigation from a security point of view.

2) Automatically decompile Windows Phone .xap application to easily analyse
the original source code

3) Launch and review results from third party scanning tools (CAT.NET,
FxCop and the capabilities detection tool in v1.0)

For more information on the changes in this release please visit this page:

You can download v1.0 of the Windows Phone App Analyser here:

Let me know what you think of it!

Dave
