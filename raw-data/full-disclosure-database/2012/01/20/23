Subject: Re: Facebook seems to think my Arch Linux box has
 malware on it

It turns out that it was a problem with firefox. However, I do not believe
I had any malicious addons or extensions for a few reasons. 1) I only had 4
extensions, adblock plus, pentadactyl, firebug, and noscript.
2) they were all vetted (presumably) by mozilla.

I believe, and this is simply speculation, that the problem may have been
caused by noscript stopping/interfering with some scripts on facebook.
Facebook would assume it was malware interfering with the site, and attempt
to block it. I am 99% sure my browser was not really compromised.

I'm going to try and reproduce it later.
