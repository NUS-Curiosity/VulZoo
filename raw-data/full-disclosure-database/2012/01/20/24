Subject: Re: Facebook seems to think my Arch Linux box has
 malware on it

Yeah good luck with reproducing it cause it REALLY sounds like a mitm or a
phishing attack trying to get people to download fake av. I would do a dns
lookup and then compare those results to that of a public web service, and
save the links for the AVs to check if they have any malicious history
associated with them.
