Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability Lab Team discovered  multiple persistent Web Vulnerabilities on Barracudas Spam & Virus Firewall 600 appliance application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-04-01:	Vendor Notification
2011-08-04:	Vendor Response/Feedback
2011-12-22:	Vendor Fix/Patch  by Check
2012-01-19:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Barracudas Spam & Virus Web Firewall 600. Local low privileged user account can
implement/inject malicious persistent script code. When exploited by an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities 
can lead to information disclosure, access to intranet available servers, manipulated persistent content.

Vulnerable Module(s): 
								[+] Trace route Device - Troubleshooting
								[+] LDAP Configuration - LDAP Username

Affected Version(s):
								[+] Barracuda Spam & Virus Firewall 600

Affected Firmware(s):
								[+] Firmware v4.0.1.009 & older versions

Picture(s):
								../ldap.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerabilities can be exploited by local low privileged user accounts with low required user inter action or 
by remote attackers with high required user inter action.

Manually Steps ...
1. Login to the Barracuda Application
2. Open the vulnerable area were the persistent vulnerability is located
3. Include/Insert your own script code or poc and save/execute the content to inject
4. View the injected results which were stored on application side. The code is getting executed in the  output section

Solution:
=========
2011-12-22:	Vendor Fix/Patch


Risk:
