 malware on it

Hello,

> “Your computer has malware!” Facebook says to me.

I am really curious to know, assuming that everything you've said is
accurate, how they determine you've got malware. This is rather curious.

The more I think about it, the more I wonder if something's come between
you and facebook pretending to be official, hoping to trick you into
downloading something.

Cheers
