 malware on it

You, use, too, many, commas, like, Jim, Kirk, "A".

But yes, I say THEY are malware :P
You'd be forgiven for thinking I'm talking about FB but FB have /no/ /way/
to /know/ you have or have not got malware.
Especially on your excellent Arch.

Sounds about time you did some DNS- / extension- / snarfing- / crack-
busting!

I'm sure whatever you find you'll tell us.
Party on.
