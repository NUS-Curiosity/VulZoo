 Service

Hi,

You already have a good reputation as a bug-finder.
IMHO, releasing additional research in a hurry like this can only
tarnish that reputation and feed the trolls.
Providing a kernel stack trace ( http://imgur.com/klC4k ) or a more
reliable PoC can't take more than an hour, and it will greatly enhance
the quality of the report.

If you are worried several people has founded a particular bug and
publication is imminent, then maybe was not such a great find to begin
with :)
