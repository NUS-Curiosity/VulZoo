Subject: Re: Nmap

(I don't have the original, so ill qoute this guy)

Nmap has an option to change how it determines if a host is up by
attempting a port connection instead. I find this to be highly effective.
Using a couple of standard ports are the best, such as 80, 21, etc. If you
only have a few ports your searching for, then drop host discovery and scan
those specific ports, youd get the same results but a tad bit less
overhead(mainly in the sense of stealth or an obsession with not wasting
bandwidth if you can help it)
