Subject: facebook

anyone else notice the apps.facebook.com/<whatever> tend to be prone to sql
vulns? ie,
https://apps.facebook.com/worldwide_dev/ while not logged in, and
https://apps.facebook.com/worldwide_dev/%00

Due to them being apps, facebook I believe is not responsible for any
security issues, but in this case there is no dev listed. odd.
