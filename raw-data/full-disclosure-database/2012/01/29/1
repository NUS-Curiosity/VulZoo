Subject: google permit to remove the pictures from your
 blog if you link your gmail account with an android mobile phone

Could sound not so useful...fancy... what you want...

but

if you link a gmail account with a blog... on an android mobile phone...
and you visit for the first time your blog... they save only your blog post
pictures/screenshot in the gallery section of your android mobile phone...
after that if you deletes from the gallery section.... they also delete
from your blog... interesting doesn't it ?

thank you very much Google!

For the confirm please follow here...
