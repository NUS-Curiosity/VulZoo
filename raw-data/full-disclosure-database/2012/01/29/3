So why bother with album sales in the first place?

This is the same with free/commercial software. At the end of the day
the creator decides
the sales strategy.


The only thing I can see in this is that the recording industry really
needs to grow up
to the times, but piracy is not a solution nor the means to one, just
like DDoSing facebook
is not the means to the removal of a certain bill/law (arguably, to
the contrary).

The recording companies have every right to retaliate just as the FBI
has every right to
arrest suspects involved in these childish acts.
