Metallica used to encourage fans to record "bootlegs" and share with those 
who didnt/wouldnt/couldnt attend the shows. Now look at them:-( Metallica 
sucks btw ever since their heads got to big to fit up thier asses. This was 
around the time Cliff died. The way they treated  Jason Newsted was just 
plain wrong, but thats another subject...

I see I sparked a major debate which is what I was looking for but no one 
has addressed the fact that the feds will do what they want. By enacting 
laws we can be sure of the boundries they can/will cross. ( I know, everyone 
will still find ways to steal) I think google and such should be held 
accountable for encouraging the acts. I forsee Kimble doing Mitnick time...

Im all for PIPA in a modified form. Im not running 65000 servers that are 
based near Langley. Only a tool shats in the FBI's backyard and doesnt bring 
a bag to clean it up or at least cover it.

Im filling papers to patent 1's and 0's. Just like the guy a few years back 
who tried to patent the wheel... Its futile but i will get free publicity.

bma

Dear Valdis and whoever else;

The really ridiculous points are the following:
A) Every time you execute/install/download a program you are
committing evil data theft by not only copying
"secret" or "illegal" information into
RAM/Disk/Registers/Buffers/Busses/photons coming off the screen/human
memory/history of the universe but potentially not just your physical
property but on hundreds of routers and deduplication boxen around the
earth.
B) You can't "copyright" or "own" a number, all digital
representations are numbers, due to the boolean nature (no fuzzy
data), etc.
C) Any data is a form of any other data given a specific transform,
e.g. manifold / encryption key + algo, something as trivial as XOR
D) You guys already know these points so why do we even care anymore
about what these people say? Why even have these conversations. They
will never stop. It's about greed and shortsightedness, not about what
is moral or logical. Just try to ignore them or change the subject
when the parrots start talking.

And to preempt the flames from the blind, Yes I feel artists should be
compensated for their contribution. It's 5am- bye.
