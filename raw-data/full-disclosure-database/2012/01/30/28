Hi there,

You may first need identify the purpose of using it.

   - If you want to collect malwares exploiting Windows vulnerabilities,
   you've Nepenthes which is a low-interaction honeypot. It can be easily
   installed in Debian from the official repo.
   - If you're looking something to detect intrusion in a production
   environment, you've Honeyd (even this is available as a Debian package)
   - For something more specific, like capturing live ssh sessions, you may
   use Kippo. It stores the logs in UML format that can be played back on a
   later stage using tools like Ajaxterm. You even get a separate copy of the
   tools and bots they download using wget.
   - Glastopf is another good high interaction honeypot with a nice
   vulnerability emulator. Although, you need patience and some SEO to get
   best results out of it.

I hope this helps.

Regards,
Vipul
