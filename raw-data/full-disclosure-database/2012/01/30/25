In terms of SSH honeypots Kojoney (http://kojoney.sourceforge.net/) is
very good but is sort of abandoned, so be prepared to do your own
customization.  I hear very good things about Kippo
(https://code.google.com/p/kippo/) as well.  For HTTP I ran Glastopf
(http://glastopf.org/) for a while but never got any good results.
