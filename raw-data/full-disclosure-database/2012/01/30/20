Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in bip might allow remote unauthenticated
attackers to cause a Denial of Service or possibly execute arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

bip is a multi-user IRC proxy with SSL support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/bip                 < 0.8.8-r1               >= 0.8.8-r1 

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in bip:

* Uli Schlachter reported that bip does not properly handle invalid
data during authentication, resulting in a daemon crash
(CVE-2010-3071).
* Julien Tinnes reported that bip does not check the number of open
file descriptors against FD_SETSIZE, resulting in a stack buffer
overflow (CVE-2012-0806).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the bip daemon,
or cause a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All bip users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/bip-0.8.8-r1"

NOTE: The CVE-2010-3071 flaw was already corrected in an earlier
version of bip and is included in this advisory for completeness.
