Subject: Re: p0f3 release candidate

So just for the record, version 3.00 is now officially out:
http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p03/. Many thanks to countless people who
submitted signatures and bug fixes, including:

  Phil Ames
  Jason DePriest
  Dalibor Dukic
  Mark Martinec
  Damien Miller
  Nibbler
  Bernhard Rabe
  Chris John Riley
  Sebastian Roschke
  Peter Valchev
  Jeff Weisberg

I won't be spamming the list with any further updates on p0f, but this
being a major rewrite after ~6 years, I thought it makes sense to let
people know - especially since the previous version is used in quite a
few abuse detection / monitoring / pentesting frameworks.
