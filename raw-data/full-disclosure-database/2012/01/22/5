DoS attacks by using Exploit Pack
What is this? Exploit Pack is a next generation tool to assist you 
while you perform penetration testing to your workstations or servers.
Make your workstation safe by testing its security. Before hackers do.

Take a look of this tool while we perform a denial of service to a test
