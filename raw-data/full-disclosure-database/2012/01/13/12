It's obvious that all analogies are bad -- the Internet is a reality
onto itself and cannot, but more importantly *should* not be compared
to the physical "3d" reality. Internet has no law of gravity for
instance, and certainly no garages.

Please, just focus on what is relevant. Perhaps even take one step
further back to determine what actually is relevant first. Stop
comparing it to arbitrary things. No one lives in a server, so it's
certainly not a house.
