Unless you're a complete fool, yes.  You say you're helping me, but you 
broke in to my server.  How do I know you didn't help yourself to a 
permanent back door?

Again, it's naive to think that most people are motivated purely by a 
desire to help others, especially when they are actively intruding into 
other people's assets.

YOU might say thank you, but I'll be taking the server offline, grabbing 
forensic images and rebuilding it long before I get around to saying thank 
you.
