Would you say that we should arrest the person who walks into the
house, takes a picture of themselves standing next to an expensive
television and leaves the picture next to a note that says "your door
was unlocked?"

Really though, it is still a terrible analogy.  You can disconnect a
computer from the Internet; you cannot disconnect a building from a
street.  A hacker in a foreign country might be attacking your computer
system from that country, and could be outside the jurisdiction of any
relevant law enforcement agency; a person who breaks into a building is
committing a crime in whatever jurisdiction the building is in.

Analogies are nice and they help non-technical folks understand what
is going on, but let's not get carried away with them. Someone who
attacks a computer system over the Internet (or any other network) is
sending unwanted/malicious messages.  This is not the same as physically
breaking into a building, locker, or computer. It may be illegal, but
it is still very different from other crimes.  If anything, the closest
type of criminal would be a con man, which seems fitting given how many
of today's attacks have an element of social engineering.
