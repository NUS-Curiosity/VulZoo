yeah, it would still be an offence in most country.

the crime would still be a crime in the country where the building/computer
is located, you just can't get the offender prosecuted, just like if he
would flee the country after trespassing into your house.

why is it different? the only difference imo is that the whole
IT/networking stuff is relatively new, and the law was lagging behind, and
some people still that it is, when it isn't really anymore.
you can get the same amount of fine/years in prison whether you stole the
money/confidential info through physical or electronical means.

nope.
of course social engineering can be compared to Confidence trick, because
it is a Confidence trick.
but social engineering is only one vulnerability from the many, and usually
it is used together with other methods (you get the credentials using that,
then you proceed and access the system using those credentials, which is
the gaining unauthorized access to the system.
