Bzzzt.  Bad analogy.  A better one would be noticing your neighbor's garage 
door is open, walking across the street, entering the garage and rummaging 
around in his belongings.

I suspect at least some of your neighbors would take offense to that and 
ask you what you think you're doing.  And if they wanted to press charges 
for trespass, you'd likely go to jail.
