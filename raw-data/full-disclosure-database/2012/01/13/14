Except that we do not arrest people for every violation of the law; if
we did, almost the entire population would have to be arrested.  We do
not even convict every guilty person e.g. abolitionists who were
acquitted despite having clearly broken fugitive slave laws prior to the
civil war.  Intent is an important part of criminal cases, and courts
do at least try to do what is in the best interests of society.

Are society's interests really served by arresting people who point out
security problems?  I suppose that it is a matter of debate and that we
could discuss ad infinitum what the appropriate way to bring attention
to a vulnerability or exploit might be.

Except that in this case, the offender was never physically present in
the country where the computer is located.  Suppose I criticize the
Thai monarchy from my desk here in Virginia; I have violated the laws of
Thailand, but I am not in Thailand, and the situation would be no
different if I were to email the offending statement to someone who is
located in Thailand.  What analogy would you draw there?  That I spat
on the faces of people in the Thai royal family, then fled the country
and hid in Virginia?

Suppose I download a database of customer records, complete with bank
account information.  Have I stolen something?  No, I have not, aside
from a tiny about of bandwidth and electrical power.  If this were not
a different sort of crime, there would be no need to pass laws to
criminalize it; yet that is exactly what we did.  Having a confidential
document in your possession is not theft, nor is downloading the
document from a computer system.  What you do with the confidential
document is what matters.

Given a database of credit card numbers, someone can do a variety of
things.  You could make unauthorized, fraudulent payments with the
credit accounts.  You could print it out and make some wallpaper.  You
could just let it sit on your hard drive.  Some of these things are
clearly criminal without any special computer crimes laws, while others
one would be hard-pressed to call immoral (is it really immoral to
simply have credit card numbers on your hard drive?).

I did not say that it was the same as a confidence trick, I said it was
similar.  Con men do not use force (usually), they just dress
themselves up a certain way and say the right things to convince people
to lower their defenses.  Cracking computer security systems (without
social engineering -- with social engineering, you basically are a con
man) is similar in that you are simply sending the right combination of
messages to a computer system to get to it do something it would not
normally do. Perhaps you spoof an address, or send a message that would
normally be sent by an user that was authorized, or send messages too
quickly, or send messages that are too big, or send messages from many
different sources, or send a message with an unknown format, or
politely ask some other computer or user to send messages for you --
all things that are common in confidence tricks (with a little
adjustment in terminology).
