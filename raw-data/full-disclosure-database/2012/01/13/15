Subject: Re: Rate Stratfor's Incident Response

No one lives in a server, but the server certainly occupies space somewhere. Even a VM runs in a physical space somewhere. If someone attacks my server in my home, I think of that as physically being in my home. If someone were to hack into my daughters webcam, and enable it to view her, I would certainly consider that the EXACT same as being in my house, on my property. And said person would incur the same fathers wrath as any other boy who attempted such a thing.

Father has baseball bats (the 3 B's of being a father) and this father has other more powerful weapons to defend his family with.

The people out there willing to do harm remotely should not forget that there are officers of the law who will come knocking with a very real physical presence, even though the attacker was in a "virtual" world.

That's just one fathers take on things.

It's obvious that all analogies are bad -- the Internet is a reality onto itself and cannot, but more importantly *should* not be compared to the physical "3d" reality. Internet has no law of gravity for instance, and certainly no garages.

Please, just focus on what is relevant. Perhaps even take one step further back to determine what actually is relevant first. Stop comparing it to arbitrary things. No one lives in a server, so it's certainly not a house.
