So the attacker, hoping to keep his backdoor, will tell you about the
vulnerability he exploited that you were presumably not aware of, and
then hope that the system is not audited?

Of course you are going to audit the system that was attacked.  Not
because you fear the person who reported the problem, but because there
is an exploitable vulnerability that anyone could have exploited.
