And? I'm talking about the simple fact that the producer has the right
to earn money from his creation. Copyright is just a tool.

Exactly. So, in your own words, producers are at a loss.

Oh come on. Who are you trying to feed that to?
You know damn well current court cases target 'copyright infringement'
for non-personal use....such as copying such material and selling it for
profit.

Why don't you just admit many people out there are afraid of loosing
their little racket?

Can you prove that a company/group can live on by handing out free copies
of their song on the internet? How many companies out there do that?

Lets turn this to a different parallel issue, open source. Last I checked,
income for opensource projects tend to come from one of the following:
- advertisements
- paid support
- training

How many such activities play well with records companies?
