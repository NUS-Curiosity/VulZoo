the shop can supplement the stolen CD for much less than 14.99, and
also manufacturing a cd cost much less.
the price not only contains the material value of the given product,
but it is an arbitrary number, which was calculated based on the cost
of the production(and marketing, and shipping, and etc.) costs of the
product, and on the demand and pricing of that kind of product, so
basically the market.

the difference with the digital goods that there is no material part
of the package, so it could seem that there is no theft and no loss of
revenue.
which could be true, if only those would pirate, who otherwise
wouldn't/couldn't buy the product, which imo is not true.
