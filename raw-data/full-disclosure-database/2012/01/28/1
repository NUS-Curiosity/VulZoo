You might want to go read "Courtney Love Does The Math", and then ask yourself
the following:

1) You can make a case that if you copy an album intead of buying it, you're
depriving somebody of profits.  But what if it's an album that you would *not*
have bought at full price anyhow?  Or one that you bought used (see "first sale
principle")?

2) Who gets those profits, the artist, the label, or the RIAA?  Are you
stealing profits from the artist, or are you stealing them from somebody else
who was attemting to steal them from the artist?
