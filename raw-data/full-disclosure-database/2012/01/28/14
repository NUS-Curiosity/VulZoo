Except that there are plenty of legal and unquestionably ethical
situations where things are copied without any transfer of value to the
original creator.  Nothing is created in a vacuum; musicians are
inspired by other musicians, film makers by other film makers, authors
by authors, etc.  Nobody is so original that they can claim that their
creative work did not borrow ideas from other creative work.

Moreover, even copying a work in its entirety may fall under fair use;
when was the last time you paid royalties for the use of the Happy
Birthday song?

This is not as clear-cut as one might think.  Musicians make a lot of
money doing live shows, and a live show is an experience that cannot be
downloaded.  Attendance at live shows is driven by the popularity of
the musicians, which is increased by downloading as much as it is
increased by radio broadcasting, if not more.  One of the major
criticisms of Metallica's lawsuit against Napster users was that in
their early days, Metallica became popular because people would record
them at their concerts and distribute the recordings.

The way I see it, the way we cling to copyrights and try to protect
industries that were built on the copyright system when we now have
computers and computer networks is equivalent to hiring scribes and
protecting their jobs in an age of printing presses.  Copyrights were a
great idea back when copying creative works required specialized
industrial equipment.  Since that is no longer the case, we should
instead be investigating new systems for promoting art and science and
building new industries around such systems.  Copyrights are not going
to die overnight, just like scribes continued to be employed for some
time after the printing press spread, but eventually copyrights are
going to die -- or else computers and global computer networks are
going to have to die.  I doubt that technology can be rolled back, but
creating a new legal framework does not seem to be infeasible.
