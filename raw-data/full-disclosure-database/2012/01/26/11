Subject: Re: DNS bind attacks

Other than the fact they may somehow notice this and start trying to
autoban sites you should be fine. Since he is spoofing it would be hard for
him to tell without trying it out on a box he controls. If anything gets
autobanned you really need then just whitelist it, if you can think of such
places before hand then go ahead and whitelist them now.

Just be aware in case its not a ddos but really part of some exploit of
sorts, as owning a bind server is obviously very appealing. Now if any
would be a good time to do a double check on your security measures but in
all likelihood it seems like a fairly weak attack and your measures should
be fine.

That or we are both missing some glaring piece of information.
