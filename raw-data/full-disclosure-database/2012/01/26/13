Yes this is correct information at least with new versions of WordPress. We are running pretty big Linux-server in our organization and I can tell you that open "install me" -pages are very common and I see these as problem.

I can try to find out what went wrong with the installation or did they remove the WordPress-installation and didn't understand to remove everything included. I really hope to see this patched anyways just to be sure. I don't know what the actual impact in user-experience can be. Could WordPress comment?
