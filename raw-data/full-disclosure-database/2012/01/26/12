"conspiracy theory"?? "let's just say"??

That happens. It is, say, a fact.

Wrong.

Corporations do whatever they please, and that is achieved through
propaganda, which in turn, prepares the masses to think they are being
asked "nicely".

Yes, it's getting internationally worst. Search for ACTA.

One crackdown we're living in. Goal is: keeping knowledge away from the people.

Not the people as a whole (which would be ideal) but a small part of

That is not democracy but a rotten representative system. Masses were
taught to accept it as fair.

Man, why you keep separating "officials" from "interest groups"? They
are the same thing. SAME THING.

Naivety detected.

Conglomerates' propaganda indoctrinates most of the people to see
