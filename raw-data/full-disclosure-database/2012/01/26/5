Given that I'm *still* waiting for him to carry through with his repeated
threats to sue me for a BlackHat 2006 presentation that I didn't even write, I
wouldn't worry too much about Andrew's lawyers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoppel_by_acquiescence
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations (see period of prescription)

(Andrew - I'd avoid saying your lawyers are looking at the thread, unless you
actually *do* have lawyers looking. You just set the clock ticking on an
acquiescence defense or a period of prescription)

And I've always wondered exactly who/what the "n3td3v organization" is - there
doesn't seem to be a consultancy doing actual business under that name, or
other legal entity that would have standing in a libel suit.  Who/what gets
listed as plaintiff?

(You may as well tell us Andrew - if we don't know who "the n3td3v organization"
is, we can't make an attempt to avoid accidentally libeling it. :)
