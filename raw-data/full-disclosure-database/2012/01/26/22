Subject: Re: DNS bind attacks

Your theory's likely correct - do you allow external IPs to make recursive queries to your server? 

>>From (this would be a way to corroborate & I can't say it any better): http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nanog/users/143319

"The isc.org record is commonly used in reflection attacks because the size of the record is so large, so the amplification factor is greatly increased. Can you check to see if +edns=0 was set in the query? That would be a sure sign this is related... "
