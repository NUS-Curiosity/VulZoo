- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Netware. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the xnfs.nlm component which is used when
handling NFS RPC requests. This process listens on UDP port 32779. When
decoding the xdr encoded caller_name from an NLM_TEST procedure request
the process uses the user supplied length as the bounds for its copy to
a stack buffer. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the system.
