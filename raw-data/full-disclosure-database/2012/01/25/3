hihi. Thanks.

"It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to 
another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other 
direction, over a network."
"The VNC protocol (RFB) is very simple, based on one graphic primitive 
from server to client ('Put a rectangle of pixel data at the specified 
X,Y position') and event messages from client to server."

Compare to above.

Now, the part where it defines that clipboard is also a standard part of 
VNC... oh, huch, it's not there! (Just a random note that Unicode is 
impossible, but not that clipboard is defined as part of the protocol at 
all.) Ah, I know... Surely, it must be on 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFB_protocol>... No, same thing there. 
Strange.

So much for the lulz...

Ben

P.S. I was just reporting bug. I hope at least some software finds a 
better solution. Have fun.
