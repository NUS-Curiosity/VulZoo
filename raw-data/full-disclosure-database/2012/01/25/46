Subject: Re: Megaupload Anonymous hacker retaliation,
 nobody wins

On a personal note, maybe OFF...

I fail to see the gain in such retaliations, especially in organized 
ones... First the Megaupload retaliation, now the UN... and for what... 
I know people want to be heard, but this is plainly sending the wrong 
message.

This will give decision makers EXACTLY what they WANT. They coax 
otherwise smart people into acting out violently, thereby creating just 
the false-flag "anarchy" to prove their point, which is: "yes, we need 
to censor and control everything especially the Internet, because see, 
there's already a 'war out there at the gates and we need to protect 
etc. whatever'". We've seen it before countless times and this reverse 
strategy almost always works.

If anyone from the "responsible" groups are reading this, please know 
that I'm not against the point that you are trying to make... You are 
all learned and knowledgable people, otherwise you wouldn't have been 
able to pull this complicated scheme off... but I implore you to 
reconsider such outbursts in the future for the sake of the very thing 
that you are trying to protect... What's done is done, but let's not 
give these goons one more reason to take away freedom even more so... 
Please. Just consider this. That's all I'm asking... And I guess that's 
all I wanted to say.
