Feature or bug, vnc or ip kvm, the same behavior has a virtual box virtualized machine with shared clipboard. You can choose disabled, direction and bidirectional (by default)

Something to keep in mind, at least the beginners like me.

Just run in the guest and see your clipboard, sure there are more elegant ways of doing the same. (tested linux in linux with virtual box and linux in mac with vmware)

while true; do
  xsel -p
  echo
  xsel -s
  echo
  xsel -b
  echo
done
