Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on the powered by Acolyte v1.5 v6.3 CMS.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to execute sql commands via remote sql injection attack.
The bug is located on the news_comments & plugin_forum module of the content management system. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attacker to compromise the application & dbms.


Vulnerable Module(s): (v1.5.3)
					[+] ?c=plugin&plugin=forums
					[+] ?c=news_comments

Vulnerable Module(s): (v1.6.3)
					[+] ?c=news_comments
					[+] ?c=forum_post
