Subject: Re: VNC viewers: Clipboard of host automatically
 sent to remote machine

and stupidly, you forgot to addin the second PRIVT post i sent you,
saying i meant *insecure :)
now, go try tell me windows vnc is secure again...and, then setup a
vnc on your box, and, under win32, try your best, when your ready,
yell out, so i can make a compete fucking fool of ya.
ok ?
if this is how you want to play, i am challenging you, if i can own a
shitty windows setup you 'secure' as best you8 can, here on fd, is
this trolling is it ?
its a challenge... maybe, if you read the lame rfb and, pixelisation
via IP KVM, unfortunately for windows, it aint any different, a pixel
is placed at X or Y, and, you can place data calls to it, from server
wich, could be, my bot :)
want more proof,...keep going with my challenge then.
