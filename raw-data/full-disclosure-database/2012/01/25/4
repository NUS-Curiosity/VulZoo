what Dan was trying to point out to you was the vast difference in
attack surface between an IP KVM and the VNC protocol and
architecture.

IP KVM: keyboard, video, mouse interface to physical ports. dumb dumb dumb.

VNC: not so simple full of bugs year after year privileged service
running on host hooking into various OS facilities and exposing all
sorts of vulnerabilities between server and client. sma^H^H^H^H stupid
stupid stupid (from a security perspective)

if you believe these present *precisely* the same risk profile,
well... can i have some of what you're smoking?

let me spell it out: your precise equivalency between a KVM device and
a VNC service is neither accurate nor correct.
