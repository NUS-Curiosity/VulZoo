There is A LOT of these open installation pages in the Internet. It is not uncommon to leave those open by accident. Some people also do this, because they just don't understand the risks. I am wondering if WordPress would apply patch if we create one as a collaborative effort. I would be more than happy to help creating a patch for this if this is the case.
