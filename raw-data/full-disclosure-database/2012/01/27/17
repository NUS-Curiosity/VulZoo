 freedom

You want to be very careful with that line of thought. You are taking the creator the rightful owners profits, which they are entitled to if it is a product they created to be sold. You are confusing what you want - with what the law states. Theft is typically very widely defined in the law, not just what the dictionary states.

When you make a copy, you are performing a step that the manufacturer takes with physical products. Just because copying software is easy does not mean the laws are so cut and dried around what is theft and what is not. If you take something by making yourself a copy, when the producer is the only authorized authority to make copies then you have committed theft.

You also cannot steal electricity, check out "Abstracting Electricity", but bypassing the meter is wrong in most jurisdictions.

In the US you can be arrested and charged for riding in a stolen car, even if you really didn't know it was stolen, known as "taking without consent" or TWOC.

In some jurisdictions you can be arrested and charged for "going equipped for burglary" mean you have implements of the trade on you - crowbars, lock picks etc. So I suppose in the US we are fortunate that having a copy of some previously defined hacking tools on a computer in our possession will not get us arrested - yet.
