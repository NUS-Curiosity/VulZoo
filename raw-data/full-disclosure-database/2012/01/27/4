Subject: Fw: when did piracy/theft become expression of
	freedom

when you enter piracy into google the 1st link is the piratebay...

dictionary.com-
1. practice of a pirate; robbery or illegal violence at sea. 
2. the unauthorized reproduction or use of a copyrighted book, recording, television program, patented invention, trademarked product, etc.: The record industry is beset with piracy. 
3. Also called stream capture. Geology . diversion of the upper part of one stream by the headward growth of another. 

Software copying doesnt come into play in this definition, that's an entity of its own. I copy software to make a backup. I do not profit from it therefore it's neither piracy or theft. Once I sell it then its theft, copyright infringement, piracy...

piratebay is the next on the list. The US gave all fair warning and encouraged the use of laws to help thwart this problem. So everyones panties got in a bunch so the government did as they pleased with the help of foreign interests. The balls of mega.... to use servers in VA right in the FBI's backyard. Kimble is a tool, always has been.
