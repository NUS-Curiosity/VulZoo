Synopsis
========

A double-free flaw in Logsurfer allows a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Logsurfer is a real time log monitoring and analysis tool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/logsurfer+          &lt; 1.8                       &gt;= 1.8

Description
===========

Logsurfer log files may contain substrings used for executing external
commands. The prepare_exec() function in src/exec.c contains a
double-free vulnerability.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could inject specially-crafted strings into a log
file processed by Logsurfer, resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the permissions of the Logsurfer user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Logsurfer users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
&quot;&gt;=app-admin/logsurfer+-1.8&quot;

References
==========
