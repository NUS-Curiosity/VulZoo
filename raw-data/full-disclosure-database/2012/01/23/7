	Write-up

Hey Mark,

For the longest time /proc/pid/mem writing was ifdef'd out. Then for
the 2.6.39 kernel release, they deemed that the work they'd been doing
to make the writing interface secure was strong enough, so they
included the ability to write [1]. So versions before 2.6.39 are not
vulnerable, and after it (until 3.3, I guess) are. Hope this
clarifies.

Jason
