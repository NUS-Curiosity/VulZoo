Nice writeup. They should have known to comment out is bad thing, they
already received exploit demo 2011 when fixing CVE-2011-1020

http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/SuidBinariesAndProcInterface/

If /procc/[pid]/mem would be writeable on standard linux kernels, this
program should give local root privilege escalation (SeekHelper.c),
e.g. ./SeekHelper /proc/self/mem 8048000 /usr/bin/sudoedit -p xxx
/etc/sudoers with a crafted address and promt payload. Currently
something else is still blocking in kernel, could be fs/proc/base.c
