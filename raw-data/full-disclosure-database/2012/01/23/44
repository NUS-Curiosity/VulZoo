Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Tor, the most severe of
which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/tor                < 0.2.2.35               >= 0.2.2.35

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tor:

* When configured as client or bridge, Tor uses the same TLS
  certificate chain for all outgoing connections (CVE-2011-2768).
* When configured as a bridge, Tor relays can distinguish incoming
  bridge connections from client connections (CVE-2011-2769).
* An error in or/buffers.c could result in a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2011-2778).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code or cause a
Denial of Service. Furthermore, a remote relay the user is directly
connected to may be able to disclose anonymous information about that
user or enumerate bridges in the user's connection.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.2.2.35"
