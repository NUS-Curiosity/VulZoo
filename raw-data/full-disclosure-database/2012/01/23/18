Synopsis
========

Format string vulnerabilities in iSCSI Enterprise Target could result
in execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

iSCSI Enterprise Target is an open source iSCSI target with
professional features.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-block/iscsitarget        < 1.4.19                  >= 1.4.19

Description
===========

Multiple functions in usr/iscsi/isns.c of iSCSI Enterprise Target
contain format string errors.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted Internet Storage Name
Service (iSNS) request, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with root privileges or cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All iSCSI Enterprise Target users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-block/iscsitarget-1.4.19"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since August 11, 2010. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
