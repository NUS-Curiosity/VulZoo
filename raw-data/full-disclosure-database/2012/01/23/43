Synopsis
========

Insecure temporary file usage in Firewall Builder could allow attackers
to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

Firewall Builder is a GUI for easy management of multiple firewall
platforms.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-firewall/fwbuilder       < 3.0.7                    >= 3.0.7

Description
===========

Two vulnerabilities in Firewall Builder allow the iptables and
fwb_install scripts to use temporary files insecurely.

Impact
======

A local attacker could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the
privileges of the user running Firewall Builder.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Firewall Builder users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-firewall/fwbuilder-3.0.7"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since March 09, 2010. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
