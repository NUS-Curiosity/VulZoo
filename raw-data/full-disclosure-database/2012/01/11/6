If you guys cant scan for basic sql injection and these kids can then 
theres a real problem, thats my point here. The attacks are so simple 
children can do it and the so called experts arent finding them or just 
arent looking so im not sure if its incompetence or apathy behind these 
high profile hacks, you can teach these kids the same skillsets the so 
called experts have, but you cant teach incompetent people to be 
competent as its a willful mindset to not learn new things, and theres 
no solution for apathy other than hiring someone who cares.  These kids 
have the motivation to learn new things and the energy to apply them. 
Something the people they are owning lack sorely. As the ancient proverb 
says "Set a thief to catch a thief"
