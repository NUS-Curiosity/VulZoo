Are you proposing that we reward all such behavior with jobs? I've
always wanted to be a firefighter. Forget resumes, job applications
and interviews, I'm going to set people's houses on fire. By your
logic, an arsonist is not only the best person to combat other
arsonists, but due to his obviously unique insight into the nature of
fire, simply must know how best to fight a fire as opposed to someone
who went to school for years to learn the trade.

This is asinine. WHY would I want to hire someone for a position of
trust that just committed a crime, or at the very least acted in an
unethical manner? More than anything, that person has proven that
while he *might* have the technical chops, he certainly lacks the
ethics and decision making skills to operate in the grown-up world.
