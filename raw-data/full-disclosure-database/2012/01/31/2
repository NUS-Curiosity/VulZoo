I reported it on gentoo bugzilla, but trusting upstream advisory, since gentoo 
compiles as default with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, seems unaffected.

However, upstream advisory and joernchen advisory seems not the same.

The first says:
adding -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 to the OSDEFS line in src/Makfile and rebuilding 
sudo will prevent the bug from being exploited.

The second says:
he above example shows the result of FORTIFY_SOURCE which makes explotitation 
painful but not impossible (see [0]). Without FORTIFY_SOURCE the exploit is 
straight forward.

something should be corrected?
