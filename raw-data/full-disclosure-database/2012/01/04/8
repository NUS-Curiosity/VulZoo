It was discovered that the foomatic-filters, a support package for
setting up printers, allowed authenticated users to submit crafted
print jobs which would execute shell commands on the print servers.

CVE-2011-2697 was assigned to the vulnerability in the Perl
implementation included in lenny, and CVE-2011-2964 to the
vulnerability affecting the C reimplementation part of squeeze.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-20080211-3.2+lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your foomatic-filters packages.
