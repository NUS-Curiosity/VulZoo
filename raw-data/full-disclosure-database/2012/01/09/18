I was working at coreix when we took down the original C&C and have icq numbers, source and logs.

What's your point? I'm sure its good work but this was all done over a year ago and is on copies in a police store room somewhere.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Who's Behind the Koobface Botnet? - An OSINT
	Analysis

Hi everyone,

In this post, I will perform an OSINT analysis, exposing one of the
key botnet masters behind the infamous Koobface botnet, that I have
been extensively profiling and infiltrating since day one. I will
include photos of the botnet master, his telephone numbers, multiple
email addresses, license plate for a BMW, and directly connect him
with the infrastructure -- now offline or migrated to a different
place -- of Koobface 1.0.

The analysis is based on a single mistake that the botnet master made
- namely using his personal email for registering a domain parked
within Koobface's command and control infrastructure, that at a
particular moment in time was directly redirecting to the ubiquitous
fake Youtube page pushed by the Koobface botnet.
