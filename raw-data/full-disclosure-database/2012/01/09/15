Subject: Who's Behind the Koobface Botnet? - An OSINT
	Analysis

Hi everyone,

In this post, I will perform an OSINT analysis, exposing one of the
key botnet masters behind the infamous Koobface botnet, that I have
been extensively profiling and infiltrating since day one. I will
include photos of the botnet master, his telephone numbers, multiple
email addresses, license plate for a BMW, and directly connect him
with the infrastructure -- now offline or migrated to a different
place -- of Koobface 1.0.

The analysis is based on a single mistake that the botnet master made
- namely using his personal email for registering a domain parked
within Koobface's command and control infrastructure, that at a
particular moment in time was directly redirecting to the ubiquitous
fake Youtube page pushed by the Koobface botnet.
