Subject: [SE-2011-01] Additional materials released for
	SAT TV research


Hello All,

We have decided to release additional information about security
issues discovered as part of our digital satellite TV research.

This additional publication is done in a response to continuous
inquiries received regarding SE-2011-01 project.

Cumulative reports containing detailed vulnerability information
as originally reported to set-top-box manufacturer, DVB chipsets
vendor and Conax CAS vendor are available for download from the
following address:

http://www.security-explorations.com/en/SE-2011-01-details.html

Most of the issues described in these reports should have been
already addressed. We don't have any official confirmation of
the above though as the vendors have not been responding to our
status update / impact related inquiries for months [1].

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
