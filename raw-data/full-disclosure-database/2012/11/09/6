Mr BaconZombie, first of all, greetings, it's an amazing rainy friday in
Buenos Aires.

Your signature is awesome as well, and makes it really hard to respond,
and read, I like it.

You are sending the long string as status update, *you have to send it
as a message in the chat,
the addressee user will eventually be disconnected. *

Since there's no limit in the amount of characters that you can send in
a message and the application will push as much as you send,
the user browser pulling the information will get a huge amount of data
in no time,
crashing in diverse ways.

 I hope you have fun, and a great weekend;
 Sincerely yours; Chris C. Russo
