I couldn't tell, I started up with 1,000 chars and increased 1,000 by
1,000 until 100,000 with parallel connections. But certainly, even if
you only full the text input using the regular UI from facebook, you'll
crash any regular box, or tablet.
Perhaps you should try with 1 Gb tho and see what happens, there's test
users you can create from the facebook.com/whitehat.
