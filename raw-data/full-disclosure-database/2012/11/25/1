Subject: One packet OS fingerprinting feature in SinFP3

Hi list,

The latest version of SinFP3 (v1.20) introduces two  new  cool  features:  the
ability to perform a SYN scan and doing OS fingerprinting at  the  same  time.
The idea is to use SYN|ACK answers to the SYN scanning  process  to  acurately
identify the remote operating system nature.  The  second  new  feature  is  a
server  mode  allowing  third-party  applications   to   access   the   SinFP3
fingerprinting engine. We also created a new output plugin to display  results
in a simpler manner than in previous versions of SinFP3.
