Hi chort!

I'm glad that you liked this XSS in swfupload (in different flash-files of
it). If you like vulnerabilities in flash applications, then feel free to
look at all those flash related holes, which I've published for last five
years. Since Persistent XSS in Invision Power Board, which I've found at
12.12.2007, and till last holes in multiple web applications with swfupload.

XSS via swf-files it's just XSS, nothing new :-) (I'm posting reflected and
persistent XSS and CS via flash for five years). Just revealing new
vulnerable web applications.

Don't worry, I've wrote all necessary posts about multiple web applications
with different versions of swfupload (for swfupload.swf, swfupload_f8.swf,
swfupload_f9.swf, swfupload_f10.swf and swfupload_f11.swf). Later I'll write
about another vulnerable flash-file ;-).

Best wishes & regards,
