Mobile is a step backwards in software security (back to about the
mid-1990s) due to patching. Or more correctly, lack thereof. I've been
bitching about it for years.

I'm convinced the only way to fix it is through legislation and
software liability laws. Waiting for companies to "do the right thing"
means will be waiting a very long time (given their track record)
because "do nothing" is cost effective and maximizes profits,

The Security Architect for Good should be fired if that sort of thing
is acceptable.
