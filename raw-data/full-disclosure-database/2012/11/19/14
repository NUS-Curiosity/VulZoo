Subject: phpmyadmin compromised?

Hello *,

I've setup my browser to remember login & password at my server phpmyadmin 
login page. It usually fills the two fields correctly, but today it showed 
this crap instead:

http://img208.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=38933_php_myadmin_compromised_122_430lo.jpg

Since I've already suffered a security breach through phpmyadmin in the 
past, I immediately suspected another one. Please note that phpmyadmin is 
shielded by http digest authentication since the previous accident.

Are you aware of any security problems related to phpmyadmin (or to 
Iceweasel 10 for that matter) that can cause such garbage on the login page?

Thanks in advance
Lucio.
