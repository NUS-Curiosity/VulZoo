Subject: [SE-2012-01] Security vulnerabilities in Java SE
	(details released)


Hello All,

On 14 Nov 2012, Security Explorations delivered a talk at Devoxx Java
Community Conference in Antwerp where we disclosed details pertaining
to our research project verifying security of Java SE platform (project
SE-2012-01).

Presentation slides for this talk along with our more detailed technical
report discussing vulnerabilities and attack techniques are available
for download from the following address:

http://www.security-explorations.com/en/SE-2012-01-details.html

Please, note that not yet-addressed Issues 29 and 50 will be disclosed
at some later time. Along with that we will also reveal the results of
our quick Vulnerability Fix Experiment proving that Issue 50 can be
fixed in less than 30 minutes time and that the nature of the fix does
not require any integration tests (Oracle had a month to respond to our
challenge - they either didn't care to take the ball or simply failed
to find a bug in our patch / analysis).

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
