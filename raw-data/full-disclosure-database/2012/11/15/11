ZDI-12-185 : Apple Mac OS X  DirectoryService SwapProxyMessage Unchecked
objOffset Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-185

November 15, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0650

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Apple

- -- Affected Products:
Apple OS X

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Mac OSX. Authentication is not required
to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the DirectoryService daemon. This process listens on
TCP port 625 by default on Mac OSX Server pre 10.7. Request types to the
service include a sComProxyData structure having a translate field which is
responsible for describing the endianness of the payload. When passing a
message to SwapProxyMessage for byte-reordering, multiple user controlled
fields are trusted including lengths and offsets. When processing this data
with DSSwapObjectData, the process will address memory out of the bounds of
the allocated region. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.

- -- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
