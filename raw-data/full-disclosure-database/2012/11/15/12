- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of RTF files. The code
responsible for lexing control words from the input file does not properly
validate that all objects are properly defined. By removing terminating
values within an RTF file an attacker can cause the program to re-use a
freed object. Combined with basic memory layout control an attacker can
abuse this situation to achieve code execution under the context of the
user running the application.

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
