Hi genius of the year

Sometimes when people argue over the definition of '0day', it is important to be clear. Although the bash script made it clear, I have never ever seen someone call 'user enumeration' an 'oracle attack'. Probably because this is 2012 and the Matrix hasn't just come out.

Sorry for not knowing non-industry terms used by 1% of the populous you hipster.
