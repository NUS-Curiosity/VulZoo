Subject: Security risks of doing business with China?

Hi guys,

I greatly respect the collective knowledge about security matters on this
list. What do you make of this BBC report? Here in the UK we are seeming
happy to do business with China, but other countries are blocking over
alleged security concerns. Do you think these concerns are legitimate or is
this purely political protectionism?
