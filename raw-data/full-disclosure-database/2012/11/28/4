Yes, I agree with you.

However, my opinion it that it should be fixed once and for all in iOS/Webkit (and the other
browsers) by disabling resources loaded with credentials.

At some point, as a protection for phishing, URLs with the format
scheme://username:password@...tname/ were disabled.
When you enter in the browser bar something like that it doesn't work in most browsers.

I was surprised to see that doing something like <image
src='scheme://username:password@...tname/path'> works in Chrome and Firefox but if you enter the
same URL in the browser bar it doesn't work. This doesn't work in Internet Explorer, which is the
right behavior in my opinion.

I don't see any good reason why something like this should work. Closing this in browsers will solve
this problem once and for all.
