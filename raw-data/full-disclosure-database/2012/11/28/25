Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-170 - MultiLink -
	Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1853244

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-170
  * Project: Multi-Language Link and Redirect (MultiLink) [1] (third-party
    module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-November-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

MultiLink allows you to generate in-content links to a suitable node or node
translation based on the visitor's language preferences. It allows the Node
Title of the target node to be shown as the visible text and title attribute
for the generated link.

Prior to versions 6.x-2.7 and 7.x-2.7 the module doesn't check the the
current user has access to a node referenced by the generated link, so that
node title (only) may be disclosed to a user who would otherwise have no
access to that node.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to edit text using an Input Format for which the
MultiLink Filter has been enabled.

CVE: Requested
