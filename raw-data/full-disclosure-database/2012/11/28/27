Subject: Server Side Request Forgery attacks on
	web-applications

Hello world!

Would like to present some words in webapp security area.

*SSRF - Server Side Request Forgery attacks. The ability to create
requests from the vulnerable server to intra/internet. Using a protocol
supported by available URI schemas, you can communicate with services
running on other protocols (smuggling).
