Hash: SHA1

CVE-2012-3439 Apache Tomcat DIGEST authentication weaknesses

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- - Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.29
- - Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.35
- - Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.35
- - Earlier, unsupported versions may also be affected

Description:
Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication
were identified and resolved:
1. Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.
2. When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.
3. The user name and password were not checked before when indicating
   that a nonce was stale.
These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making
replay attacks possible in some circumstances.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations:
- - Tomcat 7.0.x users should upgrade to 7.0.30 or later
- - Tomcat 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.36 or later
- - Tomcat 5.5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.36 or later

Credit:
The first issue was identified by Tilmann Kuhn. The second and third
issues were identified by the Tomcat security team during the code
review resulting from the first issue.
