Subject: [HITB-Announce] #HITB2013AMS Call For Papers Now
	Open

The Call for Papers for the fourth annual HITBSecConf in Europe is now
open! Taking place on the 8th till 11th of April at the Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, #HITB2013AMS will be a triple track conference (with HITB Labs) and features keynotes by Eddie Schwartz, Chief Information Security Officer at RSA and Bob Lord, Chief Security Officer at Twitter

As always, talks that are more technical or that discuss new and never
before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has
been covered several times before.

Submissions are due _no later than 8th February 2013_
