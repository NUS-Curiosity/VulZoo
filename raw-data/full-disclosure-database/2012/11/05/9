Also, "They told me they will work on this, and
will improve their internal security practices."
is just ridiculous.

I have the same feeling you had while reaching out with them,

I wish we could always go Full Disclosure, like old times.
Unfortunately lawsuits are a scary beast.
Finally, honestly, not interested in buying a new kitchen for my house.
