 hijack vulnerability

I don't want to justify their problems, but let me answer your question:

First and foremost the recent problem seems to be caused by the online
service, not their clients.
In fact, I don't see it remotely related to the skype client.

Secondly, "proper security measures" does not make you automagically sound
with it comes to business logic.
Even if they directed all the penetration tools there is out there, this
situation might still have gone unnoticed.

Also, next time, just don't reply with nonconstructive comments at all, if
you have nothing better to say.
It is always easy to bash $company when something comes up. Something you
should think about, that stupid
idiotic flawed company owns assets you don't even come close to.

Again, I've nothing to do with Skype, I'm just irritated by the modern
attitude of situations like these by clueless
people.


Chris.
