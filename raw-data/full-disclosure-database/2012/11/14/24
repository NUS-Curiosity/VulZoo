Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-164 - Smiley
	module and Smileys	module - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1840892

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-164
  * Project: Smiley [1] (third-party module)
  * Project: Smileys [2] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-November-14
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [3]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

These modules enable you to substitutes text emoticons, like :-), with
images.

These modules don't sufficiently sanitize user defined smiley acronyms before
displaying smiley images.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer smiley".

These two modules are based on the same codebase and Smiley was forked due to
lack of new feature development in the Smileys project. This single Security
Advisory covers the same issue in the code of both modules.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Smiley 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.1.
  * Smileys 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Smiley [4]
module, or the Smileys [5] module there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Smiley module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Smiley 6.x-1.1 [6]
  * If you use the Smileys module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Smileys 6.x-1.1
    [7]

Also see the Smiley [8] project page.
