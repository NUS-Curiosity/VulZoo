View online: http://drupal.org/node/1840886

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-163
  * Project: User Read-Only [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-November-14
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

User Read-only is a module that allows an administrator to prevent
modification of user account/profile fields. The administrator can select
which fields will allow or disallow editing.

The module can mistakenly assign roles when performing unrelated operations
against a user's account such as changing a password.

The vulnerability is particular to certain combinations of configuration and
the number of roles available on the site (more than 3).

[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.
