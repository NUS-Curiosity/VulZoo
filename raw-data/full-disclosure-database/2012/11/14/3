Perhaps. I believe it will improve those that remain (survival of the fittest?).

Folks like Google and Red Hat might have to take a proactive approach
to limit their liability. It might hurt folks like Dan Rosenberg, who
make their careers out of finding Comp Sci 101 bugs in the kernel.
(Nothing against Dan - he does a great job).

Its not just Microsoft.

The courts (in the US) are starting to limit those obscene Terms of
Service. http://www.topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/2633-zapposcom-loses-arbitration-bid-in-data-breach-class-action-lawsuit.
Its another legal absurdity to me: you are given a protection, then
corporate america tries to get you to wave it. I guess that's why my
undergrad and grad degrees are computer science and not law.
