Subject: Re: TTY handling when executing code in
 lower-privileged context (su, virt containers)

Furthermore, the handling of user privileges to disallow root logins is to
stop (stupid) users doing stupid things, security wise. If a lot of users
weren't forced to use unprivileged accounts, all the processes you're
talking about running would be run as root. AFAIK security is used to
protect from the lowest denominator up, not top down.
