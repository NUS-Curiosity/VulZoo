Subject: Re: TTY handling when executing code in
 lower-privileged context (su, virt containers)

"This is why I find the standard security mantra of "disable root

I think you've taken that far too literaly. My understanding of it is to
protect against a) brute force retardation b) dumb attackers. Noone said
it's supposed to completely protect uid=0. If you're seeing that as
"extremely silly" then you're interpreting the recommendation in the wrong
way.
