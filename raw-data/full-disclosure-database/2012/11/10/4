The advice weakens the security of your system, because it means I
just need to compromise your unprivileged account (in which you run
your browser, mail client, and so on) to own the entire box.

As for the benefits, care to elaborate? I'm not sure what a) and b)
really mean. If you're worried about brute-force, don't use trivial
passwords. If you worry about opportunistic attacks, do that and then
patch your stuff every now and then.
