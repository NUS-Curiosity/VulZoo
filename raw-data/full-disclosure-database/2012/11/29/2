Subject: Lesson 1: Being a Hacker

Hi,

The relaunch of Hacker Highschool starting with "Lesson 1: Being a 
Hacker" is now available for download.

It's completely new and re-written specifically to help teens learn 
the positive critical of hacking: resourcefulness, creativity, 
security, and controlling their own stuff.

Get it here now:
