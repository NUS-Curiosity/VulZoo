Subject: Directory traversal vulnerabilities in
 jsupload.cgi.pl version 0.6.4 and before

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory traversal vulnerabilities in jsupload.cgi.pl version 0.6.4 and
before
29 November 2012

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details:
----------
Versions of the Perl script jsupload.cgi.pl prior to version number 0.6.4
are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.
The script allows a remote user to upload a file to the "/tmp/uploader"
directory. However, by adding the characters ../ when supplying a filename
it is possible to break out of the directory and write to other
directories on the system.

A similar vulnerability exists in the code that allows a user to download
files from the "/tmp/uploader" directory.

A detailed writup of this vulnerability can be found at www.pwnani.com.

Recommendation:
-------------------------
The latest version of the script includes a patch for these vulnerabilities
and can be found at:

http://code.google.com/p/gwtupload/source/browse/jsupload/src/main/java/jsupload/public/jsupload.cgi.pl
