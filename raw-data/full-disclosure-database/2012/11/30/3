Introduction:
=============
PayPal is a global e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. Online money 
transfers serve as electronic alternatives to paying with traditional paper methods, such as checks and money orders. Originally, 
a PayPal account could be funded with an electronic debit from a bank account or by a credit card at the payer s choice. But some 
time in 2010 or early 2011, PayPal began to require a verified bank account after the account holder exceeded a predetermined 
spending limit. After that point, PayPal will attempt to take funds for a purchase from funding sources according to a specified 
funding hierarchy. If you set one of the funding sources as Primary, it will default to that, within that level of the hierarchy 
(for example, if your credit card ending in 4567 is set as the Primary over 1234, it will still attempt to pay money out of your 
PayPal balance, before it attempts to charge your credit card). The funding hierarchy is a balance in the PayPal account; a 
PayPal credit account, PayPal Extras, PayPal SmartConnect, PayPal Extras Master Card or Bill Me Later (if selected as primary 
funding source) (It can bypass the Balance); a verified bank account; other funding sources, such as non-PayPal credit cards.
The recipient of a PayPal transfer can either request a check from PayPal, establish their own PayPal deposit account or request 
a transfer to their bank account.

PayPal is an acquirer, performing payment processing for online vendors, auction sites, and other commercial users, for which it 
charges a fee. It may also charge a fee for receiving money, proportional to the amount received. The fees depend on the currency 
used, the payment option used, the country of the sender, the country of the recipient, the amount sent and the recipient s account 
type. In addition, eBay purchases made by credit card through PayPal may incur extra fees if the buyer and seller use different currencies.

On October 3, 2002, PayPal became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay. Its corporate headquarters are in San Jose, California, United 
States at eBay s North First Street satellite office campus. The company also has significant operations in Omaha, Nebraska, Scottsdale, 
Arizona, and Austin, Texas, in the United States, Chennai, Dublin, Kleinmachnow (near Berlin) and Tel Aviv. As of July 2007, across 
Europe, PayPal also operates as a Luxembourg-based bank.

On March 17, 2010, PayPal entered into an agreement with China UnionPay (CUP), China s bankcard association, to allow Chinese consumers 
to use PayPal to shop online.PayPal is planning to expand its workforce in Asia to 2,000 by the end of the year 2010.
Between December 4–9, 2010, PayPal services were attacked in a series of denial-of-service attacks organized by Anonymous in retaliation 
for PayPal s decision to freeze the account of WikiLeaks citing terms of use violations over the publication of leaked US diplomatic cables.

Affected Product(s):
====================
PayPal Inc
Payment System - Core Application 2012 Q3-4


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the official Paypal ecommerce website content management system.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent 
vulnerability is located in the Artikel pro Seite listing module with the bound vulnerable filterVal1 parameter. Remote exploitation 
requires low user inter action or privileged application user account for local exploitation. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (admin), account steal via persistent web attack or stable (persistent) context manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                          [+] Geld Anfordern > Artikel pro Seite (Listing) > Rechnungen verwalten


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                          [+] filterVal1 - Item Index (Listing)


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers & local privileged user accounts with low required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

Solution:
=========
2012-10-29:	Vendor Fix/Patch by PayPal Inc


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent script code inject vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
