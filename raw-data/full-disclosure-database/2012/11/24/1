Subject: XSS injection in netadmin's challenge in Dreamhack

Hi!

It is possible to make an XSS injection in the netadmin service provided
at https://dreamhack.netadmin.se/ on, at least, the title header.

For this just set the nick as the script to inject and there you go, it
will be copied literally on the title and may also be copied on the
achievements.
