Here in the UK we are seeming happy to do business with China, but other countries are blocking over alleged security concerns. Do you think these concerns are legitimate or is this purely political protectionism?

In order to make and sell your products, you have to transfer a lot of intellectual property to the joint venture. Guess what happens to that intellectual property? Pretty soon there are multiple Chinese companies making exactly the same thing you make, but selling for a lot cheaper, and maybe not only in their domestic market.

There's a lot of hype about backdoors, but IMO the biggest practical risk is the technical experts they send to do the support. Do people do background checks on the support experts they send in who will have privileged access and debugging capabilities? I doubt it. Maybe they don't even steal any information directly, but simply file reports on how the infrastructure is designed and connected. That information alone has strategic value.

Do they get access to board members, to sensitive financial data? If there's no access to non-public data or trade secrets, then there wouldn't appear to be much risk.

They're really good at making it seem like you have a huge opportunity, if only you give in just a little bit more...
