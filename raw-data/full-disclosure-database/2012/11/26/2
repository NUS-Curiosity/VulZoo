Subject: Re: OT Google raises sploit bounties

His question seemed pretty clear to me. As indicated in the article he
linked to, Google apparently raised their bounty/reward. He's asking if
something happened to one of their products to cause that, or if they're
just paranoid (and maybe expecting something to happen to one of their
products).
