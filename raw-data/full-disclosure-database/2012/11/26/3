FWIW, these choices seem weird... for any announcement of that sort,
it seems more rational to assume any of the following:

1) It's getting harder to find bugs. Reward amounts correspond to the
average time needed to locate a vuln.

2) More reward programs are competing for a fixed pool of skilled
researchers. Reward amounts are just "bids" for their time.

3) Incoming reports are surprisingly good. Reward amounts are set to
recognize high quality work.

4) The vendor thinks that their product is bulletproof, and uses
increasing reward amounts as a publicity stunt.

As far as I know, all reward increases for Google VRPs were driven by
a combination of factors 1 through 3.

I am not sure how "being paranoid" factors in - complex products have
bugs, browsers doubly so. Similarly, malware seems like a weird reason
to bump up rewards.
