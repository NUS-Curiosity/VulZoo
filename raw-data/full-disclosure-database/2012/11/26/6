How is this a vulnerability if it's behind an authentication wall?
I've seen several SOHO routers and APs that include some kind of
"hidden" web page that allows one to tweak settings. How does this
differ & how is it remotely exploitable without authentication? I'm
sure if you contacted the vendor they would acknowledge the existence
of the page as either a debug or dev tool and ask the same questions I
have.
