Subject: Re: TTY handling when executing code in
 lower-privileged context (su, virt containers)

The only thing I am saying is that when you have a choice between
direct root logins and using sudo / su, telling people to use the
latter option for "security reasons" actually makes them worse off.

Poor corporate security practices, schizophrenic account lockout
policies, or dealing with "hundreds of administrators" on a single box
are completely tangential to that (though you can have as many uid 0
accounts as you want).
