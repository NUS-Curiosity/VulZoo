Subject: BF and FPD vulnerabilities in MODx

Hello list!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in MODx. This is the first 
part of the vulnerabilities in this CMS (the first 19 vulnerabilities).

These are Brute Force and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities in MODx. It's 
about 0.x and 1.x (Evolution) versions of MODx CMS. In 2.x (Revolution) 
versions of MODx there are part of these holes and part of new holes - I've 
wrote separate advisory concerning it.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are MODx 1.0.6 and previous versions.

Brute Force (WASC-11):

In login form (http://site/manager/) there is not reliable protection from 
Brute Force attacks.

At that at some web sites the blocking is used after multiple unsuccessful 
attempts. But it's ineffective - the password can be picked up before 
blocking will trigger (as it was during my pentest), it's short-term and it 
works for concrete account, i.e. it's possible to pickup passwords to other 
unblocked accounts.

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

2012.06.27 - announced at my site.
2012.06.28 - informed developers about the first part of vulnerabilities.
2012.06.30 - informed developers about the second part of vulnerabilities.
2012.07.28 - informed developers about vulnerabilities in MODx Revolution 
and reminded about previous two letters.
2012.07.28-2012.10.31 - during conversation with developers about MODx 
Revolution, I was constantly reminding them, that I've sent them info about 
holes in Evolution and I can resent them, because it was clear that they 
missed it (they only were answering concerning Revolution).
2012.11.02 - after developers said they want to see this information (missed 
by them in June), I've resent the first two letters to the developers.
