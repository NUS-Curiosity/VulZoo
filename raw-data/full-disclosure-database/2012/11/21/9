	multiple security issues

webubs.com and prioritymeter.com are utility billing service companies.
They do not take security seriously. Then have hundreds of thousands of
customers. All their customer data is exposed to anyone that logs into the
portal via numerous site security flaws such as: Direct Object Reference
(see someone else's billing data), Account Hijacking (log into anyone's
account without knowing their password), and much more! Maybe they take
security more seriously in the future after they get breached a few more
times?
