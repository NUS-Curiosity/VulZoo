Subject: CIntruder v0.2 released

Hi list,

There is released a new version of *CIntruder* (v0.2) - the captcha intruder

Take a look to the CIntruder website to see new features implemented:

http://cintruder.sf.net

You can download original code directly from here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/cintruder/files/cintruder_v0.2.0.tar.gz/download

Or update your copy from the CIntruder repository:

http://sourceforge.net/p/cintruder/code/

Now there is modularity on OCR process, you can handle CIntruder with
another tool, to perform automatic test on forms that have a captcha,
and interact with an online distributed dictionary.

I hope that you enjoy it!! :D
