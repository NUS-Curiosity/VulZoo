Hi,

a "vulnerability" was identified on MoroccoTel Boxes:
a telnet server is running, open to the web, with a default password of
admin (or 123456)

This critical vulnerability can affect the entire network of a Country.

Solution: change the default password account or modify the default firmware

NB: a new firmware was released, introducing a cipher on the "PPOE
password" (one common, publicly available PPOE account is largely used)

Discovered by NETpeas research team, NETpeas CERT is trying to contact
the ISP

This is rather low-hanging fruit.  But I suppose someone has to disclose
the low hanging fruit.

Aside from abusing WolframAlpha's API, I'm not sure I see that this is that
huge an accomplishment.  I do find it somewhat silly that unobfuscated
appid's are passed to the API over an unsecured connection, but meh.  My
access to the API getting cut would be an annoyance, and I would certainly
be non-plussed about that if I were one of the poor souls who paid for a
bigger better faster stronger query plan, but still, meh.  Maybe I'm
missing out on the gravity of this by not using the WolframAlpha API.

Of course, I'm assuming the real point here *is* that the appid is passed
unobfuscated and unsecured, and *not* that I can go trawling for appid's on
Google.  The former is somewhat interesting to the niche of WolframAlpha
API users.  The latter is rather old news under the heading "I can find a
disturbing amount of private information using a properly formatted Google
query".  Patching that vulnerability will only be accomplished
through reeducation and strategic employment modifications.

Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple security vulnerabilities in plugin
Organizer for WordPress. This is the second in series of advisories
concerning vulnerabilities in this plugin.

These are Cross-Site Scripting (reflected and persistent), Cross-Site
Request Forgery and Arbitrary File Upload (Code Execution) vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Organizer 1.2.1 and previous versions.

As answered me the developer of the plugin, he doesn't support it anymore
and will not be fixing any vulnerabilities in it.

----------
Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/users.php&edit_id=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

XSS (Persistent) (WASC-08):

Exploit:

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2012/Organizer%20XSS-2.html

Code will execute at the page users.php of the plugin.

CSRF (WASC-09):

Via attack on function Add/Edit User Setting (which combined into the same
POST request) it's possible to add and edit settings.

POST request at page
http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/users.php. Similarly to
above exploit for XSS.

Via attack on function Delete User Setting it's possible to delete settings.

http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/users.php&delete_id=admin

Arbitrary File Upload (Code Execution) (WASC-31):

It's possible to upload arbitrary files with code execution (php files).
Because in field "File extensions allowed" it's possible to set extensions
of scripts, such as "php".

This will allow to upload to the server and execute arbitrary scripts.
Besides attacking admin via above-mentioned CSRF vulnerability for changing
of the settings (or getting access to admin account for this), the
Insufficient Authorization vulnerability (described in the third advisory)
also can be used for this (in the presence of account even with lowest
rights as Subscriber).

------------
Timeline:
------------

2012.04.15 - informed the developer about previous vulnerabilities.
2012.04.16 - announced at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/5786/).
2012.04.17 - the developer answered, that he didn't support the plugin
anymore.
2012.04.17 - additionally informed the developer about new vulnerabilities.
2012.04.24 - disclosed at my site.

Best wishes & regards,
MustLive

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-062
  * Project: Creative Commons [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-April-25
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The Creative Commons module allows users to select and assign a Creative
Commons license to a node and any attached content, or to the entire site.
The module did not sufficiently filter the text describing licenses. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with
the permission "administer creative commons".

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-064
  * Project: Ubercart [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-April-25
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Varies (Local & Remote)
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Arbitrary PHP code execution,
    Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The Ubercart module for Drupal provides a shopping cart and e-commerce
features for Drupal. Parts of Ubercart were vulnerable to a Failure to
encrypt data, Cross Site Scripting, and an Arbitrary PHP Execution
vulnerability.

.... Failure to encrypt data: Exploitable from local

Passwords supplied by new customers during checkout were stored as plain text
until payment was completed for an order, for a maximum of 15 minutes. This
vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, but information may have
inadvertently been leaked via database access (e.g. backups, developer
laptops that are compromised).

.... Cross Site Scripting: Exploitable from remote

The product classes feature did not properly sanitize output and was
vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack. This vulnerability is mitigated
by the fact that an attacker must have the "administer product classes"
permission.

.... Arbitrary PHP Execution: Exploitable from remote

In Ubercart 6.x-2.x, arbitrary PHP code can be executed by users with the
"administer conditional actions" permission. This vulnerability is mitigated
by the fact that this permission should only granted to trusted users.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

  * Ubercart 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.8. [3]
  * Ubercart 7.x-3.x versions prior to 7.x-3.1. [4]

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Ubercart [5]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Ubercart module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Ubercart
    6.x-2.8. [6]
  * If you use the Ubercart module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Ubercart
    7.x-3.1. [7]

Additionally, in Drupal 6.x, ensure that only trusted users have roles that
have been granted the "administer conditional actions" permission.

Also see the Ubercart [8] project page.

  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to display a plethora of information about your
site's structure. Optionally, the information may be saved into a file for
later comparison.

The module doesn't sufficiently verify that the saved file is protected by
the Private File System.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the administrator must have
configured the module to save the HTML report file to disk.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

  * Sitedoc 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Site
Documentation [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Sitedoc module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Sitedoc 6.x-1.4
    [4], and
  * Enable the private file system if you want to save the output file.

Also see the Site Documentation [5] project page.

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

Spaces is an API module intended to make configuration options generally
avaliable only at the sitewide level to be configurable and overridden by
individual "spaces" on a Drupal site.

The spaces and spaces_og modules (part of the spaces package) in some cases
do not apply the expected spaces access permission to pages that are
non-objects (e.g. /node)

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that node_access and user profile
permissions will prevent node or user data from being exposed, but other
information (e.g. block data,etc) is still displayed. This issue only affects
sites using spaces to limit access to content for some users.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

  * Spaces 6.x-3.x versions prior to 6.x-3.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Spaces [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Spaces module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Spaces 6.x-3.4 [4]

---------------------------------------------------------

Linkitprovides an easy interface for internal and external linking. Linkit
links to nodes, users, managed files, terms and have basic support for all
entities by default, using an autocomplete field.

When searching for entities, no access restrictions were added and users may
see information about content that they do not normally have access to see.
This issue only affects sites using an entity access module to limit access
to content for some users.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0249 CVE-2012-0250 CVE-2012-0255

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing
daemon.

CVE-2012-0249
        A buffer overflow in the ospf_ls_upd_list_lsa function in the
        OSPFv2 implementation allows remote attackers to cause a
        denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a
        Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet that is smaller than
        the length specified in its header.

CVE-2012-0250
        A buffer overflow in the OSPFv2 implementation allows remote
        attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a
        Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet containing a
        network-LSA link-state advertisement for which the
        data-structure length is smaller than the value in the Length
        header field.

CVE-2012-0255
        The BGP implementation does not properly use message buffers
        for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers impersonating
        a configured BGP peer to cause a denial of service (assertion
        failure and daemon exit) via a message associated with a
        malformed AS4 capability.

This security update upgrades the quagga package to the most recent
upstream release.  This release includes other corrections, such as
hardening against unknown BGP path attributes.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.20.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Oracle TNS Poison vulnerability is actually
        a 0day with no patch available

Hi all,

Short history:

The remote pre-authenticated vulnerability with CVSS2 10 I published
some days ago [1], the vulnerability I called Oracle TNS Poison
(reported to vendor in 2008), is a 0day affecting all database versions
from 8i to 11g R2. There is no patch at all for this vulnerability and
Oracle refuses to write a patch for *ANY* existing versions, even for
Oracle 11g R2. So, yes, ALL versions are vulnerable and will remain
vulnerable.

As I published many workarounds for this vulnerability I believe it's
better to make this information public so Oracle database's customers
can protect themselves.

Long history:

Some days ago, after the release of Oracle Critical Patch Update April
2012, a friend of mine told me that Oracle gave me credit in the
"Security-In-Depth" program for a vulnerability they fixed. After this,
I asked both Oracle and iSightPartners (the company I sold the
vulnerability in 2008) for information about the vulnerability they
fixed in this CPU. Oracle told us that the vulnerability with tracking
id #13793589 (the TNS poison vulnerability) was the one fixed.

As the vulnerability was fixed, there was no reason not to publish
information about it any more and I decided to publish an advisory, a
document explaining the vulnerability and a proof of concept. So far, so
good.

However, I was suspicious about an statement Oracle people wrote me in
an e-mail as, in their words, the vulnerability "was fixed in future
releases of the product". Eeeeh... "was" and "in the future"? As it
makes no sense, I sent Oracle an e-mail asking for details about the
fix:

And Oracle answered me with excuses ("excusatio non petita, accusatio
manifesta"):

As they refused to answer it clearly, I asked them once again in a more
simple way about the "fix" for the vulnerability:

And Oracle, believing I'm stupid or something like this, answered me the
following:

> To protect the interest of our customers, we do not provide these
> level of details (like versions affected) for the issues that are
> addressed as in-depth. The future releases will have the fix.

So, as previously stated, this is a 0day vulnerability with no patch,
Oracle refuses to patch the vulnerability in *any* existing version and
Oracle refuses to give details about which versions will have the fix.
But they say the vulnerability is fixed. Cool.

Oracle security people: For the next time, don't say that a
vulnerability is fixed in a Critical Patch Update if the patch is not
published. Your customers are not interested if the vulnerability is
fixed in your development version, they only care about the
vulnerability being fixed in the versions they are using in production
systems.

PS: I must admit that being Oracle, that confusion doesn't surprises me
at all.
