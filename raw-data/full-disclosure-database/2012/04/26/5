Introduction:
=============
Hotmail (also known as Microsoft Hotmail and Windows Live Hotmail), is a free web-based email service operated by 
Microsoft as part of Windows Live. One of the first web-based email services, it was founded by Sabeer Bhatia and 
Jack Smith and launched in July 1996 as HoTMaiL. It was acquired by Microsoft in 1997 for an estimated $400 
million, and shortly after it was rebranded as MSN Hotmail. The current version was released in 2007. Hotmail 
features unlimited storage, Ajax, and integration with Microsofts instant messaging (Windows Live Messenger), 
calendar (Hotmail Calendar), file hosting service (SkyDrive) and contacts platform. According to comScore (August 2010) 
Windows Live Hotmail is the world s largest web-based email service with 364 million members, followed by Gmail and 
Yahoo! Mail, respectively. It is available in 36 different languages. Hotmail is developed from Mountain View, 
California. When Hotmail Corporation was an independent company, its headquarters was in Sunnyvale.

Microsoft Corporation
Product: MSN - Hotmail v2012 - Q1 & Q2


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A high severity password reset vulnerability is detected in Microsofts official MSN Hotmail service.
A Vulnerability Laboratory senior researcher, Benjamin Kunz Mejri, identified a critical security vulnerability 
in Microsoft’s official MSN Hotmail (Live) service. A critical vulnerability was found in the password reset 
functionality of Microsoft’s official MSN Hotmail service.  The vulnerability allows an attacker to reset the Hotmail/MSN 
password with attacker chosen values.  Remote attackers can bypass the password recovery service to setup a new password 
and bypass in place protections (token based).  The token protection only checks if a value is empty then blocks or 
closes the web session. A remote attacker can, for example bypass the token protection with values “+++)-“.  
Successful exploitation results in unauthorized MSN or Hotmail account access. An attacker can decode CAPTCHA & 
send automated values over the MSN Hotmail module.

Vulnerable Module(s): 

					[+] Password Recovery Service & New Pass


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Note: To exploit the vulnerability only  a browser and a url (GET|POST) tamper is required.

Exploitation Techique(s):
					[+] Bypass the Recovery Mod Page to New Pass or Reset
					[+] Bypass token protection via not empty value or positiv value(s)
					[+] Setup new password
					[+] Decode captcha & send automatique values


Solution:
=========
2012-04-20:	Vendor Fix/Patch [#HOTFIX] - Coordination MSRC Team


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the remote password reset vulnerability is estimated as critical.
