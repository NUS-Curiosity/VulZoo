Subject: Re: Brute Force vulnerability in WordPress

Dear MustLive,


No offense intended, but when you post irrelevant information to the
mailing lists I'm following I feel obligated at least once in a while to
respond and be critical, especially when it is almost always the same
pattern, and it is as if you've gone back in time and live in the 80's in a
Commodore 64. No offense intended of course :-)

I don't expect you to reply, and I certainly don't wait for you to respond
to my e-mails (as it often takes you a month to do such, while you post
5-100 new "vulnerabilities" meanwhile), and as I've actually found a
vulnerability I must inform this list about this seriousness that when I
write "No offense intended of course", I am performing a Time-Jump
Bruteforce Attack by using 25 characters in a clever way, and of course (no
offense intended) I wrote about this back in 2005 which you can read about
on securitycompanysecurity.com.co.uk

There is no way to protect against this vulnerability because when you
don't write it people will find your e-mails offensive too and you will
have to spend time apologizing or writing long funny e-mails that doesn't
make sense.


Now, let's get back to reality and be more serious.

I know that you're probably a busy man, even though I may (this time I
actually mean it: no offense intended) wonder what you're busy with, and if
you're spending your time right. Have you read the Web Application Hacker's
Handbook? I suggest you do, and stop posting about these bruteforce flaws,
etc., that can't be fixed or exists in like every web app there is.

It's like saying you found some air today. There's air everywhere on Earth
pretty much, and we all know it, but we don't need to be reminded weekly
about it exists.

About me sending more than one e-mail a month, what do you do with the
spammers? Do you send them e-mails too and ask them not to send you more
e-mails before they've responded? I get tons of e-mail each day, including
a lot of spam too, and in some cases I've received e-mails as if it was a
chat system, but I've never told anyone, please don't send me any further
e-mails before I've responded, because I respond whenever I have time.

Now we're at working on more important things, actually, I feel this is an
important matter too, and fyi I do already have a visa for Australia. So
that's not an excuse for not writing long e-mails to you :-)

I'll skip through most of what you've said as you could've said it in 10
words or less (e.g., MaXe I don't like what you say), but what intrigues me
is this: "> I'm writing only about what matters - only about that which is
important for me."

Information Security, is not about what is important for you, it is about
what is important for the world, and its users. Let's take an example: It's
easier than you think to break into a house, even with the best lock in the
world and 10-inch reinforced concrete door, you can just smash a window and
jump in, in some cases you can just take off the window. 

That's a very common physical security issue, but we don't need to hear
about it, especially not on mailing lists. We know that this vulnerability
exists, along with tons of others in the human nature, most people are
aware, of most of them, but we don't discuss them most of the time, unless
it's really necessary, as it's common sense. So is bruteforcing of any
kind. It's like trying to guess the key combination on a door or on a lock,
it has its flaws, and we know, but we accept it, and live with it.

Concerning lying, that's what you're accusing me for, so you're
postulating as you didn't back up your statement with facts. (Essentially
meaning, you're lying too.)

Keep in mind, that you may think you can offer 100% security, at least it
sounds like that, when you say you can protect against any type of
bruteforcing when "implemented correctly", the problem is, nothing is 100%
secure, at all. Everything in this world, universe, dimension, etc., will
never be 100% secure. Even credit cards that are locked or "eaten" by the
teller machine, has 3 tries, and an even higher chance to guess the pin if
there's a "pin code helper card" along with it. If you take a credit card
and only need the CVV number, you can in some cases bruteforce this
instead, and now you've just broken credit card security, but it was broken
from the start, just like computers are, as they are and will never be 100%
secure, because they were made by humans who will never be 100% secure, in
a world that will never be stable / secure, and in a universe that will
never be stable / secure, as everything is in constant motion all the time.
(Well, except "Dark Matter" perhaps.)

Back to lying: As I can see halfway through your e-mail you began to
become obsessive about me and others lying about you, however, as you don't
have the facts, you're postulating, aka lying which I've already said, but
lying is also relative, as you may think it's a lie from your perspective,
but from my perspective it's not, so in that sense, it's 50/50 and that
equally both, meaning either we both lie or both of us doesn't lie. 


I think it's wrong of you to fall down to this level where you waste time
on vulnerabilities that are worth absolute zero in most cases (thankfully
not always), and I think that you should as I said in my other e-mail,
focus on more "realistic" vulnerabilities that will protect the web apps
and its users from more serious attacks than password guessing and common
developer mistakes. 


Last but not least, I know that it is not the most friendly tone you're
receiving, but most of the time I'm actually quite friendly, it's only when
you keep annoying me (and others) for longer periods (in this case years!)
by sending these "bruteforce vulnerability" e-mails to the mailing lists
I'm following, so my brain starts to slowly degrade. 

I don't know if you've noticed, but who else on Full Disclosure writes
about the type of vulnerabilities you do? Maybe there's a reason they
don't, and this is what I've been trying to make you realize, to get you to
MustLive 7 instead of MustLive 3.11



Best regards,
Your no offense intended debater
