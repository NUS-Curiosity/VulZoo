Subject: [SE-2012-01] Security vulnerabilities in Java SE


Hello,

The following information might be of interest for the readers of this
list. It's been sent to Bugtraq yesterday, but hasn't get to the list
yet.

Security Explorations, a security and vulnerability research company
from Poland, discovered multiple security issues in the latest version
of Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE) [1] software coming from
Oracle Corporation [2].

Discovered security issues violate many "Secure Coding Guidelines for
the Java Programming Language" [3]. Most of them demonstrate a specific
problem related to Java SE security. Among a total of 19 weaknesses
discovered, there are issues that allow to either create a specific
Java security bypass condition or that facilitate the exploitation
process of a certain type of vulnerabilities.

Security Explorations developed reliable Proof of Concept codes for all
of the issues found. This includes 12 exploit codes that demonstrate a
complete JVM security sandbox bypass.

Malicious Java applet or application exploiting one of the most serious
issues found could run unrestricted in the context of a target Java
process such as a web browser application. Security Explorations
verified that in a result of a successful attack, arbitrary files could
be created or programs executed in the environment of the affected Java
SE software.

The following versions of Java SE were verified to be vulnerable to all
19 identified weaknesses:
* JRE/JDK 7 (version 1.7.0-b147)
* JRE/JDK 7u1 (version 1.7.0_01-b08)
* JRE/JDK 7u2 (version 1.7.0_02-b13)
* JRE/JDK 7u3 (version 1.7.0_03-b05)
* JRE/JDK 7u4 (version 1.7.0_04-ea-b18, early access release from 29
                Mar 2012)

On Apr 02 2012, Security Explorations sent a vulnerability notice to
Oracle corporation containing detailed information about discovered
vulnerabilities. Along with that, the company was also provided with
source and binary codes for 14 Proof of Concept codes illustrating
all security bypass issues and exploitation vectors.

Thank you.

Best Regards
