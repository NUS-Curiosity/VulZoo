Subject: Mind Control Security Awareness

Hi,

One of the key aspects to the SmarterSaferBetter workshop is in the 
first hour where the class is eased into knowing how they are not in 
control of their mind. We talk about why you believe what you believe 
and how you make decisions. We do a lot of mind exercises to show 
this. But the biggest mind-bend of them all is showing how our mind 
works as a sensory processor and how we think about what we think we know.

Here's a snippet, a little story, about how I approached that.

This is the stuff that real security awareness needs to take into 
account or else it will NEVER really work:
