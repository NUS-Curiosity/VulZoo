Cisco Security Advisory: Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in the Cisco
WebEx Player

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120404-webex

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 April 4 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) player contains three buffer
overflow vulnerabilities. In some cases, exploitation of the
vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
on the system with the privileges of a targeted user.

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back
WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting
site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can
be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that
is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually
installed for offline playback after downloading the application from
www.webex.com.

If the WRF player was automatically installed, it will be automatically
upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a
recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the WRF
player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a
new version of the player after downloading the latest version from
www.webex.com.

Cisco has updated affected versions of the WebEx meeting sites and WRF
player to address these vulnerabilities.
