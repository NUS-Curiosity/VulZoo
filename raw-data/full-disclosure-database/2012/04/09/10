ZDI-12-059 :  Mozilla Firefox Ogg Vorbis Decoding Memory Corruption
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-059

April  9, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0444

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Mozilla



- -- Affected Products:

Mozilla Firefox



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of Ogg Vorbis media files. By
crafting a stream with specific values , it is possible to cause a
decoding loop that copies memory to write controlled data beyond the end
of a fixed size buffer. An attacker can leverage this behavior to gain
remote code execution under the context of the current process.

- -- Vendor Response:

Mozilla has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
