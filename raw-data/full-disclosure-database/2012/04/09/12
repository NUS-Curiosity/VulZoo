ZDI-12-060 : Oracle Java Runtime readMabCurveData nTblSize Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability

April  9, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0498

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Oracle



- -- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within cmm.dll. While parsing multi-function a
to b curve data the size of an allocation is calculated based on user
supplied data. It is possible to cause an integer wrap on the nTblSize
variable. This variable is later used to allocate an heap buffer which
will be smaller than necessary resulting in heap memory corruption. This
can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
