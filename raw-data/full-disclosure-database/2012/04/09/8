- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Flash Player handles the update
of a NetStream object via the appendBytes method which can lead to a

remote code execution under the context of the current process.
