They made special notice of that.  Amendment 7 got reworded a bit (the phrase
"authorized testing" was replace with "testing in accordance with law", and in
the Justification they say:

The term "authorised testing" can be interpreted in a way that would require a
formal authorization before the security testing of own in formation systems.
This would entirely undermine the effectiveness and practicality of self tests
without criminal intent. Further, there should be no criminal liability when
the limitation of access to a system is illegal by itself.
