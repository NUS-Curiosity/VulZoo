Thanks for posting that.  Looks like the final text is in fact not that bad. In
particular, Amendent 7 clarifies that authorized pen-testing is legal, and
Amendment 22 strikes the "possession" of tools/devices and adds "for the clear
purpose of committing any of the offences".

So you're allowed to have a copy of Metasploit, but pointing it someplace
you don't have permission is still strictly forbidden. Sanity wins, at least this
time. ;)
