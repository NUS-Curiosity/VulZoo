	Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1547660

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-063
  * Project: RealName [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-April-25
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module allows you to set a pattern for constructing "Real names" for
users out of profile fields. The module does not sufficiently escape users'
real names under certain circumstances which could lead to a Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) [3] attack.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * RealName 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.5 [4].
  * RealName 7.x-1.x versions are not vulnerable.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed RealName [5]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the RealName module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to RealName 6.x-1.5
    [6].

Also see the RealName [7] project page.
