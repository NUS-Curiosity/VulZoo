Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-066 - Spaces and
	Spaces OG - Access	Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1547736

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-066
  * Project: Spaces [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-April-25
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Spaces is an API module intended to make configuration options generally
avaliable only at the sitewide level to be configurable and overridden by
individual "spaces" on a Drupal site.

The spaces and spaces_og modules (part of the spaces package) in some cases
do not apply the expected spaces access permission to pages that are
non-objects (e.g. /node)

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that node_access and user profile
permissions will prevent node or user data from being exposed, but other
information (e.g. block data,etc) is still displayed. This issue only affects
sites using spaces to limit access to content for some users.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Spaces 6.x-3.x versions prior to 6.x-3.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Spaces [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Spaces module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Spaces 6.x-3.4 [4]

Also see the Spaces [5] project page.
