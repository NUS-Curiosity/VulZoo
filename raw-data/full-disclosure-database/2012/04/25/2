CVE-2012-2110

	Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team, discovered a vulnerability
	in the way DER-encoded ASN.1 data is parsed that can result in
	a heap overflow.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze12.

The testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
are not affected by this issue.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
