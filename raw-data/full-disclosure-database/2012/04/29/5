Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the Croogo v1.3.4 Content Management System.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-26:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Croogo v1.3.4 Content Management System. 
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires 
low user inter action. Attackers can inject malicious strings as username to execute them when a admin is processing to view, review 
or list username or names. The bug is located on application side & the execution is persistent out of the web application context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] User Listing - Username & Name
				[+] Role Listing - Name & Alias

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
