Presentation Title Skype Vulnerabilities: Zero Day Exploitation 2011
Presentation Abstract

The popular VOIP client Skype has been beaten?! As everyone knows Skype takes security very seriously according 
to their own words: “The security of your information is of the utmost concern to us here at Skype and something 
we take very seriously” So we rose up to the challenge and tried to see if we could beat the system filters and/or 
software out of the box.

This presentation will offer the first in depth view & analysis of the bugs that where found in Skype by the 
vulnerability-lab.com research team in 2011. The presentation will also provide exclusive attack schemes from 
an attackers point of view which were also used for verification of our findings.

Buglist:

– Skype 5.3.x 2.2.x 5.2.x – Persistent Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability
– Skype 5.3.x 2.2.x 5.2.x – Persistent Software Vulnerability
– Skype v5.3.x – Transfer Standby Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
– Skype v5.2.x and v5.3.x – Critical Pointer Vulnerability
– Skype v5.3.x v2.2.x v5.2.x – Denial of Service Vulnerability

Attack schemes:

– Client Side Skype Exploitation (Local & Remote)
– Server Side Exploitation #1 (Local & Remote)

checks(penetrationtests) on services, software, applications, malware analysis, underground economy, 
government protection or cyberwar analysis, reverse engineering, lectures or presentations and 
workshops about IT Security. During his work as a penetration tester and vulnerability researcher, 
many open- or closed source applications, software and services were formed more secure. In 1997, 
Benjamin K.M. founded a non-commercial and independent security research group called,  Global Evolution 
- Security Research Group  which is still active today.

From 2010 to 2011, Benjamin M. and Pim C. (Research Team) identified over 300 zero day vulnerabilities 
in well known products from companies such as DELL, Barracuda, Mozilla, Kaspersky, McAfee, Google, 
Fortigate, Opera, Cyberoam, Safari, Endian, Skype, Asterisk, Astaro, PBX & SonicWall. In 2010 he founded 
the company  Evolution Security . After the firm s establishment arose the Vulnerability Lab as the legal 
european initiative for vulnerability researchers, analysts, penetration testers, and serious hacker 
groups. Ben is also the leader of the Contest + VLab Research Team. He have a lot of stable references 
by solved events, interviews or contests/wargames like ePost SecCup, SCS2, 27c3, EH2008, Har2009, Da-op3n 
& he provids exclusive zero-day exploitation sessions/releases.
