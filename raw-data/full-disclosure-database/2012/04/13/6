Subject: Re: Erronous post concerning Backtrack 5 R2 0day

I think it is misleading to just blame it on title shortening when you
clearly stated in the body of the advisory:

"This 0day exploit for Backtrack 5 R2 was discovered by a student in
theInfoSec Institute Ethical Hacking class, during an evening CTF exercise."

This was also said on the original post on your website but has since been
edited.
