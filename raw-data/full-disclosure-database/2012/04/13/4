 You obviously customized the install or changed it post installation as
this is not the default way it gets setup.  Below is the filesystem
setup when using all the default options (no customization):

# df -hP
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
rootfs                5.5G  2.1G  3.4G  39% /
udev                  495M     0  495M   0% /dev
tmpfs                 502M  272K  501M   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs                 502M  612K  501M   1% /run
/dev/mapper/vg_fedora15test-lv_root  5.5G  2.1G  3.4G  39% /
tmpfs                 502M     0  502M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs                 502M     0  502M   0% /media
/dev/sda1             485M   30M  430M   7% /boot
/dev/mapper/vg_fedora15test-lv_root  5.5G  2.1G  3.4G  39% /tmp
/dev/mapper/vg_fedora15test-lv_root  5.5G  2.1G  3.4G  39% /var/tmp
/dev/mapper/vg_fedora15test-lv_root  5.5G  2.1G  3.4G  39% /home

Despite what the above looks like, /tmp is actually part of the root
filesystem.

Yes, of course you can change your setup post install or if you're
daring enough during the install, but that wasn't the point of the
research.
