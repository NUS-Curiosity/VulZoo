[Overview]

After taking two years off to work on our surfing skills we decided it
was time to bring some top notch technical talent back to one of the
most remote locations on earth.  

Sitting around somewhere freezing your a$$ off?  Dreaming about warm
days, rainbows, decadent tropical drinks sipped out of coconuts? Sure
you could drop your 0day in Vegas, bring down the Internet in Germany,
or satisfy your dark desires in Asia; however, wouldn't you rather
submit your research or topics to our CFP and maybe win yourself a paid
trip to Hawaii?  

The Shakacon security conference is a laid back conference where
industry, government, academia and independent experts will get together
to share knowledge and experience in one of the most beautiful places on
Earth.  

Shakacon will offer local, national, and international participants a
casual, social, learning environment designed to present a "holistic"
security view and the opportunity to network with peers and fellow
enthusiasts in a relaxed setting.  Leave your ego at the airport (or
shoreline if you come in via another method) as we look forward to
attendees varying in skill level from N00b to Ninja.
  
During the day, sessions will include: best practices, case studies,
research projects, etc. 
covering all different aspects of the information security landscape.
There will be something for everyone and if sitting through talks isn't
your cup of kava, there will be exciting events and contests for you to
sharpen your skills and knowledge on.



[Trainer Opportunities]

Don't want to speak at the Con but have an uncanny ability to teach and
a proven track record for delivering quality courseware and want to come
to Hawaii? We're also interested in bringing in trainers to provide
world class training leading up to Shakacon (June 18 and 19). Submit a
synopsis/class agenda, prior teaching experience, and maybe get selected
to teach in Hawaii.

There are a limited number of speaking sessions for which the conference
organizers will provide travel and accommodations so please submit your
abstract early if you are interested in speaking.  Speaking slots will
be 55 minutes long (45 minutes for your talk and 10 minutes for Q&A);
however, we will accept "turbo" talk submissions and if we have enough
we'll blend them into a block of the conference.

The audience will be a broad mix of professional, academic, and
enthusiast, so we welcome both technical and non-technical submissions
on all aspects of security.  The key criteria are practicality and
timeliness.  
We want to provide our attendees with up to date materials they can take
away and immediately gain benefit from as well as new research or tools.
Absolutely NO SALES presentations will be accepted.
