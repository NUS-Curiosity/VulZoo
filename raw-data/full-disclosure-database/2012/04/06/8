I'm a noob and there is nothing in this magazine I don't already know.
Although your mag might just enlighten the very clueless to some small extent.
Full disclosure is not the place to promote your advertisement riddled magazine.

This publication needs to target not pen testers and security specialists, but the clueless middle and upper management with business degrees
and little understanding of IT security.

There are real professionals here, proper coders and hackers, people with genuine skills (myself not included).
Can you imagine how they see your publication?

Regards
Dave
