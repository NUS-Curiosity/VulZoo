Subject: CWEs translation

Hi list,

I finished the translation into french of all available CWEs (Titles +
Descriptions).
We use it for our CERT.
I should soon share this work with french CERTs, but I would like to
know if others could provide a translation in other languages?
(I know some spain guys are working on it)

Thanks
My 5 euro cents
