Yes. . I bought this RAT software from him. He claims that he is having is own RAT but they all are freeware.
1. Darkcomet
2.Xtream Rat
google it
even you can find better RAT free of cost on net.

he will give you BOT which is again freely available on net. And last he uses "Father Crypter" to crypt all RAT output files. and this is pure bullshiz. All will be detected by Anti viruses after few hours.
Before buying they said they will be giving FUD server, (Commercial Exploits Packs for Reliable Deployment in ZIP, EXE, Single XLS(office 2007), JPG+LNK, PDF File(9.3.0) & Browser Pack) but nothing given.
Once you start using it nothing goes according to his claimed way and fails. You have only option left is KEEL EMAILING and CALLING. He will never respond to you again.. Bloody money sucker.

Result:
LEOIMPACT.COM<http://LEOIMPACT.COM> is SCAM

LEORAT.COM<http://LEORAT.COM> is SCAM

LEORAT.COM<http://LEORAT.COM> is SCAM
