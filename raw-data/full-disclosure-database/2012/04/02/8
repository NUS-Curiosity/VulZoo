=========
Low


Details:
========
A client side cross site scripting vulnerability is detected on DirectAdmins Management Web-Application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker with higher privileged user account to hijack customer/moderator/admin sessions with high required user inter 
action. Successful exploitation can result in account steal or client side context manipulation when processing affected module
application requests.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                      [+] CMD DOMAIN - &domain=

Picture(s):
                                      ../1.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with medium required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Solution:
=========
The issue will be addressed by direct-admin development team with the next update.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as low.
