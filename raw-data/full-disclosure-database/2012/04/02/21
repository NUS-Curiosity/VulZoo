Subject: Re(3):  An April Fools' Day Android Payload

Oh, you noticed it. Good.
Of course not missing it, but just can't reverse it properly thru ARM
base at that moment..
That was why I wrote "x86".
Dan was kind enough to put his asm PoC code too & since the commands
was simple so a quick x86 logic reversing match will do fine to
confirm that the #shellcode wasn't an April's fool.

Or, you have a better idea jotting an ARM shellcode to asm within
5minutes during a train ride on a laptop?
If so, go ahead mock me. :)

BTW, like I said, is just a curiosity. And I rest my case.

Best regards.
