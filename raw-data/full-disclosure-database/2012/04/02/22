Subject: [Tool] New release of peepdf (PDF analysis)

Hi!

During last Black Hat Europe I released a new version of peepdf. If you
don't know it, it's a tool to analyze PDF documents, supporting
encryption, compressed objects, Javascript and shellcode emulation, etc.
You can also modify PDF documents, remove filters, obfuscate them, etc.
All of that with a powerful console.

In summary these are the main changes:

- Improved PDF filters like LZWDecode, ASCII85Decode and predictor
parameters for FlateDecode / LZWDecode.

- Monitorization of new vulnerabilities like CVE-2011-2462 or CVE-2011-4369.

- Added update process

- Javascript beautifier

- New command to hash objects, streams, etc.

- Added an easy way to extract information (>, >>)

- New commands to perform XOR operations and searches for patterns in
the result of XOR brute-forcing.

- XML output


You have the full blog post here:

And you can download it here:

I want to deal with the next points in the next steps:

- AES 256 encryption

- Automatic analysis of embedded PDF documents

- Support for the rest of filters

- Improving modification capabilities

- ...


I hope these new changes can be useful to you and I would appreciate any
kind of feedback, bugs, etc.


Thanks!

Jose
