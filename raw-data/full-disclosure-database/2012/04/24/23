PD: Bad English written on purpose, please forgive me for any correct
grammar I may have used :P
PD2: Григорий seeing your historial I think the mail was a joke but
anyway, just in the improbable case it may not be:
  1. Bad administration issues are not global to a distro issues.
  2. Make sure a vulnerability is not a not so secure by design feature.
  3. Really if you ever want to write a paper or something make sure you
get it readen by at least two or three english speaking partners for
your own sake.
