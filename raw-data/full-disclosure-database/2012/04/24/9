Subject: Re: [New tool] - Exploit Pack - Web Security

Hi,

I think that people here would be more interested by the (new?)
techniques you're using in your tool than by your own (not documented?)
implementation.

ie: are you using MSF browser autopwn technique for browser control?
(Or, will we have to spend individually 3 days to review and test your
tool?)
