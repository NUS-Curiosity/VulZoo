Subject: Opcodes Database Revival

Hi List,

WANTED: one (free/available) .Net programmer

I did a research on Windows Opcodes (return addresses) database
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasploit_Project#Opcode_Database
http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-eu-12/bh-eu-12-briefings.html

My tools/results should be soon published (BlackHat website /
Packetstorm...)

Anyway, to publish the source code, i would like to collaborate with a
.Net programmer to share a better/clean/more understable code.

Anyway, in short it is an update of http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html
