Subject: BeyondCHM 1.1 Buffer Overflow

 From http://www.beyondchm.com/:
"Beyond CHM is a powerful chm reader and chm editor, It enables user to 
open multiple tabs at the same time. With this CHM viewer, user can edit 
CHM files, including highlighting CHM text, changing font and font size, 
removing contents, adding comments and so on, all the changes can be 
saved persistently. Additionally, user can switch Beyond CHM between 
reader mode and editor mode easily. In reader mode, users can zoom on 
CHM pages and navigate among CHM pages easily. Beyond CHM is a good 
Microsoft HTML Help Tool replacement, which supports nearly all Windows 
operation systems."

Using a crafted .chm file is possible to cause a stack based buffer 
overflow.
