Subject: Hacking WolframAlpha

Sharing source code with peers is one thing; sharing secrets over a public
medium is another. The all-seeing eye of Google has no mercy, and once the
secret has been seen, indexed, and copied to clone sites, it is no longer a
secret. Now combine the search power of Google with the computational power
of WolframAlpha and the results are limitless! It's raining data from these
saturated clouds, and you just need to hold out your hands for a taste:
