	Overflow

 From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket:
"Mobipocket SA is a French company incorporated in March 2000 which 
produces Mobipocket Reader software, an E-Book reader for some PDAs, 
phones and desktop operating systems.

  The Mobipocket software package is free and consists of various 
publishing and reading tools for PDA, Smartphones, cellular phones and 
e-book devices (Symbian, Windows Mobile, Palm OS, webOS, Java ME, 
BlackBerry, Psion, Kindle and iLiad). Mobipocket.com was bought by 
Amazon.com in 2005.[1] Amazon's acquisition was believed to be a result 
of Adobe Systems's announcement that it would no longer sell its eBook 
packaging and serving software.[2]

  An alpha release of the java-based version of the mobipocket reader 
was made available for cellphones on June 30, 2008.[3] There is also a 
reader for desktop computers running Microsoft Windows, which also works 
with computers running Mac OS X and Linux using WINE.[4]

  It has been widely reported that since Amazon's acquisition of 
Mobipocket, software support, user support, and platform growth was 
ended. In December, 2011, it was reported that Amazon officially 
notified the book publishers that it was ending support for Mobipocket. 
RIP: Mobipocket 2000-2011, Mobipocket eBook Format Is Gone, et.al. The 
status of Mobipocket DRM content previously purchased by users continues 
to be unclear since currently no other ebook reader supports this 
propriety DRM method."
