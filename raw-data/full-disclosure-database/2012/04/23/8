Subject: SumatraPDF v2.0.1 chm and mobi files memory
	corruption

SumatraPDF si absolutely my favourite reader. Itâ€™s stable, secure, open 
source and offers the opportunity to read a lot of formats including 
.chm and. mobi files. Unfortunately there is the possibility, crafting 
these files, to cause a memory corruption which could lead into 
arbitrary code esecution.
