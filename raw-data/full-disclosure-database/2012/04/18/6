Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-060 - Commerce
	Reorder - Cross Site	Request Forgery

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1538436

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-060
  * Project: Commerce Reorder [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-April-18
  * Security risk: Not critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Commerce Reorder module enables you to reorder previously purchased
products for Drupal Commerce.

The module does not sufficiently protect the re-order URL against Cross Site
Request Forgery (CSRF [3]), allowing a malicious user to trick someone into
adding unwanted items to their shopping cart.

This vulnerability is mitigated by by the fact that while items can be placed
in a shopping cart, the user still has to complete the checkout process, and
by the fact that re-ordering is restricted by access to the "source" order.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Commerce Reorder versions prior to 7.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Commerce
Reorder [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Commerce Reorder module, upgrade to Commerce Reorder
    7.x-1.1 [5]

Also see the Commerce Reorder [6] project page.
