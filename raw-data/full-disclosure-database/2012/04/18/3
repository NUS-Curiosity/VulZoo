Immunity is excited to announce our third annual Hack Cup this year in
Las Vegas! As always, it will be held on the first day of DefCon (July,
27th).

Anyone interested in playing indoor soccer is welcome to join! The
dynamic will be the same as previous years:

 o The tournament will go from 9:00-13:00.

 o We will have 12 teams of five players each, playing 15-minute matches
in four different groups. We recommend that you have at least 2-5
substitutes as it's a very fast field and you may have had a few beers
the night before. Last year, several teams absorbed people who came
without a team, so if you don't know five other soccer players, all is
not lost. You'll make new friends!

Last year the Spanish team FOCA won the tournament.  Can they defend
their victory title or will another team cause an upset?

We just opened the team subscription page which can be found here:

Keep in mind that there are only 12 spots and it's first come, first
serve!

For more information or pictures of last year, please visit our
stunningly attractive and highly scalable website:

Thanks,
Team Hack Cup!

PS: Almost forgot about the mandatory Buffy quote:

DAWN:    Whatcha doin'?
BUFFY:  (Reading a magazine) Playing soccer.
