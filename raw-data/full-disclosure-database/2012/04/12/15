Package        : samba
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1182
Debian Bug     : 668309

It was discovered that Samba, the SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server,
contained a flaw in the remote procedure call (RPC) code which allowed
remote code execution as the super user from an unauthenticated
connection.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze7.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.6.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
