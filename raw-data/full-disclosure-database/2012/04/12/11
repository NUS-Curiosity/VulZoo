This is just a message for Patrick Belcher, CISSP... we're watching you.

Seems he's been investigating, collecting and providing information about
Occupy and Anonymous (and similar groups) to people in Law Enforcement and
trying to keep his name out of it for fear of retaliation. Welcome to
public exposure, Patrick!
