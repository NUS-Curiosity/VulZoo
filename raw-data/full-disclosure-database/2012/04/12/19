Subject: Re: Most Linux distributions don't use tmpfs nor
 encrypt swap by default

Fedora Core 15:

/dev/mapper/vg_youwish-lv_swap swap                    swap
defaults        0 0
tmpfs			/tmp			tmpfs 	defaults	0 0

Removed other options it should have, but defaults do not include
nosuid,nodev,noexec.
