John Thomas Draper (born 1943), also known as Captain Crunch, Crunch or Crunchman (after Cap`n Crunch, 
the mascot of a breakfast cereal), is an American computer programmer and former phone phreak. He is a 
legendary figure within the computer programming world.

Draper is the son of a U.S. Air Force engineer; he described his father as distant in an interview 
published on the front page of the Jan 13–14, 2007 issue of The Wall Street Journal. Draper himself 
entered the Air Force in 1964, and while stationed in Alaska helped his fellow servicemen make free 
phone calls home by devising access to a local telephone switchboard. After Alaska, he was stationed 
at Charleston Air Force Station in Maine. In 1967, he created WKOS [W-\"chaos\"], a pirate station in 
nearby Dover-Foxcroft, but had to shut it down when a legitimate radio station, WDME, objected. He 
was honorably discharged from the Air Force in 1968 and did military-related work for several employers 
in the San Francisco Bay Area. He adopted the counterculture of the times and operated a pirate radio 
station out of a Volkswagen van.

One oft-repeated story featuring Captain Crunch goes as follows: Draper picked up a public phone, then 
proceeded to “phreak” his call around the world. At no charge, he routed a call through different phone 
switches in countries such as Japan, Russia and England. Once he had set the call to go through dozens of 
countries, he dialed the number of the public phone next to him. A few minutes later, the phone next to 
him rang. Draper spoke into the first phone, and, after quite a few seconds, he heard his own voice very 
faintly on the other phone. He sometimes repeated this stunt at parties. Draper also claimed that he and 
a friend once placed a direct call to the White House during the Nixon administration, and after giving 
the operator President Nixon\'s secret code name of \"Olympus\", and asking to speak to the president about 
a national emergency, they were connected with someone who sounded like Richard Nixon; Draper’s friend 
told the man about a toilet paper shortage in Los Angeles, at which point the person on the other end of 
the line angrily asked them how they\'d managed to get connected to him. Draper was also a member of the 
Homebrew Computer Club.

hosting entities, banks, isp(telecom) and ips. His specialties are security checks(penetrationtests) on services, 
software, applications, malware analysis, underground economy, government protection or cyberwar analysis, reverse 
engineering, lectures or presentations and workshops about IT Security. During his work as a penetration tester 
and vulnerability researcher, many open- or closed source applications, software and services were formed more 
secure. In 1997, Benjamin K.M. founded a non-commercial and independent security research group called, 
Global Evolution - Security Research Group which is still active today.

From 2010 to 2011, Benjamin M. and Pim C. (Research Team) identified over 300 zero day vulnerabilities in well known 
products from companies such as DELL, Barracuda, Mozilla, Kaspersky, McAfee, Google, Fortigate, Opera, Cyberoam, 
Safari, Endian, Skype, Asterisk, Astaro, PBX & SonicWall. In 2010 he founded the company Evolution Security. 
After the firm`s establishment arose the Vulnerability Lab as the legal european initiative for vulnerability 
researchers, analysts, penetration testers, and serious hacker groups. Ben is also the leader of the Contest + 
VLab Research Team. He have a lot of stable references by solved events, interviews or contests/wargames like 
ePost SecCup, SCS2, 27c3, EH2008, Har2009, Da-op3n & he provids exclusive zero-day exploitation sessions/releases.
