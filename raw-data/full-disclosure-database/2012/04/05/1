Subject: Teensy USB HID (and Kautilya) for Penetration
	Testers

Hi List,

I have started a series of blog post called Teensy USB HID for Penetration Testers on http://labofapenetrationtester.blogspot.com/. As the name suggests, this series will cover basics to advanced stuff of using Teensy++ device in Penetration Tests. I will also describe a toolkit developed by me called Kautilya, which can be found here http://code.google.com/p/kautilya/

Please leave comments and feedback.

Regards,

Nikhil
