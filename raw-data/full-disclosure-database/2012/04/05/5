What is Sagan?
- --------------

Sagan Main Site: http://sagan.quadrantsec.com

Sagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2) high performance, real-time log
analysis & correlation engine.  It is written in C and uses a
multi-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event
analysis. The Sagan structure and Sagan rules work similarly to the
Sourcefire ?Snort? IDS engine. This was intentionally done to maintain
compatibility with rule management software
(oinkmaster/pulledpork/etc) and allows Sagan to correlate log events
with your Snort IDS/IPS system. Since Sagan can write to Snort IDS/IPS
databases via unified2/barnyard2 or direct SQL access, it is
compatible with all Snort ?consoles?. For example, Sagan is compatible
with Snorby [http://www.snorby.org], Sguil
[http://sguil.sourceforge.net] and the Prelude IDS framework!  For
more information, please visit the Sagan web site:
http://sagan.quadrantsec.com.

What's new in Sagan?
- --------------------

- - Native Snortsam [http://www.snortsam.net] support. Snortsam is a
firewall blocking agent for Snort. Sagan can now leverage Snortsam to
block attacks based on log analysis and normalization. Snortsam
currently supports Checkpoint Firewall-1, Cisco PIX/ASA, Cisco
routers, Juniper/Netscreen, ipf/ipfw2 (FreeBSD), pf (OpenBSD),
ipchains/iptables/ebtables (Linux),  Watchguard, 8signs (Windows), and
MS ISA Server (Windows).

- - New ?after? rule option ? For example, ?alert me after X number of
events?.  This works great with thresholding. For example, ?Alert me
after X number events, but threshold by the source address when 10
events are reached?.

- - New DNS cache system ? Ideally, you will never need this feature but
in some environments it can't be avoided.

- - Several bug fixes/code clean up (SQL direct write improved, core
thread handling changed, etc)

What's in the future for Sagan?
- -------------------------------

- - New pre-processors for log analysis for better anomaly detection.
- - Better documentation.
- - New output plug-ins.

Where is an online demo?
- -----------------------

For an online demo of Sagan and Snorby in action, please go to:
