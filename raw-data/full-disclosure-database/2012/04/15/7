Introduction:
=============
Siche search v.0.5 for Zerboard is search module to known CMS named Zeroboard

(Copy of the Vendor Homepage: http://eos.pe.kr )


Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory researcher discovered multiple web vulnerabilities in Siches Search v.0.5 Application for Zerboard.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-15:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected in Siches Search v.0.5 for Zerboard.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                          [+] ssearch.php


1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected  in Siches Search v.0.5 for Zerboard.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing 
& client-side content request manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
                                          [+] ssearch - category=&ss=1&search=


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
ssearch.php?sno=2&siche=search&page=1&sn=`[SQL Injection]&ss=`1[SQL Injection]&sm=`1&search=asd

ssearch.php?sno=1&siche=search&page=5&sn=1&ss=1&sm=1&sc=&oga=&search=hey&align=`[SQL Injection]

ssearch.php?sno=1&siche=search&page=5&sn=1&ss=1&sm=1&sc=&oga=&search=hey&
align=mt.subject&align1=ASC&category=`[SQL Injection]

1.2
The persistent script code inject can be exploited by remote attackers with medium required user inter action.

PoC:
ssearch.php?PHPSESSID=686a65552114b3d0e70c461c4c531e99&sno=1&siche=search&page=1&category=
&ss=1&search=<script>alert(vlab)</script>


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as high(+).

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
