Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher discovered multiple client side Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities on DirectAdmins Management Application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-25:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Low


Details:
========
A client side cross site scripting vulnerability is detected on DirectAdmins Management Web-Application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker with privileged user account to hijack customer/moderator/admin sessions with high required user inter 
action. Successful exploitation can result in account steal or client side context manipulation when processing affected module
application requests.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                      [+] CMD_DOMAIN  -  confirmed=Confirm&delete=yes&select0=

Picture(s):

                                      ../2.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with medium required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the client side cross site vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+).
