>>From a strictly pragmatic point of view, I find this argument complete (and somewhat compelling).  From a "moral"
standpoint it does leave a bad taste in my mouth though, as I have no illusions at all that anyone has been "converted"
from black hat to white hat (except for that single case where a bounty is being offered).  And there is the reality
then that a black hat's actions are being "rewarded" (and the possibility (already expressed on some of these lists)
that there will be a future expectation from other entities to similarly "reward" such behavior).

   anyhow, that's my $.0199999... (for whatever it's worth),
