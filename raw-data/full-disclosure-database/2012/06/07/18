Such naivety. It's charming. You have much to learn about American apathy.

There were people in the streets. They were marginalized, and made fun
of, pepper sprayed, called "entitled dirty socialists" and told to get
a job. As long as people care more about what happens on American Idol
and whoever Kim Kardashian is divorcing this week, they're not going
to care one iota about what the government is doing to some country
that probably had it coming to them in the first place. You want the
masses out in the streets with the torches and pitchforks, you're
going to have to overcome decades of being programmed to not care what
the government does anymore as long as the TV works, there's beer in
the fridge, and porn is still freely available.
