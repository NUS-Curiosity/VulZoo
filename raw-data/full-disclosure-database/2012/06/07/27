Subject: CVE-2012-2379 - Apache CXF does not verify that
 elements were signed or encrypted by a particular Supporting Token.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


CVE-2012-2379: Apache CXF does not verify that elements were signed or
encrypted by a particular Supporting Token.

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all released versions of Apache CXF.

Description:

Apache CXF currently validates WS-SecurityPolicy SignedParts,
SignedElements,
EncryptedParts and EncryptedElements policies by checking to see if the
matching elements are signed or encrypted if they are included in the
request.
However, CXF does not ensure that the elements were signed or encrypted by
a particular token, if these policies are specified as children of a
Supporting Token. For example, the following policy requires that (the
private
key associated with) an X.509 Token sign the WS-Addressing "To" header. CXF
currently checks to see whether the header was signed, but not by a X.509
Token in particular:

<sp:SupportingToken>
  <sp:X509Token sp:IncludeToken="...">...</sp:X509Token>
  <sp:SignedParts>
        <sp:Header Name="To" Namespace="http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"
/>
  </sp:SignedParts>
</sp:SupportingToken>

Note that this applies for both WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 and 1.2 policies.

This has been fixed in revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1338219&view=rev

All released versions of CXF are affected.

Migration:

Users of CXF prior to 2.4.x should upgrade to either 2.4.8, 2.5.4, or 2.6.1.
CXF 2.4.5 to 2.4.7 users should upgrade to 2.4.8 as soon as possible.
CXF 2.5.1 to 2.5.3 users should upgrade to 2.5.4 as soon as possible.
CXF 2.6.0 users should upgrade to 2.6.1 as soon as possible.
