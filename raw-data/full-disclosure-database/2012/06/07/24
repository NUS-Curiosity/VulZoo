4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Network Instruments
Observer, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS
(Denial of Service).

The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the
"CSnmp::ASN1_ReadObjIDValue()" method (NISNMP.DLL) when processing an
Object Identifier (OID) within a variable binding list. This can be
exploited to cause a limited stack-based buffer overflow and cause a
crash only via e.g. a specially crafted SetRequest SNMP datagram.

======================================================================
5) Solution 

Restrict access to trusted hosts only.
