I never thought id be agreeing with Andrew , but in this case he is
right, that's what the second amendment was written for.

However my idea is quite a bit less violent.


Stop selling these people 0 days.

Just stop.

I mean everyone here talks about how much of a threat cybercriminals are
and yet some of the people who im sure are on this list are selling
exploits to governments and they do quite a bit more harm than these
kids do.

They have turned the US Gov into the largest script kiddy clans on the net.

Until people inside the industry stop doing that i really dont think
there is any point *in* the infosec field because at this point you all
are not even trying anymore.
