We are not so savage that we decide who is powerful by military
strength.  Money plays a much bigger role in deciding power in our
society; people with money have significant influence over the military
and paramilitary police, and many make decisions that affect millions
of people every day.  Chris Dodd basically stated an expectation that
laws can be bought after PIPA and SOPA failed, as if the money the MPAA
had donated to politicians was supposed to guarantee that those
politicians would do what the MPAA tells them to do.  Armies and wars
are expensive and need to be paid for, and money is how we pay for such
things.

Law enforcement (i.e. the use of guns) is rarely needed to maintain the
power of money; most people accept the laws that surround money and try
to follow them.  People pay taxes when asked politely, they pay fines
and damages that courts assess, they repay loans when legally obligated
to so, and so forth.  Disputes over money are almost always settled
without violence and without the need to call in the police, even in
cases where people broke the law.  Even violent criminal gangs need
money, despite being in possession of guns and despite a willingness to
make use of those guns.

Alexander Dumas stated it better than I can:

"What I mean, my dear fellow, is that I shall do more by myself with my
gold than you and all your people with their daggers, their pistols,
their carbines and their blunderbusses.  So let me do it." (The Count
of Monte Cristo)
