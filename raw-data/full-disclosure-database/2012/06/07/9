The Grey Man NEVER draws attention to himself by word, dress, action, or 
mannerism. The Young Grey Man is dismissed as a wimp, the Older as a 
doddering old fool. The Grey Man derives great inner satisfaction from 
having this portrayal of himself accepted by all he meets, for it means 
he is succeeding in his disguise of his actual persona.

It helps the Survivor to build up this persona of The Grey Man gradually 
and over time. The anti-gun sheeple neighbors will quickly rat out the 
‘Patriot’ who is always loudly declaiming about his ‘Rights’ and ‘what 
will happen if they try to take my guns’. The Grey Man goes far out of 
his way never to offend anyone, imitating the duck which appears calm on 
the surface of his pond whilst paddling like hell under the surface.
