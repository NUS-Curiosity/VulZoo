Subject: CVE-2012-2378 - Apache CXF does not pick up some
 child policies of WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 SupportingToken policy assertions
 on the client side.

Hash: SHA1


CVE-2012-2378: Apache CXF does not pick up some child policies of
WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 SupportingToken policy assertions on the client side.

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

Apache CXF 2.4.5 to 2.4.7
Apache CXF 2.5.1 to 2.5.3
Apache CXF 2.6.0

Description:

None of the following child policies of a WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1
(.*)SupportingToken policy are picked up on the client side:

 - AlgorithmSuite
 - SignedParts
 - SignedElements
 - EncryptedParts
 - EncryptedElements

Note that all of these policies are picked up on the client side in the most
common use-cases, for example when an AlgorithmSuite is specified under a
security binding, or when a SignedParts Element is specified per-operation
or
per-binding. They only do not apply when a SupportingToken is used to sign
or encrypt some part or element, for example:

<sp:EndorsingSupportingToken
  xmlns:sp="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy">
  ...
  <sp:SignedParts>
        <sp:Header Name="To" Namespace="http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"
/>
  </sp:SignedParts>
</sp:EndorsingSupportingToken>

Also note that this does not apply for the WS-SecurityPolicy 1.2 namespace,
but *only* for the older WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 namespace of:

"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy".

This has been fixed in revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1337150

The versions that are affected are CXF 2.4.5 to 2.4.7, CXF 2.5.1 to 2.5.3,
and
CXF 2.6.0. The vulnerability does not exist in CXF 2.3.10, CXF 2.4.4 or
2.5.0.

Migration:

CXF 2.4.5 to 2.4.7 users should upgrade to 2.4.8 as soon as possible.
CXF 2.5.1 to 2.5.3 users should upgrade to 2.5.4 as soon as possible.
CXF 2.6.0 users should upgrade to 2.6.1 as soon as possible.
