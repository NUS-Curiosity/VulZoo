4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Network
Instruments Observer, which can be exploited by malicious people to
compromise a vulnerable system.

1) A boundary error in the "CSnmp::DecodePacket()" method (NISNMP.DLL)
when processing the community string can be exploited to cause a
heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted SNMP datagram.

2) An error in the "CSnmp::DecodePacket()" method (NISNMP.DLL) when
processing an Object Identifier (OID) can be exploited to cause a
heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted Trap PDU (0xA4)
SNMP datagram sent to UDP port 162.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of
arbitrary code, but may require the attacker to enumerate or guess
the SNMP port.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Restrict access to trusted hosts only.
