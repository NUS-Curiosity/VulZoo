Subject: Re: How to access your favorite sites in the
 event of a DNS takedown ?

As has been stated, this won't work on co-hosted sites.

The more reliable way to do this is to fake the DNS on your own machine by
adding the IP address to the HOSTS file (/etc/hosts on UNIX/Linux/Mac,
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc\hosts on most Windows boxes):

# Comment describing why you're doing this
# Format is: IPAddress list of DNS names or aliases
# DNS is down, get to my sites anyway
