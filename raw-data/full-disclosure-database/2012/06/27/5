- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
SAP

- -- Affected Products:
SAP NetWeaver

vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 12407.

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of SAP NetWeaver ABAP. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the way SAP NetWeaver handles packages with
opcode 0x43. If a package with sub opcode 0x4 contains a long parameter
value string NetWeaver will eventually write a \x00 byte onto the stack to
mark the end of the string. The location of this null byte is dependent on
user supplied data and the resulting stack corruption can lead to remote
code execution under the context of the running process.


- -- Vendor Response:
SAP has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
