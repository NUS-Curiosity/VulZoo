This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required

The specific flaw exists within he way Quicktime handles Text Track
Descriptors. Values for almost all of the text descriptors recognized by
quicktime will be read into a fixed size buffer. This can lead to a heap
based buffer overflow which can result in remote code execution under the
context of the current process.
