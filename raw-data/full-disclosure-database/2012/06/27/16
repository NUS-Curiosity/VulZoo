Hey all

He is such a bloody cheat.. Now they are trying to gain faith of people by
displaying their fake professionalism. But cheaters are always cheaters.
All mentioned addresses are fake and even everyone knows that anyone can
have virtual numbers of mentioned countries. Who cares..!! There is no Mark
and no CISO. In fact CISO never takes legal action for company. L0L

All LEORAT and LEOIMPACT is fake. Leorat.com and leoimpact.com is fake.
Stop bluffing and scamming people. and this time do not change your
identity. Leorat.com is completely scam and same identity is leoimpact.com..
scam scam scam..

leorat and leoimpact is scam
