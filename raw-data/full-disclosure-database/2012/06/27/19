I think he was referring to a DNS blockade ala SOPA.  Though the suggestion was painfully obvious (and that I pointed out the HOSTS file a few days back) it does show the level of complete ignorance on the part of any legislator who thinks a DNS blockade will, in any way, affect access to pirate sites.  

Of course, we all know it is simply record industry lobbying to make the government pay to enforce copyright infringement so that they don't have to.  It really is quite a nice scam on their part:  don't invest in any real DRM, and make someone else pay to enforce your IP.  Nice.

Hi,

The More interesting question is: how possible is a complete "DNS takedown"?

I don't feel that this is a real danger to the internet.

>>From technical Site, DNS is decentral. All the Rootservers are designed
to handle a fail/takedown of 2/3 of the dns-servers.

>>From the political Site, the current public DNS is controlled by the
ICANN and so (theoretical) by the USA. But I think, if they would abuse their force too much, this just would bring more people to alternatives like OpenNIC.

Kind Regards,
Michael
