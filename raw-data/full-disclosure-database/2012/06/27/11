 event of a DNS takedown ?

Hi,

The More interesting question is: how possible is a complete "DNS
takedown"?

I don't feel that this is a real danger to the internet.

>>From technical Site, DNS is decentral. All the Rootservers are designed
to handle a fail/takedown of 2/3 of the dns-servers.

>>From the political Site, the current public DNS is controlled by the
ICANN and so (theoretical) by the USA. But I think, if they would abuse
their force too much, this just would bring more people to alternatives
like OpenNIC.

Kind Regards,
Michael
