- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of America Online's Toolbar, Desktop, IM, and

the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the dnUpdater ActiveX Control. When
