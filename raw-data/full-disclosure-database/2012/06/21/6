Subject: Re: WordPress Authenticated File Upload
 Authorisation Bypass

to me it seems like hes trying to say that someone with administrative
access has the ability to....have administrative access. Its like
saying "Hey guys! I found a local exploit and all it requires is to be
a root user!!!"

I'm not sure if he's trolling or just stupid.
