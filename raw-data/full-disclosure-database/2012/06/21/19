- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Performance Manager. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the PMParamHandler component of Performance
Manager, which is served via an Apache Tomcat instance that listens on TCP
port 8081. The process receives a filename from a remote user and performs
insufficient validation of the provided file path. Additionally, the user
can specify an arbitrary extension due to premature truncation resulting
from an embedded null byte. Remote unauthenticated attackers can exploit
this vulnerability by sending malformed message packets to the target,
which could lead to a directory traversing arbitrary file write and
ultimately remote code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
