That tool is meant to allow an admin to upload arbitrary php plugins. You
can argue that this feature is insecure by design, but there are two
solutions from the WordPress perspective:

1) "Don't grant malicious users the permission to install plugins."
2) If you don't want this feature on your site at all, this feature can be
disabled in the config define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', TRUE);

By the way, two more "vulnerabilities" the theme installer has this same
issue and the upgrade tool could also be abused if you can poison the DNS
of the server.
