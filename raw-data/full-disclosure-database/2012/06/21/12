- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Real Helix Server. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within rn4auth.dll, which is responsible for
parsing authentication credentials. When the GetNameValuePair() function
calls strcpy, there is an unbounded copy into a stack buffer, which can
lead to stack memory corruption. An attacker can leverage this
vulnerability to execute code under the context of the process.
