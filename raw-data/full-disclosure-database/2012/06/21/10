Subject: Re: server security

I completely agree with Gage.  The way I see it, security through obscurity is perfectly valid as long as the control remains obscured.  I think the "anyone can just scan your ports" is somewhat specious in that most (if not something like 99% or so (unqualified opinion of course)) traffic is simply noise and scans for standard ports.  This is particularly true when it matters most: during a worm outbreak or a newly published vulnerability.  Attackers simply don't have the time nor the inclination to go through and perform slow and loud scans when they can quickly move on to the next target.  If 90% of the targets have services on the default ports, then it makes far more sense to just go after the easily targets.  

Perfect case-in-point is the recent RDP unpleasantness.   Non-standard port deployments were automatically removed from the target scans for 3389.  I don't see how any can argue against the security value of such a configuration.

Well thats a bit of an iffy one. I'd say it IS a security measure, albeit one that is solely effective if and only if compounded with other measures.

It's unlikely, but you never know, you just might miss out on a nasty worm all because you werent running on a  default port one day.

The only time changing ports actually hardens a service in any way is when the port requires elevated rights to bind, changing to 1025 for example removes the root requirement. Any actual or theoretical vulnerabilities still exist. If somebody is looking at your server, they'll find the port without much trouble. Alternate ports can remove junk traffic from logs, so there is a benefit, if not entirely a security one.
