Well thats a bit of an iffy one. I'd say it IS a security measure,
albeit one that is solely effective if and only if compounded with
other measures.

It's unlikely, but you never know, you just might miss out on a nasty
worm all because you werent running on a  default port one day.

The only time changing ports actually hardens a service in any way is when the port requires elevated rights to bind, changing to 1025 for example removes the root requirement. Any actual or theoretical vulnerabilities still exist. If somebody is looking at your server, they'll find the port without much trouble. Alternate ports can remove junk traffic from logs, so there is a benefit, if not entirely a security one.
