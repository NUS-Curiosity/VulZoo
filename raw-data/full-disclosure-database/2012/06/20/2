Whoever from so named leoimpact.com:
WHOIS brings fake mailing address of PO in the US, and the phone does not belong to "leorat" either.
Just shut up and stop sending fake messages. You are nothing and not having a name rats. Not a legal entity.

Hey man, that's some serious shit there - it's not a "letter," it's a "legal letter."  Those are "more letter" than the "normal letter."   Be afraid!
