	- Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1649346

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-104
  * Project: Privatemsg [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-June-20
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Privatemsg module allows users to send private messages between to each
other. The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user names when creating
messages.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it is not possible to create
insecure user names through the default user interface. The exploit is only
possible in combination with another module that allows this, such as
Realname [3] which allows site-builders to choose fields to display an
alternative username.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Privatemsg 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.3

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Privatemsg [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Privatemsg module for Drupal 7, upgrade to Privatemsg
    7.x-1.3 [5]

Also see the Privatemsg [6] project page.
