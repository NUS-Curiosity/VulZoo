Subject: Metadata exfiltration

In today's Information age, data is very crucial for every organization.
Data loss for any organization can have a very negative impact financially
as well as reputation wise. Generally organizations are aware of the
information they are revealing through different online mediums, but what
about the data that is being exposed without the knowledge of the
organization and which could be crucial from security perspective? In this
InfoSec Institute article we are going to learn about the information hidden
in the documents and files present in the public domain which could be
sensitive from security perspective and remediate this security issue.
