`Sudhanshu Chauhan is a researcher at InfoSec Institute. He is in his
final year of studies as a B.Tech (CSE). He has completed his Diploma
in Cyber Security and has earned certifications in Web Development and
Cyber Laws. `

Is this is joke? `completed his Diploma in Cyber Security` is from who
he graduate with such diploma? `has earned certifications in Web
Development and Cyber Laws.` Earned certification in Cyber Laws` is
from who? Ask.com? Web development is from who? Is must be joke.

with brainbench to make become new certification of 'Is Secuker to
spend your money' ISSYM certification. Is you make competition for ISC
