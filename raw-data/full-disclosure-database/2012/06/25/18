Is that so? As far as I know if the host has multiple websites you
need more info than just the IP. For example, my webpage
(nakerium.com) is in a shared hosting.
If I ping it it says that its IP is: 159.253.149.218
However, if I just enter that IP in my browser it just shows a random
page from my host because the server doesn't know what webpage I want
to see.
In order to see my webpage I need to enter
http://159.253.149.218/~nakerium

Most of the times it should be straightforward to add the
"/~websitename" but it depend on how the host has defined their server.
