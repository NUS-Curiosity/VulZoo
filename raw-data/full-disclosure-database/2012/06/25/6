partially true and not always the case. the servers may be co-hosted and if reached via IP address you wouldnt
be handled by the virtual hosting redirection and therefore drop onto some other site/service/catch-all... same is true if
you use alternatives to the old IPv4 - for example, I prefer to access www.wikipedia.org via 2620:0:862:ed1a::1
