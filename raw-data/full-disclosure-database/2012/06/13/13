Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-102 - Ubercart
	AJAX Cart -	Potential Disclosure of user Session ID

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1633048

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-102
  * Project: Ubercart AJAX Cart [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-June-13
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to replace the default Ubercart shopping cart block
with an AJAX-enabled one.

The module includes the user's current session ID in one of its JavaScript
settings keys on every page load which could be intercepted if the user's
connection is not over SSL.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must gain read
access to the HTML output of a page with the uc_ajax_cart block enabled in
order to potentially hijack the user's session. The issue is only known to
affect sites that use some additional form of caching for authenticated users
that shares Javascript settings values which is not a common case.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * uc_ajax_cart 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Ubercart AJAX
Cart [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the uc_ajax_cart module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to uc_ajax_cart
    6.x-2.1 [4]

Also see the Ubercart AJAX Cart [5] project page.
