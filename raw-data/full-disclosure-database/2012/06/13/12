Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-101 - Protected
	Node - Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1632918

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-101
  * Project: Protected node [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-June-13
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Protected Node module enables users to use a password to restrict access
to an individual node or all nodes of a node type.

The module doesn't sufficiently protect node access when nodes are accessed
outside of the standard node view (i.e. node/1 is protected but other lists
are not).

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Protected node 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.6.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Protected node
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Protected node module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Protected
    node 6.x-1.6 [4]

Also see the Protected node [5] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY

-------- FIXED BY

  * Alexis Wilke [7] the module maintainer

-------- COORDINATED BY
