	Redirect - Open	Redirect

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1633054

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-103
  * Project: Global Redirect [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-June-13
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Open Redirect

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module improves SEO and usability of a site by redirecting visitors to
user-friendly and search-engine-friendly URLs.

The module does not sufficiently validate that a destination URL is internal
to the site, allowing an attacker to disguise a malicious destination address
as a query parameter passed to a legitimate site URL.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a site must have the
"non-clean to clean" redirect enabled; however, this is the default
configuration.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Global Redirect 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.4.
  * Global Redirect 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Global
Redirect [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION

  * If you use the Global Redirect module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Global

    Redirect 7.x-1.4 [5]
