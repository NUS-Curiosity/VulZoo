	- Cross Site	Request Forgery (CSRF)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1632908

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-100
  * Project: SimpleMeta [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-June-13
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Simple Meta module provides a method to set meta tags, such as page
title, description and keywords for nodes, views and other pages.

The module doesn't sufficiently confirm user intent when adding and deleting
meta tag entries allowing a malicious user to trick a site admin into
deleting entries or adding inappropriate entries.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Simple meta 6.x-1.x all versions prior to 6.x-2.0.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed SimpleMeta [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Simple meta module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Simple meta
    6.x-2.0 [4]

The 6.x-1.x branch is no longer supported and all users of that branch should
upgrade to the 6.x-2.x code.

Also see the SimpleMeta [5] project page.
