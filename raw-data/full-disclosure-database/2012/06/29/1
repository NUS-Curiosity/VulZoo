TPTI-12-06: Hewlett-Packard Data Protector DtbClsAddObject Parsing Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-12-06
June 29th, 2012

- - --CVE ID
CVE-2012-0123

- - --Affected Vendors
Hewlett-Packard

- - --Affected Products
Data Protector

- - --TippingPoint(tm) IPS Customer Protection
TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by
Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 12378. For further product information

- - --Vulnerability Details
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Data Protector. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the dpwintdb.exe process which listens by
default on TCP port 3817. When parsing data within a DtbClsAddObject
request, the process copies data from the network into a fixed-length
buffer on the stack via an unchecked loop. This can be leveraged by
attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

- - --Vendor Response
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
