TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by
Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 12286. For further product information

- - -- Vulnerability Details
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle AutoVue. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page
or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the AutoVueX.ocx ActiveX object. There
exists a method SetMarkupMode() that takes an unbounded string as an
argument and copies it to a fixed-length buffer on the stack. This can lead
to memory corruption which can be leveraged to execute code under the
context of the process.

- - -- Vendor Response
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
