Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilites in Simple Forum PHP v2.1 CMS.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-10:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected in Simple Forum PHP v2.1 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in 
dbms & application compromise. The vulnerabilities are located in the forum.php and admin.php files and bound parameters 
orderType, orderBy, & p. The vulnerability in forum.php can be exploited by remote attackers without required user 
inter action or privileged user account. A privileged user account is required to the exploit the sql bug in the admin.php.

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] forum.php
				[+] admin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] orderType
				[+] orderBy
				[+] p


Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with and without privileged user account.
