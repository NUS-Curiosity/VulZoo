ubuntu apt-key (part 3)

On fully patched as of Fri Jun 15 12:33:01 EEST ubuntu 10.4
apt-key allows installing malicious trusted gpg keys using
minor abuse.

Attached is pe2, either MITM apt-key or change ARCHIVE_KEYRING_URI
in it, then do 'apt-key net-update' or wait cron to do it for you.

The poc needs some polishing on purpose.

OFFTOPIC: Someone is selling solution/keys/dev tools for this bug,
for inquiries M8R-pnkrp4 @mailinator.com
