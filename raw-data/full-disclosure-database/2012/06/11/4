Subject: Publication References on Criminalisation of
	Hacking Tools Needed

Hi Folks,


I was wondering if any of you could point out any good references (academic
preferebly) on the consequences of the Criminalisation of sales,
distribution, advertisement, and cretation of Hacking Tools (those that can
be used to facilitate a computer breach, especially software).

I have find a few and would very much apreciate any contribution.

Thank you.

Regards,

Pablo Ximenes
