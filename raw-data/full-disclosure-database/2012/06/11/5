'ls' is a user program, not a system call; system calls are entry
points into the operating system itself: basically little passage ways
into the kernel.  Having many them opens up the surface area for bugs.
 The Linux people seem to be making great strides in, ahem, 'catching
up' to Microsoft in this area, but comparing the number of options to
a non-privileged user-level program to the number of system calls in
the win32 or win64 API isn't very useful.

I totally agree.  The question is do you want to use the system that
allows you to be complex, or the one that forces you to be?

For general purpose computing, this unfortunately seems to be more or
less true.  It's a sad state of affairs.
