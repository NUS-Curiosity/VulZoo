This is the site of the Federal pay scale. It generally matches what NSA
pays, though NSA uses a little different schedule. If you scroll down to
the Washington DC area list you'll see the adjusted scale for what is paid
around Ft. Meade.

The GS 9-11 area is what is paid for new graduates in IT/CS with no
experience. The GS 10-12 area is what is generally paid for those with
graduate degrees or some experience. Generally management positions start
in GS-13 and above.
