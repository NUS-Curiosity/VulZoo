says:

 "[..] certificates issued by our Terminal Services licensing certification
authority, which are intended to only be used for license server
verification, could also be used to sign code as Microsoft. Specifically,
when an enterprise customer requests a Terminal Services activation
license, the certificate issued by Microsoft in response to the request
allows code signing without accessing Microsoftâ€™s internal PKI
infrastructure."
