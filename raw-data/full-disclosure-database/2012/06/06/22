Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-096 - Authoring
	HTML - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1619852

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-096
  * Project: Authoring HTML [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-June-06
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module creates an input format suitable for use within a WYSIWYG editor.
It adds support for the iframe HTML tag, making it friendly with the popular
iframe embeds available in popular video sites like YouTube and Vimeo. It
supports the script tag too. Both tags will only be allowed if the referred
URL is whitelisted. By default, you can refer some well known video sites in
the iframe tag and any site with the tag.

The module doesn't sufficiently verify the whitelisted hosts. This allows an
attacker to register and use a malicious host, bypassing verification.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
authorized to use the "Authoring HTML" input format.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Authoring HTML 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.1.
