I think you just identified it.  buy rifles (I have, there's a Colt M4 
Law Enforcement Carbine sitting next to me), but mortars (a bit 
difficult but not impossible to get) buy tanks (quite easy to get if you 
know where to look), and buy ammo.  DEMAND that federal firearms laws be 
revised, and specifically repeals of 18 USC 921-922.  Yet again I point 
out your VT.edu e-mail and your refusal to listen to Jefferson's 
warnings.  The man wrote your state constitution.  He wasn't kidding 
when he did it.
