ZDI-12-078 : Apple QuickTime SVQ3 Codec mb_skip_run Parsing Remote Code
Execution

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0669

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Apple

- -- Affected Products:

Apple QuickTime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Apple QuickTime handles file with
the Sorenson v3 Codec. When parsing the data inside the svq3 stream
QuickTime does not verify the value for the mb_skip_run value it reads from
the data. This value is used later as a loop counter to write data to a
heap allocation without boundary checking. This can result in a heap based
buffer overflow that can result in remote code execution under the context
of the user running the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
