	- Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1619824

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-093
  * Project: Node Embed [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-June-06
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Node Embed gives content editors an interface for selecting and embedding
nodes using a WYSIWYG editor. The interface for selecting nodes is a page
that had no access check, allowing users to view node titles they might not
have access to. This issue only affects your site if you have unpublished
nodes or use a node access module to restrict content access from some users.

---------------------------------------------------

  * Node Embed 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.5.
  * Node Embed 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.0.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Node Embed [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

  * If you use the Node Embed module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Node Embed
    6.x-1.5 [4]
