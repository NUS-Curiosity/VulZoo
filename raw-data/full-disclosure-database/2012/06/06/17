Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-092 - Organic
	Groups - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS) and Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1619810

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-092
  * Project: Organic groups [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-June-06
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Organic Groups module enables users to create and manage their own
'groups'. Each group can have subscribers, and maintains a group home page
where subscribers communicate amongst themselves.

.... Cross Site Scripting

The module doesn't sufficiently filter user supplied text when used in
connection with the Vertical Tabs module.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to create or edit a group title and the site must have
the contributed Vertical Tabs module installed and the Vertical Tabs
configuration must include the Organic Group select area (this is the default
configuration when Vertical Tabs is enabled).

.... Access bypass

The module's default views do not sufficiently check the Drupal core
permission to /access content/.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a site must have removed the
"access content" permission to all users. This is not a common configuration.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Organic groups 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.4.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Organic groups
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Organic groups module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Organic
    Groups 6.x-2.4 [4]
