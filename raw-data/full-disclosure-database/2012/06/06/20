Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-094 - Maestro
	module - Cross Site	Request Forgery (CSRF),
	Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1619830

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-094
  * Project: Maestro [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-June-06
  * Security risk: Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Maestro module is a workflow engine/solution that facilitates simple and
complex business process automation.

The module doesn't sufficiently filter user-supplied data in its admin
screens leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. A Cross Site
Request Forgery vulnerability in the control of the module could allow a user
to change workflows including injecting malicious scripts to exploit the XSS.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the maestro admin permissions or use CSRF against a user with that
permission.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * maestro 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.

module, there is nothing you need to do.
