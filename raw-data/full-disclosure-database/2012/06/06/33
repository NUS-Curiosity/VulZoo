ZDI-12-082 : Oracle Java OpenGL Arbitrary Native Library Loading Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-082
June  6, 2012

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Oracle

-- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the Java OpenGL (JOGL) library. This library is not installed by default with Java, but it is available as a signed .jar package. The affected jar files are signed with a certificate that is trusted by default JRE install and as such is downloaded and run without user interaction. Crafted Java applets can reach a call to 'LoadLibraryA' in the JOGL library that allow remote .dll files to be loaded into the JRE process. This can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current process.

-- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:
