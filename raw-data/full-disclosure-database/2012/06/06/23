  * Project: Protest [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-June-06
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Protest allows websites to display a complete page blackout (website
protest).

The module contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability as it fails to
sanitize user input before display.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer protest".

module, there is nothing you need to do.
