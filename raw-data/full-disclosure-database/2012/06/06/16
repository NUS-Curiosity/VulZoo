	Authentication - Access	bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1619808

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-091
  * Project: Tokenauth [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-June-06
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Token Authentication module provides a token for use in the URL to
authenticate users to a site.
Under certain uncommon situations, the module may not revert a user's session
properly. Depending on how tokenauth is used, this could result in subsequent
requests being performed as a user with additional privileges when they
shouldn't.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Tokenauth 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.7.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Token
Authentication [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Tokenauth module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Tokenauth
    6.x-1.7 [4]

Also see the Tokenauth [5] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY  
---------------------------------------------------------

  * John Morahan [6] of the Drupal Security Team

-------- FIXED BY  
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Adam Ross [7] the module maintainer
