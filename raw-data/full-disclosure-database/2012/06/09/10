What's the real problem Laurelai? If the US abruptly vanished, there will
be another country taking its place as the global player.

The thing is, I can't imagine another country doing a better job than the
US....not because the US is a walking saint, but because the rest of them
are no better.

Back to the subject of the US playing "dirty", who gives a shit? Security
experts of all shades have been doing it. Now that the US is taking your
place you're worried?
