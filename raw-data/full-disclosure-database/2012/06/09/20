By any chance, Jason Hellenthal, do you work for the NOVO medical group? Or
is it just NOVO1?

I'm asking, because you saying what you say there below, indicates that you
may pose a security problem for some health related medical information on
people that should be of no interest to NSA or national security.
You know, there are such things as due process. And you saying you're
willing to give access
to anyone from NSA to all systems you have access to is a pretty tall deal,
when you're the IT guy for a corporation. Someone might feel you're
betraying their trust and even working against their interest when
willingly allowing the abuse of their systems, be it for "right or wrong"
for whatever clandestine purpose.

There should be a global NO-HIRE list for guys like you.
