Subject: TrueCaller Vulnerability Allows Changing Users
	Details

TrueCaller – worldwide number search and spam filter, a top iPhone
application in many countries, enables users to search half a billion phone
numbers worldwide and much more.

The application allows users to search numbers if and only if the user
enables *Enhanced Search* feature. When enabled, the user is warned that
his contacts will be shared with other users to search and his address book
is sent to TrueCaller database. This process is done by sending the
following HTTP “*cleartext*” request:

post_contact_data=[{"REV":"","FN":"ContactName","TEL_CELL":["MobileNumber
"],”TCBID”:”Number“,”FID”:”Number
“,”TEL_WORK”:[Number],”TEL_HOME”:[],”CONTACT_ID”:”3619″,”LID”:”"}

>>From a security point of view, this is a bad security behavior and may lead
to one of the following situations:

   - *Privacy Issues*
   - *Fake Data*
   - *Enabling Enhanced Search features without having to share user’s
   Address Book*
