Package        : python-crypto
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2417

It was discovered that that the ElGamal code in PythonCrypto, a 
collection of cryptographic algorithms and protocols for Python used 
insecure insufficient prime numbers in key generation, which lead to a 
weakened signature or public key space, allowing easier brute force 
attacks on such keys.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages. After 
installing this update, previously generated keys need to be regenerated.
