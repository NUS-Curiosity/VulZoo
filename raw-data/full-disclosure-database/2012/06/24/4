For the FB'ers out there, the "Hacker News" (arguably accurate) has posted an incendiary photo alleging US soldier posing with the dead and supposedly engaged in "The Ichabod."  The funny part of it is to go through and count the number of posts that threaten the lives of Americans; each one of these poor sods' accounts are going to have their full history dumped, stored, and analyzed.

Though they didn't do it on purpose, it is a very good example of how to socially manipulate behavior.

Security isn't about thinking outside the box.
It's about not thinking yourself into it.
