Subject: Re: TrueCaller Vulnerability Allows Changing
 Users	Details

You can still submit fake data by just adding fake contacts.  And of course, the real privacy issue here is that you are sharing your freaking address book with the world.  Frankly, I’m amazed anyone would even think about doing that.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] TrueCaller Vulnerability Allows Changing Users Details


TrueCaller – worldwide number search and spam filter, a top iPhone application in many countries, enables users to search half a billion phone numbers worldwide and much more.

The application allows users to search numbers if and only if the user enables Enhanced Search feature. When enabled, the user is warned that his contacts will be shared with other users to search and his address book is sent to TrueCaller database. This process is done by sending the following HTTP “cleartext” request:

post_contact_data=[{"REV":"","FN":"ContactName","TEL_CELL":["MobileNumber"],”TCBID”:”Number“,”FID”:”Number“,”TEL_WORK”:[Number],”TEL_HOME”:[],”CONTACT_ID”:”3619″,”LID”:”"}

From a security point of view, this is a bad security behavior and may lead to one of the following situations:
·         Privacy Issues
·         Fake Data
·         Enabling Enhanced Search features without having to share user’s Address Book
