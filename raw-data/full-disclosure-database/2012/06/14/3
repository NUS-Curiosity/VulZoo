2 Vulnerability Details
=====================

Code Audit Labs http://www.vulnhunt.com has discovered a website
spoof vulnerability in Opera .When a user types a new URL for the
browser to load, the currently active page may detect when the
new page is about to load and prevent the navigation, while still
leaving the new URL displayed in the address bar. This can then be
used to spoof the URL of the target page. The malicious page would
need to employ social engineering tactics in order to guess what
page the user is likely to try to load next, as it cannot see what
 URL the user has typed.

==========
Opera Software has released Opera 12 and Opera 11.65,
where this issue has been fixed.
