Affected Products:
==================
Boonex
Product: Dolphin CMS v7.0.9


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the
Boonex Dolphin CMS v7.0.9 content management system.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script
code on the application side (persistent). The vulnerabilities
are located in the user profile Map location name & listing but also in
the unsanitized album (gallery) name & output listings.
The CMS itself allows via management function to publish vulnerable
albums (name) & profiles (location) (Public, Me, Share & Co)
which impacts a high risk. Remote attackers can exchange the persistent
malicious script code after the inject with the users
profile or album share functions. Exploitation requires low user inter
action & low privileged user account. Successful exploitation
of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or
stable (persistent) context manipulation.

Vulnerable Location(s):
[+] Profile [Location] - Location Name & Listing
[+] Album (Gallery) - Album Name & Listing

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] disignBoxFirst
[+] boxContent > dbContent


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] dbTitle
[+] bx_map_curr_loc


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with
low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Review: Album (Gallery) - Display Name

<div class="disignBoxFirst">
<div class="boxFirstHeader"><div class="dbTitle">Browse photos from album
""><[PERSISTENT SCRIPT CODE HERE!]' <"<="" div=""><div
class="dbTopMenu">

URL: http://dolphin.127.0.0.1:1337/m/photos/browse/album/[PERSISTENT
CODE AS ALBUM NAME]

Note: To reproduce the issue insert your own malicious script code as
album name and save the input.
After the save you can share the album with other users to execute the
persistent script code.


Review: Profile [Location] - Profile Map Listing

<div class="boxContent"><div class="dbContent"><div class="bx_map_curr_loc">
<b>Current Location:</b><span id="bx_map_curr_loc">"><[PERSISTENT SCRIPT
CODE HERE!]' <,="" us<="" span="">
</div>
<div id="BxMapProfile" class="bx_map bx_map_profile">
</div>

URL: http://dolphin.127.0.0.1:1337/[USERNAME]

Note: To reproduce the bug insert your own malicious script code in the
location name input field when processing to register a user.
Save the string and the script code will be executed persistent when the
admin/mod is watching the user listing or the user profile page.


Solution:
=========
2012-05-17: Vendor Fix/Patch

Note: Publicly available release v7.1.0 - Changeset 16256
Updates: http://www.boonex.com/trac/dolphin/changeset/16256



Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are
estimated as high(-).
