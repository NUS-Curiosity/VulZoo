Whilst I agree with the general consensus regarding sustenance and trolls....

Double standards are commonplace amongst governments (regardless of nation).

Please be aware I am always right no matter how wrong I may appear to be to your deluded perception.
How do I know your perception is deluded, or just plain wrong? Because it does not concur with mine.

Besides, I have god on my side, he talks to me and gives me guidance, therefore I know I am right.

;-)
