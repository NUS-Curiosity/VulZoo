Subject: Re: Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyberattacks
 Against Iran

So, a quote, from a book?  Isn't that kinda circular?

Also, there are no quotes from anyone in the room and no one is referenced except by association.  Not saying it's not true, but there's nothing there that indicates it is.  

The only people who will know if this is 100% true were in the Oval Office at the time, and those people aren't going to be quoted in a NYTimes article.
