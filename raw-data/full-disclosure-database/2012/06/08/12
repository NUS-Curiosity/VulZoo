Please don't feed the troll - the only way he can post to full-disclosure is
if somebody quotes him in.

The worst part is that Andrew's reading comprehension is as good as
always - I wasn't commenting on Stuxnet, but the move of naval forces
to the Pacific.  China isn't the only reason we might want a naval task
force over there.

And I never said I condoned it, merely pointed out alternate interpretations.

The funny thing is that Andrew was going on for a *long* time that there
is no such thing as cyber-warfare - when in fact it was going on while he
was denying it.
