ZDI-12-092 : RealNetworks RealPlayer QCELP Stream Parsing Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-092
June  8, 2012

- -- CVE ID:

CVE-2011-4247

- -- CVSS:

7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks

- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer

- -- Vulnerability Details:

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way RealPlayer handles audio encoded
with the QCELP codec. The codec allows you to specify the 'block_size' that
is used. This size is used to create an allocation to hold the data, but a
hardcoded blocksize is later used to copy data into that allocation. This
could lead to remote code execution under the context of the current user.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
