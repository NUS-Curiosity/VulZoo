Subject: Analysis: Vast IPv6 address space actually
	enables IPv6 attacks

Folks,

TechTarget has published an article I've authored for them, entitled
"Analysis: Vast IPv6 address space actually enables IPv6 attacks".

The aforementioned article is available at:
<http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/Analysis-Vast-IPv6-address-space-actually-enables-IPv6-attacks>

(FWIW, it's a human-readable version  of the IETF Internet-Draft I
published a month ago or so about IPv6 host scanning (see:
<http://www.si6networks.com/presentations/ietf.html>))

Cheers,
--
