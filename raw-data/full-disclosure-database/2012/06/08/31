Perhaps the US Government would gain better results by mass protests and
chanting peace songs.

Or perhaps it just doesn't work this way.

They shouldn't be blamed, everyone knows fighting fire with fire is very
effective, just as everyone

botnets lying about.
Can't blame them, now that someone else is using their own tools against
them.
