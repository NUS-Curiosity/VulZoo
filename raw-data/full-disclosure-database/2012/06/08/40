I don't see how Iran developing nuclear power is a threat, I'm sorry to
me this just seems like more fear mongering.

And remember the only nation that has ever shown itself *insane* enough
to actually use nuclear weapons on other human beings is the USA and
history showed the use was completely unwarranted. I don't get why we
can have literally enough nuclear weapons to wipe out all life on the
surface of the planet but Iran developing nuclear *power* is somehow a
national security threat.
