Ever hear of voter fraud? It's real popular here in the USA.

It still doesn't matter though, this country was hijacked and was taken over.

If votes really counted, Ron Paul would be our next president.

And...just a note that Americans civilians aren't blind. - We see everything. We know who the real terrorists are.

Sound or look familiar? 

Operation Northwoods was a series of false-flag proposals that originated in 1962 within the United States government, and which the Kennedy administration rejected. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or other operatives, to "commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities and elsewhere". These acts of terrorism were to be "blamed on Cuba" in order to create public support for a war against that nation, which had recently become communist under Fidel Castro. One part of Operation Northwoods was to "develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods

Nixon got re-elected at 3.6%., Reagan got re-elected at 7.5%,, Clinton at 5.4%, and Bush the II got re-elected at 5.5%.

Ford failed to get re-elected with an unemployment rate of 7.7%. Carter failed at 9.7%.  Bush the First failed  at 7.5% (even though Reagan got re-elected at that same rate).  And extending back more than 40 years, Johnson didn't get re-elected even though the rate was 3.6% or so.

So we have 4 guys that got re-elected, 4 that didn't, and  only Carter ran for re-election in a year that the rate was over 8%.  The previous president that ran for re-election with a rate that high was FDR during the Depression.

So it looks like "no president has been re-elected when the rate is over 8%"
isn't as strong a predictor as you might hope, with only one sample.  Though I'll grant it appears to be a lot harder to get re-elected if the rate is over 7% unless you have the charisma of a Ronnie.

(I got the yearly rates from here: http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104719.html
if anybody wants to do the research to find what the monthly rate in October of the elections was, feel free - short term spikes could have pushed it over 8% for Ford and Bush the First even though for the year it was under 8%.)
