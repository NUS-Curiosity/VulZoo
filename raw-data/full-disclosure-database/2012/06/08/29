There you have it folks, the best argument the so called experts could
come up with as to why we shouldn't do anything about this is name
calling and half baked attempts at derailing the conversation and more
spelling errors than a 5th graders book report.

I must have hit a nerve or something, makes me wonder if im speaking to
the very people selling the zero day exploits. You wouldn't be having a
guilty conscience or anything would you all? Worried we might put a stop
to your gravy train perhaps?

Now back on topic, those of us who actually have a soul should work
together to find a good solution.

Anyone interested feel free to email me.
