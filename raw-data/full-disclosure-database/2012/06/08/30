Derail? I ask valid question.

Hit nerve? Not in is my book. All exploit is I make I hoard is like
American TV show Hoarders Buried Alive. I has so many zero day exploit
I is now count in negative. So now I has -108 days and is money for to
buy is you ask? American, Chinese, Russian, and is Euro countries. All
is government and is company spy on company. Is beautiful life. Is
like arms race, never die.

Is your comment on soul is opinion. Speak religion (soul) where is I
believe, no soul. Dirt. Cavemen we is rise, dirt we is go. Evilution
little Wesley. I ask valid question. You change name, sex, etc., when
you is serve Army, you was one person. Person no longer here. Here as
in is someone with social security, someone is identifiable. No.
Person speak is Laurelai, not Wesley therefore is question I make
valid. You (Laurelai) has never served in Army is otherwise you would
is has camaraderie. Is respect for others is serve now, has served in
past, have died. You is slap everyone in face for go against the
country you is once swore to defend. Hypocrisy is plus narcissism.
