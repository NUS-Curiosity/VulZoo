Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
The SolarWinds Orion Network Performance Monitor 9.1 and prior
contains a blind SQL injection flaw on the 'Login.asp' page. An
attacker can leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary SQL commands and
extract sensitive information from the backend database using standard
blind SQL injection exploitation techniques.

This vulnerability applies to installations that have been upgraded
from version 9.1 or prior. Fresh installations and migrations starting
with version 9.5 do not contain this vulnerability.

Solution Description
--------------------
SolarWinds has addressed the issue in releases subsequent to and
including version 9.5 and has provided the following options to
resolve the issue:

1. Upgrade to the latest version of Network Performance Monitor
2. Manually delete the 'Login.asp' page from the vulnerable
installation â€“ the vulnerable page has not been used for several
versions but does not get removed through the application of upgrades.

Please contact SolarWinds support for assistance in addressing the
issue.
