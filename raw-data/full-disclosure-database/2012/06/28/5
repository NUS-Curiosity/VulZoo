Subject: Vulnerabilities in LIOOSYS CMS

Hello list!

CMS.

These are SQL Injection and Information Leakage vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:

Vulnerable are all versions of the system, except the last one, which was
released by developers after my informing. Where they've fixed these
vulnerabilities in their CMS. But there are a lot of other vulnerabilities
in this CMS.

SQL Injection (WASC-19):

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

Leakage of a log of DB requests errors. It can be used for getting 
information about DB structure and at conducting of SQL Injection attacks 
(because error messages aren't shown at pages of a site).
