The answer is "yes" and "no":
- Yes - because, that kind of attitude coming from a big software
   vendor with a large users base seems to be rare these days. Also, in
   the past we haven't experienced any issues with the company.
- No - because we are aware that different vendors may act differently
   in response to the information received about security flaws in their
   products. That's one of the reasons behind our disclosure policy,
   vendors status and legal threats pages.

Thank you.
