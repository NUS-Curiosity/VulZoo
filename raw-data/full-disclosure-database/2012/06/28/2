- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists because Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter

ImageUpload.ashx. The uploaded files will not be stripped of their file
extensions and the directory where they are uploaded to has no scripting
restrictions. This flaw can lead the remote code execution under the
context of the user running the IP Office Customer Call Reporter, usually
NETWORK SERVICE.
