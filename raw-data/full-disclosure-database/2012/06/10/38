this is wrong in fact, and understanding.

factually other state driven malware has targeted OSX, iOS, Android,
many other popular operating systems. the cost of exploit development
varies significantly between them, yet they are all vulnerable
targets.

your understanding is flawed in that at root these are well funded,
highly skilled, large resource entities able to position effective
attacks at multiple points around / within a target. if you are using
another OS distribution they may only get 2 vectors instead of 12; not
exactly a winning strategy for such a blanket statement.

defending against large resource attackers a very long tangent, too
long for this margin.
 ... more a method and practice of continuous learning,
  eventually making you harder nut to crack than others ;P
