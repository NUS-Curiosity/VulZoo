more fun reading, if you're curious:

"Exploiting Lawful Intercept to Wiretap the Internet"
http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Cross_Tom/BlackHat-DC-2010-Cross-Attacking-LawfulI-Intercept-slides.pdf

"Lawful Interception and Countermeasures"
http://web.it.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/080922-Romanidis_Evripidis-with-cover.pdf


... and, there are rumors VUPEN got hacked a few days ago. their
