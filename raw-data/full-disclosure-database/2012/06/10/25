I am a bit surprised by the direction of this conversation and I have
been waiting for someone to say the obvious in regards to protecting
yourself from .gov malware, it really is quite simple if you think about
it. Stuxnet, duqu, flame, ect.. all only run on windows platforms. If
the people you are protecting are concerned about that kind of malware
(and they should be) it would be a great time to tell them about
GNU/Linux, BSD, ect..
