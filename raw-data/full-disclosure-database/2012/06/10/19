Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2386

The Phar extension for PHP does not properly handle crafted tar files,
leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.  PHP applications processing
tar files could crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.

In addition, this update addresses a regression which caused a crash
when accessing a global object that is returned as $this from __get.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze13.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.4.4~rc1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
