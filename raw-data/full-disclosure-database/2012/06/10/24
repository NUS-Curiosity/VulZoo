It is not clear to me that these were CALEA components, as opposed to
some similar law in Greece or the UK (where Vodaphone is based).  Are
there examples of this sort of thing happening in the US, using CALEA
equipment?  Alternatively, is it clear that the Greek equipment was
built to US standard i.e. that all CALEA requirements are already met
by that equipment?

Again, I have little doubt that CALEA functionality has been abused by
criminals, I just do not know of any well-publicized cases that I can
point to.
