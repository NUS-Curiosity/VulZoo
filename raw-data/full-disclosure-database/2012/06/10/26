OK, I'll bite this one time.  I assert you are blatantly lying about military service.  How about tell me your service dates?  Surely you can't consider that any sort of privacy breach.

This is an easy way for us to be done with the whole thing.  Part of your diatribe is based on your "right" to bitch because of your military service.  I, again, assert that is complete fabrication.  As someone who actually HAS done work for the government I know (as you should) that your military service records are actually public record.  I don't need your service dates, but it will help.  All I need do is fax over form SF-180, and they'll verify your service.

If you really did serve, I'll apologize publically.  If you didn't (or don't provide the information) then we'll all know you are just a lying nutjob and we can ignore you from now on.  Is that fair enough?

I dont listen to either. And sorry to burst your bubble but I did serve 10 years in the army.

Next I imagine you will insult my gender identity or something equally silly. For the record you should capitalize the first word of each sentence and put a punctuation mark at the end, not doing this just makes you look uneducated and ensures people do not take you seriously.
