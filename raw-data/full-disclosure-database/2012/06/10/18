It was never confirmed whether the infamous NSAKEY was an actual backdoor, or
just a hilariously poorly named variable.  In any case, even if it was a
backdoor, it's certainly not the same "legal" status as CALEA, where Federal
law said "ISPs Will Provide A Law Enforcement Tap". A lot of universities
which had just finished positioning themselves as ISPs in order to qualify for
the 17 USC 512 copyright "safe harbor" provisions, ended up doing a 180 degree
turn and said "Not An ISP - Private Network" so they wouldn't have to meet the
CALEA requirements. (An amazing number of .edu's ended up a "private net' for
CALEA purposes, but kept things in place for the safe harbor stuff as well.
Fortunately, nobody's ever pushed the issue).

If NSAKEY was a backdoor, it was at best a quasi-legal one, and I'm positive
that everybody at both Microsoft and the NSA would prefer that their roles in
the story never came to light.
