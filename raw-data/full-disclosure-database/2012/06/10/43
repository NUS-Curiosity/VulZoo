Which would do little to protect anyone.  Do you really think that
GNU/Linux would be a more difficult target for the NSA (or whichever
agencies were responsible -- I would guess the NSA, but there may be
others)?  GNU/Linux machines are compromised by criminals all the time,
and the majority of people would not be willing to put in the effort
needed to keep their system secure.

There are probably a bunch of remote exploits in the Linux kernel, in
Firefox and Chrome, in OpenSSL and NSS, in Ghostscript, and in any of
the thousands of other packages that will be installed on a typical
GNU/Linux system.

There is no magic bullet here.  Security is not about running the right
OS, it is about running your OS the right way (and more).  Telling
people that using GNU/Linux will make them safe is silly.
