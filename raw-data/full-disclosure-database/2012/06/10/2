AV industry vows to become better detectors,
 find and reverse; you get million dollar vuln R&D for free!
incident response, analyze and sell to ZDI *grin*

am-pro white/grey hatters and black alike - raise your game. find holes first.
 government and private sector are making you look bad :/
beat them to punch - leave no pickings or path to arb exec!

developers: much has been and yet to say to you,
 alas you know your plentiful failures well. :P

end users! you can,   you could, ... you...
 well, you're all pretty fucked given the current state of things.
try voting with your wallet!
 sadly that implies you know what sucks and what doesn't.
a criteria disturbingly more complicated than it should be :(


and industry? industry is slave to profit. security and quality not a
priority until it is a monetary priority with plenty of blame to go
around throughout and external to your average organization.


this doesn't mean all is lost, acute despair
  moribund comedy abounds all around :P
