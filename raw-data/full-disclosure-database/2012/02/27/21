I think you didn't understood the content of the advisory.
If there are 10 non-root users in an Ubuntu machine for example,
if user 1 is using pidgin with OTR compiled with DBUS, then user 2 to 10
can see what user 1 pidgin conversation.

"Simple" as that, without impersonating user 1 or knowing his password.
