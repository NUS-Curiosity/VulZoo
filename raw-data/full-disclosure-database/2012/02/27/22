Package        : puppet
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1053 CVE-2012-1054

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management tool.

CVE-2012-1053
	Puppet runs execs with an unintended group privileges,
	potentially leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2012-1054
	The k5login type writes to untrusted locations,
	enabling local users to escalate their privileges
	if the k5login type is used.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6.2-5+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.7.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
