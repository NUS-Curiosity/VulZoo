Subject: Soft skills needed for an information security
	career?

Two people can interview for a position who look to be nearly equal in terms
of experience, yet a hiring manager comes away with a strong recommendation
to hire one and not the other. Or sometimes there are even instances in
which someone may appear to be even stronger in terms of experience and
training, and yet someone else gets the job. Setting aside potential
discrimination issues, a very valid difference could be what some would call
soft skills, or behavioral skills. These skills are the intangibles that
really pull everything together and drive someone's success or failure in a
role.
