Subject: DeepSec "Sector v6" - Call for Papers

--- DeepSec 2012 "Sector v6" - Call for Papers

We are looking for talks and trainings for the DeepSec In-Depth
Security Conference 2012 ("Sector 6"). We invite researchers,
developers, auditors and everyone else dealing with information
security to submit their work. We offer slots for talks and workshops,
and we encourage everyone working on projects to present their results
and findings.

Please visit our updated website for more details about the venue, the
schedule and information about our past conferences:
https://deepsec.net/

The DeepSec offers a mix of different topics and aspects like current
threats and vulnerabilities, social engineering and psychological
aspects as well as security management and philosophy. Our speakers and
trainers traditionally come from the security community, companies,
hacker spaces, journalism and academic organisations.

You can submit content for three categories:
- Talks for the conference (45 minute slots)
- Two day workshops
- U21 (a special category for young security researchers)

https://deepsec.net/cfp

--- Talks:
To make it short, talks should be up-to-date, of a high quality that
matches our previous years and preferably exclusive (which of course is
not a hard requirement but it will be one evaluation criterion). Topics
from all security disciplines are welcome but we encourage you to
submit talks about emerging technologies and concepts like these (in
alphabetical order):
- Cloud computing and virtualisation
- Design flaws ("defective by design" or even "secure by design")
- IPv6 (again, until protocol designers get it right)
- Mobile computing and communications
- Risk assessment
- Security intelligence
- Security management and IT governance
- Topics that have a high impact on IT security

Talks must not:
- Endorse products, vendors or specific solutions
- Discredit anyone or anything, let's be fair

Speaker privileges:
- Free entrance to the conference
- Hotel accommodation for three nights (single/double room)
- Travel expenses up to EUR 800,-
- Invitation to our famous Speaker's Dinner with genuine Austrian food

--- Workshops:
We look for highest quality and most current topics. We had very good
feedback for our workshops in the past and we want to keep it that way.
Our audience has a very high level of technical understanding and is
deeply involved with security management, implementation, operation and
research.
What we like to see:
- Applied cryptography
- In-depth workshops on securing infrastructure or systems therein
- Mobile communications, vulnerabilities and defences
- Protocol and software development/design
- Social engineering and psychological aspects

Workshops should not:
- Cover too much (two days sounds a lot, but isn't)
- Focus on specific vendors or products
- Teach too much basic stuff (keep the level sufficiently high)

Trainer privileges:
- Free entrance to the conference
- Invitation to our famous Speaker's Dinner with Austrian food
- 50% of the net profit of your class

--- U21 category:
We don't take the age so serious as it might sound but this category is
especially for young security researchers who are *not* working in a
professional sense yet, e.g. (full-time) students, or attending college,
technical school or just interested in computer security. We will also
accept submissions if you are a little bit older than 21 years.
Don't be shy if your idea is not groundbreaking or not the top
vulnerability discovered in the last 5 years. There's always room for
some extra hacking and we'd be happy to provide a basis for
breakthroughs. :)
We want to encourage you to submit your _own_ research.
We will ask some questions and evaluate your submission, so don't cheat.
What we like to see:
- anything that is your own idea and/or implementation
- a valuable extension to existing ideas and/or implementations
- anything you have discovered on your own and is not discussed a lot
yet or has been accepted as a CVE (common exploit and vulnerability)

Please don't:
- Implement something which has been around for long
- Reuse something existing

U21 privileges:
- A 15 minute lightning talk on the conference
- Free entrance to the conference
- Invitation to the Speaker's Dinner, but no alocohol without age
check ;)
- We help you with your travel expenses to Vienna, but cannot cover the
full speakers allowance, if in doubt talk to us we can work something
out.

All CfP submissions must go through the form on our web site:
https://deepsec.net/cfp.html

Please make sure that you read http://blog.deepsec.net/?p=294 before
submitting your ideas. Practice is never a bad thing. :)

We will support anyone if you have question, need clarification
whatever, just contact us for additional questions: cfp@...psec.net
