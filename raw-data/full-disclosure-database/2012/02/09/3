> In some cases, a cross site scripting vulnerability in a given site can affect a large user base and the code is custom to the business.  As an example, a cross site scripting issue in gmail is probably more catastrophic than a cross site scripting vuln in some half-rate CMS.  Not to mention there's the other situation where small website design shops repackage other open source code, brand it as part of their offering, and never provide updates to their customers.
