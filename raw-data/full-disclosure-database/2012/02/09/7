Subject: Re: posting xss notifications in sites vs
	software packages

Typically if you are in the US, are testing a server in the US owned by a
company headquartered in the US it is legal to find Reflective XSS so long
as you don't crash any services. Crashing any services can be seen as a DoS
attack and then you are screwed. Moreover if you crash a service and cost
the company more than 5k USD then you have a risk of the FBI trying you for
cybercrime.


*I DO NOT CONDONE TESTING SITES YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO TEST*
