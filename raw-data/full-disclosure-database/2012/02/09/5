Subject: Iran is doing ip-and-port filtering of SSL

I have pretty definitive proof that Iran is doing ip-and-port based
filtering of SSL.

Filtering is being done by 217.218.154.250 after a hop through
217.219.96.120 / 217.219.96.132. This hop is after my source's ISP,
and all three IPs are owned by ITC, Iran's central telco.

Filtering targets all google.com IPs, some but not all torproject.org
IPs, probably more. Haven't attempted a broad scan. It's a simple
connection drop; filtered connections just time out.

It is not based on SSL handshake signature; testing SSL on nonstandard
ports worked successfully, and testing non-SSL on :443 of target IPs
was blocked.

I'm not sharing screencaps in order to protect my source, but tests
included TCP traceroutes on different IP/port combinations and some
simple use of curl.

Cheers,
Sai
