Subject: Re: Arbitrary DDoS PoC

If the design is broken than the implementation is broken. Have you READ
your own source code? Do you understand what its actually doing? Rhetorical
questions of course but still.

Your poc calls curl multiple times via a list of proxies. No more, no less.
If you are going to claim that such a thing is an effective general
technique YOU have to back up that claim, not me or anyone else on this
list. I never bothered running it because anyone who read that simple
python code(which was a good thing its simple), can understand what it is
doing, and do a mental comparison to what they previously knew about the
subject of dos. Your poc does not demonstrate anything new, it demonstrates
existing knowledge that is generally known to not be an effective method
for dosing for all the reasons I explained in my previous mails.

I think its quite pedantic of you to only criticize me for calling out the
ineffectiveness of your poc. You did not address anything I or anyone else
said about your claim. If you think I am wrong or mistaken in my personal
assessment of your claim than you are the one who must show how and why to
defend your claim. Belittling someone who criticizes you is not
professional, not productive, does not give strength to your claim, and
does not make you right.

The end of the line is I don't care what you claim your code does, I care
about what the code does, and your code is not an effective general
technique for denial of service attacks.
