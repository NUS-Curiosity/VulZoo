Subject: Re: Arbitrary DDoS PoC

I could argue that an attack targeted at a service, especially HTTP, is 
not measured by the band, but the requests, especially the heavier, 
could argue that a technique is the most inherent characteristic of 
multiple sources of traffic and still relying on trust. I could still 
say that is an implementation that relates only to say - Look, it 
exists!, I could still prolong explaining about overheads, and using 
about the same time many sites that make the requests, thus reducing the 
wake of a failure, even if you say easily diagnosable.

But I'd rather say that it is actually very pedantic of you label 
something as inefficient, especially when not done a single test, only 
the pedantic observation of someone whose interests it is reprehensible. 
I will not say you're one of those, but this is really an attitude 
typical of this kind, which is certainly not a hacker. Thanks to people 
like that, do not know if you like, there are many flaws yet to be explored.

If anyone wants more information, obviously I will ask to send an email 
or call me to give a presentation, I will not think about anything. My 
goal in was invited researchers to study DDoS on this model, because 
anytime someone can direct thousands to generate a network congestion.
