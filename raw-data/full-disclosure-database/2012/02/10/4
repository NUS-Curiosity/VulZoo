 software packages

Well....in Germany...our law regarding security in general is very, very
vague.

It basically says that you have to go to prison if you produce or
publish any information
and/or tools (for so-called "hacking-purposes") in preparation for a
criminal offense.
And: if you get unauthorized access to data which is specially secured
by evading the
security mechanisms.

But The European Expert Group for IT Security says that especially the
first part does not apply if you're dealing with information and tools
in a good-natured way using e.g. a detailed reporting or documentation.
So i think it's hard to say if looking for a custom website
vulnerability (and finally not using it for bad purposes) is
illegal...at least it depends on how the judge defines "criminal
offense" and interprets your behavior.

@Valdis:
Therefor: agree :)

Julien.
