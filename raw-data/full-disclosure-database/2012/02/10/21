Hello list!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in D-Link DAP 1150 
(Wi-Fi Access Point and Router).

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery, Denial of Service and Cross-Site 
Scripting vulnerabilities. This is my fourth advisory from series of 
advisories about vulnerabilities in D-Link products.

These vulnerabilities are in device admin panel in Access Point mode. In 
Router mode there are many new sections appear in admin panel which are 
vulnerable to CSRF and XSS.
