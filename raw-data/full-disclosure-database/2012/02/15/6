The following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids have been
assigned to identify them:

CVE-2012-0210:

    processing .dsc and .changes files, it is possible to execute
    arbitrary code and disclose system information.

    Raphael Geissert discovered that it is possible to inject or modify
    arguments of external commands when processing source packages with
    specially-named tarballs in the top-level directory of the .orig
    tarball, allowing arbitrary code execution.

    a specially-named file, allowing arbitrary code execution.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.69+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.
