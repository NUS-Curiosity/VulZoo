	- Number of requests processes by the kernel
	- Average time to complete the request
	- Outstanding requests
	- Users connected to the kernel process (if applicable)

This information is displayed in the SAW or Server Manager applications. This is critical to monitoring the health of the EnterpriseOne kernels and
providing a view into how the system is executing .” JD Edwards EnterpriseOne. The complete reference.  - Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies
