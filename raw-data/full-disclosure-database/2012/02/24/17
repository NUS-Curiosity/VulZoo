Subject: Known compromises of OpenVZ/Parallels Virtuozzo
	containers

I have been researching the security record of OpenVZ and Parallels
Virtuozzo and it appears quite good. I am curious as to whether there
have been any known compromises or in-the-wild exploits (ever) that have
allowed someone to break out of a container and compromise the host node.

Note that I would not count exploits *of* the host node, such as via a
bad PHP script installed there. I'm looking for any case where someone
has been able -- with only access to a container -- to break out.
