Hi James,

I've found that using the Shadow Server network/ASN reports is very useful,
depending on what analysis you are trying to do.

http://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Involve/GetReportsOnYourNetwork

I.e.
 - Detected Botnet Command and Control servers
 - Infected systems (drones)
 - DDoS attacks (source and victim)
 - Scans
 - Clickfraud
 - Compromised hosts
 - Proxies
 - Spam relays
 - Malicious software droppers and other related information.
 - Compromised hosts

 - Spam relays
 - Malicious software droppers and other related information.

You could always create your own honeypot and/or partner with one of the
carriers/ISP's to get live data.


Thanks
Derek
