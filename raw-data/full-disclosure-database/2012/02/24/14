Hi folks,

as the programmer of hydra, some comments on this ...

yes, multiprocessing is faster than threads, and threads used
intelligently are faster than forking - but ... for network login
hacking that is not the bottleneck and its not where optimization helps
anything.

the secret of being fast is how you balance the connections to the
network services and skipping parts of the protocols which are not
essential.

thats why hydra is the fastest one out there (own biased testing ;-)
http://thc.org/thc-hydra/network_password_cracker_comparison.html )
although it uses forking. go figure.
hydra got more stable and faster when I rewrote the balancing engine in
v7, the v7.2 is now the fastest and is very stable.

(why forking? because when it was written the goal was to be able to run
on any platform, even on esoteric platforms like ultrix 4, MVS
openedition etc. - and it did. In today's monocultures that a less
useful feature, I agree)

have you read the code of the named tools?
hydra does multiple password attempts in the connection if the protocol
supports it - the competitors do so too I'd guess, medusa and ncrack use
threading or parallel socketing - and rgw false negatives/positives ...
you will have them too, because its always interpretation of results.

post some speed comparison and show that your tool is ruling :-)
competition makes the tools better.

Greets,
