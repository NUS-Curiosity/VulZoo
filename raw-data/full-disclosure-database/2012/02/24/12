This is not the simplistic issue with clear moral blacks and whites
that you seem to think it is.

Companies need MitM certs to fully implement DLP and protect
proprietary data - HR info, trade secrets, unpublished financials.
Without them, SSL-protected external sites are potentially
back-channels for the leakage of anything someone decides to leak.
Workers don't understand what the lines are between work-related and
personal network usage.  Companies would be suicidal to just give up
on this.

So, what would you propose as an alternative?
