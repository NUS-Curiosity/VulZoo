- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java Webstart. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within javaws.exe . Java Web Start does not
safely handle double quotes that are placed anywhere except the
beginning of certain property names in JNLP files. As a result, double
quotes can be used to inject arbitrary command-line arguments into a
javaw.exe process. Leveraging this would allow a remote attacker to
execute code under the context of the user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
