- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows Media Player. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of ASX meta files. When the
code within wmp.dll attempts to process the version string within a meta
file, it copies it to a fixed-length buffer on the stack without
checking that the destination can contain the input data. This can be
abused remotely by attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context
of the user running the media application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
