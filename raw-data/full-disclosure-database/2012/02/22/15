As an interesting crypto research item, it's actually very good work.

However, for those of us in the trenches, it's mostly a non-issue, actually -
see Dan Kaminsky's analysis of the actual situation:
http://dankaminsky.com/2012/02/17/primalfear/

Bottom line: The bug allows you to MITM the same embedded webservers
in routers and wireless boxes that you were *already* able to easily MITM
because the devices used self-signed certs and other crappy key management
issues.
