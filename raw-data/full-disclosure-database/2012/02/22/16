Subject: Pros and cons of 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
	header?

Does 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header provide any benefits in
defending against cross site scripting attacks?

Doesn't 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header make any XSS flaw
trivially exploitable? For example, if an attacker finds an XSS flaw
in a web application, he can now inject a JavaScript with
XMLHttpRequest that sends a request to attacker's web server which
serves resources with the HTTP header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
*". The browser would see this header and fetch the resource from the
attacker's web server.

Isn't the web a safer place without this header?
