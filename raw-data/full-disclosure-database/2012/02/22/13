anyone who cares about proper key generation uses a hardware entropy
source. they put them in CPUs, they provide them on motherboards. they
make them very high throughput so your /dev/urandom will never block
no matter what the task.

hwrandom -> egd -> /dev/[u]random always filled at boot and ever
after... SOLVED.

anything less is asking for failure.
