- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious page or
open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within MSHTML, specifically the handling of an HTML time
t:MEDIA element. A t:MEDIA element can be manipulated such that when the
page is refreshed a reference to a freed CDispNode object remains
allowing the repurpose of this region.  A remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
process.
