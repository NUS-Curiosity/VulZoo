TPTI-12-01 : Oracle Java True Type Font IDEF Opcode Parsing Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-12-01
February 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

Oracle



- -- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Java handles True Type Font
files. When reading a font file, Java will use the MaxInstructionSize
from the maxp table to create a heap memory location to store all the
Instruction Definition found in the Font Program 'fpgm' table.
However, when Java encounters an IDEF opcode (0x89) in the opcode
stream it never checks the size of the MaxInstructionSize which can
result in a heap buffer overflow. This can lead to remote code
execution under the context of the current process.

- -- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
