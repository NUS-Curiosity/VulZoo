ZDI-12-032 : Oracle Java Runtime Environment readMabCurveData Integer
Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-032
February 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Oracle



- -- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle's Java Runtime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses structures
for a specific tag descriptor with a specific ICC color profile. When
handling a field from this structure, the application will incorrectly
check for signedness and then perform an operation on it. This will then
get passed to an allocation. Immediately following this, the application
will use a different size to initialize the allocation. This can lead to
a controllable memory corruption which can be leveraged to achieve code
execution under the context of the applicaiton.

- -- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
