Hi Jeff,

True, any file can be loaded this way, but our pretty extensive experimenting showed
extremely few cases where legitimate applications (in this case mostly installers)
loaded anything other than <something>.dll. The operating assumption here is that the
initial executable (installer) is friendly but whatever it loads with LoadLibrary*
can be potentially malicious. The attacker can therefore not choose which file the
initial executable will load with LoadLibrary* but must plant a file that the
executable is already set to load.

Certainly. In the mean time, "del Downloads\*" is a free and efficient superset of
that ;-)

Cheers,
