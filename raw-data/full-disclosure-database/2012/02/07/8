Introduction:
=============
Sun Microsystems, Inc. was a company that sold computers, computer components, computer software, and information 
technology services. Sun was founded on February 24, 1982. At its height, Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara, 
California (part of Silicon Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center.

On January 27, 2010, Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation for US$7.4 billion, based on an agreement signed on 
April 20, 2009. The following month, Sun Microsystems, Inc. was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become 
Oracle America, Inc.Sun products included computer servers and workstations based on its own SPARC processors as 
well as AMD s Opteron and Intel s Xeon processors; storage systems; and, a suite of software products including 
the Solaris operating system, developer tools, Web infrastructure software, and identity management applications. 
Other technologies included the Java platform, MySQL, and NFS. Sun was a proponent of open systems in general and 
Unix in particular, and a major contributor to open source software. Sun s main manufacturing facilities were 
located in Hillsboro, Oregon and Linlithgow, Scotland.

Die Java-Technik (englisch Java Technology) ist eine ursprünglich von Sun entwickelte Sammlung von Spezifikationen, 
die einerseits die Programmiersprache Java und andererseits verschiedene Laufzeitumgebungen für Computerprogramme 
definieren. Diese Computerprogramme werden meistens in Java geschrieben.

Die Java-Technik besteht aus den folgenden Bestandteilen:

    die Programmiersprache Java, um Programme zu formulieren
    das „Open Java Development Kit“ – ein Entwicklungswerkzeug das grundlegende Teile, wie einen Übersetzer und Bibliotheken, enthält
    die Java-Laufzeitumgebung – eine standardisierte Software-Plattform um die entwickelten Programme ausführen zu können.
