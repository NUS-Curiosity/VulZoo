Presentation Title Is the Pen Still Mightier Than the Sword?
Presentation Abstract

In ancient Greece, Euripides warned that the tongue was sharper than the blade. In the Internet era, does 
the adage hold true? Julian Assange might agree, but what about the unknown author of Stuxnet? Access to 
information is nice, but the audience must have electricity to download and display the data. In this 
presentation, Dr. Geers will compare and contrast the national security implications of Wikileaks -- 
the new pen, and Stuxnet -- the new sword.
