Mobile malware is becoming a larger concern every day, as the proliferation of smartphones continues and more and 
more in-the-wild malicious applications appear. Unfortunately, many people charged with malware analysis and/or 
network defense lack the tools or the know-how to analyze malicious binaries on anything but a standard Windows/x86 
environment – and thus mobile malware remains shrouded in mystery, with inadequate response compared to traditional 
desktop-based malware.

This presentation aims to combat that problem. I’ll explain the process of setting up a virtual machine capable of 
running and analyzing Android applications (chosen as the mobile platform most likely to see new malware), and then 
step through analysis of live samples collected from the wild. The analysis will focus primarily on network behavior 
that can be used to detect infected devices – something whose usefulness is not limited to cell phone carriers, given 
the number of mobile devices that communicate over local Wi-Fi networks.
