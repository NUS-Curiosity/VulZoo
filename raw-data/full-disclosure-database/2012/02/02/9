Subject: GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) publication
	changes

Like other Linux distribution vendors, Gentoo is currently CC'ing advisories 
to the full-disclosure and bugtraq mailing lists.
Starting today, we will be *no longer* publishing our advisories to full-
disclosure or bugtraq.
We are following our colleagues at Ubuntu with this decision.

Users who want to receive advisories via email in the future should subscribe 
to the gentoo-announce mailing list, as described here:
  http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml

We also offer an RDF feed at
  http://www.gentoo.org/rdf/en/glsa-index.rdf

Finally, our security notices are posted to our forums at
  https://forums.gentoo.org/viewforum-f-16.html

All past and new advisories can be viewed at
  http://glsa.gentoo.org/

Please contact security@...too.org with any questions.
