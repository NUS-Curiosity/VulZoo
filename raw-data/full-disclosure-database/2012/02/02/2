Subject: Fwd: IPv6 RA-Guard: Advice on the implementation
	(feedback requested)

Folks,

We have talked about this one quite a few times (including
<http://blog.si6networks.com/2011/09/router-advertisement-guard-ra-guard.html>).
-- still, most implementations remain broken.

If you care to get this fixed, please provide feedback about this I-D on
the IETF *v6ops* mailing-list <v6ops@...f.org>, and CC me if possible.

Thanks!

Best regards,
Fernando

Folks,

We have just published a revision of our I-D "Implementation Advice for
IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard)"
<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-gont-v6ops-ra-guard-implementation-01.txt>.

In essence, this is the problem statement, and what this I-D is about:

* RA-Guard is essential to have feature parity with IPv4.

* Most (all?) existing RA-Guard implementations can be trivially evaded:
if the attacker includes extension headers in his packets, the RA-Guard
devices fail to identify the Router Advertisement messages. -- For
instance, THC's "IPv6 attack suite" (<http://www.thc.org/thc-ipv6/>)
contains tools that can evade RA-Guard as indicated.

* The I-D discusses this problem, and provides advice on how to
implement RA-Guard, such that the aforementioned vulnerabilities are
eliminated, we have an effective RA-Guard device, and hence
feature-parity with IPv4.

We'd like feedback on this I-D, including high-level comments on whether
you support the proposal in this I-D.

Thanks!

Best regards,
