Subject: hackers.it disappeared from google search results

Hello guys,

Since few days my domain is out for first tests ..but today
it is totally disappeared from Google search results. 

Do you know how this can happen? 

It has no malwares, exploits or anything illegal and there is neither
the intent as you can read in the few pages. 

the domain is hackers.it 

Any help in understanding would be appreciated.
Thanks

Davide
