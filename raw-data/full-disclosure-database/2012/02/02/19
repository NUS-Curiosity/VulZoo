Subject: Re: hackers.it disappeared from google search
 results

yes i know robots are not specified properly, 
I am going to update the pages, but the point is that searching
*site:hackers.it*
you do not have any results, while since yesterday yes.
(the update was done quite a week ago..)

If it is all due to this mistake, i would be
very happy, and will give some time to serious SEO studies 

.D
