Judging from the screenshot, it seems to be a reflected XSS through the
User-Agent field.
I would be curious how could this be exploited from the client side as you
can't manipulate other visitors User-Agent header.
Of course if the User-Agent is logged and the admin area which displays the
logs has the same defect, then this is a different story.
