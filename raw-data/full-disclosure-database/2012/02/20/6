Subject: pcAnywhere Leaked Source Code - An Anonymous
	Review

DISCLAIMER: InfoSec Institute received an anonymous submission concerning
the leaked pcAnywhere source code. The article is published here, we have
redacted any code snippets or other pieces of source code that were included
in the original article. Otherwise it has been left unedited/unaltered. 

 

The pcAnywhere source code leaked out onto the internet late January 2012
includes 47,021 files weighing in at 1.3GB. The October 2006 snapshot
provides an insight into Symantec development practices, polices, and of
course the code itself. Below is a brief assessment of the source code and
what it all means for computer users, hackers, and Symantec.
