Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - February meet - Tuesday
	February 21st 2012

This month we have our usual two talk format - one that you'll need to 
concentrate on (and which will give us time to break into the bar), and 
one through which you can sip the beer you bought to accompany the one 
you bought for me...

   Shaun Colley of IOActive will make our heads hurt with
   "printf tricks & setjmp/longjmp bugs"

followed by

   "E-mail Headers I Have Known And Loved" from @gwire (of NTK fame)
