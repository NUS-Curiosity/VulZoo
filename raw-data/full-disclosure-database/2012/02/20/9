They apparently thought that their customers would never need to talk to
anybody in the then-unallocated 25/8 and 28/8 blocks.  I mean, it was only 1992
or so when people started worrying that we'd run out of IPv4 space, so you can
hardly blame companies that deployed large numbers of deviced before 1992 for
doing stupid things not thinking about when address space ran out.

Oh wait...
