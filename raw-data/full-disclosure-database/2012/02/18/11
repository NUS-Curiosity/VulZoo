"*Hacker*
1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and 
how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer 
to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users' 
Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an 
intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers 
and computer networks in particular.
2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys 
programming rather than just theorizing about programming.
3. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or 
circumventing limitations."
