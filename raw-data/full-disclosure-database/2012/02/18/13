OpenVAS already has a partial IVIL implementation, I know because I wrote it:

~/Development/Private/Unpublished/OpenVAS/trunk/openvas-
manager/report_formats/IVIL$ ls
generate  IVIL.xsl

Thanks very much for thinking of us, if anyone does take an interest and gets
OpenVAS could you point them in my direction?
