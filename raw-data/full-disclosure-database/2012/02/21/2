Not only Sprint and T-Mobile - here is the snip from one recent spam
message:

Received: from megafonpro.ru (mail.megafonpro.ru [193.201.231.40])
	by fr51.aha.ru (Postfix) with SMTP id C24E72E3F
	for <andris@...net.ru>; Thu, 12 Jan 2012 13:03:34 +0400 (MSK)
Received: from Privet (83.149.9.199) by megafonpro.ru (7.3.118.8)
        id 49AFA7CF0308FD8C for andris@...net.ru; Thu, 12 Jan 2012

Note the use of 7.3.118.8 IP address! The 7/8 network is allocated to
DoD.

Just because some network admins are lazy and dumb and even don't want
to read RFC 1918 and other BCPs.
