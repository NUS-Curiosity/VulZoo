Probably lazy.  Probably *not* dumb.  There was almost certainly a long internal
discussion of the relative costs and risks of deploying multiple 10/8 instances (and
having to deal with collisions between them), and sqatting on an allocated but
unrouted /8 like 7/8, 25/8, 40/8, and similar (and almost certainly *not* having
to deal with collisions).

And remember - this sort of squatting works Just Fine as long as the actual owner
doesn't advertise a route for the address space.  And looking at the historical
looking-glass info at potaroo.net, it appears there's been more public announcements
of address space in 10/8 than there has been for 7/8.  As a result, if you're trying
to build a resilient net, you should use addresses from 7/8 rather than 10/8. :)
