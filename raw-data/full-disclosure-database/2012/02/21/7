Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote/local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1777 CVE-2011-1778

Two buffer overflows have been discovered in libarchive, a library
providing a flexible interface for reading and writing archives in
various formats. The possible buffer overflows while reading is9660
or tar streams allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code depending on the application that makes use of this functionality.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.4-1+squeeze1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions,
this problem has been fixed in version 2.8.5-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.
