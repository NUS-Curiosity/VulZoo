Mitja,
The #1 item on your list of countermeasures should be to advise people to
not run with admin privileges in general and especially when surfing the
web. Your #5 item seems risky to me because the executable won't be updated
if Microsoft issues a patch.

Regards,

Kurt

this technique while waiting for the affected software to correct its
behavior.
