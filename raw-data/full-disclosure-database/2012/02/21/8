Subject: DNSChef - a highly configurable DNS proxy

Hello fulldisclosure,

I wanted to share a new tool to help with application traffic analysis 
and interception. DNSChef is a cross-platform DNS proxy capable of 
forging responses based on inclusive and exclusive domain lists, 
matching domains with wildcards, proxying true responses for nonmatching 
domains, using external configuration files and other features useful 
for pentesters and malware analysts. DNSChef was developed to help with 
a test of an application which did not support HTTP proxy parameters. 
There are many ways to intercept network traffic; however, you may find 
this tool handy when everything else fails.

DNSChef source and documentation:
