if i understood the paper correctly they broke some rsa keys because
they shared a prime $p$ (the rsa keys are different, shared rsa
keys might be explained by the debian random fiasco or the like bugs).

i would suspect it is quite unlikely entropy/seed to explain the above
scenario - the odds appear small to me.
