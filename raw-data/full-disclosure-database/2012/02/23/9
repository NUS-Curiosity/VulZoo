Subject: Re: Trustwave and Mozilla (Resolved)

Hello,

They weren't rewarded. They were not punished for voluntarily coming
forward and reporting the problem to Mozilla. Punishing them for doing
so would only convince others not to come forward in the future. This
has triggered a policy change and announcements to CA, if you've
followed Mozilla's security policy discussions and these *will* result
in people being removed for such behavior in the future.

Hyperbole serves no real purpose here.
