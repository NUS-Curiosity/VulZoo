Subject: Trustwave and Mozilla (Resolved)

It appears to be official.

Trustwave issued MitM certificates, which is deceptive, unethical, and
contrary to its agreement for inclusion.

Mozilla just rewarded their violations of trust by continuing their
inclusion. Apparently, agreements between Mozilla and CAs have no
veracity as both are more than happy to violate the end user.
