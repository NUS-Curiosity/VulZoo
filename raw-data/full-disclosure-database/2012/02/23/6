Ass Eddy Nigg pointed out
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=724929#c13), it was a
clear violation:

Basically this is not your problem if you don't dictate how this
should be done. The Mozilla Policy at
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/InclusionPolicy.html
requires:

    for a certificate to be used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
    takes reasonable measures to verify that the entity submitting
    the certificate signing request has registered the domain(s)
    referenced in the certificate or has been authorized by the domain
    registrant to act on the registrant's behalf;

Failing to ensure the above would be a violation by that CA.

Hmmm.... I'm not sure how allowing a confession with no retirbution is
good for users or even ethical CAs. I think its sets a terrible
precedent. Users can expect to be violated again because Mozilla
implicitly condoned the actions by not penalizing the guilty. Ethical
CAs a further victimized because they cannot usurp customers from CAs
which were removed.

Gothcha. The mob defense invoked by CAs.

Gotcha. The mob defense invoked by Mozilla. (I know, that's not
Mozilla's position).

For what its worth, if if Microsoft does not act it is the company's
choice since I reported via email to their security email addresses
(there was nothing relevant on Microsoft Connect).

Out of curiosity: what do you think is going to happen when one of
these CAs cooperates with law enforcement (rather than a court order)
and gets caught doing it in the future? They now know they can act
with impunity since Mozilla's sactions are laughable.
