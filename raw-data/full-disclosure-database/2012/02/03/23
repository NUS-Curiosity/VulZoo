I've seen this sort of thing before, from misconfigured VPNs.

Do you have someone using "Tunngle" on your network?

It's a VPN product (as far as I understand it, primarily for gaming), 
and it appears to (mis)use the 7.xxx.xxx.xxx IP address space.  See this 
for a report of similar packet sightings:

http://www.tunngle.net/community/topic/18311-bsod/

My guess is that one of your users has set up this VPN in order to 
tunnel through your firewall, but it's not configured correctly and its 
DHCP requests are going onto your main network rather than (as intended) 
through the tunnel.  You might want to look into who is using this...
