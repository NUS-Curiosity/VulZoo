Actually, it was just released in Verisign's 10-Q
(https://investor.verisign.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-11-285850&CIK=1014473).
Otherwise, without the SEC changes, it probably never would have seen
the light of day.

And this is alarming: "Ken Silva, who was VeriSign's chief technology
officer for three years until November 2010, said he had not learned
of the intrusion until contacted by Reuters. Given the time elapsed
since the attack and the vague language in the SEC filing, he said
VeriSign "probably can't draw an accurate assessment" of the damage."

Remember, this company runs a CA. I can't wait to see aggregate data
on CA breaches next year (its being collected now by EFF, et al).
