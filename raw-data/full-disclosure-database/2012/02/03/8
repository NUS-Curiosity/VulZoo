BSides Detroit 12 Call For Presenters (CFP)

BSides Detroit (http://bit.ly/BSidesDetroit) brings the BSides community to
a new level, to a place it has never been before: The Destination
Conference. BSides Detroit is an unconference-style information security
event, designed both by and for the participants. Above all, we aim to
advance the industry by creating a stronger community, and facilitating
networking.

We offer a venue friendly to new speakers and emerging thought-leaders,
giving them a chance to become known. We also support contributions by
well-known speakers. All in all, we like content, specifically new and
emerging content, and not necessarily limited to the stuff that is all over
the media. BSides Detroit is about sharing material frankly, honestly, and
directly, for the purpose of informing, educating, and continuing the
conversation.

We are calling people from all over the country to Detroit, Michigan, USA.
Come talk with us about technical and non-technical topics, to help educate
and advance the current state and industry of information security.
