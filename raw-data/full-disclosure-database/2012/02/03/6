Introduction:
=============
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the agency of the United States government 
that is responsible for the nation`s civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research. 
Since February 2006, NASA`s mission statement has been to `pioneer the future in space exploration, 
scientific discovery and aeronautics research.`` On September 14, 2011, NASA announced that it had 
selected the design of a new Space Launch System that it said would take the agency s astronauts farther 
into space than ever before and provide the cornerstone for future human space exploration efforts by the U.S.

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Lab Researcher discovered multiple critical vulnerabilities on a NASA CMS Application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-01-28:	Vendor Notification
2012-02-01:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
Multiple  remote File Upload vulnerabilities & Misconfiguration Read Bugs are detected on the official NASA CMS Subdomains. 
The Vulnerability allows to read the config & can result in malicious file uploads. Successful exploitation can result in 
dbms- & application compromise. The bugs are located in the available FCKeditor version & multiple nasa subdomains are vulnerable.

Attacker can for example scan for fckeditor bugs & exploit them via automatic routine. The method allows to manipulate 
multiple nasa subdomains.
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] FCKeditor


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
