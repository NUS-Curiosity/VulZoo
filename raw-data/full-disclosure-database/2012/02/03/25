Earlier today I tried to contact the people over at 
http://vulnerability-lab.com about an XSS vulnerability I found on their
site (ironic) but it appears they want nothing to do with me. Praise 
Full-Disclosure.

The Irony Of A Site For Disclosing Site Being Itself Vuln To Something So Trivial
 
Basically I tried to report this issue to them through a private 
message on youtube and then a follow request on twitter (so I could DM 
them) but to no avail. Eventually rem0ve joined freenode and messaged me
and told me he didn’t want to be cooperative with me or even be 
friendly. Sometimes being a prick just makes you look like an idiot.
