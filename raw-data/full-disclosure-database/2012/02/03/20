Earlier today I tried to contact the people over at
http://vulnerability-lab.com about an XSS vulnerability I found on their
site (ironic) but it appears they want nothing to do with me. Praise
Full-Disclosure.

The Irony Of A Site For Disclosing Site Being Itself Vuln To Something So
Trivial



Basically I tried to report this issue to them through a private message on
youtube and then a follow request on twitter (so I could DM them) but to no
avail. Eventually rem0ve joined freenode and messaged me and told me he
didnâ€™t want to be cooperative with me or even be friendly. Sometimes being
a prick just makes you look like an idiot.
