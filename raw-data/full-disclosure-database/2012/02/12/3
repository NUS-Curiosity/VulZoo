Hi All,

https://www.infoworld.com/d/security/trustwave-admits-issuing-man-in-the-middle-digital-certificate-185972

In case folks are interested in the following Mozilla's response to
active MitM attacks that were facilitated by Trustwave, the bug report
is here: http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=724929.

For what its worth, pinning the certificate can usually remediate
these sorts of MitM attacks, but Mozilla subverted it:
