Maybe I'm not sufficiently caffienated, but that link doesn't seem to
mention Mozilla at all, much less anything they did to "subvert" pinning.
(Note that I don't consider "doesn't happen to support the feature yet"
as "subversion" - that requires an active decision to take some action
that undermines the feature)
