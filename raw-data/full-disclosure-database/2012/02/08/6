Subject: Re: posting xss notifications in sites vs
	software packages

Typically you will run into instances where a website is employing a custom
CMS/plugin/module/whatever and as such there may not be a specific software
to call out as the one at fault.

It's like finding an XSS in Microsoft, 99% chance they are running their
own custom CMS so at that point you are just left with saying that
Microsoft is vulnerable to XSS as there is no name to the software at hand.
