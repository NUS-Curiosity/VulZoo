- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the SaveDoc function exposed by the
VsVIEW6.ocx ActiveX control. The SaveDoc function causes a file to be
created at an arbitrary path specified by the first argument (FileName).
The file contents can be controlled by first setting the 'Text' member
of the object. These behaviors can be exploited by a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the target system.


- -- Vendor Response:

IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
