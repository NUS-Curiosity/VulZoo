### REGISTRATION ###

Registration is open but the lower-priced registration blocks are
selling out fast!  You can register for the conference using the links
to our registration portal provided on the conference registration page:

http://www.infosecsouthwest.com/registration.html

If you intend to attend the conference, we ask that you please register
as early as possible using our registration portal.  As this is our
first conference, it would greatly help us in planning and logistics
(such as ordering badges) to have a more accurate idea of expected
attendance, which early registration will definitely help with.  To
reward early registration, we have set up a tiered registration pricing
model.  Each block of registrations is limited in quantity up to the
final block which is unlimited in quantity and will be available both
via the registration portal and on-site:

Block		Price
Student		$90.00
Block 1		$110.00 *** SOLD OUT ***
Block 2		$120.00
Block 3		$130.00
Block 4		$140.00
Block 5		$150.00
Block 6		$160.00
On-site		$160.00

As each block of registrations is exhausted the next block will become
available.
