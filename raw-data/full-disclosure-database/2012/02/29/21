Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-026 - ZipCart -
	Access bypass

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-026
  * Project: ZipCart [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-February-29
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

ZipCart [3] enables a site to provide users with Zip archives for downloads
selected by the user.

Versions of ZipCart prior to 6.x-1.4 checks an incorrect permission when
building archives. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that archive
file addition is only permitted if Drupal's normal file download access check
permits the user to download the file directly.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * ZipCart 6.x versions prior to 6.x-1.4 [4].

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed ZipCart [5]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the ZipCart module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to ZipCart 6.x-1.4
    [6]

See also the ZipCart [7] project page.
