Details
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call processing component
of the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony
features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as IP
phones, media processing devices, VoIP gateways, and multimedia
applications.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains two vulnerabilities that
involve the processing of SCCP packets. These issues may allow a
remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send crafted SCCP
messages to an affected device to cause a reload or execute
attacker-controlled SQL code.  Both SCCP ports (TCP ports 2000 and
2443) are affected.


Cisco Unified Communications Manager SCCP Registration may Cause Reload
+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communication Manager may reload when a specially
crafted SCCP message is processed. Successful exploitation could cause
a loss of all voice services that are being handled by the affected
device.  After the device restarts, voice services will be restored.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtu73538 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2011-4486.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager Vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection
During Registration
+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager may allow the blind execution of
attacker-controlled SQL code when processing a specially crafted SCCP
message.  Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to modify
certain sections of the SQL database that are utilized by the device.
This vulnerability is also documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtu73538 and
has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-4487.


Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has scored the vulnerabilities in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this
security advisory is in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps organizations determine the urgency and priority of
a response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can also
compute environmental scores that help determine the impact of the
vulnerability in their own networks.

Cisco has provided additional information regarding CVSS at the
following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to compute the environmental
impact for individual networks at the following link:
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss


* CSCtu73538 - Cisco Unified Communications Manager SCCP Registration may Cause Reload

CVSS Base Score - 7.8
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   None
    Integrity Impact -         None
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.4
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


* CSCtu73538 - Cisco Unified Communications Manager Vulnerable to Blind SQL
  Injection During Registration

CVSS Base Score - 5.8
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Medium
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   None
    Integrity Impact -         Partial
    Availability Impact -      Partial

CVSS Temporal Score - 4.8
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in
this advisory could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
trigger a device reload or execute SQL commands against the back-end
database.  A successful SQL injection could result in the retrieval or
modification of data or a persistent denial of service (DoS) condition
on the affected device. In the case of a device reload, Cisco Unified
Communications Manager will restart the affected processes, but
repeated attacks may result in a sustained DoS condition.


Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult
the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at:
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt

Review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded
contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and
software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the
new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to
contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their
contracted maintenance providers.
