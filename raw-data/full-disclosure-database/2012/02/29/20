Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-027 - Submenu
	Tree -Cross Site	Scripting

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-027
  * Project: Submenu Tree [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-February-29
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Submenu Tree module allows sufficiently privileged users to show a
list of menu entries when displaying a node.

The module does not sanitize some of the user-supplied data before
displaying it, leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS [3])
vulnerability.

The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a malicious user must
be assigned a role that includes permissions to edit the Drupal menus.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Submenu Tree
