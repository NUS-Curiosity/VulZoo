Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-028 -
	Hierarchical Select - Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-028
  * Project: Hierarchical Select [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-February-29
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Hierarchical Select module provides a "hierarchical_select" form element,
which is a greatly enhanced way for letting the user select items in a
taxonomy. The module does not sanitize some of the user-supplied data before
displaying it, leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS [3]) vulnerability that
may lead to a malicious user gaining full administrative access.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have a
role with the 'administer taxonomy' permission; specifically he must be able
to create or modify vocabularies and then modify the vocabulary's help text.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Hierarchical Select 6.x-3.x versions prior to 6.x-3.7.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Hierarchical
Select [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Hierarchical Select module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to
    Hierarchical Select 6.x-3.8 [5]

See also the Hierarchical Select [6] project page.
