Subject: Re: Arbitrary DDoS PoC

Uhh...looks pretty standard boss. You aren't going to DoS a halfway decent
server with that using a single box. Sending your request through multiple
proxies does not magically increase the resource usage of the target, its
still your output power vs their input pipe. Sure it gives a slight boost
in anonymity and obfuscation but does not actually increase effectiveness.
It would even decrease effectiveness because you bear the burden of having
to send to a proxy, giving them ample time to recover from a given request.

Even if you look at it as a tactic to bypass blacklisting, you still aren't
going to overwhelm the server. That means you need more pawns to do your
bidding. This creates a bit of a problem however as then all your slaves
are running through a limited selection of proxies, reducing the amount of
threats the server needs to blacklist. The circumvention is quite obvious,
which is to not utilize proxies for the pawns....and rely on shear numbers
and/or superior resource exhaustion methods....
