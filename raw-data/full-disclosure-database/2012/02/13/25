Subject: Re: Linksys Routers still Vulnerable to Wps
	vulnerability.

i believe that disabling wps on router still leaves some routers vulnerable
was reported on before.
from
http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/hands-on-hacking-wifi-protected-setup-with-reaver.ars
"Having demonstrated the insecurity of WPS, I went into the Linksys'
administrative interface and turned WPS off. Then, I relaunched Reaver,
figuring that surely setting the router to manual configuration would block
the attacks at the door. But apparently Reaver didn't get the memo, and the
Linksys' WPS interface still responded to its queries—once again coughing
up the password and SSID. "

the testing i did was in early-mid jan, ill verify my findings again. at
work now, but will let you know about config methods.
