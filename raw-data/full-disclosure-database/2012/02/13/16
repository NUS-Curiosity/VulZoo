Can anyone confirm that Trustwave CA certificates in the local Mozilla
certificate store are the ones with names containing the word "SecureTrust"
?

I want to disable Trustwave CAs on all my local systems, but am not certain
which are the relevant ones.  For some benighted reason, the word
"Trustwave" is not present in any of the certificate names in the FF
certificate store on WinXP or Debian (Iceweasel).  Ironically of course,
the word "trust" appears everywhere :)

I found a page at mozilla.org which appears to show all CAs included with
FF, and that Trustwave certificates are labelled "SecureTrust" :
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/
but I would like confirmation from Someone Who Knows Better.

Be advised: the above page appears to be some kind of .. [recoils in
horror] .. XML which doesn't render properly on WinXP, but renders fine on
Debian Linux.  Maybe there's some XSL needed somewhere.

Cheers
Nick
