Subject: fasmaes-1.0.tar.gz - An AES implementation for
	Flat Assembler (FASM)

yo was geht?

DESCRIPTION
===========
An AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 implementation for FASM. Uses the the
x86 32-bit instruction set and operates completely on the stack. No
additional data segments are necessary which makes it easy to integrate
the AES functions in any existing project.
The implementation is not optimized for speed but for easy maintainability.
