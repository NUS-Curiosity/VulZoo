Subject: Arbitrary DDoS PoC

With the recent wave of DDoS, a concern that was not taken is the model 
where the zombies were not compromised by a Trojan. In the standard 
modeling of DDoS attack, the machines are purchased, usually in a VPS, 
or are obtained through Trojans, thus forming a botnet. But the 
arbitrary shape doesn't need acquire a collection of computers. 
Programs, servers and protocols are used to arbitrarily make requests on 
the target. P2P programs are especially vulnerable, DNS, internet 
proxies, and many sites that make requests of user like Facebook or W3C, 
also are.

Precisely I made a proof-of-concept script of 60 lines hitting most of 
HTTP servers on the Internet, even if they have protections likely 
mod_security, mod_evasive. This can be found on this link [1] at GitHub. 
The solution of the problem depends only on the reformulation of 
protocols and limitations on the number of concurrent requests and 
totals by proxies and programs for a given site, when exceeded returning 
a cached copy of the last request.
