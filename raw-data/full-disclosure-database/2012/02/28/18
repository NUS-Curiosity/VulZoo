Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform.

CVE-2011-3377
	The Iced Tea browser plugin included in the openjdk-6 package
	does not properly enforce the Same Origin Policy on web content
	served under a domain name which has a common suffix with the
	required domain name.

CVE-2011-3563
	The Java Sound component did not properly check for array
	boundaries.  A malicious input or an untrusted Java application
	or applet could use this flaw to cause Java Virtual Machine to
	crash or disclose portion of its memory.

CVE-2011-5035
	The OpenJDK embedded web server did not guard against an
	excessive number of a request parameters, leading to a denial
	of service vulnerability involving hash collisions.

CVE-2012-0497
	It was discovered that Java2D did not properly check graphics
	rendering objects before passing them to the native renderer.
	This could lead to JVM crash or Java sandbox bypass.

CVE-2012-0501
	The ZIP central directory parser used by java.util.zip.ZipFile
	entered an infinite recursion in native code when processing a
	crafted ZIP file, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2012-0502
	A flaw was found in the AWT KeyboardFocusManager class that
	could allow untrusted Java applets to acquire keyboard focus
	and possibly steal sensitive information.

CVE-2012-0503
	The java.util.TimeZone.setDefault() method lacked a security
	manager invocation, allowing an untrusted Java application or
	applet to set a new default time zone.

CVE-2012-0505
	The Java serialization code leaked references to serialization
	exceptions, possibly leaking critical objects to untrusted
	code in Java applets and applications.

CVE-2012-0506
	It was discovered that CORBA implementation in Java did not
	properly protect repository identifiers (that can be obtained
	using _ids() method) on certain Corba objects.  This could
	have been used to perform modification of the data that should
	have been immutable.

CVE-2012-0507
	The AtomicReferenceArray class implementation did not properly
	check if the array is of an expected Object[] type.  A
	malicious Java application or applet could use this flaw to
	cause Java Virtual Machine to crash or bypass Java sandbox
	restrictions

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.13-0+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b24-1.11.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
