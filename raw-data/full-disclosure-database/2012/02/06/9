Subject: Re: Vulnerability-lab.com XSS

So today I was threatened with legal action by Rem0ve of the
Vulnerability-Lab crew after talking with X4lt (who is MUCH more pleasant
to speak with btw). Apparently due to the fact that I don't want to remove
my blog post about it Rem0ve got a bit upset. Apparently freedom of speech
isn't important to him, meh, oh well.

Rem0ve, learn your laws please, exploiting reflective XSS isn't illegal
silly; good luck trying to prosecute.


Also if you are gonna send your goons on FD to back you up, please make
sure they know English; it hurt my brain to read that response...
