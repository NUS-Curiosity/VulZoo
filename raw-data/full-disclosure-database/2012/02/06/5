Subject: TROOPERS12 - Welcome to Heidelberg.

Dear TROOPERS,

We call for action for the fifth time in the history of our 
up-and-coming IT security conferences series. Experts from all around 
the globe come together in Heidelberg (Germany) to enjoy a week-long 
agenda (March, 19-23, 2012) of workshops, the main conference and 
roundtables.

On Monday & Tuesday you have the choice between ten workshops:

- Advanced E-Mail and Certificates Security
- Advanced IPv6 Security
- Auditing the Cloud
- Implementing SDLs in corporate environments
- Cyber Security Assessment of Mission Critical SCADA Systems
- Two-day seminars: Mobile Security & Hacking 101
- Two ISECOM workshops: Certified Trust Analyst & Smarter, Safer, Better
- And another highlight: SAP Security - Vulnerabilities, Exploits & 
Remediation

On Wednesday & Thursday the main conference kicks in:

More than 25 internationally renowned experts are on site to present 
their latest research to you. Besides our all-star team of veteran 
speakers like Sergey Bratus, Chema Alonso, Graeme Neilson and Rodrigo 
Branco, we also have plenty of new faces in the TROOPERS line-up, such 
as Gary McGraw, Haroon Meer, Piotr Cofta and Mike Ossmann.

A vast amount of IT security topics are covered. We have it all: Cloud 
security, implications of quantum computing on crypto, SAP security, 
trust, and many more. Please find the complete agenda at:

To finish up we host a set of roundtables on Friday. This is the place 
where we recap the week's happenings and venture a glimpse into the future.
