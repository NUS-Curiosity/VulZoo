If it's an abandoned account that he never actually *uses* for anything, it's
conceivable.  Somebody mentioned to me yesterday that they had gone to get a
specific *very* unlikely name on GMail, only to find it was taken.  And then 20
minutes later, updated it with "I totally forgot that I had already taken that
name and never used it".  There's similar disused and abandoned accounts
across all the social media and email services.
