He is PhD in Software Engineering and does not notice during two years someone posting into his Facebook account? I also assume if he has some story to tell to justify, he is free to do. But by default I assume PhD of Software Engineering has some clue about computers and excuses "I do not know why my computer spams during months and years" are not acceptable. This is not the case when dentist got hacked and does not understand what we speak about. Something does not fit.
