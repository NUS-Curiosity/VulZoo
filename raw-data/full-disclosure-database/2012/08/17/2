 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2012:138
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : acpid
 Date    : August 17, 2012
 Affected: Enterprise Server 5.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected in acpid:
 
 Helmut Grohne and Michael Biebl discovered that ACPI scripts were
 executed with a permissive file mode creation mask (umask). A local
 attacker could read files and modify directories created by ACPI
 scripts that did not set a strict umask (CVE-2011-4578).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
