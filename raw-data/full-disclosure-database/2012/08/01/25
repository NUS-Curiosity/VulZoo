You misunderstand.  I wasn't "bitching" about anything.  I was simply noting the truth about how disclosure really works, what it is, and what it does.    I don't have any actual "position" about it one way or the other.  While I know it is fun for us to poke back and forth, don't let your predisposed attitude towards me cloud your interpretation of what I write.  I fully review everything you post with  an open mind (as I did with the GPG key issues) before replying.  

What exactly are you pointing out here?   I'm curious to know exactly what you think my stance was.  Just to be clear, I hope you understand that I could not care less if someone goes about FD.   I wouldn't care even if it were regarding a bug in my own tools.   I was all about "intent" not "action."

Seriously, what do you think I was saying?


Oh, and P.S.  I actually like the "satanic writer" bit - that made me LOL.  I think you (and many others) will be quite surprised to see what my next book is about.  Syngress and I have all but signed the contract.  Dare I say YOU may even buy it.  That's too much.  Dare I say YOU may even steal it of BT.  :)
