Subject: OT: OSX-PHP Dev Enviornment

Greets all.  Sorry for the OT, but I thought I'd ask here...

As you can guess, I've used Visual Studio to do web and application development for longer than I care to remember.   Given that I've moved my production HoG facilities over to OSX, I now find myself missing the development environment VS afforded me as I migrate to PHP under Apache.  

I'm using EditRocket atm, but I'm soliciting recommendations for a PHP dev environment that will provide the same functions (or close) as VS does in regard to syntax checking, code completion, etc.   I'm actually surprised at how quickly I've synched up with PHP, but I'd still like a more professional environment.   Free or Commercial doesn't matter.  

I am thanking you.
