Telnet and do the HTTP request by hand, for quick & dirty. If I really suspect an exploit kit page I run it through urlquery.net with appropriate referrer and user-agent.

For practical surfing of suspect content, Firefox in a VM with NoScript, running through Privoxy & Tor (don't forget to configure Firefox to send DNS requests through Tor, it doesn't do that by default).
