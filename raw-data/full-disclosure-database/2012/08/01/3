Package        : krb5
Vulnerability  : denial of service and remote code execution
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1014 CVE-2012-1015
Debian Bug     : 683429

Emmanuel Bouillon from NCI Agency discovered multiple vulnerabilities in MIT
Kerberos, a daemon implementing the network authentication protocol.

CVE-2012-1014

	By sending specially crafted AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) to a KDC
	(Key Distribution Center), an attacker could make it free an uninitialized
	pointer, corrupting the heap.  This can lead to process crash or even arbitrary
	code execution.
	.
	This CVE only affects testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions.

CVE-2012-1015

	By sending specially crafted AS-REQ to a KDC, an attacker could make it
	dereference an uninitialized pointer, leading to process crash or even
	arbitrary code execution

In both cases, arbitrary code execution is believed to be difficult to achieve,
but might not be impossible.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
