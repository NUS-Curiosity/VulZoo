So I may be stepping into it here, but BurpSuite works well for my purposes. Provides a really simple interface to view request/response, as well as allow the user to follow subsequent 302 redirects and view source without rendering responses.

Just a thought :)

Telnet and do the HTTP request by hand, for quick & dirty. If I really suspect an exploit kit page I run it through urlquery.net<http://urlquery.net> with appropriate referrer and user-agent.

For practical surfing of suspect content, Firefox in a VM with NoScript, running through Privoxy & Tor (don't forget to configure Firefox to send DNS requests through Tor, it doesn't do that by default).
