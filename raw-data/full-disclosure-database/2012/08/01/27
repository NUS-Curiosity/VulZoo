Subject: Re: sandboxed browsing

Hi,

this is something Daniel Berrange spoke about in FOSDEM 2k12
in his talk "Building app sandboxes on top of LXC and KVM with libvirt" [1].

Slides available at [2].
This may lead to the same direction as yersinia's pointer, since fedora
is quite close to redhat.

Hope this help.
