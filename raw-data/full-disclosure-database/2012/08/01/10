Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the Distimo Monitor v6.0 application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required user 
inter action or local low privileged user account. The bugs are located in the  Downloads > Map or Revenue > Date with the bound 
vulnerable parameters metric, application & date. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, client side phishing & client-side 
content request manipulation. Exploitation requires medium or high user inter action & no privileged application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Downloads > Map
				[+] Revenue > Date


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] metric
				[+] country
				[+] application


Proof of Concept:
=================
The non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium or high required 
user inter action & without required privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...
