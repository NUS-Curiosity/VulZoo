Subject: Re: sandboxed browsing

Uhm, there's countless ways to download a file through HTTP on Windows.
To be honest, I don't trust sandboxie at all. I think, and I'm sure many
agree with me on this one, a VM would be much better than sandboxie at this
point.

That said, I suppose there is still a chance of malware getting over your
VM OS and infect your main one through the network, or the malware to be
able to somehow escape your VM into the host.

Either way, I think the best bet would be wget or similar.
