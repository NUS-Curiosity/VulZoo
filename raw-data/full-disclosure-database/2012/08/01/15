ChristianÂ´s tip on wget is a good alternative. Why not do some protocol
level inspection? I mean wget, netcat, curl, etc... Sometimes I even hide
my network with tor.  Of course,  sometimes you gonna need some actual end
user experience to better analyze the attack, but I think most suspicious
URLs can be cracked right away with just that.
