When I worked for Cray, we found a mbuf allocation issue with solaris.
Ten or so ftp sssions in VERY rapid sucessions could kill a top of the range
sun server - kernel panic/shitty death everytime! :-)

We provided test case, and dev system dump analysis - and even worked out
the assembler tweak to the .a/.so required to eleminate the problem.

Sun's response? - Give us the 20K to fix it.

In the end we manually hacked the .a/.so and shipped the workaround to
our custsomers - IIRC sun fixed it some three or four years later but
it was fun to be able to kill any sun kit so easily using
nothing more a sequence of 20 or so SYN's.
