 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2012:074-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ffmpeg
 Date    : August 30, 2012
 Affected: Enterprise Server 5.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in ffmpeg:
 
 The Matroska format decoder in FFmpeg does not properly allocate
 memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted file (CVE-2011-3362, CVE-2011-3504).
 
 cavsdec.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (incorrect write operation and application
 crash) via an invalid bitstream in a Chinese AVS video (aka CAVS)
 file, related to the decode_residual_block, check_for_slice,
 and cavs_decode_frame functions, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2011-3362 (CVE-2011-3973).
 
 Integer signedness error in the decode_residual_inter function in
 cavsdec.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (incorrect write operation and application crash)
 via an invalid bitstream in a Chinese AVS video (aka CAVS) file,
 a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3362 (CVE-2011-3974).
 
 FFmpeg does not properly implement the MKV and Vorbis media
 handlers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors (CVE-2011-3893).
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted stream (CVE-2011-3895).
 
 An error within the QDM2 decoder (libavcodec/qdm2.c) can be exploited
 to cause a buffer overflow (CVE-2011-4351).
 
 An integer overflow error within the &quot;vp3_dequant()&quot; function
 (libavcodec/vp3.c) can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow
 (CVE-2011-4352).
 
 Errors within the &quot;av_image_fill_pointers()&quot;, the &quot;vp5_parse_coeff()&quot;,
 and the &quot;vp6_parse_coeff()&quot; functions can be exploited to trigger
 out-of-bounds reads (CVE-2011-4353).
 
 It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed
 VMD files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted VMD file,
 an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash,
 or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
 invoking the program (CVE-2011-4364).
 
 It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed SVQ1
 streams. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted SVQ1 stream
 file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application
 crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
 user invoking the program (CVE-2011-4579).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 0.5.9 version where
 these issues has been corrected.
 
 Additionally a couple of packages needed to be rebuilt for the new
 ffmpeg version and is also being provided with this advisory.

 Update:

 A missing dependency was discovered which prevented the sox library
 from installing properly. This updated advisory provided the missing
 libwavpack1 and lib64wavpack1 packages.
