 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2012:129-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : busybox
 Date    : August 10, 2012
 Affected: 2011.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities was found and corrected in busybox:
 
 The decompress function in ncompress allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute arbitrary code,
 via crafted data that leads to a buffer underflow (CVE-2006-1168).
 
 A missing DHCP option checking / sanitization flaw was reported for
 multiple DHCP clients.  This flaw may allow DHCP server to trick DHCP
 clients to set e.g. system hostname to a specially crafted value
 containing shell special characters.  Various scripts assume that
 hostname is trusted, which may lead to code execution when hostname
 is specially crafted (CVE-2011-2716).
 
 Additionally for Mandriva Enterprise Server 5 various problems in
 the ka-deploy and uClibc packages was discovered and fixed with
 this advisory.
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.

 Update:

 The wrong set of packages was sent out with the MDVSA-2012:129 advisory
 that lacked the fix for CVE-2006-1168. This advisory provides the
 correct packages.
