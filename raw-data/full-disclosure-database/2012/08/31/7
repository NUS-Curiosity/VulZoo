The quoted code is actually nothing more than a regular threaded UDP
flood DoS tool, both SNMP spoofed requests and responses are equally 65
bytes (no reflection). Make a simple network capture for verification.

The payload is a mis-used .1.3.6.1 getBulk SNMP request resulting in a
null value response.

A sample perl script with the biggest reflection factor per transaction
achieved on Cisco devices is available here [1] (Amplification = 84
bytes request / 1480 bytes response).

For more information about SNMP reflection DoS you may refer to this
link [2].

The quoted code reminds me an old implementation on the same concept [3].
