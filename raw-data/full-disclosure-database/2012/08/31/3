No. Per our Disclosure Policy, we stick to reporting issues to original
vendors only.

Yes. As indicated, we are planning to release a technical write-up
where we will present many new details of security issues found.

We'll send notification about the paper release to Bugtraq / Full
Disclosure mailing lists. We do not plan to do that prior to the
release of the necessary security fixes by Oracle though.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
