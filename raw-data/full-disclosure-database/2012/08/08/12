Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-125 - Chaos tool
	suite (ctools) -	Local File Inclusion and Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1719548

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-125
  * Project: Chaos tool suite (ctools) [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-August-8
  * Security risk: Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Local File Inclusion and Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Chaos tool suite is primarily a set of APIs and tools to improve the
developer experience.

The module doesn't sufficiently validate css import statements to confirm
they only include css content appropriate to show to end users. This could
allow a malicious user to add sensitive content from the site (e.g.
settings.php) exposing that sensitive content to visitors of the page. It
could also be used to execute a Cross Site Scripting attack.

This vulnerability is party mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have
a role with a permission to place custom CSS into a field. However, any user
who can create or edit a node may have sufficient permissions to place the
CSS depending on the site configuration.

CVE: Requested
