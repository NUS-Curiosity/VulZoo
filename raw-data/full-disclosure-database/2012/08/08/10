	authentication -	Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1719462

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-123
  * Project: Shibboleth authentication [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-August-8
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Shibboleth authentication module provides user authentication with
Shibboleth single sign-on systems (both v1.3 and v2.0) as well as some
authorization features (automatic role assignment based on Shibboleth
attributes).

The module doesn't sufficiently confirm the user's active status in Drupal
when authenticating a user whose account could be blocked.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Shibboleth authentication all versions prior to 6.x-4.0-rc3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Shibboleth
authentication [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Shibboleth authentication module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to
    Shibboleth authentication 6.x-4.0 [4]

Shibboleth authentication releases for Drupal 7.x are not affected.

Also see the Shibboleth authentication [5] project page.
