Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-124 - Mime Mail -
	Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1719482

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-124
  * Project: Mime Mail [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-August-8
  * Security risk: Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The MIME Mail module allows users to send MIME-encoded e-mail messages with
embedded images and attachments.

The module doesn't perform proper access checks, allowing a user to send
arbitrary (e.g. the settings.php) files as attachments.

In the latest version users must have the "send arbitrary files" permission
to access files located outside the public files directory.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Mime Mail 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Mime Mail [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Mime Mail module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Mime Mail
    6.x-1.1 [4]

Also see the Mime Mail [5] project page.
