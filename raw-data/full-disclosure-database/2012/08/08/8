Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-121 - Shorten
	URLs - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1719392

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-121
  * Project: Shorten URLs [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-August-8
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Shorten URLs module provides an API to shorten URLs via many services
like bit.ly and TinyURL, as well as a block and a page that provide an
interface for easily shortening URLs.

.... Cross Site Scripting via report

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user input when displaying shortened
URLs.
This vulnerability is mitigated by several factors:

  * The Record Shortened URLs submodule must be installed
  * The Views module must /not/ be installed
  * An attacker must either have the "use Shorten URLs page" permission or
    access to the Shorten URLs block

CVE: Requested

.... Cross Site Scripting via Custom Services List

There is an additional XSS vulnerability where the module doesn't
sufficiently sanitize user input when displaying custom URL shortening
services.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the "Shorten URLs Custom
Services" submodule must be enabled and the attacker must have the
"administer Shorten URLs custom services" permission, which should not be
given to non-administrators.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Shorten URLs 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.13.
  * Shorten URLs 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.
