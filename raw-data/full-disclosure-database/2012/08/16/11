Subject: Re: Nishang: PowerShell for Penetration Testing

Some time ago a colleague and I collaborated on a bit of software that
analyzed and reported on interesting/unknown/anomalous logs.

It reported via email. We published the code to the web in the hope
others would find it useful. I forgot and left my email addr as the
default mail to.

You'd be amazed that: a) people don't bother to look through the
code/configs and b) how much information you can gather when people
inadvertently send you all of their logs.

Just sayin'

Cheers,
Harry
