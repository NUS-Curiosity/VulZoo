Its just another godaddy registration - you can use any old crap to register a domain with GD.

Agreed!

My assumption was the professor had been hacked by a student (perhaps he left his desktop open and a waiting
grad student did a tools-options-security->view passwords in his open browser). Not exactly "leet" but...

This ties in well with the gaming site and the rather clueless txtspeak. I somehow doubt that a resident (published)
professor would write in that style.

My advice would be to report the abuse to the uni and drop the matter. They may have not responded bacause they
are in the process of prosecuting the little trog responsible or he just wants to hide the fact that he has been
hacked from other staff :-)

IMHO Give the guy the benefit of the doubt - but it does not hurt to block all incoming traffic for the uni
and report any ads instigated from dialups to the appropriate ISP pointing out thet link to the assumed hacked
account of said professor.
