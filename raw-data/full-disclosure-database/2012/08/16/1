So... did you establish that the person doing the spamming actually *is*
that professor, or merely somebody who managed to phish the professor's
credentials and is using their identity to send the spam? (We get 5 or 10 phished
users a day, and maybe 1 or 2 actual spammers a year)

As you note yourself:

"Man who writes into computer vision list:
Dear Friends,
...
does not look like scientist with problem solving skills able to work on satellite vision problems."

So it's possible the person has been phished or joe-jobbed.
