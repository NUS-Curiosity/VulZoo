Subject: middle-clicking on links

Have a look at this PoC: http://jsfiddle.net/wbfpM/1/

At least in Chromium and Firefox on Linux, middle-clicking the "Google" link opens
an alert window with the current clipboard contents. Well, I guess there's not much
that can be done about that, but I think it's interesting to know.
