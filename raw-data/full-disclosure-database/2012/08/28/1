It actually doesn't matter what OS or what kind of kernel security is on
going, this 'hole' of yours does not exist. and why would I want to 'try
make program exec /bin/sh 'n setuid it to root' that's just moronic.

so in closing, and once again this will NOT work on any Linux OS or Linux
Kernel

Thanks for all the fish.
