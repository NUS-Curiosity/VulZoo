No way did I just google for that; I'm actually working on a rewrite in
ObscureLNG/S, and I've been following the progress of the original project
closely. Besides, it's not as if that plug is supported anyway; it was
written with OS X 10.1 support, and is broken on later versions. The
windows version is terrible (really, Win32 in today's world?) and the Linux
version is downloadable only from the vendor's .vn subsidiary.
