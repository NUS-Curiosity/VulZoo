Subject: nvidia linux binary driver priv escalation exploit

Dave,

Thank you for reporting this vulnerability. NVIDIA has released an updated
driver, version 304.32, which contains a hotfix to block access to the
registers involved in this attack, as well as some other registers which
we have identified as being susceptible to a similar type of attack. In
addition to the updated driver, NVIDIA has released patches for older
driver versions.

Details about the updated driver and the patches are available at:
