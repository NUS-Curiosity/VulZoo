Subject: Portspoof - service signature obfuscator (more
 pain for port scanners)

Hi,

Short description of the soft and the concept:

The portspoof program is designed to enhance OS security through 
emulation of legitimate service signatures on otherwise closed ports.
The general goal of the program is to make the port scanning process 
very slow and output very difficult to interpret,
thus making the attack reconnaissance phase a challenging and 
bothersome task.

Note:
This is an idea that I had for a long time in mind and finally I found 
some time to implement it.
It is still an early release and some part of the code isn't perfect, 
but I'll be working on that :]

Cheers,
Piotrek
