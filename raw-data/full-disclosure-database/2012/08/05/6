--[ Description

BugCON 2013 will take place in Mexico City from February 13th to 15th, 2013.

----[ Background

BugCON Security Conference: Safety is just a myth...! is the biggest
security conference in Mexico since 2008.

    BugCON 2008: The security event with the highest technical level in
Mexico...

    BugCON 2010: More than 40 talks and trainings...
    BugCON 2012: Speakers from Argentina, USA, Spain, Ecuador, Mexico...

--[ Approach

BugCON is merely a technical security conference. BugCON is focused in
getting together security researchers, security professionals, companies,
universities and goverment agencies with the purpose of showing their
latest research, networking with people involved in security fields and get
drunk ;) ... all taking place in an uncensored environment.

This is the reason why BugCON only accepts really hardcore technical talks
and workshops related with security areas like: research, new techniques,
vulnerabilities, projects, etc. No business talks... neither "CSI of
computers" nor yellow scarves.
