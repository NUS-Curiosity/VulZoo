Subject: OpenSecurityTraining Exploits 2 class

We have just released the class materials and first day of videos from
Corey K's three-day Exploits 2 class. This class focuses on Windows and its
exploit mitigations, whereas the previous Exploits 1 class focused on
Linux.

We also offer classes on x86 assembly and the PE binary format for those
who do not already have backgrounds in those areas.
