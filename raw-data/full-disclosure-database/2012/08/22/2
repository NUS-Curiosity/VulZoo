Subject: USB HID attacks on Mac OS X

All,

Kautilya has been updated to include attacks on Mac OS X and some new nifty payloads on other OS as well. Details here

http://labofapenetrationtester.blogspot.com/2012/08/kautilya-03-released-breaking-mac-os-x.html

I use this in my Social Engg. attacks and is quite successful in many pen tests. Have a look. 


Also, the reason for posting this to FD is to ask that how many of you use this type of attack vector in real life pen tests?If yes, how do you use this?


Cheers,
Herald
