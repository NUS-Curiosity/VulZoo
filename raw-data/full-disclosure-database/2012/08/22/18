- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Notes. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within notes.exe. When handling URLs, it is
possible to inject the -RPARAMS command line argument into the call to
notes.exe, which will then launch rcplauncher.exe. Including the java -vm
command will allow for the attacker to execute code under the context of
the process.
