Package        : libapache2-mod-rpaf
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 683984

SÃ©bastien Bocahu discovered that the reverse proxy add forward module
for the Apache webserver is vulnerable to a denial of service attack
through a single crafted request with many headers.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-rpaf packages.
