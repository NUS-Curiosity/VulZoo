Dear <insert appropriate hyperbalic description of yourself>.  
You are hereby invited to participate in SEC-T 2012.
The annual SEC-T conference is taking place between 13th and 14th
of September at Fotografiska in Stockholm.

This year, the SEC-T conference will revolve around information security in general
and technical security in particular. We have a great line up of speakers this year.
We are proud to invite back some previous speakers that have been popular together
with some new.

Mind you we're still just a 200+ size one track con run by a few enthusiasts but we
very proud of our conference and the excellent speakers and attendees we've attracted 
the past four cons. If you've always wanted a reason to visit Sweden I think it's time
you came this September ;)
