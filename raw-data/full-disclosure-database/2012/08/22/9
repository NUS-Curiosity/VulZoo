- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within how the service handles a specially
formatted LDAP request. When handling a particular set of commands, the
server will copy a string described in the packet into a statically sized
buffer without validating it's length. This leads to a stack-based overflow
and as such can be exploited to achieve code execution under the context of
the application.

- -- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
