ZDI-12-162 : (0Day) HP Diagnostics Server magentservice.exe Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-162
August 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard Diagnostics Server

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Diagnostics Server. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the magentservice.exe process which listens
on port 23472 by default. The process performs insufficient bounds checking
on user-supplied data prior to copying it into a fixed-length buffer on the
stack. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by
sending malformed message packets to the target, which could ultimately
lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:

This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in
accordance with the ZDI 180 day deadline.
