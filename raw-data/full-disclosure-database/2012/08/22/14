ZDI-12-151 : Oracle Outside In Excel File TxO Parsing Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-151
August 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

- -- Affected Products:
Oracle Outside In

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of products utilizing Oracle's Outside In
Technology. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in
that the target must open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the library's parsing of Excel files. When
handling the TxO record, the vseshr.dll module can be made to wrap an
integer value when parsing a specific field. This can lead to an improper
memory allocation that can be leveraged to corrupt the heap leading to
arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the
application. 

- -- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
