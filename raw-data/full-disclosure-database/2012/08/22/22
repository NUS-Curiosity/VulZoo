- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of Series records. The code
within Excel.exe makes an assumption about the data types within a Series
record and can be made to write beyond the bounds of a heap buffer when a
specific combination of fields are set to unexpected values. This
corruption can be leveraged to achieve code execution under the context of
the user running the application. 

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
