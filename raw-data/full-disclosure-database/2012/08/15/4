Package        : python-django
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3442 CVE-2012-3443 CVE-2012-3444
Debian Bug     : 683364

Jeroen Dekkers and others reported several vulnerabilities in Django,
a Python Web framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project defines the following issues:

CVE-2012-3442

    Two functions do not validate the scheme of a redirect target,
    which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks via a data: URL.

CVE-2012-3443

    The ImageField class completely decompresses image data during image
    validation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (memory consumption) by uploading an image file.

CVE-2012-3444

    The get_image_dimensions function in the image-handling functionality
    uses a constant chunk size in all attempts to determine dimensions,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process
    or thread consumption) via a large TIFF image.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
