Subject: Associate professor from Pakistan National
	University - spammer

Hi!

I hope this is within reasonable limits of self promoting. I keep blog about local spammers but today bit different fish was captured. I found that person who is spamming
OpenCV list with "Plz visit my e-gaming site at http://." is PhD and associate professor of National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Milirary College of Signals, Pakistan. 

I posted relevant stuff here: http://no.spam.ee/?p=920

I would like to receive feedback from universities listed there. Till now I got zero feedback from spammer not rector or university yet.

  Tonu
