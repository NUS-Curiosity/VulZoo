You're right: my apologies.  I didn't really look at how this exploit works.

And you're certainly right that making /data writeable is a better way
to exploit it.

I just confirmed that on my 2.3.6 Epic 4G Touch there is no issue: a
directory symlinked to /data/local/tmp does NOT get its permissions
changed on boot.

I am not sure I would say that it's erroneous to make /data/local
writeable by adb shell.  It may be handy for a developer with an
unrooted device to put various commandline utilities in /data/local,
such as a better busybox.
