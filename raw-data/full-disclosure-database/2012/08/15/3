Subject: debugfs exploit for a number of Android devices

I haven't seen a reference to this in the archives, so for the sake of
completeness here it is:
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1790104

Looks like on a number of devices you can symlink the block device
that gets mounted on /system to something like /data/local/tmp, and
then use debugfs to edit that file system.  This allows rooting by the
local user, but also all sorts of nastiness by malicious apps that
might bundle a copy of debugfs and then change arbitrary files in
/system, raise privileges, etc.
