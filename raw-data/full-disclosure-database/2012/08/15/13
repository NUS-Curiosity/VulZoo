Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-126 - Hotblocks -
	Cross Site	Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1732946

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-126
  * Project: HotBlocks [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-August-15
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Hotblocks module provides an enhanced GUI for administering blocks and
block content that is intended to be simpler and more controllable for less
privileged users than the default block administration tools.

.... Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize the user input for "block names" on
the module's settings page. A user could inject arbitrary scripts into pages
affecting site users.

This XSS vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a
role with the permission "administer hotblocks".

.... Denial of Service (DoS)

The hotblocks user interface also allows a user to configure one hotblock to
reference itself as content, thereby creating an infinite loop and
potentially rendering a site unusable.

The DoS vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a user must have a role
with the permission "administer hotblocks" or a user with said permission
must have configured the site such that it allows hotblocks to be embedded in
other hotblocks.

CVE: Requested
