Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-127 - Custom
	Publishing Options -	Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1732980

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-127
  * Project: Custom Publishing Options [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-August-15
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Custom Publishing Options module allows you to create custom publishing
options for nodes. It allows you to add to the default options of Publish,
Promote to Front Page, and Sticky. It also ingrates with views to allow you
add as a field, sort and filter by, your custom options.

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize status labels containing HTML.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer nodes".
