Subject: Fwd: [TSCM-L] {6221} Domain Awareness System

While this is slightly OT, I'm sure many readers would find it interesting.
Two emails; overview in the first, a bunch of copy/pastes of stratfor
emails in the second. Cheers.

Ah, I forgot a couple details & had some typos; when I said "Ottawa
and Canada", I meant Ottawa and London. I totally forget Austin, et
cetera.

Here's a bunch of links to copy/pastes from stratfor emails detailing
a lot of what I had to say in the prior email. There's like 10+ pages
of hits in the stratfor dumps, so it's not all of it, just what I had
bookmarked while reading into it some.

Cheers.
