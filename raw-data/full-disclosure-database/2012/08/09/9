Subject: Hacker Highschool v2

Hi,

Version 2 of Hacker Highschool (www.hackerhighschool.org) is wrapping 
up. We will begin publishing/replacing each lesson as we finish it. Of 
course we can always use more dedicated experts to contribute which 
would speed the whole process up.

More details on the project are available in a new article:

http://opensource.com/life/12/8/hacker-highschool-students-learn-redesign-future

FYI: since then, we've added 1 more lesson

       #22 Trolling and Bullying

Enjoy!

Sincerely,
-pete.
