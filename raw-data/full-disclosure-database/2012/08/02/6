About TOR (I don't know if this is OT with respect to the thread subject),
which is the best configuration for a browser?

On torproject.org they strongly suggest the use of the Browser Bundle, but
personally I don't like that much the idea of runnining another instance
of Firefox with its own configuration. Also, reading the website, It's
possible to find a lot of ways for torifying applications[1], but after
reading this article[2], I've start wondering if this documentation is
out-dated.
