Subject: [Full-disclosure] OT: OSX-PHP Dev Enviornment

Greets all.  Sorry for the OT, but I thought I'd ask here...

As you can guess, I've used Visual Studio to do web and application
development for longer than I care to remember.   Given that I've moved my
production HoG facilities over to OSX, I now find myself missing the
development environment VS afforded me as I migrate to PHP under Apache.  

I'm using EditRocket atm, but I'm soliciting recommendations for a PHP dev
environment that will provide the same functions (or close) as VS does in
regard to syntax checking, code completion, etc.   I'm actually surprised at
how quickly I've synched up with PHP, but I'd still like a more professional
environment.   Free or Commercial doesn't matter.  

I am thanking you.
