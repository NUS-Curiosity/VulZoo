Subject: Re: some distros for Raspberry Pi have sshd
 enabled and default logins.

My argument is they should prompt the user to change the password, not provide an insecure image
With the expectations that users will secure it themselves. It maybe obvious to us, but with a good deal
Of the audience being inexperienced users it should be part of the install.
