Why not?! Cisco is using a System Service for upgrading parts of the VPN
client. The client simply performs an update check against the currently
configured VPN site, and updates if a newer version is available and the
site policy demands it.
So one could simply replace the previously patched vpndownloader.exe
with the vulnerable version and...

But I also don't understand why "User interaction is required to exploit
this vulnerability". I'm pretty sure it's also working without.
