Oh yes, there's been code floating around for years that uses timing drift
-- but it's never anything that, say, gets integrated into kernels or
distros or even embedded frameworks.  Compared to the number of nodes out
there, it's certainly not "lots" of people using haveged.  There's just
been a lot of fear and nervousness around clock drift approaches, and
indeed, entropy gathering has gotten *worse* (via abandonment of
interrupts), not better.

Hopefully we can finally put all that -- not to bed -- but to the test.
 Lets find out if clock drift works after all.
