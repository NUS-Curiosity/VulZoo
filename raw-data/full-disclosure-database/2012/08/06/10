 ActiveX _Times Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,
 [from] Full-Disclosure Digest, Vol 90, Issue 7

Just out of curiosity: the IBM page that you linked to does give credit to 
ZDI/Tipping Point, but it claims that the page was both created and last 
updated on 5/23/2012. Did IBM fail to refresh their timestamp?
