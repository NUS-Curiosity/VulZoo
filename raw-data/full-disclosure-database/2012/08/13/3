    The first and most obvious point is that they are NOT journalists.  They are "monkey read, monkey write" content pushers with no regard for truth, accuracy, or fairness. 

Look at what's happened with the Apple thing.  One monkey reads what another monkey wrote, figures it's true, and writes his own version, mixing things 'round a bit.  Now when you read something it sounds like the whole of cloud computing is at risk. 

It's all crap.    They do whatever they can to get you to their site so you are forced to watch a 30 second commercial ( which is moronic, btw).
