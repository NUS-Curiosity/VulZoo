Subject: Re: DLL Hijacking Against Installers In Browser
 Download Folders for Phish and Profit

I've got two concerns about this:


1. Either way you put it, I can't see how one can make a convincing
argument out of downloading a DLL file.
Asking laymen, they'd ask "what's a dll for? weren't updates done with
exe/msi/etc? why's it got that funny icon?"

2. I'm a bit curious about your choice of code, and why you commented out
exit(0); (what's the point anyway?)


Cheers,
Chris.
