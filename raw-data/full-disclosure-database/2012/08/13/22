 Download Folders for Phish and Profit

Well, what can I say - your write up is accurate.

Though last time I've seen it, around 5 years ago, it was still called
DLL spoofing and not DLL hijacking, and was one of the arguments why
"carpet bombing" (automatic download) in Safair/Chrome must be fixed
