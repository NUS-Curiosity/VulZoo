Subject: WTB: CIK and Fortezza card

So I know FD isn't Craigslist but I figured its my best bet.  I am looking
for a KSD-64 Crypto Ignition Key (CIK) as well as a Fortezza card.  If you
know where I can get either, please contact me.  Note that
http://www.psism.com lists Fortezza cards on their website but they don't
sell them anymore.  FWIW I am a US citizen...so no, I'm not a spy :P
