ZDI-12-172 : (0Day) HP Operations Orchestration RSScheduler Service JDBC
Connector Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-172
August 29, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard Operations Orchestra

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Operations Orchestration. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the RSScheduler service JDBC component of
Operations Orchestra which listens by default on TCP port 9001. The
component is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Remote, unauthenticated
attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL into
the target, which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under
the context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:


- -- Mitigation:
The overall design of Operations Orchestra assumes it runs as an
application on a Windows server. Given the stated purpose of Operations
Orchestra, and the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation
strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines.
Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship
with the HP Operations Orchestra service should be permitted to communicate
with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with
firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native
Windows Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
