Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-133 - Taxonomy
	Image - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS) & Arbitrary PHP code execution

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1762482

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-133
  * Project: Taxonomy Image [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-August-29
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Arbitrary PHP code execution

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The taxonomy_image module allows site administrators to associate images with
taxonomy terms.

The module did not sufficiently filter retrieval of taxonomy images, allowing
users to bypass Drupal's normal file upload protections to install malicious
HTML or executable code to the server.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the
permissions "administer taxonomy" and "administer taxonomy images", and that
the fix for SA-2006-006 - Drupal Core - Execution of arbitrary files in
certain Apache configurations [3] should prevent code execution in typical
Apache configurations.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Taxonomy Image 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.7.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Taxonomy Image
[4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Taxonomy Image module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Taxonomy
    Image 6.x-1.7 [5]

Also see the Taxonomy Image [6] project page.
