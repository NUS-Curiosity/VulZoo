Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-130 - Jstool -
	Multiple	Vulnerabilities

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1762220

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-130
  * Project: Javascript Tool [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-August-29
  * Security risk: Highly critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Javascript Tool enables administrators to edit any javascript file online
from an admin panel.

The module does not protect its menu paths, which contain sensitive
information about all javascript files on the site and their contents.
The module does not validate filenames which can lead to potential read/write
access to arbitrary files on the server.

Write access to files is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the
permission to use the full_html text format.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Javascript Tool 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.7.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Javascript
Tool [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

  * If you use the Javascript Tool module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to
    Javascript Tool 7.x-1.7 [4]
