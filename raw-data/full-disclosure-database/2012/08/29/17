Code Execution Vulnerability

10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard SiteScope

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP SiteScope. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists because HP SiteScope allows unauthenticated SOAP
calls to be made to the SiteScope service. One of those calls is
getSiteScopeConfiguration() which will return the current configuration of
the server including the administrator login and password information. A
remote attacker could abuse this vulnerability to login to SiteScope with
administrative privileges then execute arbitrary code through the
underlying functionality.

- -- Vendor Response:


- -- Mitigation:
Given the stated purpose of SiteScope, and the nature of the vulnerability,
the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the
service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a
legitimate procedural relationship with the HP SiteScope service should be
permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of
ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are
available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
