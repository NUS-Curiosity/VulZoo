- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of GE Proficy Historian. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the KeyHelp.ocx ActiveX control. The
control contains a LaunchTriPane function that allows launching of the HTML
Help executable (hh.exe) with customized command line parameters. By using
the -decompile switch, an attacker can specify the folder to decompile to
and a UNC path to a specially crafted .chm file. The attacker can utilize
this vulnerability to execute remote code under the context of the process.
