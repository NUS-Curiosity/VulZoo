Perhaps its time to update the disclosure policy. It does not seem to
be working as intended. Hindsight being 20/20, it makes sense since it
appears the "foxes are guarding the henhouse." I believe its the
reason for Bugtraq and Full Disclosure.

At minimum, it seems appropriate to include US Cert (or other Cert's)
once a good faith effort has been made to have the vendor fix the
defects. Vendors can string folks like you and I along, but they have
less success with folks like country-wide cert's.

I once used DE Cert to report some issues with GnuPG on Windows.
Interestingly, I was asked to provide funding for the fix even though
I submitted sample code demonstrating the fix. (Crowd sourcing is a
myth - don't drink the Kool-aide).
