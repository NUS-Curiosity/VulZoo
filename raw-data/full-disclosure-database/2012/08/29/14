ZDI-12-170 : (0Day)  HP Application Lifecycle Management XGO.ocx ActiveX
Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

August 29, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard Application Lifecycle Management

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Application Lifecycle
Management. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in
that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the XGO.ocx ActiveX control. The control
exposed two vulnerable functions: 'SetShapeNodeType', which is vulnerable
to a type confusion allowing user specified memory to be used as an object;
and 'CopyToFile' which allows an attacker to create and overwrite files on
the system of the user invoking the control. The attacker can utilize these
vulnerabilities to execute remote code under the context of the process.

- -- Vendor Response:

- -- Mitigation:
Given the stated purpose of Application Lifecycle Management, and the
nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to
restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients
and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the HP
Application Lifecycle Management service should be permitted to communicate
with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with
firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native
Windows Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
