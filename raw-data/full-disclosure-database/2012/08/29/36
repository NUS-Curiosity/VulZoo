Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-135 - CAPTCHA -
	Insufficient	anti-automation prevention

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1762496

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-135
  * Project: CAPTCHA [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2011-August-29
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to protect website forms using a CAPTCHA. A CAPTCHA
is a test which attempts to differentiate between a human and an automated
bot or script.

The module doesn't ensure that test submissions have a single-use unique
token. This means that web robots could reuse a single successful submission
multiple times, reducing the effectiveness of the protection.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * CAPTCHA 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.3

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed CAPTCHA [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the CAPTCHA module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to CAPTCHA 6.x-2.3
    [4] or greater

Also see the CAPTCHA [5] project page.
