Subject: t2′12: Challenge to be released 2012-09-01 10:00 EEST

It is that time of the year again - we’re pleased to announce the
release of the t2’12 Challenge!

This year’s challenge starts from the homepage of a young woman who is
rumored to be the girlfriend of an infamous carder. To solve the
challenge, the participants need to step into investigator's shoes and
follow the clues to find all gang members. But this is only where the
challenge begins - each gang member possesses a piece of a secret image
file that they have hidden using their own expertise.

Gang members and their secrets can be revealed in any order. The
scoreboard shows real-time overview of all investigators, as well as
detailed TOP 20 ranking. What is more, this year's challenge will
require a more diverse skillset than ever before. Finding the gang
members from the Interwebs is a challenge in its own right but some
serious ninja skills are required to unravel the hidden image files.

The rules are simple: the first one to solve the challenge will win free
admission to the t2’12 infosec conference. But don’t stop just because
you weren’t the first one to solve it: The Advisory Board will select
another winner among the next ten correct answers, paying particular
attention to the elegance of the solution rather than the speed. In
other words you can win with either speed or style :)

The t2’12 Challenge will be released 2012-09-01 10:00 EEST right here at
http://t2.fi/

Good luck,
