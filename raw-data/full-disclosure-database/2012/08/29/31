Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-131 - Email Field
	- Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1762470

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-131
  * Project: Email Field [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-August-29
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The email module provides a field type (CCK / FieldAPI) for storing email
addresses. Furthermore, it provides a formatter to output the email address
as a link to a contact form. The contact form formatter allows a site visitor
to email the stored address without letting them see what that e-mail address
is.

The module didn't sufficiently check access for the contact form page,
allowing a site visitor to email the stored address on the entity without
having access to the entity itself.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Email Field 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.2.
  * Email Field 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Email Field
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.
