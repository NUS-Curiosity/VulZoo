ZDI-12-130 : Apple QuickTime Player MP4A Uninitialized Pointer Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-130
August  3, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3458

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
Apple

- -- Affected Products:
Apple QuickTime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a header
containing codec-specific data. When handling an error case, the
application will forget to initialize a pointer which will later be used in
a memory operation. This can lead to code execution under the context of
the application.

- -- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
