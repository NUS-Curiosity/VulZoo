Subject: How to use ARP Spoof to bypass firewall ACL?

Hello

I do ARP Spoof often to obtain credentials with ettercap, but now I'm in a
network where I can't reach a system on another network, but sniffing I see
that there is another machine on the same network segment where I'm that is
able to connect to them, however I don't have access to this system as well
and it's always turned on. I need to do ARP Spoofing to make my gateway
believe that I'm this system to reach my target. I found a tool called
arp-sk and I followed an example to escape firewalls but I think it doesn't
work.

I tried this arp-sk stuff, tried to setup a virtual interface with the same
IP (collision happened and was not helpful), tried to use it with arpping
-U and even change value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_nonlocal_bind and nothing
worked.

Anyone with real experience in use ARP spoof to bypass firewall ACL please
drop me a private e-mail.

Thanks.
