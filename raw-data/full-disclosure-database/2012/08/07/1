Administrative and Technical contacts at

You also have the standard mailboxes (RFC 2142) -
secure@...sungtechwin.com, security@...sungtechwin.com, and
hostmaster@...sungtechwin.com.

Stay away from the web submission forms. The site's legal team can
(and will) insert all sorts of obscene terms. They may attempt to bind
you to confidentiality and non-disclosure.
