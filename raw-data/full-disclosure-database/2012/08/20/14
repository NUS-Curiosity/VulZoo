The long answer is look at /usr/src/sys/sys/random.h.

The short answer is:
/* Allow the sysadmin to select the broad category of
 * entropy types to harvest
 */
struct harvest_select {
	int ethernet;
	int point_to_point;
	int interrupt;
	int swi;
};

swi is software interrupt handlers.  interrupt is hardware interrupts (e.g. 
usb, pci, etc.)

*If* you install a hardware PRNG, FreeBSD will use that instead (by 
default).
