This 2002 USENIX paper explains the process.  A Yarrow PRNG is used and the 
output is encrypted with the AES Rijndael cipher.

Sources of entropy are defined in random.h
enum esource { \
    RANDOM_WRITE, RANDOM_KEYBOARD, \
    RANDOM_MOUSE, RANDOM_NET, \
    RANDOM_INTERRUPT, ENTROPYSOURCE \
};
void random_harvest(void *data, \
    u_int count, u_int bits, \
    u_int frac, enum esource source);

Here's a copy of random.h:
