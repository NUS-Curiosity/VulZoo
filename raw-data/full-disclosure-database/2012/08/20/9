Subject: Re: GIMP Scriptfu Python Remote Command Execution

The scriptfu network server (when enabled) does not require authentication
and will run commands from anyone that can connect to its tcp port (usually
10008).

Where exactly is the vulnerability here? I am unable to see it myself, it
appears that you are using an eval function to evaluate code which isn't
exactly a security issue.

2012/8/17 research <research@...ctionis.co.uk>

Summary
=======

There is an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the scriptfu
network server
console in the GIMP 2.6 branch. It is possible to use a python scriptfu
command to run
arbitrary operating-system commands and potentially take full control of the
host.

Vendor homepage: http://www.gimp.org/
Vendor notified: 9/8/2012

(Windows or Linux builds).

Details
=======

There is an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the scriptfu
network server
console in the GIMP 2.6 branch. It is possible to use a python scriptfu
command to run
arbitrary operating-system commands and potentially take full control of the
host.
The following command will write "foo" to "/tmp/owned":

(python-fu-eval 0 "file = open('/tmp/owned','w')\nfile.write('foo')")


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in remote command
execution.

Solution
===========
No solution has been implemented at this stage apart from the workaround
below.

Workaround
===========

Do not enable the scriptfu network server.
The GIMP development team have stated that this component was not designed
with security
 in mind and therefore should not be used in production environments.
