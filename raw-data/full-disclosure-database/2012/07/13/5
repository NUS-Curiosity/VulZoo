Subject: Multiple CSRF Vulnerabilities in [GLPI Version
	0.83.2]

Hi,

 

This is regarding multiple CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)

Vulnerabilities in [GLPI Version 0.83.2]. The following

is the disclosure document:

 

Title: Multiple CSRF Vulnerabilities in [GLPI Version 0.83.2] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project: [GLPI Version 0.83.2] 

Severity: High

Versions: 0.83.2 (other versions may be affected)

Exploit type: Multiple CSRF

Fixed: New release GLPI 0.83.3 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timeline:

27 June 2012:  Vendor Contacted

27 June 2010:  Vendor Response received

5  July 2012:  Vendor releases new version

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Description:

GLPI is the Information Resource-Manager with an additional
Administration- Interface. You can use 

it to build up a database with an inventory for your company (computer,
software, printers...). It 

has enhanced functions to make the daily life for the administrators
easier, like a 

job-tracking-system with mail-notification and methods to build a
database with basic information 

about your network-topology.

Vulnerability Details:

An attacker can execute functions as an authenticated user by tricking a

user into making requests to the Server. The attack works by including a

link or script in a page that accesses a site to which the user is known

(or is supposed) to have been authenticated. Successful exploitation of

these vulnerabilities could result in, but not limited to, compromise of

the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials,

arbitrary page redirection, disclosure or modification of sensitive data

and phishing attacks.

 

Since the vulnerabilities also exist in the administrative module, a

successful attack could cause a complete compromise of the entire

application. An attacker can send a link with the exploit to an

administrator whose access could compromise the application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Proof of Concept:

Create a html content (img, iframes etc.) with the following PoC URLs as

src and host for the authenticated victim.

 

 

Eg URL: 

http://localhost/glpi/front/preference.php?name=glpi&id=2&realname=Attac
ker&language=en_GB&use_mode=

0&update=Update
