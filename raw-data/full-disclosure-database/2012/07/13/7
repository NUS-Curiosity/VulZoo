Uh, so, erm, you assume that someone can steal my cookie/set it/whatever
although the Same Origin Policy should clearly not allow that, and then, after
I have logged in, he can't just steal my cookie? Unless you allow setting the
session-ID via an URL or so (which would IMO be pretty stupid), I can't see
how this is a realistic, vendor-neutral attack. Could you explain this a bit
better? I don't get it.
