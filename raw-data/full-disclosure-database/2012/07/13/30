Subject: Re: Predefined Post Authentication Session ID
	Vulnerability

Well if I understand Tim correctly you wouldn't need a CA. In the attack he
mentioned not once do you ever actually look at the ssl content. He's
talking about redirecting them to plain http and then setting the session
cookie and redirecting them back. Then when the victim logs on over ssl,
the session cookie isn't changed and is treated as authenticated. Obviously
since you set the cookie, you know what it is and can then impersonate
them.

I also agree that it probably wouldn't take too much effort to make that
work, anything that can modify traffic ought to do the job easily enough
with some tweaking. If not it wouldn't take much effort to whip up
something specialized.
