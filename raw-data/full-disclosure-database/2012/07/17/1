While some known patterns of behaviors are useful to detect malware or backdoors we still need that normal profile to detect 0-day or APT style intrusions. Isn't that the same idea from early days of intrusion detection research (anomaly detection approach)? Or maybe I'm off track.

The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts. I'm wondering if there is any systematic approach to analyze the collected logs? Most of the materials I've seen are more aligned to malware and rootkit detection which is not the only concern apparently.
