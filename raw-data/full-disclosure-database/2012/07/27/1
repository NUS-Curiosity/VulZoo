Subject: Google Blacklisted Database Query

Google has totally 'blacklisted' queries.  For example, if you search
for 4000000000000000..4999999999999999 (any 16 digit number starting
with 4), as well as some other little known strings, you will
instantly get an error message from Google talking about bad traffic
from your network (it looks a lot like the "bot" message).  However,
if you search in Google Alerts preview box, it does not filter out the
"bad" queries for that day, and that day only.  You can also set up
email alerts for blacklisted things you would like to search for.  I
notified Google about this about a week ago, they didn't really seem
to care too much, so I figured I'd post it here. :)
Have fun if you want, but don't be a jackass.
