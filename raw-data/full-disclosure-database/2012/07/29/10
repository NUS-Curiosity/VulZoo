Subject: Vulnerabilities in plugins for MODx CMS, Joomla,
	Moodle and WordPress

Hello list!

Earlier I've wrote about Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities in JW Player (http://securityvulns.com/docs28176.html). And
I've mentioned that there are near million of web sites with vulnerable
flash-file - it's only indexed by Google, and in reality there are much more
of them (JW Player is very popular flash video player). Similar
vulnerabilities exist in hundreds of web applications. Particularly in the
next five plugins for engines MODx CMS, Joomla, Moodle and WordPress, which
are using swf-file of JW Player.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of JWPlayer for MODx.

Vulnerable are all versions of Simple video flash player for Joomla.

Vulnerable are all versions of Poodll for Moodle.

Vulnerable are all versions of RokBox for Joomla.

Vulnerable are all versions of RokBox for WordPress.

----------
Details:
----------

Content Spoofing and XSS are similar to described earlier
(http://securityvulns.com/docs28176.html). Only in the plugins (old
versions, which I saw) Simple video flash player for Joomla and RokBox for
Joomla and WP, in which JWPlayer 4.x is used, there are no CS via playlist
and logotype and XSS via parameter playerready and via logotype.

The paths to swf-file are the next:

JWPlayer for MODx plugin (extra):

http://site/embed/player.swf

Example of XSS vulnerability.

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/embed/player.swf?playerready=alert(document.cookie)

Simple video flash player for Joomla:

http://site/modules/mod_simple_video_flash_player/jwplayer.swf

Poodll for Moodle:

http://site/poodll/jwplayer59/jwplayer.swf

Example of XSS vulnerability.

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/poodll/jwplayer59/jwplayer.swf?playerready=alert(document.cookie)

RokBox for Joomla:

http://site/plugins/system/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf

RokBox for WordPress:

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf

--------------
Mitigation:
--------------

At 3rd of June, after my informing, developers of MODx CMS have removed
JWPlayer plugin from their official web site. But the file is still online,
because it was hosted at another site and it was just a redirect from
modx.com to the plugin. Upgrading to the new version of swf-file of JW
Player can help mitigate some XSS holes (and the developers are planning to
fix other holes later).

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site:
