Subject: Quick note on requesting CVEs for public issues

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Just a note if you need CVE's for open source security issues email
oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
(http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security).
Please note that these requests are completely public (anyone can sign
up to the oss-security@ list, the archives are public). This is
generally one of the better ways to request a CVE because everyone
that cares to track CVE #'s will find out about it ASAP, and also
because it is a public request it is unlikely that anyone else will
accidentally or otherwise request a CVE for the same issue resulting
in a duplicate.

Time line: I generally respond to these within one business day, this
means you'll either get a CVE or a request for more information if the
request is not properly formatted or is unclear/missing details/etc.

As far as what goes into the request:

Information for CVE request that is REQUIRED:

    -Email address of requester (so we can contact them)
    -Software name and optionally vendor name
    -At least one of (to determine if this a security issue):
        Type of vulnerability
        Attack outcome
    -For Open Source at least one of:
        Link to vulnerable source code or fix
        Link to source code change log
        Link to security advisory
        Link to bug entry
    -Affected version(s) (3.2.4, 3.x, current version, all current
releases, something)
    -If this has been previously requested (i.e. on OSS-Sec or to
cve-assign@...re.org) please inform me so we can avoid duplicates
    -If multiple issues are listed please list affected versions for
each issue and/or who reported them (so we can determine CVE
split/merge status).

Information for CVE request, REQUESTED:

    -More of the above information of course
    -Software version(s) fixed (if available)
    -Any additional information that helps determine the status of the
flaws/fixes

Examples of CVE entries can be found at http://cve.mitre.org/cve/,
examples of CVE requests can be found in the OSS-sec archives.
