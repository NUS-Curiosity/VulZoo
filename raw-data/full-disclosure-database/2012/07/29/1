Assuming it's not a troll, my suspicion is that it's common where
Musntlive comes from to use unmanaged switches at the distribution level. 
I think he has a great point in that case - if you can't associate MAC's
with ports and hence physical connections, you do indeed have a problem. 
And to cut off any rebuttal from Musntlive, yes I am fully aware of how
easy it is to spoof MAC addresses.  However, if you want your packets on
the network, the switch is going to be aware of that your MAC is coming
from a particular system (again, assuming managed switches and a one to
one relationship of servers to switch ports).  If you have a way around
that, I suspect you'll have a great talk for Defcon next year.

In this mess of emails, I somehow completely lost the context of how we
went from a question on being able to analyze a Linux system to determine
if it's compromised to arguing about whether we can track back an attacker
sending (malicious?) broadcast packets on a network to a specific server.
