I was just looking at a similar package for Windows called utorrent. They
relay the remote administration through a third party, presumably to help
non-technical users understand NAT traversal.

Similar problems exist, but you can use it to set configuration options that
result in command execution. I guess this problem is public as their contact
address is a public bug tracking system (mea culpa).

I have a working demo for command execution, email me off-list if you want
it (I'm reluctant to send too much information about windows software to the
list, as journalists tend to abuse it, email me if you need specifics).

Tavis.
