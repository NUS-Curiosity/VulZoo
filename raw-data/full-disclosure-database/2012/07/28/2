Subject: Re: Pligg 0.9/1.x remote code execution

they should not have been fixed, as when exploit has been released they
where not and looking at SVN no change has been made (
http://pligg.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pligg/ )
no CVE has been asked for this vuln (at least from me), so none should has
been assigned.
And regarding your post been deleted: it's a common practice for the head
of Pligg to try hiding bugs of his CMS instead of encouraging responsible
disclosing them ( that's why exploit has been released in the wild ).
