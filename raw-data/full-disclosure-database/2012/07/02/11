Subject: Fake messages and chat bug in Facebook

Knowing the user registration email is possible to send fake messages /
chat to facebook users.
The only thing required is a fake mail with as the sender the victim
registration  email addressed to the facebook ids followed by "@facebook.com
"

Example:

from victim.email@...mail.com to friend1@...ebook.com, friend2@...ebook.com.
..

Sent email will be shown in Facebook like a private message (or chat if
multiple recipients are specified) sent by the Facebook account of the
victim.

(Previously reported vulnerabilities to Facebook)
