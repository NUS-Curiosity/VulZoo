 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2012:115
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : dhcp
 Date    : July 26, 2012
 Affected: 2011.

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in ISC DHCP:
 
 An unexpected client identifier parameter can cause the ISC DHCP
 daemon to segmentation fault when running in DHCPv6 mode, resulting
 in a denial of service to further client requests. In order to exploit
 this condition, an attacker must be able to send requests to the DHCP
 server (CVE-2012-3570
 
 An error in the handling of malformed client identifiers can cause
 a DHCP server running affected versions (see Impact) to enter a
 state where further client requests are not processed and the server
 process loops endlessly, consuming all available CPU cycles. Under
 normal circumstances this condition should not be triggered, but a
 non-conforming or malicious client could deliberately trigger it in
 a vulnerable server. In order to exploit this condition an attacker
 must be able to send requests to the DHCP server (CVE-2012-3571
 
 Two memory leaks have been found and fixed in ISC DHCP. Both are
 reproducible when running in DHCPv6 mode (with the -6 command-line
 argument.) The first leak is confirmed to only affect servers
 operating in DHCPv6 mode, but based on initial code analysis the
 second may theoretically affect DHCPv4 servers (though this has not
 been demonstrated.) (CVE-2012-3954).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the latest version
 (4.2.4-P1) which is not affected by these issues.
