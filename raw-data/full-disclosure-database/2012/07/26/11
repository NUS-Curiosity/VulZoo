Whatever layer-2 feats you've performed or will continue to perform,
you're still very trackable and monitoring/blocking you at layer-3 is
trivial.

Remote-to-machine or remote-to-network? Ultimately I can just say it
again: Whatever layer-2 feats you've performed or continue to perform,
you're still very trackable and monitoring/blocking you at layer-3 is
trivial.

You've figured it out- tap-port the entire switch's traffic, and then
once you've got what you need, shut down every port. Once data
integrity has been compromised, service downtime is almost always the
lesser cost.
