Subject: Re: Linux - Indicators of compromise

Hello Ali. 

Is your question about investigating a set of servers you suspect may be infected, or setting up a steady state monitoring strategy to alert when/if a host is compromised?  

Regards,

Jerry

The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts. I'm wondering if there is any systematic approach to analyze the collected logs? Most of the materials I've seen are more aligned to malware and rootkit detection which is not the only concern apparently.
