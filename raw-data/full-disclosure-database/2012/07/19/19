	Monitor - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1691446

  * Advisory ID: SA-CONTRIB-2012-114
  * Project: Campaign Monitor [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-July-18
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to integrate Campaign Monitor into Drupal so you can
give users the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe for your Campaign Monitor
lists.

The module doesn't sufficiently validate strings entered in the
administration interface.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer campaignmonitor".

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Campaign Monitor 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.5

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Campaign
Monitor [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Campaign Monitor module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Campaign
    Monitor 6.x-2.5 [4]

Also see the Campaign Monitor [5] project page.
