Subject: Re: Linux - Indicators of compromise

I wasn't initially, but that's where the discussion is taking me. I was thinking of collecting local logs from a Linux box and analyze them to determine if its been compromised or not. I understand a hybrid approach should be taken, including pattern detection to capture known malware/backdoors and a behavioral analysis to tag any abnormal behavior.

Michael mentioned a very true and good point that theoretically logs and behavior of a compromised system cannot be trusted. Other folks, also pointed that a data exfilteration usually follows a compromise and can be considered as a shared pattern for majority of attacks (I want to add command/control traffic myself).

Friends, is that a good summary of a high level approach?

Cheers,
Ali

SO you're talking about making a baseline?

While some known patterns of behaviors are useful to detect malware or backdoors we still need that normal profile to detect 0-day or APT style intrusions. Isn't that the same idea from early days of intrusion detection research (anomaly detection approach)? Or maybe I'm off track.

The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts. I'm wondering if there is any systematic approach to analyze the collected logs? Most of the materials I've seen are more aligned to malware and rootkit detection which is not the only concern apparently.
