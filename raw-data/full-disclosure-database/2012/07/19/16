This is make sense! Do not isolate. Let hacker run rampant in is your
network. Because if they is damage your network in is process of not
isolating them, is ok if they is steal and delete. You get to see what
is they stole after is gone, and after they is wipe your system. This
is good advice yes, help test your BC/DR! MusntLive like absurd and
obscure approach!

MusntLive is love your advice!

According to you:

1) Let hacker run amok so you can see them is run amok
2) Once hacker is run amok, steal your bread and is butter, wipe your
systems, restore
3) Go back and is learn why they steal and delete.

MusntLive think answer for #3) is logic one: "Idiot admin allowed is
this to happen"
