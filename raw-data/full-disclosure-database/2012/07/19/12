Shortcutting other responses-

A suspect node that you want to keep live can only be treated in two ways:

1) if you need to know who is behind the shenanigans, you monitor net
traffic and isolate/simulate reach and then do what you can to get
what you need.

2) assume the worst, don't isolate, monitor spread tactics,
perceptually contain and then analyse.

Live on-box analysis is useless in every case, and you need to think forensics.
Disconnect, dump, analyse- but only after you've got what you really need.

Endgame is always close the hole, restore the data, learn from your
mistakes that allowed it to happen :)

The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts. I'm wondering if there is any systematic approach to analyze the collected logs? Most of the materials I've seen are more aligned to malware and rootkit detection which is not the only concern apparently.
