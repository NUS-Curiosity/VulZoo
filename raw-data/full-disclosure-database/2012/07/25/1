If you broadcast using a MAC address you are on the same subnet, layer 2.

On a wired network I don't really care whether you spoofed your mac 
address or not, you still registered the mac address on the switch, and 
I can see what port you connected to. Then I just need to follow the 
cable to find you.

In any case, this is an internal intrusion or post-exploitation issue 
we're talking about, not an external one, assuming the layer-2 
environment has a modicum of protection.
