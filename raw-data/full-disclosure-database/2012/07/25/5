Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-115 - Gallery
	formatter - Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1700578

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-115
  * Project: Gallery formatter [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-July-25
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Gallery formatter provides a field formatter for images that turns the fields
into jQuery galleries.
The module did not properly escape input from the user before printing it to
the browser, allowing malicious users to inject script code into the page.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to create the nodes / entities and the fields that use
the formatter.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Gallery formatter 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.

formatter [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION

    formatter 7.x-1.2 [4]
