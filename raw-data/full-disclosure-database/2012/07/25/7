Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-117 - Location -
	Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1700588

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-117
  * Project: Location [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-July-25
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Location module allows real-world geographic locations to be associated
with Drupal nodes, including people, places, and other content. The Location
Search sub-module adds a search page for searching for locations.

The Location Search module fails to enforce content and user access
permissions and node access restrictions, meaning any user can see any node
or user results on the location search page.

  From now on users must have the "access content" permission and any relevant
node access rights to see node based location results and the "view user
profiles" and "view all user locations" permissions to see user based
location results.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Location Search (Location sub-module) 6.x versions prior to 6.x-3.2.
  * Location Search (Location sub-module) 7.x versions prior to
