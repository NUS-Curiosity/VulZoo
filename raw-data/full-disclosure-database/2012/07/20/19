If corporations are people, then they are psychopaths.
http://www.thecorporation.com/ - it was an interesting documentary.

As a side note, the US Supreme Court really f**k'd up the
interpretation of the 14th Amendment - what a bastardization. The
documentary offers some alarming statistics: of the 200 or so cases
surrounding the 14th Amendment, fewer than 20 were brought by African
Americans. The remainder were brought by corporations.

Corporations are evil, and board members need to be liable in both
civil and criminal cases. And no more bribing members of Congress
(err, PAC contributions).
