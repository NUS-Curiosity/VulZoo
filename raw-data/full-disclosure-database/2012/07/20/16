It isn't very realistic because wherever you put the code, in
whatever native form, you first have to decode it to RAM for
execution; and if this code is a piece of crap, it'll stay a
piece of crap.

Furthermore, obfuscation can "talk to you" when you're used to
review tons of code (haaa, apple][ nibble counts and other
"protections", where did ou go?:), and sensibly slows down
programs responsiveness.

The base of the problem isn't obfuscation but producing good
and tested code, AND reacting fast when a flaw is discovered.
This is what most of open-source coders fight to do and what
big corps strive to avoid.

In this matter, everybody's here knows that threatening these
corpos of a full disclosure is the only way to go, because 
they're like kids that won't grow up and seek the least effort 
possible & max benefit way - in a word, they're irresponsible.
