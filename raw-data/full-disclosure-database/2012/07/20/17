Wow, how short sighted.

So you really think that obfuscating code is a good excuse to escape
reviewing of bad code?
With all that trouble, you could just write it correctly from scratch (or
give it more time for testing).

But at this point, I think everyone is getting their own deal out of this.
The original idea does not work for each and every case, and it definitely
fails badly in some specific
cases...this however, does not discredit it at all.

On the other hand, if all you really care about is trolling...well, that's
another different story.
