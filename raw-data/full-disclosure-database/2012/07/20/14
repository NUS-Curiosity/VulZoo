May be it could be due to a heavy bureaucracy: base guy receiving
threat, sending it to the chief, chief waiting a week before 
sending to his own chief, higher chief spills his coffee on e-mail
and ask other lower chief to send another copy that will ask base
guy to do so, etc.

Only future disclosures threats will tell; let's say they have the
doubt benefit at this time...
