Subject: Defcon 20 printer-friendly schedule

Here's a link to the PDF I created (don't worry, I didn't throw any
suspicious streams/code in it ; ) that will print the Defcon 20 schedule
out no problemo on your printer.  Every year it kills me that the page
never seems to render right when sent to a printer.  Anyway, it will also
work beautifully with any PDF-loving application on the device of your
choice.

Hope to see you guys there...
