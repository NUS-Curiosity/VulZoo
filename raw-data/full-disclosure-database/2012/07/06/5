Subject: Re: How much time is appropriate for fixing a bug?

Hey Georgi,

    Didn't take your happy pill this morning?

    I would say that the answer depends on how the owner/company answers
you, if you feel that their stringing you along and you have given them
some time, then warn them that your publishing, give them 24 hours and
then go for it. Obviously it depends on the bug and the software, I
major bug in a large program will take longer, and so long as they are
talking to you, and you don't miss your morning happy pill, you can
wait, a small bug in a small program shouldn't take as long. There is no
one answer to your question, if you are having an interactive discussion
with them, then be patient, otherwise, Georgi's answer is a good one if
they are ignoring you or stringing you along.
