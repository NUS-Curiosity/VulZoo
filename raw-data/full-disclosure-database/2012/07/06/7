Thor (Hammer of God) : <If and when they fix it is up to them.>

so if vendor don't fix it /ack the bug.. then what ??
Responsibility works both ways.. Advise the vendor.. if they say fuck it..
I say fuck u.. and will advise the community !

There is a responsibility to disclose a venerability to the community so
that they can take down/block /deactivate a service .

".All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do
nothing. " -whoever ..fuck it !
