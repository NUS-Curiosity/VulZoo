Subject: Re: How much time is appropriate for fixing a bug?

Realistically, it will take at least a month to go from security to
development through QA and release (in your case probably twice, because
it may have to go through the carrier's QA/release). Wikipedia says 5
months: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure
