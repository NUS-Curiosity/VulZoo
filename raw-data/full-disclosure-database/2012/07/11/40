Subject: Re: Preferred OSX Security/Server Lists

Hi,

I do not know any specific stuff yet, though I have been a recent switcher myself.
I had a quick look but it seems that there are not many resources.
So this is going to be an interesting topic.
Just curious: what are the motives for your switch?

Regards,
