Subject: Re: suspicion of rootkit

The machine is Windows XP SP3 quite up-to-date, but not fully. Except that Windows Update is not working anymore.
One of the symptoms. 

I described the issues there:

You will see why some symptoms make me think about a rootkit.

You are right, it could be some Windows being messed up.
But it actually happened on a pretty fresh install: I finished setting XP and tens of analysis tools (I aimed this box to be my fresh reversing system).
So even if possible, it sounds strange that a machine gets corrupted so quickly. And of course, I suspect some of these tools, got from multiple downloads.
At last, I could analyse them one by one of course, but there are many so it would be painful (and I am not sure that I kept all setups).
