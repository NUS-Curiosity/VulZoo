Negative. Go back to is original message I post:

So according to is your logic:

MusntLive discover pedo, report pedo, authorities lallygag, MusntLive
publicize pedo info, MusntLive is evil.
MusntLive discover is Lockheed has glitch on plane cause pilot to
crash, MusntLive publish information so to for pilots can know,
MusntLive is evil for exposure.
MusntLive discover is flaw in mechanism that shut down power grid,
rush to warn people via full disclosure, MusntLive is evil.

Gary is say I am evil to follow is my logic. Logic for disclosing pedos?


Gary: Psych 101: Evil people have no shame.

Me: And is you say my logic is wrong.

Gary: Yup.
