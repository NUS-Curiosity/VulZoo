Dear Paul,
You completely missed my point. I was talking about the foundation of this list, which is free service, and the foundation of a lot of current IT technologies, which is freeware. Giving knowledge for free (including software bugs) is the foundation of this civilization. Having profit is a necessity but not all what drives us. Could you personally show any your contribution to the society? Which was not paid for?
My contribution you can find searching/google for my name and "article", and DeepSec 2011 and OWASP AppSec DC 2012 presentations as well. Nobody paid me for. Plus, you can check our portal www.201cmr1700ma.com, which provides knowledge and security documents for free. Then, considering you association with math science, you can possibly estimate the time I've spent for free.
So, my voice pro free knowledge distribution is completely legitimate.

Sincerely

Mikhail utin, CISSP, PhD

You cannot possibly agree with someone who addresses two people in the singular. You should not agree with someone who ascribes behaviourial patterns to others, based on his own character traits.

Are you familiar with Georgi's work? Please look at his website before proffering opinions.

Cheers, Paul
