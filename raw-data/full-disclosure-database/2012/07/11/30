Summary
=======

Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch contains the following vulnerabilities:

 Cisco TelePresence Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability
 Cisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Exploitation of the Cisco TelePresence Malformed IP Packets Denial of
Service Vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
create a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the product to
become unresponsive to new connection requests and potentially leading
to termination services and processes.

Exploitation of the Cisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that mitigate these
vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:
