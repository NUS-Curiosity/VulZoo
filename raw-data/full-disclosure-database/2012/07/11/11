Has problem, yes. Has problem with discussing fu** disclosure, no.
Problem has to be with Thor arrogant, yes.
Thor has long proud messages like dogmas. Has a few fanatic fellows but stupid just.
Who has been Thor to tell others what has good or bad. Who has been Thor to tell other what think, what they has done is good or bad.
Has given lesson but has take it: has a look at u in mirror then at ur shit then has a think again.

Sure, no problem.  Heaven forbid we talk about something like full disclosure on the, um, "Full Disclosure" list.   What was I thinking?  Thanks for coming out hiding as per your "official letter" to FD telling us you were leaving just to set me straight.
