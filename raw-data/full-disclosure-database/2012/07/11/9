-------------------------
Instagram is a free photo sharing program launched in October 2010 
that allows users to take a photo, apply a digital filter to it, and
then share it on a variety of social networking services, including 
Instagram's own. A distinctive feature confines photos to a square 
shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images, in contrast 
to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras.

Instagram was initially supported on iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch; 
in April 2012, the company added support for Android camera phones 
running 2.2 (Froyo) or higher. It is distributed via the iTunes App 
Store and Google Play.
