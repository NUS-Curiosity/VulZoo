Subject: NESSUS ANDROID APP - stores login info in plain
	text

Nessus app for android
version 1.0.1

app allows user to save nessus server info
IP/username/password.

app saves this info to
/sdcard/servers.id

this file can be viewed with notepad and password is right there in 
plain text.  this means any app on the system can see that info and 
possibly transmit it to an attacker.
