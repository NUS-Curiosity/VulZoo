My disclosure concerns as a user are twofold. When it comes to serious and 
readily exploitable vulnerabilities, I want to be informed in the minimum 
period of time that allows the vendor to investigate and acknowledge, and 
either repair immediately, or give a definite, short-term timetable for 
doing so, in order to allow me to implement my own safeguards, if 
necessary (which seems to be what has been addressed in this thread up 
until now) To me, 30 days should be at least adequate in such cases. I 
also want to keep track of historical responses by vendors to bugs of all 
kinds so that I can identify those vendors who have terribly inadequate 
development cycles, standards, and practices. Those vendors I want to 
completely avoid in the future to the extent possible.
