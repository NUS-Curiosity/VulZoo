i agree that Thor is writing pure corporate crap.

note that he is contradicting himself: in another thread he
wrote basically "people do stuff for money and getting laid".

in this thread he is using the buzzwords "self promotion"/
"ego-substantiation" which don't appear to fit the above model
of motivation and are certainly wrong for most members of FD.

probably in the next thread he will use the buzzword "irresponsible".

i suppose in his glass house world he expects hackers to give the
0days to vendors and keep silent, busting vendors profits for free
so they don't accused of the ego related irresponsible crimes.

f*ck it, i expect the final usa crisis to partially fix the model.
