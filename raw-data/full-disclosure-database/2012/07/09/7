Court cases? *Really*?  When was the last time you saw a court case about
defective COTS software?  You see the occasional squabble regarding bespoke
one-off developments, but your average shrink-wrapped EULA does a pretty good
job of absolving the vendor from all blame, no matter how egregious the error.
Oftentimes, they even manage to waive responsibility for the common-law
concepts of "merchantability" or "fitness for intended use".

That's OK.  Those of us who do this for a living are *also* often hard-pressed
to find any notable difference between "state of the art" and "piece of crap",
as they're about as close as the two level of a hyperfine transition of a cesium
atom.
