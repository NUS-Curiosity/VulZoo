Subject: Re: How much time is appropriate for fixing a bug?

I must not have articulated my point properly as it looks like we are both
saying the same thing.

What I was trying to convey was that if a person was actually concerned
about the "industry" as opposed to self-promotion and ego-substantiation,
then they would just notify the vendors and then get on with their lives
irrespective of the vendors' ultimate remedy.  As you say, there are any
number of reasons why a vendor will or won't fix a bug, and/or when they
will or won't fix it.  The "researcher" will never know the requirements
or considerations.  In that respect, you have to "trust" the vendor -
again, *IF* you are not concerned with self promotion.

When a vendor fixes a bug, why do people then post details on their find
once it is patched?  For recognition.  I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with it - I've done it myself, purely for the reason of getting some
acknowledgment.  I was just commenting on the "honesty" of Joro's "fuck
'em" comment.  

I think any more on the subject will just result in another flare-up of FD
vs RD vs FO vs GGF, so I'll probably not spend too much more time on the
thread - but please feel free to add whatever you may think I've missed≈†.
