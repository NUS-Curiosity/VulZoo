OUCH!?
The "industry" will (typically) not fix any error if the cost for fixing
exceeds the loss (or revenue) that this fix creates, including the vendors
gain/loss of reputation, gain/loss of stock value, loss of money in court
cases or due to compensations, loss of (future) sales due to (dis-)satisfied
customers, ...

Joe Average can't tell the difference between a program which is designed,
developed, built and maintained according to the state of the art, and some
piece of crap that is not. He but only sees the (nice or promising) GUI of
the product and it's price tag.
