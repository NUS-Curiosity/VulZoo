Package        : pidgin
Vulnerability  : remote code execution
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3374
Debian Bug     : #680661

Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar found a buffer overflow in Pidgin, a multi protocol instant
messaging client. The vulnerability can be exploited by an incoming 
message in the MXit protocol plugin. A remote attacker may cause a crash,
and in some circumstances can lead to remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-1+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.4-1.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.
