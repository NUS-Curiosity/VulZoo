No, we still disagree.

CVE can be shut down?

If bugs and vulnerabilities were not published there is
a) no (or little) incentive for the "industry" to fix them
b) no long term record to measure the "quality" of their products.

As long as they don't fix known vulnerabilities and bugs their products
are defective, and consumers can ask for a fix, a compensation or return
the defective products and get their money back.

There is no need to know the "industries" requirements or considerations.
As long as they continue to ship products which have not been built
according to the state of the art there is a need to push the "industry"
but to do so. Software engineering was coined almost 45 years ago!

> In that respect, you have to "trust" the vendor -

Cf. Ken Thompsons "reflections on trusting trust".
As long as nobody except the vendor knows their own design, test and
build process there is no way of building trust ... except by judging
the "quality" of their products and their response to vulnerability and
bug reports.

> again, *IF* you are not concerned with self promotion.

I'm but concerned about the lack of due diligence some vendors exercise
when they build their products.

Yes, bugs happen, and bugs get fixed. But some vendors make the same
mistakes over and over again. Which can only lead to the following
conclusions:
a) they dont have control or oversight over their developers and their
   build processes.
b) they dont care.

Yes, for recognition of vulnerabilities and bugs, and for transparency,
and for the sake of the "market"!
Not all vendors publish their change logs and name the fixed vulnerabilities
and bugs.

Compare it to "food watch" or other activities to inform customers about
the "quality" of "industry" products!
Or just to create "public opinion".
