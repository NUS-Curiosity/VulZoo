Hello,

  I feel compelled to point out that disclosing a bug *is*
contributing.  It requires a lot of time and effort to find a bug,
which is a contribution to the target software, even if only seen as
free quality assurance work.  Disclosure is undeniably inconvenient
for vendors, but it is demonstrably one of the surest ways to ensure a
fix is developed.  Security researchers arguably have as much
responsibility to end users as to vendors.  If a researcher finds a
bug, unless they believe they are the best person in the world at what
they do, they must conclude black hats have access to the bug.
Disclosing the bug is the lowest resistance way for a researcher to
concurrently inform the user base and provide impetus for the vendor
to fix the issue.  The proposition that disclosure is purely selfish
ego stroking ignores the viewpoint that disclosure is a moral
obligation, which is just as valid.  Maslow's hierarchy of needs
clearly illustrates that not everyone is motivated by getting paid or
getting laid.
