First thing: You can NOT surely determine if a machine is compromised
within the machine itself. Once a machine is compromised it can
(theoretical) react to all your approach to detect it and manipulate
the output of your tools.

If there is something compromised there is a high chance that it has to
communicate to somebody. So you could dump the network traffic on your
router or add an (transparent) networklogger between your machine and
the router.

Another way would be shutting down the machine an analyzing it with an
live-cd. But there is not a general way to go sure, its compromised or
not.
