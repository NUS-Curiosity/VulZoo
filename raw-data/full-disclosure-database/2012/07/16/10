Subject: Linux - Indicators of compromise

Greetings FD,

Does anyone have any guidelines/useful material on analysis logs of a Linux machine to detect signs of compromise? The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts. I'm wondering if there is any systematic approach to analyze the collected logs? Most of the materials I've seen are more aligned to malware and rootkit detection which is not the only concern apparently.

Thanks,
Ali
