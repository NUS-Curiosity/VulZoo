Hello everybody and thank you for your useful comments.

Now I'm thinking that we need a comparison base or normal behavior profile to be able to detect any deviations or abnormal/suspicious activity. While some known patterns of behaviors are useful to detect malware or backdoors we still need that normal profile to detect 0-day or APT style intrusions. Isn't that the same idea from early days of intrusion detection research (anomaly detection approach)? Or maybe I'm off track.

Thoughts?

Greetings FD,

Does anyone have any guidelines/useful material on analysis logs of a Linux machine to detect signs of compromise? The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts. I'm wondering if there is any systematic approach to analyze the collected logs? Most of the materials I've seen are more aligned to malware and rootkit detection which is not the only concern apparently.

Thanks,

Ali
