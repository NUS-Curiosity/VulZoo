Hi Ali,

I'd say send log to another machine, use a "checksumator" (like
tripwire), store its computation files on an external storage 
device and when you check the system with it, boot it on a liveCD.

And as G.Baribault says, each compromised system tries to store its
findings elsewhere on the Internet (often encrypted these days), so
a fine traffic analyzer would be a good thing; but is there a very
good one working out of the box, I don't know!? (beware it can be
very disk space greedy).
