The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts.

root folder called /root/MilaKunisLeakedPhotos/ and
/root/OlgaKurlyenko/ is when I see is accessed. Then I know is my
machine compromised. Everyone is want see Olga and Mila
