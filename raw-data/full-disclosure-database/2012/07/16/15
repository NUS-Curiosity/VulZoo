many but not most.

also, goats are exceptional sources of inspiration on side channel
attacks and insider threats. more on this later.. ;)

[i'd like to see a survey of info-sec specialists[0] turned ag
entrepreneurs. or sechors[0] as jya calls them...]

this is true. they are better.

many criminals are also better!

as evidenced by novel MD5 collision attacks leveraged for windows
update MitM (aka, "holy grail") and expansive A/V countermeasures via,
again novel, code injection methods.

they also do extensive QA to ensure success against their targets,
spanning whatever platform and processes. QA is expensive, and
methodical QA on malware; this makes me chortle!

this is intended to preserve return on investment. maybe one
difference, but not the most significant.

they won't and they don't need to. conventional malware targets the
masses, and they're vulnerable without much effort.

military malware targets the specific, and they'll do whatever they
can (which is significant) to achieve success.

entirely different domains!

this is succinct and apropos. commercial A/V is not going to protect
against state sponsored attacks (of which world class malware is a
part).

such protection requires ..., well, far more than kaspersky can ever give you :P
