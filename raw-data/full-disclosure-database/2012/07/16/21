Subject: Unpatched IIS Vulnerabilities / Microsoft July
	Security Bulletin

Hi Lists,

it seems Microsoft doesn't want to patch the vulnerabilities I posted
back in June,
at least not in the July update.

The posting included some important bugs in the Internet Information
Services, one of their
flagship products:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Jun/189

The July Security Bulletin doesn't mention any bug.
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-jul

I wonder if Microsoft will silently patch the vulnerabilities or just
bluntly ignore them.
I understand that Microsoft doesn't want to make a big deal about the
impact and exposure like in the past,
yet I believe that admins should be informed about the threats by
their very side.
You have to remember that I put much effort into finding these
vulnerabilities and you get them for free.
With resolving the bugs Microsoft proves that they care about security
even if these vulnerabilties
where disclosed uncoordinated yet free to patch.
