OK, this is the last one before the big one!

Whether you're coming to Vegas or not, you need to be here for this:

Title: "Hacking iOS Applications"

Synopsis: "iOS applications are leet and cool. Let's have some fun with
them!"

Pentester Bio: Zsombor Kovacs, "Zsombor is a security geek interested in
hacking iOS applications, working for an early adopter of enterprise
iPad applications."

Heh. Maybe he can help me unfsck my iphone... Speaking of which, what do 
you do when you get the dreaded 'error -1' when updating to the latest 
ios (5.1.1) and the apple support nazis say 'you must have tried to hack 
it, tough luck!'? No, really, I didn't try to hack it. Honest. No, 
honest, really. Look, I *know* who I am, but, honest, honest, honest, 
guvner, pretty please I didn't. Your stoopid update broicked it! Dammit!

Anyways, moving on....

Venue is here:
