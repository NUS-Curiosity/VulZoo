Introduction:
=============
LEPTON is an easy-to-use but full customizable Content Management System (CMS). LEPTON enables you to run nearly all 
the websites most others current CMS promise you but has the big advantage of extremely short learning and training 
curves, and this is a great argument to those who work with LEPTON. LEPTON needs a MySQL database, the most common 
database on webspaces. LEPTON is easily installed and started, and - what is really important - can easily be adapted 
to fit the needs of nearly all web appearences. Besides many other features LEPTON got  ...

    easy to use backend
    content input via wysiwyg-editors
    multi-language-support
    file and media management
    design via template system
    addons to extend cms
    scaling access system
    and much more...

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the Lepton v1.2.0 Content Management System.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-23:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in iScripts Reserve Logic v1.2 Booking Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent 
vulnerabilities are located in the modify groups, add user, listing, Profile & add page module(s) with the bound vulnerable parameters 
Groupname, Username, Display Name & list_page_title. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. 


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Modify Groups - Group
				[+] Access - Add User
				[+] Preferences - My Settings - Profile
				[+] Add Page

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Group Name
				[+] Username
				[+] Display Name
				[+] list_page_title & url (modify_link)


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with privileged user account or without user account.
To exploit the vulnerability low or medium user inter action is required. For demonstration or reproduce ...
