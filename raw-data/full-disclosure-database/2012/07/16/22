Thanks Feighen.

I had to say that I'm looking for solutions/guidelines that help in doing the analysis in a short period of time or a narrow shot of the system state.

Any thoughts?

Hey

there are programs that can help to analyse log files. Logwatch comes to mind. There are possibly others. I suppose you could write a script to check file permissions and ownership changes over time, which could be a starting point for more in-depth checks


Thanks and kind regards

Greetings FD,

Does anyone have any guidelines/useful material on analysis logs of a Linux machine to detect signs of compromise? The data collection piece is not a challenge as a lot of useful information can be captured using commands and some scripts. I'm wondering if there is any systematic approach to analyze the collected logs? Most of the materials I've seen are more aligned to malware and rootkit detection which is not the only concern apparently.

Thanks,
Ali
