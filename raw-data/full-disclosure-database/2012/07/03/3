Subject: Re: "Please remove my e-mail and IP from internet"

Not to mention as others pointed out it is implied that the guy might've
let out information he didn't have permission to let out, which could get
him into some serious trouble. Also I could be wrong since I don't remember
the full thing but did the guy said they were doing a pentest soon? No need
to report the guy when any remotely competent pentest team is gunna find
this and probably start laughing :)
