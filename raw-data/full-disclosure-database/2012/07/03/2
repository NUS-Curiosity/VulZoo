I fwd'd details to lester haines of vulture central fame but doubt he will
see it a a story.

This outsourced orange sysadmin really needs the striesand effect to hit him
and orange - hard!

Has anyone contacted any of the email addresses in the logs pointing out the
disclosure. I suspect kia as a company may not be too happy that a SAP reports
email address has been disclosed. Far easier to soclially engineer something
when you have even this minor sort of info.
