Triple redundancy? Is many company not even have single redundancy.
You read too much sci-fi is please stop spread false information on
list. List is filled with too many is noobs look to learn, not hear
nonsense.

Amazon, Twitter, Citibank, BofA and is many others all went down is
this past week. All is companies has more money than God and is has
competent CERTIFIED staff. Yet is they could not even is keep site up.
Maybe is since you can, you can become CTO of is any one of these
companies yes.

Is better for banking transactions not to be made? Is this same for
NASDAQ as this is transaction. No is better for business to CONTINUE -
this is the C in BC (Business *CONTINUITY*). Transactions is can be
audited on the fly.

Doctor make wrong call? Speak and Spell. Is no one say anything about
Doctor. Doctor would be too late. Go back and read is what was
written. "if the patient alert system is affected" If patient cannot
call Doctor or Nurse because help button is tampered with: Goodbye you
are the weakest link"

Exploding or melting down? Maybe perhaps is you watch too many time
Die Hard. In is real environment, turbines and is other HMIs can be
addressed by is taking *only* is that turbine and
baselining-shifting-outsourcing-outpulsing power to other turbines
*without* taking out the mid-west. Perhaps you is go back to work in
real environment then come and try and is to test MusntLive. Is your
comment show many much immaturity. Is MusntLive now pray your bosses
not see these posts.

Really? Is not better to send them to another *open* runaway versus is
