Subject: Security Problem with Googleâ€™s 2-Step Authentication

Hi Folks,

I'd like to share with you one of my findings that failed to get
Google's Security Reward. Although Google doesn't consider it a
security problem, some might find it at least amusing if not
interesting.

Check it out: http://ximen.es/?p=653

Sorry for typos, cross posting, and lack of accuracy.

Regards,

Pablo Ximenes
