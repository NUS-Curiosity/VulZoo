There are no significant bugs in our released software that any
significant number of users want fixed. â€¦ I'm saying we don't do a new
version to fix bugs. We don't. Not enough people would buy it. You can
take a hundred people using Microsoft Word. Call them up and say "Would
you buy a new version because of bugs?" You won't get a single person to
say they'd buy a new version because of bugs. We'd never be able to sell
a release on that basis.
