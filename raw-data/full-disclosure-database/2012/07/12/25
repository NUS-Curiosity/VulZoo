- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Performance Agent. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the coda.exe process which listens on a
random TCP port by default. The process trusts a value within a GET request
as a size. It then proceeds to copy that many bytes of user-supplied data
into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. Remote unauthenticated attackers
can exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed message packets to the
target, which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the
context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
