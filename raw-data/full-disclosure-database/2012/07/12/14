 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2012:104
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openjpeg
 Date    : July 12, 2012
 Affected: 2011.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in openjpeg:
 
 OpenJPEG allocated insufficient memory when encoding JPEG 2000 files
 from input images that have certain color depths. A remote attacker
 could provide a specially-crafted image file that, when opened in an
 application linked against OpenJPEG (such as image_to_j2k), would cause
 the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the user running the application (CVE-2009-5030).
 
 An input validation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow,
 was found in the way OpenJPEG handled the tile number and size in an
 image tile header. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
 image file that, when decoded using an application linked against
 OpenJPEG, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
 application (CVE-2012-3358).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
