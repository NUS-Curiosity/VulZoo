Subject: Re: Preferred OSX Security/Server Lists

Yep, saw those.  There's some good material there, but it is dated and I
was hoping for more of a "discussion" environment like we have on the list
(when we actually discuss security here).  I'm just a bit surprised as
most of the "hacks" all run Mac.  But I guess they don't run it in a
production environment and serve up public services.

That said, look at the Focus-MS listŠ  With constant barrage of MSFT
configuration questions and security requirements, there's not been a
single post there in years it seemsŠ
