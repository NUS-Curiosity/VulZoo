Yes, maybe WinDbg… Not that I am confortable with WinDBG, but certainly a good chance to learn and get more familiar.

However:

- Volatility: anything has to sit somehow in the memory, so there is no way for it to escape from the analysis. It has all advantages of offline analysis. I don't think Volatility is script kiddy stuff. I think it is a great tool and should be enough for my concern.

- WinDBG: here we are doing live analysis, with all the difficulties it implies. It is long and painful. You have to read damn a lot of assembly, thousands of calls, decide to step into or step over, when and based on what assumptions, etc.
Of course, perfect knowledge of the system internals is required. Difficulty will be raised if ever there are some anti-debugging protections. Respect to the people who can do it, they are artists, but is it really the most reasonable way to go?
