0x00: MusntLive will always help you. .effmach x86 (or is whatever is
your machine amd64, ia64) is your first friend. When you is run this,
you come back and let MusntLive know. For then we must use !dml_proc
and only is real hacker debug stuff. No script kid stuff. Only for
when you is know WinDBG like is back of your hand is you Windows
hacker. Not is Immunity or is Olly, this is these are for is how you
say rookie. Now you is go dump with is effmach. Then is we can study
this is yes with HB Gary memory tools. Because is HB Gary, if we know
is find it, HB Gary is will find with is their backdoor into is their
tools. We not worry, we find evil 1337 together.
