0x00: MusntLive is give you now priceless advice for you must to listen:

1) WinDBG is to dump your memory
2) Is HB Gary FD Pro is used not volatility. This is because since
Greg is backdoored all his tools, is we don't find problems, then when
is HB Gary snooping in our session maybe they can find is problem for
us.
3) Volatility is script kid tool (don't is tell anyone who is use this)
4) Step over is step into. MusntLive give you good analogy right now.
Is you have choice, step into POOP or is step over POOP is what is
your choice? Step over is what is hoped. Forget this is step over,
into, above, sideways. Foolproof is method is to diff memory. Before
and is after yes. This is key to anomalies: Before and is after
