Subject: The right to read,
	debuggers and building future Fedora kernels

I know this is old.

In The Right to Read RMS writes "In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger." [1]

Helped by m$, Fedora are actively working this to become true [2] [3]

Q: What if I want to build a custom kernel or load 3rd party kernel modules?
A: You will need to disable Secure boot, or setup your own keys and sign everything with them. 

Q: what about ARM?
A: On ARM Microsoft Windows 8 ready requirements say that Secure boot should be enabled by default and cannot be disabled. Fedora has no plans to support secure boot on that platform and suggests buying Non Windows 8 ready hardware.

Q: Whats this about a $99 fee?
A: There is a one time fee of $99 to access the Microsoft sysdev portal in order to get your binaries signed by the Microsoft key (shipped by default in all Windows 8 ready devices). 

[4] That could lead to a lot of key churn, especially if, as Alan Cox suggests, every kernel hole will require that its certificate be revoked.
