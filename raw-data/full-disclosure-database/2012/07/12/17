 Issue 15 suspicion of rootkit (Alexandru Balan)

A better way of proceeding on this, assuming you can afford the time,
is to boot from of the many live boot CDs (UBCD4Win, BartPe, various
Linux-based rescue disks) to scan the disk while the suspect OS is not
in memory. Those CD images either come with, or can be caused to
contain, various AV packages. Make sure the packages used are current,
and scan away.
