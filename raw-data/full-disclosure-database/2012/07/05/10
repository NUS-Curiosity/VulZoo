         CVE Name       TBD                                                   

    Description  If Asterisk sends a re-invite and an endpoint responds to    
                 the re-invite with a provisional response but never sends a  
                 final response, then the SIP dialog structure is never       
                 freed and the RTP ports for the call are never released. If  
                 an attacker has the ability to place a call, they could      
                 create a denial of service by using all available RTP        
                 ports.                                                       

    Resolution  A re-invite that receives a provisional response without a    
                final response is detected and properly cleaned up at         
                hangup.
