Subject: How much time is appropriate for fixing a bug?

After having reported a security-relevant bug about a smartphone, how long would
you wait for the vendor to fix it? What are typical times?

I remember telling someone about a security-relevant bug in his library some time
ago - he fixed it and published the fixed version within ten minutes. On the
other hand, I often see mails on bugtraq or so in which the given dates show that
the vendor took maybe a year or so to fix the issue...
