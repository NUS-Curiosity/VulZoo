Introduction
------------

 Breakpoint is a new security conference to be held on the 17th and 18th of
 October, in Melbourne Australia. The event will show case the work of expert
 security researchers from around the world on a wide range of topics.
 Breakpoint is organised by the Ruxcon conference team and will offer a
 specialised and more professional security conference to complement and lead
 into the larger and more casual Ruxcon weekend conference. Breakpoint will
 cater towards security researchers and industry professionals alike, with a
 focus on cutting edge security research.

 With just one day separating both conferences, Breakpoint presents a great
 opportunity for our selected speakers to receive a complimentary trip to
 Australia and experience both the Breakpoint and Ruxcon conferences, not to
 mention the great weather, awesome parties, and friendly people.

 Melbourne is Australia's cultural capital, with Victorian-era architecture,
 extensive shopping, museums, galleries, theatres, and large parks and gardens.
 It is a city of many subcultures, personalities and styles, and it is these
 layers that make it so interesting. Melbourne has a vibrant arts and music
 scene, eccentric cafes, cobbled lane-ways, quirky shops, intimate bars and
 restaurants, and is known as one of the world's great streetart capitals.
