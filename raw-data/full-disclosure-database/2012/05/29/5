I think this quote sums it up well:

"Hacking is ... not a day job or a semi-ordered list of instructions found
in a thick book." - Anthony Bunyan (Shellcoder's Handbook)

Predetermining an attack path or even representing every possible way an
entity can be attacks is just not possible. There are potentially an
infinite number of permutations one could take to compromise a system.
Formalising such a thing would not accurately represent the real world; it
would merely display a subset of possible attack vectors.

This is a good example of where someone has made something from nothing
(and would have been very difficult to have predicted/formalised):
