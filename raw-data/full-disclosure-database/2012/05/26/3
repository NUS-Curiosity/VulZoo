this concept is more useful in fully automated exploit +
post-exploitation systems, where you have an arsenal of exploits of
varying stealth, reliability, applicability. the result of exploit
preference, exploit chaining, and contingency paths based on real-time
feedback results in a tree like structure following the path of least
resistance to total compromise.

you need to prepare this tree ahead of time as a human in the loop
will only slow down the process and increase the risk of counter
measures frustrating further attack.

a pedant would call them exploit graphs ;)
