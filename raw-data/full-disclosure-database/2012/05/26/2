Subject: Re: Info about attack trees

If you havnt guessed from the replies, there are no such thing as an attack
tree. Sure things maybe methodical, but I don't think of things as being
like a tree.

The classical method is something along the lines of preform recon,
enumerate, attack, presist/extract data. You react based upon the
information you gather, the more information you have, the clearer it is on
to what the next step ought to be.

No offense, but I don't think it'd be a good idea to make a master thesis
about the textbook methodology of a field you are not familiar with,
especially since you seem to be diving into it with multiple misconceptions
and assumptions.
