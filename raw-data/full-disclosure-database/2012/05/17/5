Hi Tavis,

Yes this is stock kernels and yes you must believe it is so simple mistake ;)
All systems was installed as VM in default installation using official ISOs.

And of course this is configuration mistake not kernel problem(!) - my mistake
if I wasn't clear in the write-up.

Anyway Suse ISO which I used:

$ md5sum /media/pi3/openSUSE-12.1-DVD-x86_64.iso 
4cfe8229111ef723ae7aa541fd2c87b7  /media/pi3/openSUSE-12.1-DVD-x86_64.iso
$ md5sum /media/pi3/openSUSE-12.1-DVD-i586.iso 
22b4d6bfdb11f5bdd36a05f9968a780c  /media/pi3/openSUSE-12.1-DVD-i586.iso


After reading opensuse kernel developers list I found a problem and gentle fix:

http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2012-03/msg00056.html

so the latest update has this fix but still official ISO has old kernel. Fix was applied
in March/April. So again _sock kernels_ have/had so simple mistake ;)




Best regards,
Adam
