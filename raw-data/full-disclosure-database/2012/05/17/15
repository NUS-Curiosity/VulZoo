You're assuming it's a *mistake* rather than something intentional.

Remember that the distro does *not* know what you run on the kernel, so they
need to build one that covers all the bases.  So they really need to make a
choice.  Which is going to result in more nasty phone calls and e-mails:
leaving COMPAT_VDSO set (which is probably the 12,934th most security crucial
security setting in a distro), or turn it off and *know* this will break
certain older binaries?

Remember that if you're a distro with a million users, even if only 0.1% of
them still have old binaries, you just borked 1,000 user's machines.  Now
compare that number to the number that will get hacked if you leave COMPAT_VDSO
on (remember that the *only* thing it stops is exploits that hard-code certain
addresses)
