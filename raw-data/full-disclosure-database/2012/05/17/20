Exactly - it's all about the old 3rd party binaries.

Each distro has to decide for itself where to draw the line, and apparently
Suse 12.1 drew it differently than others. Keep in mind that Suse is targeting
itself as an "enterprise" distro.  As such, they have to worry a lot more about
shops that run huge ancient creeping-horror software systems that often have
binaries that nobody really understands how to rebuild.

My point was just that it's not necessarily a "mistake" (as you put it) - each
distro has to make lots of these sorts of decisions every release cycle.  Stay
compatible with old stuff, or ship new stuff?  Decide to keep a compatibility
option around for one more release cycle, and you take heat for having old
stuff.  Go the other way, and you end up shipping Unity. :)

I'll bet a large pizza with everything but anchovies that once 12.2 ships,
somebody will find an application that breaks.  But we'll probably never hear
about it, because nobody will want to admit having that creeping horror binary. ;)
