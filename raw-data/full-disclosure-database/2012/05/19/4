Package        : pidgin-otr
Vulnerability  : format string vulnerability
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2369
Debian Bug     : 673154

intrigeri discovered a format string error in pidgin-otr, an off-the-record
messaging plugin for Pidgin.

This could be exploited by a remote attacker to cause arbitrary code to
be executed on the user's machine.

The problem is only in pidgin-otr. Other applications which use libotr are
not affected.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.0-5+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin-otr packages.
