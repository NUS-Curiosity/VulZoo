	Apache Ant denial of service vulnerability

CVE-2012-2098: Apache Commons Compress and Apache Ant denial of service
               vulnerability

Severity: Low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Commons Compress 1.0 to 1.4
Apache Ant 1.5 to 1.8.3

Description:
The bzip2 compressing streams in Apache Commons Compress and Apache Ant
internally use sorting algorithms with unacceptable worst-case
performance on very repetitive inputs.  A specially crafted input to
Compress' BZip2CompressorOutputStream or Ant's <bzip2> task can be used
to make the process spend a very long time while using up all available
processing time effectively leading to a denial of service.

Mitigation:
Commons Compress users should upgrade to 1.4.1
Ant users should upgrade to 1.8.4

This issue was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response
Team.
