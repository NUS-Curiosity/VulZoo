Hell Juan.  As per the conditions of the contract I forwarded, I am pleased to see that you have given me full permission to assess any systems of yours I feel are within scope.  I'm copying in FD again so they can all be witness to the fact you acting in a manner consistent with the terms of my contract, and that you have given me full permission to do as I wish with any aspect of your network without repercussions.

I'm looking forward to it!  Thank you.


Is your final report going to be public?
