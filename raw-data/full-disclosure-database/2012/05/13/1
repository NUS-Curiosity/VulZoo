Details.
The NETGEAR Wireless Extreme for Mac computer and PCs (WNDRMAC) 
is a N600 wireless dual-band gigabit router. The router 
discloses sensitive information in the page source, if a 
previous password recovery has been successfully completed,
which allows an attacker to login to the device. 

Proof of Concept.
Viewing the source code of the page you are presented with when
you fail to login successfully with the administrator account 
exposes the routers serial number which is required to get to the 
recovery questions section.

        var enter_sn_again="0";
  var last_error_sn="2T82195D0093D";
        if( enable_recovery == "1" )

Viewing the source code of the recovery questions page allows an 
attacker to view the answers to the password recovery questions. 
After submitting these answers you are presented with the current 
administrator credentials.
