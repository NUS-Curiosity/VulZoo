Subject: Context IS Advisory - .NET 1.0 through .NET 4
	Remote Code Execution

===============================ADVISORY===============================
Systems Affected:    .NET 1.0 through .NET 4
Severity:            High
Category:            Remote Code Execution
Author:              Context Information Security
Reported to vendor:  17th March 2011
Advisory Issued:     8th May 2012
Reference:           CVE-2012-0160, CVE-2012-0161 
===============================ADVISORY===============================
 
Description
-----------
The Microsoft .NET framework (in all released versions) is vulnerable to a number of attacks through the misuse of binary serialization which could be leveraged to disclose important information or to achieve remote code execution. 
 
Analysis
--------
The .NET framework has a number of serialization mechanisms a developer can use to load and save object instances either to permanent storage locations or for use in the transport of objects across boundaries. Probably the most important of these is the IFormatter serializers, specifically BinaryFormatter which has existed in one form since the very first version of the framework. 
 
It is common to see this used as a mechanism for data storage, object marshalling and object cloning. This can lead to situations where an attacker can introduce malicious objects into an application either remotely over a network or through a sandboxed environment.
 
Through the use of specific functionality an attacker can then leverage this situation to circumvent security mechanisms and gain remote code execution without user interaction or to disclosure important information.
 
 
Technologies Affected
---------------------
Microsoft .Net Frameworks 1.0 through 4.0
 
Vendor Response
---------------
Microsoft advises users to patch the .Net Framework to the latest version.  See the following Microsoft security bulletin for more details:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-035
 
There are a number of mitigations which reduce the severity of the issues which are also detailed in Microsoft’s bulletin.
