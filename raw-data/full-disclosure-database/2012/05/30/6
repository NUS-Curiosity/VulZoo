	Moderation - Cross	Site Request Forgery

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1608822

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-087
  * Project: Comment Moderation [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-May-30
  * Security risk: Less Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to moderate comments in an accelerated way, by
providing a complete interface and all useful actions in a unique page.
The module doesn't sufficiently protect the publish link URL, thus a Cross
Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack against an administrator could result in
unintended publishing of comments.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Comment Moderation 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Comment
Moderation [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Comment Moderation module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to
    Comment Moderation 6.x-1.1 [4]

Also see the Comment Moderation [5] project page.
