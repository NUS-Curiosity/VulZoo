-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Amadou theme outputs additional first and last classes to the list of

A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Amadou theme's
themes_links() function in the template.php file, which was fixed in the
theme_links() function in Drupal 6.3 as noted in (SA-2008-044

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Amadou 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Amadou [4]
theme, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Amadou theme for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Amadou 6.x-1.3 [5].

If you have created a custom theme with Amadou or are using Amadou as a base
theme, please see below for a manual fix:

The offending code on line 77 in the original template.php file:
$output .= '';

Should be replaced with the following code:
$output .= '
