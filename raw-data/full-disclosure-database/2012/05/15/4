Subject: Re: Google Accounts Security Vulnerability

"From there, I attempted to log-in to my Google account with the same
username and password.

identity."

I didn't verified, but from the report it seems that those additional steps
of verification can be bypassed, if you first log in with the
credentials via IMAP.

I would guess that the successfull login on IMAP adds that new IP address
to the trusted IP list, hence the web login will skip the additional
verification.
