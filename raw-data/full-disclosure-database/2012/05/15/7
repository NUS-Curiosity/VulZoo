Hi,

The verification process bypassed which the OP is talking about is
basically put in place to protect victims of phishing attacks. The phishing
attacker generally may not be in the same location as that of the victim.
Gmail web interface asks questions (mentioned my OP) so that the attacker
wont just get into the account with stolen credentials. Also note that IMAP
and POP3 can be disabled (dont remember if both are disabled by default).
So this bypass presents an interesting approach to attacker in case of IMAP
being enabled.
