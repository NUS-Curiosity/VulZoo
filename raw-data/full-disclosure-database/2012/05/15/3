Subject: Re: Google Accounts Security Vulnerability

I'm not sure I understand the issue here - the requirement for someone "happening to come across your username and password" is a pretext.  

Logging on to the web interface where you can change password and other personal information as well as verify existing site cookies affords the service the ability to check these sorts of things.  But you logged on via IMAP, which is its own service just like POP3 or SMTP.   These services can't check where you are or for the existence of a cookie, so I'm not really sure what your expectation is, or why this is being presented as an issue.   Am I missing something?
