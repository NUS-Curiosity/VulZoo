Introduction:
=============
GENU is a Content Management System written with PHP language and using a database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite) for 
storage. It is fully customisable since it uses a templates system and supports multiple languages.

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in GENU CMS 2012.3 content management system.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-28:	Vendor Fix/Patch by Check
2012-04-30:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A SQL Injection vulnerability  is detected in GENU CMS 2012.3.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s): 
                                                        [+] posts/search.php
                                                        [+] news/search.php
                                                        [+] comments/search.php


Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Word in 'search' must consist of at least two characters

PoC:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/GENU/news/search.php?search=xd&match=`news_subject[SQL-Injection]
http://127.0.0.1:8080/GENU/comments/search.php?search=xd&match=`news_subject[SQL-Injection]
http://127.0.0.1:8080/GENU/posts/search.php?search=xd&match=`news_subject[SQL-Injection]


Solution:
=========
In file: /news/search.php
In line 82:
                     AND LOWER(` . TABLE_NEWS . `.` . $_GET[`match`] . `) LIKE  \\`%` . strtolower($search) . `% `

In file: /comments/search.php
In line 77:
                     AND LOWER(` . TABLE_COMMENTS . `.` . $_GET[`match`] . `) LIKE  `%` . strtolower($search) . `% `

In file: /posts/search.php
In line 78:
                     AND LOWER(` . TABLE_POSTS . `.` . $_GET[`match`] . `) LIKE  `%` . strtolower($search) . `% `
                   
Variable $_GET[`match`] is not filtered.
We must in this line`s edit $_GET[`match`] on $match and add code:

In file: /news/search.php
In line 71

In file: /comments/search.php
In line 69

In file: /posts/search.php
In line 69

e.g code:

if(isset($_GET[`match`]))
{
   if ($_GET[`match`] == `news_subject`) $match = `news_subject`;
   if ($_GET[`match`] == `news_text`) $match = `news_text`;
   else $match = `news_subject`;
}


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as high(+).
