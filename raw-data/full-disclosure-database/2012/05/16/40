Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-081 - Aberdeen -
	Cross Site	Scripting

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1585890

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-081
  * Project: Aberdeen [1] (third-party theme)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-May-16
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

CVE: Requested.
The Aberdeen theme provides a configurable breadcrumb which is commonly used
as an additional navigation tool for users.

The theme outputs the breadcrumb, but does not provide sufficient filtering
to prevent a Cross site scripting (XSS) attack.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the "Append the content
title to the end of the breadcrumb" checkbox is not enabled by default and
needs to be enabled for this to be exploited.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Aberdeen 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.11

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Aberdeen [3]
theme, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Aberdeen theme for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to theme 6.x-1.11
    [4]

If you copied code from the aberdeen_breadcrumb function into a custom
sub-theme's template.php file you should compare your code to the changes to
ensure that menu_get_active_title() is properly wrapped in check plain like:

check_plain(menu_get_active_title());

Also see the Aberdeen [5] project page.
