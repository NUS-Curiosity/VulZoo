I don't know about anyone else, but I use two step verification with
specific application pass phrases that Google so graciously allows you
to do.

With that said... It is the two phase authentication I chose to turn on
due to the fact I have to access my mail through IMAPS.

One thing I think you may be entirely confused with is the "Allow
multiple logins" feature that you can turn off and achieve exactly what
you would expect to happen.


?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
What I don't understand is... You go to your web portal to reset your
password... "you do not know what your password is...!" how on earth
would you login to IMAP, POP whatever...! ?
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

PS: Besides if someone was able to login to your IMAP I sincerely doubt
accessing your mail by the web will be on any one of the objective
lists. They already have your =INBOX... Do use two phase authentication
and do use application specific passwords for accessing your account.
