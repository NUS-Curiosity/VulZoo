Subject: Re: Trigerring Java code from a SVG image

Yeah, there's a bunch of wild stuff in SVG.  The browsers ignore most of
it, AFAIK.  I think Firefox is the only browser to even consider
ForeignObjects (which let you throw HTML back into SVG).

Probably the most interesting SVG thing is how they either do or don't have
script access, depending on whether or not they're loaded as <img>'s.  It
would be problematic indeed if <img src="foo.jpg"> could suddenly render
script!
