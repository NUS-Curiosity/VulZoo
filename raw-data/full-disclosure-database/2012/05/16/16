You must be using CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO, it's rarely used unless you need
compatibility with an ancient libc that was released during the narrow
window where the vdso was mapped at a static location.

Any libc released since ~2006 would never need it, and will determine the
vdso location at runtime from auxv.

If any distribution ships a kernel with this option enabled, then you've
found a real issue that needs to be fixed. Did you configure it yourself, or
are you using a stock kernel?
