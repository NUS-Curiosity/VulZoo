Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-082 - Zen - Cross
	Site Scripting

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1585960

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-082
  * Project: Zen [1] (third-party theme)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-May-16
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

CVE: Requested.
The Zen theme provides a configurable breadcrumb which is commonly used as an
additional navigation tool for users.

The theme outputs the breadcrumb, but does not provide sufficient filtering
to prevent a Cross site scripting (XSS) attack.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the "Append the content
title to the end of the breadcrumb" checkbox is not enabled by default and
needs to be enabled for this to be exploited.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Zen 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.1

Drupal core is not affected. Zen versions 6.x-2.x are not affected. If you do
not use the contributed Zen [3] theme, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Zen theme for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to theme 6.x-1.1 [4] or
    any later version.

If you copied code from the zen_breadcrumb function into a custom sub-theme's
template.php file you should compare your code to the changes to ensure that
menu_get_active_title() is properly wrapped in check plain like:

check_plain(menu_get_active_title());

Also see the Zen [5] project page.
