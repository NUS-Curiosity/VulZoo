TL;DR

CFP for the 5th annual SEC-T conference in Stockholm, Sweden is open!
This year the conference is held on the 13th and 14th of September.

Don't forget to try your hand at the challenge, this year harder than
ever and produced in cooperation with the one and only Fairlight crew.
Winner gets a free ticket to the conference and infinite glory!!!11

The SEC-T conference is an information security conference strongly
rooted in the technical realm. Talks on technical subjects with no
applicability to information security are admissible as long as they
are cool! Some topics we find interesting are:

- Interesting or new vulnerability research
- Novel defensive technology or architecture
- Neat hardware hacks and funny broken products
- Analysis of protocols and/or wireless modes

Talks are in English and either 20 or 60 minutes long (please indicate
length in your submission), we will allow additional time for audience
questions if needed. Talks that actively engage the audience to
participate are preferred. Every submission will be considered and we
will judge each proposal by its content and not the name attached.
Proposals should include a description of the talk contents and what
attendees will learn from it. Send all submissions to cfp@...-t.org.
We will pay travel expenses and arrange accommodation for all speakers.

Thanks for reading,

The SEC-T organizing comittee.
