x86_64 is a bit different.

openSUSE 12.1 x86 (32bit) still uses COMPAT_VDSO, as it was never really clear
what kind of applications would break if disabled.

The next openSUSE, openSUSE 12.2, will have the 32bit VDSO randomized.

Also, randomize_va_space will be 2 (heap randomization too for PIE binaries).

Ciao, Marcus
