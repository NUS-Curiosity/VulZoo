Agreed. Uploading a SVG chameleon (SVG file triggering a XSLT
transformation) to a website allows to display nearly arbitrary content
if the file is called directly. This is similar to the WXR upload
feature abused by the MSVR team in order to XSS the Wordpress.com
website (as presented at 27C3).

Mario's research have shown some weird behavior in Opera. There's an
online demo of SVG files loaded via <img> and starting some plugins
(Java / Flash / PDF): http://heideri.ch/opera/ And there's even a trick
involving "favicon.ico" !
