I don't believe any distribution stock kernel enabled it, because this is
just too simple to get wrong. But if they have, we need to find out who
enabled it so you can file bugs in the appropriate place.

This is why I keep asking you if these are stock kernels or not. If your
administrator enabled it, then this is just user error.

So...are these stock kernels?

If you're not sure, you can do something like:

$ rpm -qf /boot/vmlinuz* # So we can see which package owns them
$ cat /proc/version      # So we can see which image you're booting
$ rpm -qi kernel         # So we can see who signed it

And also the contents of /proc/cmdline and /proc/version (in case your
administrator set vdso=2 on the commandline).

And whatever the equivalents are for the other distributions.

But whatever the results, if you can only reproduce this on kernels with
COMPAT_COMPAT_VDSO, then this is a distribution bug and not a generic Linux
problem (it's just doing what you asked it to do!).

Tavis.
