In order to demonstrate this point _and_ the weird Opera behavior, I put
online a SVG chameleon and a HTML file calling it via <img>:

http://www.agarri.fr/docs/svg2html.html

If the chameleon is called directly, Opera, Firefox and Webkit (IE
untested) execute the HTML Javascript code located in the output
document. Look at the DOM, there's no more reference to the source SVG
file anymore.

If the chameleon is called via <img>, only Opera renders the HTML output
(without executing the Javascript). I didn't test if the inter-documents
behavior is similar to the (i)frames one ... Screen-shot:

<shameless advertising>I'll demonstrate some additional XML/XSLT/SVG/...
tricks at Hack in the Box Amsterdam next week</shameless advertising>
