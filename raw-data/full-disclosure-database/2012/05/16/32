View online: http://drupal.org/node/1585544

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-077
  * Project: Advertisement [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-May-16
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Information Disclosure, Multiple
    vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

CVE: Requested.
This module enables you to serve advertisements, define pools of ads and show
certain ads on certain pages.
The module could, under certain conditions, expose limited site configuration
information and a debugging mode did not sufficiently sanitize input,
allowing for potential cross-site scripting (XSS).
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that exposed data must have been
explicitly set in the $conf variable in settings.php.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Advertisement 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Advertisement
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Advertisement module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to
    Advertisement 6.x-2.3 [4]

Also see the Advertisement [5] project page.
