Package        : gridengine
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0208

Dave Love discovered that users who are allowed to submit jobs to a
Grid Engine installation can escalate their privileges to root because
the environment is not properly sanitized before creating processes.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2u5-1squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2u5-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your gridengine packages.
