	multiple	vulnerabilities

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1557938

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2012-002
  * Project: Drupal core [1]
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-May-2
  * Security risk: Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Denial of Service, Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

.... Denial of Service

CVE: CVE-2012-1588
Drupal core's text filtering system provides several features including
removing inappropriate HTML tags and automatically linking content that
appears to be a link. A pattern in Drupal's text matching was found to be
inefficient with certain specially crafted strings. This vulnerability is
mitigated by the fact that users must have the ability to post content sent
to the filter system such as a role with the "post comments" or "Forum topic:
Create new content" permission.

.... Unvalidated form redirect

CVE: CVE-2012-1589
Drupal core's Form API allows users to set a destination, but failed to
validate that the URL was internal to the site. This weakness could be abused
to redirect the login from to a remote site with a malicious script that
harvests the login credentials and redirects to the live site. This
vulnerability is mitigated only by the end user's ability to recognize a URL
with malicious query parameters to avoid the social engineering required to
exploit the problem.

.... Access bypass - forum listing

CVE: CVE-2012-1590
Drupal core's forum lists fail to check user access to nodes when displaying
them in the forum overview page. If an unpublished node was the most recently
updated in a forum then users who should not have access to unpublished forum
posts were still be able to see meta-data about the forum post such as the
post title.

.... Access bypass - private images

CVE: CVE-2012-1591
Drupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images, and
Image Styles which create derivative images from an original image that may
differ, for example, in size or saturation. Drupal core failed to properly
terminate the page request for cached image styles allowing users to access
image derivatives for images they should not be able to view. Furthermore,
Drupal didn't set the right headers to prevent image styles from being cached
in the browser.

.... Access bypass - content administration

CVE: Requested.
Drupal core provides the ability to list nodes on a site at admin/content.
Drupal core failed to confirm a user viewing that page had access to each
node in the list. This vulnerability only concerns sites running a
contributed node access module and is mitigated by the fact that users must
have a role with the "view content overview" permission. Unpublished nodes
were not displayed to users who only had the "view content overview"
permission.
