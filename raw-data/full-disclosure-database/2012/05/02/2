Subject: South African Bank "security"

Dear Full-Disclosure,

ABSA Bank South Africa, "a member of the Barclays Group", has a division named "ABSA stock brokers".  ABSA stock brokers sends out "secure email" for statements, etc.  This consists of an attached HTML form (plaintext) which submits a user name and password by https to digibroker.co.za, which displays the actual statement.

This, unfortunately, leaves ample room for rank outsiders to provide similar mail and collect passwords, if they can just get past that fiendishly complex base64 encryption.  The following sample of only slightly doctored "secure email" is provided for educational purposes only:
