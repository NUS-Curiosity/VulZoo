	Cross Site Scripting	(XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1558248

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-072
  * Project: cctags [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-May-02
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to create "tag clouds" with taxonomy terms displayed
in different sizes depending on how frequently they are used on a site.
The module doesn't sufficiently filter user supplied text leading to a Cross
Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the ability to create or edit vocabularies or terms.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * cctags 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.10.
  * cctags 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.10.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed cctags [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the cctags module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to cctags 6.x-1.10
    [4]
  * If you use the cctags module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to cctags 7.x-1.10
    [5]

Also see the cctags [6] project page.
