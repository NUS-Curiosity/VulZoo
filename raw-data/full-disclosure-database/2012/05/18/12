[*] About Sao Paulo (taken from fiquemaisumdia.com.br)

The city is the largest in Brazil and first in South America by
population. Quite often Sao Paulo intimidates people because of its
size, its constant pedestrian and vehicle traffic, ethnic and cultural
multiplicity. Sao Paulo will surprise you wheter you come here on
business or for an expo, a congress or a convenion, stay for at least
one more day. Let yourself be seduced by the cultural diversity of
this many-faceted city which vibrates, dictates fashion, is always
anticipating trends, and welcomes Brazilians and foreigners from all
over. And oh, do not forget to have fun in South America's wildest night
life.
