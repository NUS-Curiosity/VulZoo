Subject: Re: New Open Source Web Application Vulnerability
 Scanner Available

The code is broken,

All pages have a require_once() that references a static path.

require_once('/scanner/functions/databaseFunctions.php');

This needs to be

require_once('./scanner/functions/databaseFunctions.php');
