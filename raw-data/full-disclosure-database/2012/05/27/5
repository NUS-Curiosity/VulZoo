The question that comes to mind (for me) is what email address(es) did you use?

Per RFC 2142, MAILBOX NAMES FOR COMMON SERVICES, ROLES AND FUNCTIONS
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt), security@....com should be
monitored. I also suggest secure@....com since Microsoft made it
somewhat popular (MS was using it around the time the RFC was
published). There are a few others from the RFC I would use, including
support, abuse, and noc. For web specific problems, www and hostmaster
would be included.

Additionally, the administrative and technical contacts for IBM can be
found in any WHOIS database.

I discourage folks from using a web submittal forms since using the
website can be encumbered with legal terms. I even recall a site (the
name escapes me) that binds you to a non-disclosure when you use their
web portal to submit a bug.

Jeff
