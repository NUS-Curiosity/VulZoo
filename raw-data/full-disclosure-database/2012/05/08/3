Hello,

few minutes ago, we released a paper about windows PE runtime crypters.

A short description:

theoretic aspects behind run-time crypters and describes a reference
implementation for Portable Executables.

You can find the paper, here: http://nullsecurity.net/papers.html

We will release the source code (hyperion) during our berlinsides talk
