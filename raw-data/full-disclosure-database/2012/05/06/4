Subject: University of Washington Infected with GetMama
	3000 files!

dearest FD the university of washington server has been feeding
malware 4 about a 1 month. i grep & found total infected files to be
about 3000. it is the GetMama malware. i saved the list of infected
files on pastebin (http://pastebin.com/P4A4JN6F) and on
students03.u.washington.edu
(/nfs/aesop03/hw32/d93/blogs/wp-content/plugins/si-contact-form/captcha/temp/infected.txt).
if they can not keep the servers safe from the public then what are
they getting paid to do? they have been hacked many times before &
refuse to inform ur students, ur staff, & the public! i also post on
all their blogs to alert the students & staff
