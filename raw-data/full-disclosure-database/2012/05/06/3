how these guys can release so much vulnerabilities with such a high quality weekly.
I am a bit stunned after i watched that some month because they release more useful own advisories 
then other people do with leaks. After the last msn wave i thought it was over but it looks
they gona rock & also implemented now cvss scoring. Who are these people ?
Anybody know them personally ?
