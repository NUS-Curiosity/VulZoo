hahaha, how many buzzwords for seemingly simple stuff :)

some buzzwords you can use for profit:

division by _zero_, _integer_ overflow, attack _vector_, attack
_vector space_ [1], attack _curve_, attack _surface_, attack
_abelian surface_ [1], attack _group law_ [1] , attack _tree_, 
attack _graph_, attack _constrained path on graph_ [1], 
attack _turing machine_ [1], attack halting _problem_ [1].


[1] might not be in general usage as of Mon May 28 EEST 2012
