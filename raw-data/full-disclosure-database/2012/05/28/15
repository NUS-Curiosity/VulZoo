you've written a prospectus or two, it seems.

the best attack trees are planted in a firmament of bayesian machine
learning, nurtured with cloud based social graph analysis, and
precipitated via distributed simulation into actionable tactics with
certainty of execution. i have generated a truly marvelous
computer-assisted proof of this, which this message is unable to
contain.

the details just how many 0days rain down from this exploit cloud
shall sadly remain obscured... for now. anyone want to seed a 7.44TB
torrent?
