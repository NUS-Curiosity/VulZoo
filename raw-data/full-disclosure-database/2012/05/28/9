Subject: Re: Flame= cyberwar

What is a cyberweapon ? How does one define codeset   without actually
doing the code review. If it took stuxnet 20 wks to dismantle .. Flame
seems is 20 times more complex.. so how can one easily define it as a
"cyberweapon" ??
btw.. seems that  Kaspersky called  4 Cyber-Weapons Convention at the CeBIT
/AU zone., that was a week ago.. waht a co-incidence !!
