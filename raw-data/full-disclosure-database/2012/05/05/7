	Redirector and XSS vulnerabilities in WordPress

I don't really get how you can compare Jehovahs witnesses or any other
religion to a discussion about mailing list spam blackhat-seo style made to
increase traffic and backlinks to Mustlive's website. Not only are
MustLive's "advisories" mostly annoying it's also making other web
application security researchers look like a joke.

InterN0T doesn't condone with illegal activities, so please keep your
personal views about the community to yourself. I'm not sure what script
kiddie means in your personal biased opinion, but there's various types of
people in the community (even pure_hate is there, and many full-time
professionals (i.e., security consultants, ethical hackers, pentesters,
developers, etc.), not just beginners. Unlike other communities that takes
hacking serious, we don't kick or ban script kiddies as long as they follow
the rules, we try to make them >learn< to improve and thereby change their
destructive and annoying behaviour. (Yes, we actually try to make a
difference.)

I'm sure you're of course a master of all arts hacker, that passed OSCE
and any other similar certifications in 5 minutes or less.



Best regards,
MaXe
