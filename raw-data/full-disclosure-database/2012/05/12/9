The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a CSRF- and multiple persistent Web 
Vulnerabilities in the NetBill v1.2 web application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-05-11:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the NetBill v1.2 web application.
The bugs 
allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. 
Exploitation requires low user inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s):

				[+] /accounts/admin/index.php?user=59902561 - user Full Name
				[+] /accounts/admin/index.php?user=59902561 - add file (Title - Description)
				[+] /accounts/index2.php?page=support - Inject via support request (Details)

1.2
A cross site request forgery vulnerability is detected in  in NetBill v1.2  web application. The bugs allow remote attackers with 
high required user inter action to edit user accounts. Successful exploitation can lead to account creation. To exploit 
the issue the attacker need to create a manipulated copy the edit user mask/form. Inside of the document the remote 
can implement his own values for the update because of no form or token protection. When admin get now forced to execute 
the script via link he is executing the new value on the update of the application if his session is not expired.

Vulnerable Module(s):

				[+] /accounts/admin/index.php?action=new-client - Add New Account
