Introduction:
=============
Serendipity is a weblog/blog system, implemented with PHP. It is standards compliant, feature rich 
and open source (BSD License). Serendipity is constantly under active development, with a team of 
talented developers trying to make the best PHP powered blog on the net. Serendipity has so far 
also proven 100% PHP5 compatible. Serendipity is a PHP-powered weblog application which gives the 
user an easy way to maintain an online diary, weblog or even a complete homepage. While the default 
package is designed for the casual blogger, Serendipity offers a flexible, expandable and easy-to-use 
framework with the power for professional applications.

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory researcher discovered multiple web vulnerabilities in Serendipity v1.6 Content Management System.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-05-05:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Serendipity v1.6 Content Management System. The bugs 
allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires 
low user inter action. Attackers can inject malicious strings as author name to execute them when an admin is processing to preview, review 
or manage the listing of users. The bug is located on application side & the execution is persistent out of the user management web 
application context.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ..
