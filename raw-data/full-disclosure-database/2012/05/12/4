Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple web vulnerabilities in GENU CMS 2012-3 content management system.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-16:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in GENU CMS 2012-3 content management system.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerability is located on the username post method.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Search - news_subject

--- SQL Exception Logs ---
Error in query  SELECT genu_categories.category_id, genu_categories.category_image, 
genu_categories.category_name, genu_news.news_comments, genu_news.news_date, 
genu_news.news_id, genu_news.news_source, genu_news.news_subject, genu_news.news_text, 
genu_users.user_id, genu_users.user_name FROM genu_categories, genu_news, genu_users WHERE 
genu_categories.category_id = genu_news.category_id AND genu_categories.category_level IN 
( 0 ,  2 ) AND genu_news.news_active =  1  AND genu_news.user_id = genu_users.user_id AND 
LOWER(genu_news.news_subject-1 ) LIKE  %news%  ORDER BY news_date DESC LIMIT 0, 30

1.2
A csrf vulnerability is detected in GENU CMS 2012-3 content management system. The vulnerability allows
an remote attacker to delete with medium required user inter action administrator, moderator & users without 
checkbox or confirmation by the admin itself.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Delete User

Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without user inter action. 
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.2
The csrf vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with medium or high required
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high(+).

1.2
The security risk of the csrf vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).
