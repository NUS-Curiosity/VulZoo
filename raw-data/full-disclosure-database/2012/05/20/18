None of this matters – if you have username and password, you can check mail via POP3 or IMAP.   Last time I checked, that was “by design.”   If anyone is saying this is some sort of vulnerability because someone “happens across your username and password” then they are in the wrong business.

Michael – for you to make these claims, get Google involved, and post their replies here but refuse to give them your username (which will be on every email you send out) so they can troubleshoot is really a waste of time.

Your initial point of “even the big companies with teams of security experts have security vulnerabilities” seems to shrink a bit when they illustrate concern with the issue yet you refuse to provide the simplest of information.   I not sure what other expectations one would have of an organization.

Surely you can create a sock puppet for debugging purposes.
