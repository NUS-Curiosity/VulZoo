Subject: Re: New Open Source Web Application Vulnerability
 Scanner Available

Hi Dan,

Thanks for the feedback. Yes some users seem to be having this problem. The
code works in some environments but not in others.

I will be making another release shortly and will fix the issue. I may have
to make different releases for different environment (Windows, Linux, etc.)
instead of just having the one release.

Kind Regards,

Dermot Blair
