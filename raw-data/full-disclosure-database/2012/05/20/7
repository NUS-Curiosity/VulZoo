Subject: php code reviewer(php source code auditing tool)

PHP is a very simple and easy-to-learn programming language – it provides
anyone with minimal programming skills an easy way to get things done. For
example, you can assign a value to a variable without even declaring that
variable. It is those types of practices and often lack of knowledge of the
weakness of PHP that makes web sites more prone to attacks. In our attempt
to help you make your PHP site and web applications more secure, we’ve
produce a useful PHP source code auditing tools.

Php Code Reviewer is a PHP audit tool that performs automatic scans of PHP
source code, aimed at the detection of web application vulnerabilities such
as XSS and Command Execute. Php Code Reviewer takes a PHP program as input,
and creates a report that lists possible vulnerable points in the program,
together with additional information for understanding the vulnerability.
Php Code Reviewer takes the source code text, and matches the source code
text against those names, while ignoring text inside comments and strings
(except for flawfinder directives).
