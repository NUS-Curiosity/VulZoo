It can! The codes that 2-step uses can be generated using the open TOTP
standard, and the Google Authenticator smartphone app is just an
implementation of that:

I don't know enough about hardware OTP tokens to say for sure, but I think
if you can find a time-based code generator you can probably set it up to
accept the same keys the smartphone app does.
