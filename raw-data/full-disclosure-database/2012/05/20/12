Subject: Re: Google Accounts Security Vulnerability

I was not stating that it was a vulnerability in the sense of someone can
compromise your account with only your phone number. I was saying it's not
doing its job in terms of what most people expect it to do.

It provides a false sense of security. It's a security mechanism, it
prevents people from logging onto accounts when they come from a location
that is unrecognized as associated with the account. and it can be
circumvented with little effort on an individual basis. Distributed attacks
would have trouble with it, but could adapt to it. If distributed attacks
are the only component of their threat model, then it's fine. Regardless,
it's interesting and that's why it's here. 

 

On why I don't want to provide my email address to Google:

It's a different email address which I don't want associated with this email
address for various reasons. That is why I am not going to provide it.

Your assumption that it's a simple piece of information and requires no
effort to give out is correct, but the impact of the association is
unwanted.

The fact that Google can create a test account and reproduce the issue (as I
have now done several times) tells me that they want the account information
for some other purpose or that they're just being lazy.

 

And as for your last comment related to my "initial point", it's not my
initial point. My initial point was that there's a problem and that Google
should fix it or verify that this is the intended behavior.

I would expect an organization to be able to rig up some tests and sort it
out in a week or so. If Google is doing that, then great.

I tried, and it didn't work (couldn't repro).

 

None of this matters - if you have username and password, you can check mail
via POP3 or IMAP.   Last time I checked, that was "by design."   If anyone
is saying this is some sort of vulnerability because someone "happens across
your username and password" then they are in the wrong business.

 

Michael - for you to make these claims, get Google involved, and post their
replies here but refuse to give them your username (which will be on every
email you send out) so they can troubleshoot is really a waste of time.

 

Your initial point of "even the big companies with teams of security experts
have security vulnerabilities" seems to shrink a bit when they illustrate
concern with the issue yet you refuse to provide the simplest of
information.   I not sure what other expectations one would have of an
organization.

Surely you can create a sock puppet for debugging purposes.
