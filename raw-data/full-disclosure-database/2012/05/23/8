	List - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1597262

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-083
  * Project: Taxonomy List [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-May-23
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

CVE: Requested
This module enables you to display the terms (and optionally nodes) under
categories.

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user supplied text in the taxonomy
information.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with permissions to create or edit taxonomy terms.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Taxonomy List 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.4.

The 6.x-2.x branch is not affected.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Taxonomy List
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Taxonomy List module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Taxonomy
    List 6.x-2.0 [4].
  * If you must use the 6.x-1.x branch of the Taxonomy List module for Drupal
    6.x, upgrade to Taxonomy List 6.x-1.4 [5] (which is no longer supported).

Also see the Taxonomy List [6] project page.
