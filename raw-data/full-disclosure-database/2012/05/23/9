	- Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1597364

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-084
  * Project: Search API [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-May-23
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

CVE: Requested
This module enables you to build searches using a wide range of features,
data sources and backends.

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user input in some cases when
throwing exceptions or logging errors. This enables attackers to insert
arbitrary data into a page by manipulating its URL. Users would have to open
such a manipulated URL to see the changed content.

This is only possible in some setups of Search API, specifically when users
can manually enter field identifiers in some way â€“ e.g., through an exposed
Views sort or with the old Facets module.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Search API 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Search API [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Search API module (especially with Views, the old Facets
    module or other advanced search forms) for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Search
    API 7.x-1.1 [4]
  * Run update.php to also ensure that previously stored log messages are
    sanitized.

Also see the Search API [5] project page.

-------- FIXED BY
