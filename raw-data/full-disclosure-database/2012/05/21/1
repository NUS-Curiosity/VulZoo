Subject: New XSS vulnerability in Yandex.Server

Hello list!

I want to warn you about new Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in
Yandex.Server.

Earlier I've informed about other XSS in Yandex.Server (CVE-2007-3485) -
mentioned about them in my Month of Search Engines Bugs project. And in 2007
I've informed Yandex about them. Which should fix these vulnerabilities and
not allow new ones. But Yandex failed with it and last week, during another
pentest, I've found new Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in
Yandex.Server - this time it's DOM Based XSS.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Yandex.Server 2010 9.0 Enterprise and other versions.

Details:

XSS (WASC-08):
