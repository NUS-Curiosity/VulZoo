Michele Orru.. Sorry to write you directly to the list.. But you did it
too.. So.. please allow me to answer..

Exploit Pack != Beef ... Just similar projects.. different approaches

In fact you came to a webcast where I showed the code of Exploit Pack... I
remember you saying that Exploit Pack is a cool project...

Please check out our javascript agent...
http://www.exploitpack.com/Gate/jsacco.js
http://www.exploitpack.com/Gate/PLAINdoMagic.js

I am not pointing you with a gun.. if you don not like Exploit Pack tools..
just do not use our tools...

In my personal opinion, beef is a good project, in fact I am a big fan of
it. But it doesnt work like i want it, beef cannot handle more than 10
bots.. almost all the times I run the ruby project it crashes.. also some
modules doesnt work either.. the popup persistent is old and do not work on
recent browsers.. among other things.. Also beef doesnt have any module for
defense like clientside SQLi / XSS protection...

SQLi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD2gI8giOQA
XSS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rYy5SA9PPs&feature=relmfu

JSacco
