Hi everybody!

I wonÂ´t take much of your time: as part of a project in our University we
have developed a tool to deal with the vulnerabilty known as "Failure to
restrict access".

If you want to check it a see what do we to say about it, go to our site
and leave any comments you may have:

Thanks a lot!

Fernando.
