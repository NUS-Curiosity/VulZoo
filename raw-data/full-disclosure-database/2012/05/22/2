LOL, when did I say ExploitPack is cool ?
Maybe in your dreams!

And btw, the Javascript agent you sent are not the one I analyzed.
This is the one: http://pastebin.com/7j1wfB2n
After you scroll down, skipping jquery, you see the BeEF code that you included.

You were just replacing the BeEF global variable calling it "bot",
and re-using large parts of BeEF.

Anyway, everyone knows you...you're like the second MustLive.
Your Metasploit clone, apart from shitty InfoSec articles, is a
complete failure and clone.

So get a life man!
