Subject: Re: [OT] New online service to make XSSs easier

Anyone visiting a compromised site can get the hash, meaning anyone
who is looking for it can find it and lets any random person(assuming
stored) visiting to be able to grab all the cookie values.

That's not even my personal concern. My concern is why should I trust
the owner? Whether you are a black hat, white hat, or myriad of other
assorted hats  you would be allowing sensitive information to sit on
this guy's server. How do we know he isn't silently making a copy of
all the data for his own ends? Simply we don't.
