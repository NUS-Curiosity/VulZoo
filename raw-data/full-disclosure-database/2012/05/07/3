Subject: Re: [OT] New online service to make XSSs easier

And this is anonymous.. How??

Oh and I was also wondering how come I can see accounts created by other
users, using a static url like so:
http://www.getmycookie.com/view.m3?hash=<insert_hash_here>

Login as anybody and navigate here, to see that you are definitely not in
your own account:
http://www.getmycookie.com/view.m3?hash=bc010e11ae988eca4ea1d98d5c8014138fa0cf9ccaab457094
