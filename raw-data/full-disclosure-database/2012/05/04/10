Cool story, bro.

First fallacy: Anonymous is a plural noun, not singular.  It's not one thing with
a cohesive leadership, plan, and direction, it's a bunch of things all wandering in
the same semi-general direction.  There is no singular "wants" to Anonymous.

Second fallacy: Evenif Anonymous as a whole wants one thing, there is no actual
evidence that the one thing is to be anything more than DDoS/defacement/media
hacks.  They seem content at that.

Third fallacy: Never underestimate the value of a good media hack.  Consider
the Maine, the Lusitania, the Gulf of Tonkin, and yellowcake uranium - all to some
extent media hacks.

Overall grade: B-.
