Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : insecure defaults
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no

It was discovered that Mahara, the portfolio, weblog, and resume builder,
had an insecure default with regards to SAML-based authentication used
with more than one SAML identity provider. Someone with control over one
IdP could impersonate users from other IdP's.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.
