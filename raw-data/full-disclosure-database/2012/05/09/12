Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-075 - Take
	Control - Cross Site	Request Forgery (CSRF)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1569512

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-075
  * Project: Take Control [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-May-09
  * Security risk: Critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to manage your Drupal file-system from within Drupal
itself.
The module does not sufficiently validate Ajax calls leading to possibility
of a Cross Site Request Forgery CSRF attack.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must be able to
guess your Drupal file-system root path exactly. Further, if your site
follows the secure file-system permissions recommendations [3] and the
web-server account does not have write access to Drupal root, only
files/folders in Drupal's "files" directory are open to manipulation.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Take Control 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Take Control
[4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Take Control module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Take Control
    6.x-2.2 [5]

Also see the Take Control [6] project page.
