	Forms - Access Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1569508

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-074
  * Project: Contact Forms [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-May-09
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module expands the features of the site wide contact form. It eliminates
the drop down category menu by generating a clean looking contact form
(without a drop down menu) with a unique path for each of the contact form
categories.
The module allowed users to edit the Contact Form settings if they have
permission to 'access the site-wide contact form' instead of more appropriate
'Administer contact forms and contact form settings' permission.
This vulnerability is only mitigated by the fact that an attacker must know
the correct url to access the Contact Forms settings page (though it is the
same on all Drupal sites).

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Contact Forms 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Contact Forms
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Contact Forms module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Contact
    Forms 7.x-1.3 [4]

Also see the Contact Forms [5] project page.
