	Cross-Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1569482

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-073
  * Project: Glossary [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-May-09
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The glossary module scans posts for glossary terms, adding an indicator. By
hovering over the indicator, users may learn the definition of that term.

The module does not sufficiently sanitize the taxonomy information. This
leaves sites vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with permissions to create or edit taxonomy terms.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Glossary 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.8.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Glossary [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Glossary module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Glossary 6.x-1.8
    [4].

Also see the Glossary [5] project page.

-------- FIXED BY
