View online: http://drupal.org/node/1782686

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-140

  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-September-12
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Inf08 is a valid XHTML 1.0 Strict / CSS 2.1 theme ported from the free CSS
template. The theme contains an arbitrary script injection vulnerability
(XSS) due to the fact that it fails to sanitize user supplied taxonomy
vocabulary names before display. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact
that an attacker must have a role with the permission "administer taxonomy".

  * Inf08 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.10.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Inf08 [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION

  * If you use the Inf08 theme for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Inf08 6.x-1.10 [4]

Also see the Inf08 [5] project page.
