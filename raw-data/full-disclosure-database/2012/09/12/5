Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : improper assert
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4244

It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, does not handle DNS records
properly which approach size limits inherent to the DNS protocol.  An
attacker could use crafted DNS records to crash the BIND server
process, leading to a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze7.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
