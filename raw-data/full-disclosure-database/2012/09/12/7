	Contact - Access bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1782832

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-141
  * Project: Mass Contact [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-September-12
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module allows anyone with permission to send a single message to
multiple users of a site, using its roles functionality.

The module doesn't sufficiently check permissions after the form has been
submitted.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must use a tool
of some kind (like the Tamper Data Firefox add-on) to intercept the form
submission request in order to modify the settings.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Mass Contact 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Mass Contact
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Mass Contact module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Mass Contact
    6.x-1.2 [4]

Also see the Mass Contact [5] project page.
