Subject: Antivirus Evasion: Developing an undetectable USB
	dropper

Usually when we talk about bypassing antivirus software, and especially when
we talk about antivirus programs like NOD32, Kaspersky, BitDefender. We
automatically think about deep coding knowledge, using undocumented APIs or
using Zero days exploits, but this is not always true, since by applying
some "very" basics approaches we will be able to bypass most of (if not all)
antivirus programs, at least for doing some basic things. Learn more about
how to develop an undetectable USB dropper at InfoSec Institute  here:
