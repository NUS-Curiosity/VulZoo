Confirmed with V5 Foxit Reader 5.4.3.0920 on WinXP Pro SP3 (though
with a slightly different offset - 0015eb8c ... ASLR ?).

Interestingly, NOT confirmed for Foxit Reader 4.3.1.0323 (the last
version of the V4 Foxit Reader, which is the last version many people
are comfortable with); with this version I get a dialog box stating
"format error: not a PDF or corrupted", and no crash.  This is also on
XP Pro SP3.  Another reason to be disappointed with Foxit Reader V5 :)

Cheers
