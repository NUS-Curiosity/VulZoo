TP-LINK TL-WR340G is a SOHO router with integrated IEEE 802.11b/g AP. 
Now it's marked End-of-Life.

Transmitting crafted frames in proximity of working router cause device 
to malfunction. Wireless communication stops,  existing clients don't 
receive frames from AP ( except beacons ), new clients can't connect.

MAC>",addr3="<AP MAC>")/Dot11Beacon()/Dot11Elt()
 >> sendp(fr,iface="injection capable wireless interface",count=5)

Attacker could cease wireless traffic. To resume AP functionality user 
must restart wireless interface in WebGUI or restart device.
