Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher of the Vulnerability Laboratory Team discovered multiple web vulnerabilties in eFronts v3.6.11 Enterprise CMS.

Exploitation-Technique:

Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the eFront Enterprise v3.6.11 Content Management System.
The vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).

The first vulnerability is located in the Organization > Organizational Profile module with the bound vulnerable Father name 
parameter and listing. The bug allows a low privileged trainee account to exploit higher privileged professor or administrator 
user accounts via organisation registration listing. Exploitation of the first vulnerability requires low privileged trainee 
elearning application user account.

The secound vulnerability is located in the Files module with the bound vulnerable file name listing.
Exploitation of the secound vulnerability requires low privileged trainee elearning application user account.

The thrid vulnerability is located in the `Write something about yourself` input message box module with the bound vulnerable 
listing. Exploitation of the 3rd vulnerability requires privileged trainee/professor/admin elearning application user account.
The third issue is only local exploitable because no affected output listing is available for the vulnerable 
`Write something about yourself` application module.


Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities can lead to persistent session hijacking (professor/admin), persistent phsishing
attacks or stable (persistent) context manipulation. 


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Organization > Organizational Profile
				[+] Files
				[+] PANEL Index - Write something about yourself (Only local exploitable!)


Vulnerable Parameters(s):
				[+] Father name [Organisation Listing]
				[+] File Name [Listing]
				[+] Message - Index [Listing]


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with a low privileged trainee account.
