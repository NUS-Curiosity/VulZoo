[*] WHAT?

ekoparty is a one-of-a-kind event in South America; an annual security
conference held in Buenos Aires where security specialists from all over
Latin America (and beyond) have the chance to get involved with
state-of-art techniques, vulnerabilities and tools in a relaxed environment
which has not been seen before.

The eighth edition of ekoparty is expected to bring together over 1300
security specialists from around the world in the most deep-knowledge
technical conference of Latin America.

This is not just a completely technical conference, it also has a lot of
awesome activities like Lock picking village, Wardriving BA,
CTF wargame, WiFi antenna build workshop, after hours and even a kick ass
after conference party!

Like always this year we are going to offer simultaneous translation of all
the lectures, that way you are not going to miss anything.
