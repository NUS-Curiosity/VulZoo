Over the years I've done dozens (at least) of Adobe Flash updates on 
behalf of my employer. I'm not currently in a position to verify by 
experimentation, but my experience has been that under some (relatively 
infrequent) circumstances that check box is suppressed, or nonexistent. In 
those cases, the browser tool-bar (along with any other crapware that 
Adobe has solicited bribes to distribute) is installed without explicit 
opt-in.
