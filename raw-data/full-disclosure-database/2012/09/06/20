Subject: Adobe Flash UpdateInstalls Other Warez without
	Consent

The company that writes the worlds most insecure software [1,2,3] has
figured out a way to further increase an attack surface.

Adobe now includes additional warez in their updates without consent.
The warez includes a browser and tools bar. The attached image is what
I got when I agreed to update Adobe Flash because of recent security
vulnerability fixes.

It appears Adobe has become a whore to Google like Mozilla.

+1 Adobe.
