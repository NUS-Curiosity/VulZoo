| Toshiba ConfigFree CF7 File Remote Command Execution            |
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------/


Summary
=======

There is a command execution vulnerability in the Toshiba ConfigFree 
CF7 file format used on Toshiba laptops to import and export network 
configurations. An attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the 
privileges of the current logged-in user by enticing a Toshiba laptop
user to download and execute a crafted CF7 file.

Affected Products
======== ========

Confirmed in latest Configfree version 8.0.38 on Windows 7 on a Toshiba 
Satellite R850. Other versions may also be affected.


Details

operating-system commands.

ConfigFree is the registered file handler for the cf7 filetype (CFProfile.exe 
at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\cf7_auto_file\shell\open\command) so if a victim could 
be convinced to download and apply a crafted cf7 file the commands in the runApp
field would be executed and could be used to take control of the machine.


Impact
======

if a victim could be convinced to download and apply a crafted cf7 file 
the commands in the runApp field would be executed and could be used to 
take control of the machine.


Solution
========

As no fix is available, concerned users could remove this utility from their 
machine.
