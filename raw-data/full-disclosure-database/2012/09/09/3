Package        : xen-qemu-dm-4.0
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3515 CVE-2012-4411

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xen-qemu-dm-4.0, the Xen
Qemu Device Model virtual machine hardware emulator. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-3515:

    The device model for HVM domains does not properly handle VT100
    escape sequences when emulating certain devices with a virtual
    console backend. An attacker within a guest with access to the
    vulnerable virtual console could overwrite memory of the device
    model and escalate privileges to that of the device model process.

CVE-2012-4411:

    The qemu monitor was enabled by default, allowing administrators of
    a guest to access resources of the host, possibly escalate privileges
    or access resources belonging to another guest.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-2+squeeze2.

The testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
no longer contain this package.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen-qemu-dm-4.0 packages.
