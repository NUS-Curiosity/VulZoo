Subject: OpenSecurityTraining Intel VT-x class

We're now mirroring the content for David Weinstein's x86 virtualization
training class. This class teaches how to write a toy virtual machine
monitor (VMM) while showing how the famous BluePill and Vitriol attacks are
possible. The class is designed with particular focus on a Windows 7 x64
system, but towards the end it discusses creating a container for real-mode
(BIOS code) execution inside a toy Linux VMM (accessible via /dev/vmm once
the kernel module is loaded). The concepts are introduced first with some
historical perspective and fundamentals, followed by doing a deep technical
dive, and finally talking about detection techniques/countermeasures in the
last part.
