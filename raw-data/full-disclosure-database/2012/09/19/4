Subject: FreeSWITCH remote denial of service vulnerability

Hi List,

"FreeSWITCH is a scalable open source cross-platform telephony platform
designed to route and interconnect popular communication protocols using
audio, video, text or any other form of media."
- freeswitch.org

FreeSWITCH having issues handling overly long Route header value which
results in segmentation fault.
This can be also considered as a DoS vulnerability because it is possible
to remotely crash FreeSWITCH.

Affected version: FreeSWITCH Version
1.2.0-rc2+git~20120731T213556Z~e97da8e20a (1.2.0-rc2; git at commit
e97da8e20a on Tue, 31 Jul 2012 21:35:56 Z)
Later or previous commits might also affected.

The issue have been reported to the FreeSWITCH developers and it is already
fixed in the latest commit.

To test if you have a vulnerable build do the following:

- Prepare an INVITE request containing a Route header with the value
generated by the following command: perl -e "print 'A,' x 15000"
- Send the prepared INVITE request to port 5060

Regards,
Zsolt Imre
