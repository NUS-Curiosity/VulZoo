Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-143 PRH Search -
	Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1789252

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-143
  * Project: PRH Search [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-September-19
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

PRH Search provides an interface to search for association information for
Finnish association using the PRH (Patentti- ja Rekisterihallitus) database.
The module fails to sanitize data retrieved from an untrusted third party
source, thereby exposing an arbitrary script injection vulnerability (XSS).

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have either
gained access to that third party source or use techniques such as DNS
spoofing in order to inject malicious data.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * PRH Search 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed PRH Search [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the PRH Search module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to PRH Search
    7.x-1.1 [4]
