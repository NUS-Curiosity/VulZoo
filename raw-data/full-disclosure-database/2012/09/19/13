Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-147 - FileField
	Sources - Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1789306

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-147
  * Project: FileField Sources [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-September-19
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Drupal FileField module lets you upload files from your computer through
a CCK field. The FileField Sources module expands on this ability by allowing
you to select new or existing files through additional means. The FileField
Sources module contains a persistent cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
due to the fact that it fails to sanitize user supplied filenames before
display.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that malicious users must have
the ability to upload files on a field that has the "Reference existing"
source enabled.

CVE: Requested

---------------------------------------------------

  * FileField Sources 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.6.

Sources [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.
