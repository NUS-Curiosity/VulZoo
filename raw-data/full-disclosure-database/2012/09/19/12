Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-146 - Simplenews
	Scheduler -	Arbitrary code execution

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1789284

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-146
  * Project: Simplenews Scheduler [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-September-19
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Arbitrary PHP code execution

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Simplenews Scheduler module provides a system for creating automatic
email newsletters. These can be set to be sent at a fixed interval, or PHP
code can be entered to evaluate a condition for a new newsletter issue to be
sent.

The module allows a user with the 'send scheduled newsletters' access to the
scheduling form where PHP code may be entered. This code is then executed the
next time the site runs cron. A site administrator granting permissions is
not given sufficient warning that they are granting this level of access to
the site.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have
already been granted a role with the permission 'send scheduled newsletters'.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Simplenews Scheduler 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Simplenews
Scheduler [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
