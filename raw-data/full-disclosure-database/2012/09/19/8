Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-142 - Spambot -
	Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1789242

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-142
  * Project: Spambot [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-September-19
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Spambot module enables you to protect new user registrations from
spammers using the database at stopforumspam.com.

Spambot doesn't sufficiently sanitize API responses from stopforumspam.com
when they are logged to the watchdog, allowing a potential XSS attack.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only stopforumspam.com (or
someone pretending to be stopforumspam.com) can exploit it.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Spambot 6.x-3.x versions prior to 6.x-3.2.
  * Spambot 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Spambot [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.
