Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-144 Fonecta
	verify - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1789258

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-144
  * Project: Fonecta verify [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-September-19
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Fonecta verify provides an interface to retrieve information from the Finnish
Fonecta company information database. The module contains an arbitrary script
injection vulnerability (XSS) due to the fact that it fails to sanitize data
retrieved from an untrusted third party source.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have either
gained access to that third party source or use techniques such as DNS
spoofing in order to inject malicious data.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED

  * Fonecta verify 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.6.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Fonecta verify
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION

  * If you use the Fonecta verify module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Fonecta
    verify 7.x-1.6 [4]
