 Adobe Flash UpdateInstalls Other Warez without Consent

You guys are acting like Jeffrey is a newb to all this stuff.  I'm sure he knows what mbam and spybot are, and is able to scan his machine. I'm sure he knows to go straight to the source when downloading flash player, albeit Adobe does include the annoying toolbar unless you choose not to install.

You didn't download it from download.cnet.com, by any chance?
Sounds more like an infection to me.
For windows, download and run the following programs.
