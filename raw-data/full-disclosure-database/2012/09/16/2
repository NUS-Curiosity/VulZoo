Package        : request-tracker3.8
Vulnerability  : regression
Debian-specific: no

The security updates for request-tracker3.8, DSA-2480-1, DSA-2480-2,
and DSA-2480-3, contained minor regressions. Namely:

* The calendar popup page in Internet Explorer would be blocked by the
CSRF protection mechanism.
* Search results pages could not be shared without saving, sharing, and
then loading the search.
* rt-email-dashboards would fail with an error due to a call to an
undefined "interp" method.

Please note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web
server, you must stop and start Apache manually.  The "restart"
mechanism is not recommended, especially when using mod_perl.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.8-7+squeeze5.

We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.
