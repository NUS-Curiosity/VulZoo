Subject: Announcing the hack.lu CTF 2012

Hi folks,
we hereby announce the third hack.lu Capture The Flag contest.

The CTF will take place during the hack.lu conference, i.e. October 23,
11:00 CET until October 25, 11:00 CET.

And the best thing is: everyone may participate! For registration see
<https://hacklu.fluxfingers.net/>.

The hack.lu CTF is a challenge based CTF, very much like defcon quals.
This means that the CTF is separated
into small tasks that can be solved individually. The scoreboard will 
be
web accessible and no VPN is required. We are trying our best to give
all participants a delightful experience, the covered topics are
somewhere around crypto, web security, reverse engineering and 
forensics.

We are looking forward to seeing you participate - locally at the
hack.lu conference or from
remote. Direct your questions to somebody at our booth or by e-mail.
For further information about the CTF and the conference see

Thank you for you attention and have a good night (CET) :)
FluxFingers
