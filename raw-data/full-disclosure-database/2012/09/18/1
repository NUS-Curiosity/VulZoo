Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the Axis VoIP Manager v2.1.5.7.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-09-07:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Unpublished


Affected Products:
==================
Axis
Product: VoIP Manager v2.1.5.7


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the Axis VoIP Manager User Portal v2.1.5.7.
The vulnerability allows an attackers (remote) to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high 
required user inter action. The bugs are located on client side in the contact_chooser.cgi and contacts.cgi files with the 
bound vulnerable lastname, firstname, department, contact or manageg_usr application parameters.  Successful exploitation 
result in application account steal, client side phishing & client-side content request manipulation. Exploitation requires 
medium or high user inter action & without privileged web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] contact_chooser.cgi
				[+] contacts.cgi

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] lastname, firstname & department
				[+] contact
				[+] managed_usr


Proof of Concept:
=================
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium or high required 
user inter action and without privileged application user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the non persistent (client side) cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+)|(-)medium.
