Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
3.5


Introduction:
=============
The FortiGate series of multi-threat security systems detect and eliminate the most damaging, content-based threats from email 
and Web traffic such as viruses, worms, intrusions, inappropriate Web content and more in real time - without degrading 
network performance.

Ranging from the FortiGate-30 series for small offices to the FortiGate-5000 series for large enterprises, service providers and 
carriers, the FortiGate line combines the FortiOS™ security operating system with FortiASIC processors and other hardware to provide 
a comprehensive and high-performance array of security and networking functions including:

    * Firewall, VPN, and Traffic Shaping
    * Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
    * Antivirus/Antispyware/Antimalware
    * Web Filtering
    * Antispam
    * Application Control (e.g., IM and P2P)
    * VoIP Support (H.323. and SCCP)
    * Layer 2/3 routing
    * Multiple WAN interface options

FortiGate appliances provide cost-effective, comprehensive protection against network, content, and application-level threats - including 
complex attacks favored by cybercriminals - without degrading network availability and uptime. FortiGate platforms incorporate sophisticated 
networking features, such as high availability (active/active, active/passive) for maximum network uptime, and virtual domain (VDOM) 
capabilities to separate various networks requiring different security policies.

Fortigate applainces are Pentagon & US Military certified. 
The military provides high security standards & save outdoor camps, air base, offices with fortigate hardware.

Affected Products:
==================
Fortigate
Product: UTM Firewall Appliance Application vFortiGate-5000 Series;FortiGate-3950 Series;FortiGate-3810A;


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple input validation vulnerabilities (non-persistent) are detected in the FortiGates UTM Appliance Application. 
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack admin/customer sessions with required user inter action (client-side). 
Successful exploitation allows to phish user accounts, hijacking sessions, redirect over client side requests or manipulate 
website context on client-side browser requests.

Solution:
=========
Restrict the mkey, context, title and msg parameter. Parse the client side input & output listings on requests to fix 
the issue stable. Filter & restrict the input request of the exception-handling. Validate the output listing to 
patch/fix the stable client side cross site scripting vulnerability.

   * FortiOS v4.3.8 B0630
   * FortiOS v5.0 B064


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(-).
