Subject: Re: Adobe Flash UpdateInstalls Other Warez
	without Consent

So, I was updating flash on a computer lately, when I noticed the prompt
below*, reminding me of this conversation.

*or maybe it just took me a few weeks to photoshop this....you decide.

To the more reasonable readers, I guess Adobe could have had a genuine
mistake / bug in their code....nothing new.
Don't know why it's such a big deal.
