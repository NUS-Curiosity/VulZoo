Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 September 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability in the Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) routing protocol feature.

The vulnerability can be triggered when the router receives a
malformed attribute from a peer on an existing BGP session.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause all BGP
sessions to reset.  Repeated exploitation may result in an inability
to route packets to BGP neighbors during reconvergence times.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.  There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  This
advisory is available at the following link:

Note: The September 26, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes 9 Cisco Security Advisories. Eight of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS
Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities
detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases
that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September
2012 bundled publication.
