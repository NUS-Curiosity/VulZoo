	Bypass

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1796036

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-148
  * Project: Organic groups [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-September-26
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

OG (Organic groups) enables users to create and manage their own 'groups'.
Each group can have subscribers, and maintains a group home page where
subscribers communicate amongst themselves. A group membership can be given
immediately upon subscribing, or be pending - waiting for a group
administrator to approve it.

OG doesn't properly maintain pending memberships if the user is allowed to
edit their own account.

In addition, under certain circumstances, a user was able to post to a group
which they were not a member of.

There are no additional mitigating factors for these issues.

CVE: Requested

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * OG (Organic groups) 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.5.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Organic groups
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the OG 7.x-1.x module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to OG (Organic
    groups) 7.x-1.5 [4]

Also see the Organic groups [5] project page.
