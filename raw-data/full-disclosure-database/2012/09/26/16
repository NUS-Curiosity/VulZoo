Subject: EuSecWest, ekoparty,
	and SinFP3 OS fingerprinting tool release

Hello list,

SinFP3 is a complete framework for network discovery. Its main purpose  is  to
perform active fingerprinting, but it can also do passive fingerprinting. Both
modes are available  over  IPv4  and  IPv6.  This  new  version  introduces  a
plugin-based architecture, allowing anyone to develop their own  tools  around
the framework.

We presented the tool at EuSecWest and ekoparty security conferences.

You can read more on the tool, and read the presentation slides at:

Also, there is a blog post on how to use it for 3D (CGI) vizualisation:
