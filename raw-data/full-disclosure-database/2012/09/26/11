Summary
=======

The Cisco IOS Software Network Address Translation (NAT) feature
contains two denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities in the
translation of IP packets.

The vulnerabilities are caused when packets in transit on the
vulnerable device require translation.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:

Note: The September 26, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes 9 Cisco Security Advisories. Eight of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS
Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities
detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases
that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September
2012 bundled publication.
