Summary
=======

Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain a vulnerability
that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
of service (DoS) condition. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device that
has the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) server feature enabled, causing a
reload.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:

advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS
Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities
detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases
that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September
2012 bundled publication.
