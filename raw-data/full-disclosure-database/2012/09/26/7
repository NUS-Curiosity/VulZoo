Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120926-cucm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 September 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains a vulnerability in its
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a critical service to fail,
which could interrupt voice services. Affected devices must be
configured to process SIP messages for this vulnerability to be
exploitable.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. A workaround exists for customers who do not require
SIP in their environment.

This advisory is available at:
