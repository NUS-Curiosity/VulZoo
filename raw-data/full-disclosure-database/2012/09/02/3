## ABSTRACT

An huge number of ADSL broadband Italian users are vulnerable to
connection wiretapping and phishing. The most widely distribuited

internal router configuration like DNS servers, traffic routing, VoIP
configurations, DHCP parameters, and and other configurations that may
lead to a complete takeover of the user's ADSL connection. The
technique is also useful to enable hidden feature and
telnet/ftp/tftp/web extended admin interface.
