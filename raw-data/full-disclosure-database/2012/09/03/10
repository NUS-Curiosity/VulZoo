4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Adobe Photoshop, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's 
system.

The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation in 
Photoshop.exe when decompressing SGI24LogLum-compressed TIFF images. 
This can be exploited via a specially crafted TIFF image to cause a 
heap-based buffer overflow.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
