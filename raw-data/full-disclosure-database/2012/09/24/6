Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web
browser based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides
rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.

The reported vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or the bypass of content-loading restrictions via the location
object.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.16-18.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.7esr-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.7esr-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
