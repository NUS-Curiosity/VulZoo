Unfortunately, Apple makes no mention of patches for USB device in

As you probably know, Apple is not responsible actor in this arena.
Confer: the number of vulnerabilities left to rot and fester while
waiting for the iOS 6/iPhone 5 press release
(http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2012/Sep/msg00003.html),
the removal of the toxic Dignotar certificates from the root CA list,
etc.
