Subject: [Onapsis Research Labs] New Onapsis Bizploit
	release

Dear colleague,

We’re happy to announce the release of a new version of Onapsis Bizploit - the open-source ERP Penetration Testing framework.
Bizploit is a free command-line application to perform proof-of-concept penetration tests of the technical layer of SAP platforms.

Nowadays, most organizations which use SAP are going beyond the simple definition of SAP roles and profiles. They have incorporated the technical
layer of their SAP platform into their regular risk assessment processes, in order to address the increased threat of cyber-attacks to their
business-critical systems.

With Bizploit, you can perform basic analysis of some of the existing technical vulnerabilities affecting your SAP systems, which often pose critical
risks to the integrity of the entire platform.

Some new features in this new version (1.50-rc1):
- New exploits for Management Console.
- New modules for SAProuter.
- New modules for remote execution of RFC Functions.
- Module to detect the CTC Verb Tampering vulnerability.
- Several bug fixes.

You can download the new version from Onapsis’ web site at http://www.onapsis.com/bizploit

We hope you enjoy it!
We would love to get your feedback on how you are using Bizploit. Don't hesitate to write us at bizploit@...psis.com!

Kindest regards,
