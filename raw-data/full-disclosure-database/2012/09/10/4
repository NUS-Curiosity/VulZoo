Subject: CFP for BSidesPDX 2012 is open,
	Portland Oregon Nov 9-10 2012

Hey all.  The CFP for BSidesPDX is officially open.  It will be taking
place in Portland Oregon on November 9th-10th.  If you are going to be
in the area, or would like to be, consider sending in a submission.
This is our second year holding this conference, and due to last years
explosive success, we are expanding out a bit.

In an attempt to prevent pointless ranting in talks, we have come up
with four categories with very simplified templates to make sure the
audience gets the most out of your talk.  They are "War Stories",
"Adventure Stories", "Tool Demo", and "Stark Warnings".  Please read
through the templates, and if any of them seem to fit with a topic you
have been thinking of, we would love to read through your proposal.

Submission deadline for round 1 selections ends September 28th.
Submission deadline for round 2 selections ends October 26th.

 Thanks everyone!
