  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-174
  * Project: Context [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-12-19
  * Security risk: Less critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Context has functionality that renders block content for use with its inline
editor. When these requests are made the context module does not sufficiently
ensure that users have access to the block. A malicious user could send a
specially crafted request and get access to block content they should not be
able to see.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must know the
identifiers for the block containing sensitive information and that the
block's code must render that sensitive information when requested by a user
without privileges to see this information.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Context 6.x-3.x versions prior to 6.x-3.1.
  * Context 7.x-3.x versions prior to 7.x-3.0-beta6.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Context [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.
