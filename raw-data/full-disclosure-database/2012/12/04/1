Their documentation is extremely clear that their software should only
ever be used locally:


    [...] and develop or present locally [...]

    [...]

    For developers and development only...

    Not for production or web hosting. EasyPHP is a development tool and
    is not intended to host websites or applications.

If their webserver binds to anything other than localhost then I'll
quickly agree that this is a misconfiguration and a security problem.

But if they do bind to localhost only this seems a bit overhyped.
