We do. You are seeing the 1% that have odd bounce setups that defeat the
automated bounce processing.  The fact that the bounce comes to you and not
the list will also give you a hint as to why it is hard to catch these :)

When time permits I also examine bounces I receive from sending messages
like this, the List Charter, etc.  This is not a fun task.

As a general point, please do not post administrivia to the list unless
absolutely necessary - email me directly in the first instance, thanks.

Cheers
