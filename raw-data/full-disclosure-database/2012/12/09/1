Debian Bug     : 

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Iceweasel, the Debian web browser
based on Mozilla Firefox:

CVE-2012-5829

  Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsWindow::OnExposeEvent function could
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-5842

  Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine could allow remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application
  crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-4207

  The HZ-GB-2312 character-set implementation does not properly handle a ~
  (tilde) character in proximity to a chunk delimiter, which allows remote
  attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted
  document.

CVE-2012-4201

  The evalInSandbox implementation uses an incorrect context during the
  handling of JavaScript code that sets the location.href property, which
  allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or read
  arbitrary files by leveraging a sandboxed add-on.

CVE-2012-4216

  Use-after-free vulnerability in the gfxFont::GetFontEntry function allows
  remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
  memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.16-20.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11esr-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
