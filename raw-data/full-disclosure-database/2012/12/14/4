Subject: Security Alert CVE-2012-6329: TWiki MAKETEXT
	Variable Allows Arbitrary Shell Command Execution

This security advisory alerts you of a potential security issue with  
TWiki installations:
The %MAKETEXT{}% TWiki variable allows arbitrary shell command  
execution. The problem is caused by an underlying security issue in  
the Locale::Maketext CPAN module.

---++ Vulnerable Software Version

  * TWiki-5.1.0 to TWiki-5.1.2 (TWikiRelease05x01x00 to  
TWikiRelease05x01x02)
  * TWiki-5.0.x (TWikiRelease05x00x00 to TWikiRelease05x00x02)
  * TWiki-4.3.x (TWikiRelease04x03x00 to TWikiRelease04x03x02)
  * TWiki-4.2.x (TWikiRelease04x02x00 to TWikiRelease04x02x04)
  * TWiki-4.1.x (TWikiRelease04x01x00 to TWikiRelease04x01x02)
  * TWiki-4.0.x (TWikiRelease04x00x00 to TWikiRelease04x00x05)

---++ Attack Vectors

Editing wiki pages and HTTP POST requests towards a TWiki server with  
enabled localization (typically port 80/TCP). Typically, prior  
authentication is necessary.

---++ Impact

An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary shell  
commands as the webserver user, such as user nobody.

---++ Severity Level

The TWiki SecurityTeam triaged this issue as documented in  
TWikiSecurityAlertProcess [1] and assigned the following severity level:

  * Severity 1 issue: The web server can be compromised

---++ MITRE Name for this Vulnerability

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name  
CVE-2012-6329 [7] to this vulnerability.

---++ Details

1. Shell Command execution: The %MAKETEXT{}% TWiki variable is used to  
localize user interface content to a language of choice. Using a  
specially crafted MAKETEXT, a malicious user can execute shell  
commands by Perl backtick (``) operators. User input is passed to the  
Perl "eval" command without first being sanitized. The problem is  
caused by an underlying security issue in the Locale::Maketext CPAN  
module. This works only in TWiki sites that have user interface  
localization enabled.

In addition, there are two less severe issues with MAKETEXT:

2. Excessive memory allocation: %MAKETEXT{"This is [_9999999999999999]  
Evil"}% will consume all memory and swap space attempting to  
initialize all missing entries in the parameters array.

3. Crash: %MAKETEXT{"This is [_0] problematic"}% can cause a crash  
under some circumstances.

---++ Countermeasures

  * One of:
    * Disable localization by setting configure flag  
{UserInterfaceInternationalisation} to 0.
    * Apply hotfix (see patch below).
    * Upgrade to the latest patched production release TWiki-5.1.3  
(TWikiRelease05x01x03) [2] when available.

  * In addition:
    * Install CPAN's Locale::Maketext version 1.23 or newer.
    * Use the {SafeEnvPath} configure setting to restrict the possible  
directories that are searched for executables.  By default, this is  
the PATH used by the webserver user. Set {SafeEnvPath} to a list of  
non-writable directories, such as "/bin:/usr/bin".

This patch is also available separately [3] in case this gets mangled  
by the e-mail.

On a properly patched system, %MAKETEXT{" [_99] "}% should return this  
error: "MAKETEXT error: No more than 32 parameters are allowed"

---++ Hotfix for older affected TWiki Releases

Apply above patch (line numbers may vary).
