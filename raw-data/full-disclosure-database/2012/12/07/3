Subject: Re: XSS vulnerability in web applications with
	swfupload: AionWeb, Magento, Liferay Portal, SurgeMail, symfony

Hello list!

This is update to my advisory XSS vulnerability in web applications with 
swfupload: AionWeb, Magento, Liferay Portal, SurgeMail, symfony 
(http://securityvulns.ru/docs28761.html).

After my publication and after consulting with me concerning vulnerability 
in swfupload in Magento, representatives of eBay and Magento made an 
investigation. And they stated, that there is no swfupload in default bundle 
of Magento. I've gave them a link to web site on Magento with this 
vulnerability and after investigation they stated that it was user fault, 
who put swf-file to his site by himself.

Yesterday I've made my own investigation and found that situation is 
completely different. Yesterday I've updated information at my site and here 
is update for you.

This XSS hole is actually related to ExpressionEngine. Not to Magento, but 
to EE. And it's not site specific, because there are other sites with the 
same vulnerable swfupload in similar path (all on EE).

Confusion happened due to the fact, that the owner of the first site (where 
I've found swfupload) was using two CMS - Magento and EE, and the first 
admin panel which I've found (to identify CMS) was exactly Magento's one.

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/themes/cp_themes/default/images/swfupload_f9.swf?movieName=%22]);}catch(e){}if(!self.a)self.a=!alert(document.cookie);//

The beginning of the path can be different: some sites has it in root, i.e. 
/themes/, and that site has it in "cms" folder, i.e. /cms/themes/.

Note, that this vulnerability is available only on small amount of sites - 
i.e. it's some rare bundle of EE (not default). So you can replace in 
description of this vulnerability "Magento" to "ExpressionEngine".
