Subject: Nokia phone forcing traffic through proxy

It has been noticed that internet browsing traffic, instead of directly 
hitting requested server, is being redirected to proxy servers. They get redirected to Nokia/Ovi proxy servers if Nokia browser is used, and to 
Opera proxy servers if Opera Mini browser is used.
