The teams will try their hands at security assessment, vulnerabilities detection and exploitation as well as fulfilling reverse engineering tasks. The conditions of PHDays CTF Quals, as opposed to many other competitions of the kind, are brought as close to real life as possible: all the vulnerabilities are not fictional, but indeed occur on present-day information systems.

Time when Quals will be held: From 10 a.m. of the 15th of December till 10 a.m. of the 17th of December, 2012 (Moscow time).
