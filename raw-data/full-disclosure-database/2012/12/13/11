Subject: Re: Google's robots.txt handling

I restate my email's second point.

Google is indexing robots.txt because (from all the examples I can see) robots.txt doesn't contain a line to disallow indexing of robots.txt

It is possible that some web sites provide actual content in a file that happens to be called robots.txt (e.g a website concerned with AI development).

Could Google do better by removing the file? Sure. But as webmasters haven't told them not to, even though they have provided other files not to index, Google is doing exactly what they were asked.

Maybe the R.E.S. should state that a valid robots.txt should not be indexed.

Incidentally Bing shows the same behaviour - in fact the Google file is the 4th hit even without any of the file type classifiers.

That way google doesn't make you a goole dork target and someone browsing to your robots.txt file doesn't glean any sensitive files or folders. But this will not stop directory bruting to discover your publicly exposed sensitive data, that probably should not be exposed to the web in the first place.
