Webmasters don't have to in the US - the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
(CFAA) means Google (et al) must operate within the authority granted
by the webmasters. If that means the webmasters decide they don't want
their site crawled, then Google (et al) has exceeded its authority and
broken US Federal law. Just ask Weev.
