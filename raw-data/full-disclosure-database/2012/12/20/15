Subject: XSS and CS vulnerabilities in BuddyPress for
	WordPress

Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple security vulnerabilities in plugin 
BuddyPress for WordPress. I've disclosed vulnerabilities in JW Player in 
June and August (including in commercial version JW Player Pro) and 
disclosed vulnerabilities in Rokbox in December. And BuddyPress uses this 
software, so it has the same vulnerabilities.

These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting and vulnerabilities. 
Different versions of BuddyPress use different versions of swf-files, but in 
total we have such installations of BuddyPress: with JWPlayer 5.5.1641, with 
JWPlayer 4.2.95, with Rokbox with JW Player 4.4.198 (in rt_affinity_wp 
theme). There are small amount of web sites with these swf-files, so it can 
be old versions or some rare versions of BuddyPress. There are many other 
vulnerabilities in this WP plugin and later I'll write about them.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are versions of BuddyPress with JWPlayer or with Rokbox with 
JWPlayer.

For JWPlayer 5.5.1641 the path is 
http://site/wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-themes/bp-default/jwplayer/player.swf

For JWPlayer 4.2.95 the path is 
http://site/wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-themes/file/player.swf

third-party theme) the path is

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-themes/bp-default/jwplayer/player.swf?playerready=alert(document.cookie)

In 5.x versions of JW Player there are this XSS and other vulnerabilities 
(http://securityvulns.ru/docs28176.html). In 4.x versions of JW Player there 
are only the next holes.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and 
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of 
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which 
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file 
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary 
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have 
crossdomain.xml.
