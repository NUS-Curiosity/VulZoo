Subject: Re: Question regarding script vulnerabilities

Personally I wouldn't equate a trustworthy host to mean they had 'bulletproof' servers. Even if it were possible its not the normal definition of trust.

In any case it's irrelevant - it's what you run that typically exposes your site to the most risk
