Subject: Re: MySQL (Linux) Database Privilege Elevation
	Zeroday Exploit

Hi all,

wrote some shitcode for mysql user&hash enumeration when having FILE 
privilege. surely you could do it with simple bash one-liner using 
mysql+grep+sed, but we're not going the easy way, right?

the first thought was "hey, what about changing root password directly 
in file user.MYD?" but then...

> prevents files such as /etc/passwd and database tables from being 
> destroyed.

anyway we have Nvidia cards and Hashcat.


Cheers,

Kai
