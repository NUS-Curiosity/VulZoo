	Information	disclosure

View online: http://drupal.org/node/1859282

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-173
  * Project: Nodewords: D6 Meta Tags [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-December-05
  * Security risk: Not critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to assign meta tags on Drupal 6 sites to aid with 3rd
party search indexing and sharing on social networks.

The module doesn't correctly filter node content when configured to
automatically generate descriptions meta tags from the node text. This lack
of filtering could allow some code, e.g. BBCode, to pass through unprocessed
and potentially display private or otherwise secret information, links, file
paths or other potentially sensitive details. The problem affects the normal
'description' meta tag along with the 'dc.description' and 'og:description'
meta tags, all of which used the same logic.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it is unlikely that
sensitive content would be within the extracted portion.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED  
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Nodewords 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.14.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Nodewords: D6
Meta Tags [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Nodewords module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Nodewords
    6.x-1.14 [5].

Also see the Nodewords: D6 Meta Tags [6] project page.
