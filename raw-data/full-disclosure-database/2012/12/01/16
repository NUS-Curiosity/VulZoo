Subject: Re: MySQL (Linux) Heap Based Overrun PoC Zeroday

Hi Kingcope,

# As seen below $edx and $edi are fully controlled,
# the current instruction is
# => 0x83a6b24 <free_root+180>:   mov    (%edx),%edi
# this means we landed in a place where 4 bytes can be controlled by 4 bytes
# with this function pointers and GOT entries can be rewritten to
execute arbritrary code

Out of curiosity, is this exploitable when using hardened toolchain
settings? Specifically, -z,noexecheap, -z,now, and -z,relro? For
no-exec heaps., you need to be on Gentoo or other platforms which
offer the remediation.
