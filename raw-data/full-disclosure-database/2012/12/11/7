Your point eludes me - Google is indexing something which is publicly
available. eg.:- curl http://somesite.tld/robots.txt
So it seems the solution to the "question" your raise is, um, nonsensical.

If you don't want something exposed on your web server *don't publish
references to it*.

The solution, which should be blindingly obvious,  is don't create the
problem in the first place. Password sensitive directories (htpasswd) -
then they don't have to be excluded from search engines (because listing
the inaccessible in robots.txt is redundant).  You must of missed the
first day of web school.

Kind regards.
