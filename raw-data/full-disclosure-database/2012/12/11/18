Subject: Re: Google's robot.txt handling

If you ask me, it's a stupid idea. :)

I prefer to know where I am with a service; and (IMHO) I would prefer to
query (occasionally) Google for my CC instead of waiting for someone to
start taking funds off it.
Hiding it only provides a false sense of security - it will last until
someone finds the service leaking out CCs.

This is especially the case with robots.txt. Can someone on the list please
define a "good web crawler"?
There's plenty of crawlers out there, most are relatively unknown.... how
will we know which to trust?

I think the problem here is that people are plain stupid and throw in
direct entries inside robots.txt, whereas they should be sending wildcard
entries.
Couple that with actually protecting sensitive areas, and it's a pretty
good defence.

On a side note, someone already said this, but I'll repeat it for effect:
don't thrown in anything on the Net which you're not prepared to protect.
If a control panel should
not be accessible to the general public, consider restricting access by IP
and similar measures. Even a personal certificate is a valid layer of
defence...


Chris.
