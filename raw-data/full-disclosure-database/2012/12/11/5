If we ignore the obvious security by obscurity aspect of this discussion, there are alternatives to putting "secret" paths in the robots.txt file. One is f.ex to tell your webserver to serve these "secret" paths with a X-robots-tag HTTP header, thus not exposing anything before it's actually been requested.
