Subject: Removing seless email addresses (on FD list)

John (Cartwright),


It is quite annoying to have a volley of bounce mail form
non-existent/(re)moved mailboxes.

Can't we somehow limit this? I recall in other newsgroups software, several
bounced(reply) emails to a periodic (monthly? bimonthly?) ping would
automatically retire the email in question (perhaps after a warning or
something such).


Kind regards,
Chris.
