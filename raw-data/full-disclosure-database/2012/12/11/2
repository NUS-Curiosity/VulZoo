Subject: Re: Google's robots.txt handling

This is not a strong argument. When you opt out of marketing companies store your email on a blacklist. It's necessary.

If the contents is publicly visible then it is not a good place to put such information you highlight below.

Moreover it only needs to be in robots.txt if its browsable. If its linked from inside your site, people could find it anyway. robots.txt would merely optimise that search.

In any case, I'm fairly confident robots.txt predates Google Search.
