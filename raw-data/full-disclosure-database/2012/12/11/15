Subject: Re: Google's robot.txt handling

I think we can all agree this is not a vulnerability. Still, I have yet to
see an argument saying why what the OP is proposing is a bad idea. It may
be a good idea to stop indexing robots.txt to mitigate the faults of lazy
or incompetent admins (Google already does this for many specific search
queries) and there's not much point in indexing the robots.txt file for
legitimate uses anyway.
