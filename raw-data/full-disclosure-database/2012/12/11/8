Coldwind is right, u r talking about security through obscurity.

If u tell a pentester that u r using joomla and php together, he/she
will try <yourwebsite>.com/administrator
 Since if u r ignorant and havent blocked access to it, your joomla
access page will show up and hydra/brutus will be able to take over
from there.
