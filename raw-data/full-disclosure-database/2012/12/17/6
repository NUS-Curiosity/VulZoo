Subject: IPv6 Neighbor Discovery security (new documents)

Folks,

We have published two documents related with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
security:

1) "Security Assessment of Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IPv6" (IETF
Internet-Draft). Available at:
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gont-opsec-ipv6-nd-security>

This document contains everything you may want to know about IPv6
Neighbor Discovery security, and more... :-)

Kudos to Marc Heuse, who collaborated in the publication of this document!


2) "Security/Robustness Assessment of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
Implementations". Available at:
<http://www.si6networks.com/tools/ipv6toolkit/si6networks-ipv6-nd-assessment.pdf>

This document describes how you can employ our IPv6 toolkit
(<http://www.si6networks.com/ipv6toolkit/>) to perform a number of
attacks against IPv6 Neighbor Discovery implementations, and contains
cross-reference to the IETF I-D mentioned above.

P.S.: If you are a vendor, I recommend you perform an assessment of your
implementation with respect to the identified issues.

Thanks!

Best regards,
