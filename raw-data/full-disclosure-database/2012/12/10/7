If no one would know about a folder, why would one add it to
robots.txt in the first place?
But that's missing the point anyway - robots.txt is not a security mechanism.
If someone uses robots.txt as the only and last line of defense he
plainly doesn't understand what he's doing (especially that it's one
of the first files both pentesters & attackers look at).

If someone has an /admin/ site (which is a really easily guessable
name, checked by every web directory scanner out there) he cannot rely
on concealment*, but on proper user authentication using mechanisms
designed for such purpose (e.g. requiring a password).

(* for historical reasons there is a Polish IT term for such attempts
- "deep hiding", there's even a wiki page on that -

1. It's still missing the point.
2. No, it wouldn't work in case of scanners that try to impersonate robots.
