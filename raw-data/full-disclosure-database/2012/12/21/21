ZDI-12-202 :  Oracle Outside In WordPerfect File Processing Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-202
December 21, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

- -- Affected Products:
Oracle Outside In


- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable products utilizing the Oracle Outside In technology. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of WordPerfect files. When
parsing font records the code within vswp5.dll does not validate the
datasize value prior to performing arithmetic on it. The result is used to
make a heap allocation
that can be undersized which can be leveraged to corrupt memory leading to
arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the
application.

- -- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
