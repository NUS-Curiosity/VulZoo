10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Groupwise. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the Groupwise Internet Agent component, specifically
the optional LDAP server which listens on tcp port 389. When parsing a BER
encoded parameter the specified size is used to allocate a destination
buffer. A properly encoded BER chunk could cause an integer size value to
wrap before buffer allocation. A remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM
account.

- -- Vendor Response:

Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
