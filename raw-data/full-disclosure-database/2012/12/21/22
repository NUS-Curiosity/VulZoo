- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Honeywell HMIWeb. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the ActiveX control defined within the
HSCDSPRenderDll.dll file. The RequestDSPLoad method does not properly
verify the length of a supplied argument before copying it into a
fixed-length heap buffer. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.
