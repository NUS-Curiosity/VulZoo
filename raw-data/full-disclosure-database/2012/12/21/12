- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari Webkit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the library's implementation of a HTMLMedia
element. After a source element is created, an attacker can catch the
beforeLoad event before the element is used, and delete the element. The
pointer to the source element will then be referenced causing a
use-after-free condition, which can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:
WebKit.Org has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
