Subject: Re: Paypal Core Bug Bounty #3 - Persistent Web
	Vulnerability

"Exactly how is the session hijacking/phishing/web content manipulation
_persistent_? Just because the payload is _stored_ does not necessarily
mean that is it always running. & [...]"

The stored context can be used by another user to find the person with the details to execute.
The first module when adding parses the context but does not change the tags or scripts.
The execution happens in a third module which is also located in the core functions. 
Low user interaction is required because you need to get in contact with the person by a accepted transaction (after it your are saved to the contacts)
or click a mail link. Only the accept or click is a low user interaction because nothing else was required.

"How is THAT a... I am miss"
Paypal allows to merge accounts and use it with multiple persons or companies. 
The addressbook is also synced and visible for all parties which are bound to the account.
The attack can be executed local in multiple accounts or after an transaction or add when processing to search the contact.
