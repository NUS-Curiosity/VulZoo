ZDI-12-188 : Microsoft Internet Explorer OnRowsInserted Event Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-188
December 21, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-1881

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

- -- Affected Products:
Microsoft Internet Explorer

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Internet Explorer handles
'onrowsinserted' callback functions for certain elements. It is possible to
alter the document DOM tree in a onrowsinserted callback function which can
lead to a use-after-free condition when the function returns. This can
result in remote code execution under the context of the current process.
