- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Word. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a PAPX FKP
sections. When parsing a PAPX FKP section, the application will store a
calculation. However, when repairing a damaged document, the application
will explicitly trust this calculation in a loop that is used to index into
an array of objects. This will allow for an out-of-bounds access of an
object which can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.
