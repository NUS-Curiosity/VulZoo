Subject: Recruiting Troopers - Call for Papers,
	March 13-14 2013

Once more, it will be Troopers time.


This year was an extraordinary event. Everybody involved had so much fun (in the end, the term "best security con. ever" got a bit overstressed ;-) and we had so many great talks... it seems quite difficult to do even better next year. Still, we'll try.
You can be part of it. Again, Troopers - www.troopers.de - will be held in the beautiful city of Heidelberg/Germany (on 03/13 and 03/14 2013) and will feature two tracks, one on attack techniques and security research, the other focused on the defense side and management aspects of the infosec world. You might look at http://www.troopers.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/TR11_Enno_Rey_Keynote_Day01.pdf to get an idea of the spirit of the event.


This call for papers addresses security researchers interested in sharing their work with other researchers and a high level audience (composed of about 60% people from industry, 20% from academia and another 20% from [research] community). We would like to invite everyone with special knowledge in breaking security in whatever area or practical experience in securing complex information systems to present their skills, tools or experience.


Speaker Privileges
==================

We will cover the flight costs (limited to EUR 750 for speakers from Europe and US$ 1800 for speakers from other continents) and three nights of accomodation, plus "some evening fun and other amenities". To get an idea of our speaker treatment see http://www.elladodelmal.com/2010/03/como-una-rockn-roll-star.html ;-)


"Fresh Headz"
=============

Given an appropriate subject and technical level we're happy to welcome "fresh speakers" (not seen in various places before) and we're happy to help you with setting up your talk (or getting over your pre-talk excitement).



Submissions
===========

We are mainly interested in talks on

Security in a Mobile World
Virtualization & Cloud Stuff
Embedded Devices
Industrial Networking
Security in Telco Environments
Secure Coding & Advances in the Software Security Space
Feasible Risk Assessment Approaches
Digital Certificates in 2013
IPv6


Obviously heavy vendor-pitching will not be welcomed warmly and we reserve the right to ask for modifications of confirmed talks if we have the impression there's too much of that in a talk. 


CFP submissions [to cfp@...opers.de or/and simply reply to this mail] must include the following information: 

1) Brief biography including list of publications and papers published previously. 

2) Proposed presentation title & synopsis/description.

3) Contact Information (full name, alias, handle, e-mail, postal address, phone, country of origin, special meal requirement, smoking habits ;-).

4) Employment and/or affiliations information. 
 
5) Why is your material different or innovative or significant?

Please note that all speakers will be allocated 55 minutes of presentation time + 5 minutes Q+A. Any speakers that require more time must inform the CFP committee in the course of the submission.
