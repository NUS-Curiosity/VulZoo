Subject: CubeCart 3.0.20 (3.0.x) and lower | Arbitrary
	File Upload

1. OVERVIEW

CubeCart 3.0.20 and lower versions are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload.


2. BACKGROUND

CubeCart is an "out of the box" ecommerce shopping cart software
solution which has been written to run on servers that have PHP &
MySQL support. With CubeCart you can quickly setup a powerful online
store which can be used to sell digital or tangible products to new
and existing customers all over the world.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

CubeCart 3.0.20 and lower versions contain a flaw related to the
/admin/filemanager/upload.php script's failure to properly validate
uploaded files. This may allow a remote attacker to upload arbitrary
files and execute arbitrary code via a request to the 'atm-regen'
parameter.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

3.0.20 and lower (aka 3.0.x family)


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

Set content type to image/jpeg and upload.
Uploaded files are stored at images/uploads.
