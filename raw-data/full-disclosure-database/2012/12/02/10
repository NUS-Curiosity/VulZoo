Finally (sort of) an answer of the developers:

"Yes, we have responsibility, but no enough time to make a new
release. ... This failure will never used by real hackers because it's
better to found something in Acrobat or other wildspread soft. ... So
stop crying, kiddy."

Conclusion: Better think twice before using a software from developers
like this. There are alternatives to EasyPHP.

And a hint to interested fellow researchers, there is much more
"failure" in EasyPHP, but we "stop crying", for now...
