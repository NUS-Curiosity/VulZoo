Subject: Re: MySQL (Linux) Heap Based Overrun PoC Zeroday

When you look into the heap and stack overrun the first obstacle to
exploit the bugs is that MySQL does not allow all plain 0 to 255
characters, this means the exploiter would have to use unicode
translation in order to exploit the bugs (therefore these are PoCs
only by now). If the exploiter managed to execute code on default
installs without your mentioned protections it might be possible to
circumvent them, to be honest I didn't have a look into these
optimizations and protections, it's hard enough to exploit it without
these restrictions applied.
