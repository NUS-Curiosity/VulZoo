Please read the full email.
"However you should have a
look at the code below, it compiles with libssh 0.4.5. You need to
provide a valid login to the SSH server.

This vulnerability says long about the seriousness of this application.
I will probably find more in future if I find time to reverse it."

Please also read the attached .c code. It auths on the server with a buggous
password then tries to open a channel anyway. Note also that this exploit 
does not work if FreeSSHD uses Windows authentication (with system users) 
because it uses a different codepath. Neither does kcope's one.

I'm afraid I missed the similar vulnerability on Tectia's server :(
