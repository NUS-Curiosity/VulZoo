Subject: Merry Christmas

Yes yes, its this time of the year again, everybody going nuts and weather is shite...

And to share this special time of the year with my beloved Full Disclosure, I dedicate this short spam for you ;)

Enjoy the holidays and I hope I see some of you at the 29th C3 in Hamburg, Germany!

Merry Christmas and a happy new year!
