Subject: LulzSec $ Sabu - lessons learned

Hello,
My two cents to lessons learned:
- If FBI is hacked, CIA will LOL
- if CIA is hacked, FBI will LOL
- if DoD is hacked both FBI and CIA will LOL
But if Stratfor is hacked, all three guys get very serious, guess why?

If you do serious hacking, do not brag and do not do stupid hacks.

Mikhail
