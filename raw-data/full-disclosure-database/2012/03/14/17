Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-037 - Slidebox -
	access bypass

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-037
  * Project: Slidebox [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-14
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Slidebox [3] module allows webmasters do display a link to the next node
in a jQuery box that slides in from the right side of the page after a user
scrolls past a certain point.

While the module checks for "published" status, the module does not contain
sufficient usage of node_access() to prevent users from accessing content
that they do not have proper permission to access (for example, nodes or node
types that have been protected via an access control module).

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Slidebox 7.x-1.x versions prior to and including 7.x-1.3.
  * Slidebox 7.x-2.x-dev

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Slidebox [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Slidebox module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Slidebox 7.x-1.4
    [5]

See also the Slidebox [6] project page.
