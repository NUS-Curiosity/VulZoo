	Modules Unsupported

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-036
  * Projects: Content Lock [1], Ubercart Bulk Stock Updater [2], Ubercart
    Payflow Link [3], ticketyboo News Ticker [4], Admin tools [5], Redirecting
    click bouncer [6] (third-party modules)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-14
  * Security risk: Critical [7]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Content Lock [8] Is a module that prevents users from concurrent editing of
nodes. This module does not use a token for unlocking a content lock. This
leads to a CSRF attack vector. Ubercart Bulk Stock Updater [9] is an
extension module for Ubercart 2.x running on Drupal 6.x which makes it easy
to bulk-edit product stock levels. This module does not properly use the
formAPI and this results in a CSRF attack vector. Ubercart Payflow Link [10]
is a payment solution for ubercart provided by PayPal. This module does not
use a secure token and thus could allow payments to be forged. ticketyboo
News Ticker [11]is a module that lets you configure three separate news
tickers as Drupal Blocks. This module does not filter output correctly
leading to a XSS attack vector. It may also have a SQL injection vector.
Admin tools [12] This package will contain a complete set of tools for
managing several drupal installs. This module does not properly filter text
leading to a XSS attack vector, as well as not checking tokens leading to a
CSRF attack vector. Redirecting click bouncer [13], is a module that lets you
create links to a target that simply redirects to the real destination. The
redirect happens server-side which means that we can track the redirects.
This comes handy when we have links in our site and we need to know when they
are clicked. This module does not check the URL to redirect to, this create
an open redirect.
