I could imagine applications which accept ping interval and do not
filter it. That's a class of application which would not be affected
by a fork bomb (since they do not allow execution of arbitrary
commands), but would be affect by this (as long as the user is allowed
to alter the ping interval).

But yes, it seems like a fairly small affected class of applications.
Fun hole though, and no sense in leaving it unpatched.
