	Language Switcher Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-038
  * Project: Views Language Switcher [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-14
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Views Language Switcher module enables you to provide natively-formatted
links that act as Views exposed filters for i18n content being displayed by
Views.
The module doesn't sufficiently filter the path output when a user manually
modifies the path and makes a new request.
This vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Views Language Switcher 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Views Language
Switcher [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Views Language Switcher module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to
    Views Language Switcher 7.x-1.2 [4]

See also the Views Language Switcher [5] project page.
