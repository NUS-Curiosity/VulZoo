Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-039 - Language
	Icons - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-039
  * Project: Language icons [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-14
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Language icons module adds icons to language links generated by the
Locale and Content Translation modules in core.
The module does not sanitize some of the user-supplied data before displaying
it, leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS [3]) vulnerability. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with
the permission "administer languages".

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Language icons 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.1.
  * Language icons 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.0.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Language icons
[4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Language icons module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Language
    icons 6.x-2.1 [5]
  * If you use the Language icons module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Language
    icons 7.x-1.0 [6]
