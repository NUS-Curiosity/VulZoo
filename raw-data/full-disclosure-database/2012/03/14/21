 [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-040 - CKEditor and FCKeditor -	multiple XSS, arbitrary code execution

<pre>FYI, this bug was recently fixed by the CKEditor Developers, as the
bug itself was in the CKEditor module, not Drupal. (They just use it like
everyone else.)<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IbRbx.jpg" alt=""

&gt; * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-040
&gt;   * Project: CKEditor [1], FCKeditor [2] - WYSIWYG HTML editor
(third-party
&gt;     module)
&gt;   * Version: 6.x, 7.x
&gt;   * Date: 2012-March-14
&gt;   * Security risk: Highly critical [3]
&gt;   * Exploitable from: Remote
&gt;   * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery,
&gt;   Arbitrary
&gt;     PHP code execution
&gt; 
&gt; -------- DESCRIPTION  
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; CKEditor and its predecessor FCKeditor allow Drupal to replace
textarea
&gt; fields with the (F)CKEditor - a visual HTML WYSIWYG editor.
&gt; 
&gt; The modules have an AJAX callback that filters text to prevent Cross
site
&gt; scripting attacks on content edits. This AJAX callback function
contains a
&gt; number of bugs which allow attackers to chose which filter to execute
on
&gt; chosen text or bypass the filter entirely.
&gt; 
&gt; The vulnerability can be used to conduct Cross site scripting (XSS)
attacks
&gt; on privileged users. Attackers can also execute arbitrary PHP code if
the
&gt; core PHP module is enabled. This can happen either directly or by
enticing
&gt; a
&gt; privileged user to visit a page.
&gt; 
&gt; Direct execution of PHP code requires that the attacker has the
following
&gt; privileges:
&gt; 
&gt; "access fckeditor" for FCKeditor 6.x
&gt; "access ckeditor" for CKEditor 6.x
&gt; 
&gt; No additional permissions are required to directly exploit the PHP
code
&gt; execution flaw on CKEditor 7.x.
&gt; 
&gt; -------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt;   * FCKeditor 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.3.
&gt;   * CKEditor 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.9.
&gt;   * CKEditor 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.7.
&gt; 
&gt; Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed
CKEditor -
&gt; WYSIWYG HTML editor [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.
&gt; 
&gt; -------- SOLUTION  
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Install the latest version:
&gt; 
&gt;   * If you use the FCKeditor module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to
FCKeditor
&gt;     6.x-2.3 [5].
&gt;   * If you use the CKEditor module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to
CKEditor
&gt;   6.x-1.9
&gt;     [6].
&gt;   * If you use the CKEditor module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to
CKEditor
&gt;   7.x-1.7
&gt;     [7].
&gt; 
&gt; See also the CKEditor - WYSIWYG HTML editor [8] project page.
