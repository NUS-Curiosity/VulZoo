Subject: Why a Computer Programming *History* Class is
	Needed Re: The Mystery of the Duqu Framework

It is not a framework, but a style. A struct with function pointers is
essentially a class.  Someone already pointed out that the binary code
was generated by MS C compiler. Try a web search for "Object-Oriented
ANSI C". 

During the old days, the OO style C was quite common in MS Windows SDK
Win32 API samples.
