Introduction:
=============
LDAP Account Manager Pro is an extended version of LAM which focuses on enterprise usage. It helps you to lower your 
administration costs by providing enhanced tools for your users and deskside support staff.
Features LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored 
in an LDAP directory. LAM was designed to make LDAP management as easy as possible for the user. It abstracts from the 
technical details of LDAP and allows persons without technical background to manage LDAP entries. If needed, power 
users may still directly edit LDAP entries via the integrated LDAP browser.

Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability-Lab Team  discovered multiple web vulnerabilities on LDAPs Account Manager Pro v3.6.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-02-22:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Open Source
Product: LDAP Account Manager Pro (lamp) v3.6


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistant input validation vulnerabilities are detected  on LDAPs Account Manager Pro v3.6.
The bug allows remote attacker to implement malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate modules/context (persistent) & can 
lead to session hijacking (user/mod/admin).

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] User Listing & List Input/Output
					[+] Export


Picture(s):
					../1.png
					../2.png

1.2
Multiple client-side Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities are detected  on LDAPs Account Manager Pro v3.6.
The bug allows remote attacker hijack customer/admin sessions with medium required user inter action. 
Successful exploitation leads to session hijacking or client side module manipulation attacks and the result 
is account steal.

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] &attr=
					[+] Filter- Search & Listing


Picture(s):

					../4.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with low & high required user inter action. 
For demonstration or reproduce ...
