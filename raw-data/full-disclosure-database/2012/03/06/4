Subject: Cookie based SQL Injection

All data sent by the browser to a Web application, if used in a SQL query, can be manipulated in order to inject SQL code: GET and POST parameters, cookies and other HTTP headers. Some of these values ​​can be found in the environment variables. The GET and POST parameters are typically entered into HTML forms, they can contain hidden fields, i.e. information that is in form but not shown. GET parameters are contained in the URL and POST parameters are passed as HTTP content. Nowadays, and with the growth of Web 2.0 technologies, the GET and POST requests can also be generated by JavaScript.

Injecting malicious code in cookie:

Unlike other parameters, cookies are not supposed to be handled by users. Outside of session cookies which are (usually) random, cookies may contain data in clear or encoded in hexadecimal, base64, hashes (MD5, SHA1), serialized information. If we can determine the encoding used, we will attempt to inject SQL commands. Read more about the technique here:
