Hi Zach!

Yes, it's also a vulnerability. It's Abuse of Functionality, which allows to enumerate logins. And during 2008-2011 I've wrote about all existent Login enumerations and Login leakages in WordPress (including this one). And also in many other web applications. Such vulnerabilities are also widespread like BF, but less then BF. I've found many web sites and web applications, where there was BF, but no Login enumerations or Login leakages. So they are less widespread, but also ignored by developers, even more then BF holes.

Knowing logins is vital for Brute Force attacks and if logins are hidden it's not just 50% more secure (as some developers like to say about 50% less secure with leaked logins), but it's make BF almost impossible. Because with unknowing logins it'll be needed to pick up passwords blindly (with using of common logins), which will be unsuccessful in 99% cases. But there are web applications where logins are not needed - it's webapps with only one password field (there were many such webapps in 90-s and first part of 2000-s) and with fixed login (which is the same as only one password field), like Adobe ColdFusion, about this and other holes I've wrote last year.

Best wishes & regards,

  He also considers it a vulnerability to tell a new user that the username they've picked out has been taken by another user.

    Same type of vulnerabilities exist in 99,999...% of all web applications
    including your website. Even if you can't bruteforce all the time, you can
    adjust it with timing, and e.g., proxies, different user-agents, etc., and
    then you have "Timed Bruteforce Attacks" which works on pretty much all
    websites. Did you also mention this 5-10 years ago on your web site about
    website security named websitesecurity.com.ua?

    Also, when will you stop posting about: bruteforce/full path
    disclosure/locking actual users out/and other low priority
    "vulnerabilities" that exist in most web apps, and completely move on to
    vulnerabilities that matters? Seriously, anyone can find these
    "vulnerabilities" and the reason why anyone hasn't reported / disclosed /
    complained about them is because they exist in most apps and doesn't
    compromise the security of the end-user nor the website.

    Will the next thing you disclose be about bruteforcing SSH because it by
    default doesn't lock users out? It's been like this for +10 or +20 years.


    What I find funny is that either you:
    A) Say a web app has a vulnerability because it doesn't lock the
    "offending" user out because of too many password tries, OR
    B) Say a web app has a vulnerability because it does lock out the
    offending user because of too many password tries.

    It's almost a contradiction and an endless evil circle. You can't have
    both, ever.


    No offense intended of course.
