Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Command Authorization Bypass

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120328-pai

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 March 28 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in the Cisco IOS Software that may allow a
remote application or device to exceed its authorization level when
authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) authorization is
used. This vulnerability requires that the HTTP or HTTPS server is
enabled on the Cisco IOS device.

Products that are not running Cisco IOS Software are not vulnerable.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. 

The HTTP server may be disabled as a workaround for the vulnerability
described in this advisory.

This advisory is available at the following link:
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120328-pai

Note: The March 28, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes nine Cisco Security Advisories. Each
advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as
the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in
the March 2012 bundled publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response:
Semi-Annual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication"
at the following link:

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Any device running Cisco IOS Software release after 12.2 that has an
HTTP or HTTPS server configured is affected by this vulnerability if
AAA authorization is used. 
To determine if an HTTP or HTTP server is configured with an HTTP or
HTTPS server, issue the show ip http server status | include status
command. The following example illustrates a Cisco IOS device with an
HTTPS server enabled and the HTTP server disabled.

    Router> show ip http server status | include status
     HTTP server status: Disabled
     HTTP secure server status: Enabled

To determine if AAA authorization is used, an administrator can log
in to the device and issue the show run | include aaa authorization
command in privileged EXEC mode. If there is an entry that shows aaa
authorization commands, as shown in the following example, then AAA
authorization is configured.

    Router# show run | include aaa authorization commands
     aaa authorization commands 0 default local group tacacs+
     aaa authorization commands 1 default group tacacs+
     aaa authorization commands 15 default local

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
show version command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

Router> show version 
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

If you are not running Cisco IOS or IOS XE software, you are not
affected by this vulnerability. Devices that are not using AAA
authorization or that do not have an HTTP or HTTPS server configured
are not affected by this vulnerability. 

Cisco IOS XR is not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco IOS allows remote applications to administer and monitor
devices running Cisco IOS Software over an HTTP or HTTPS connection. 

A vulnerability exists that may allow the Cisco IOS command
authorization to be bypassed, allowing a remote, authenticated HTTP
or HTTPS session to execute any Cisco IOS command that is configured
for their authorization level. This vulnerability does not allow
unauthenticated access; a valid username and password are required to
successfully exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the
vulnerability does not allow a user to execute commands that are not
configured for their privilege level.

The HTTP server is enabled by default for cluster configurations and
on the following Cisco switches: Catalyst 3700 series, Catalyst 3750
series, Catalyst 3550 series, Catalyst 3560 series, and Catalyst 2950
series.

More information on AAA authorization can be found at: 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/secure/command/reference/sftauth.html

Releases of Cisco IOS Software after release 12.2 are potentially
vulnerable. Please refer to the release table below for more
information.

This vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID CSCtr91106 
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID 
CVE-2012-0384.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has scored the vulnerability in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this
security advisory is in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps organizations determine the urgency and priority
of a response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can also
compute environmental scores that help determine the impact of the
vulnerability in their own networks.

Cisco has provided additional information regarding CVSS at the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at the following link:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* Command Authorization Fails for commands delivered over HTTP

CVSS Base Score - 8.5
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Medium
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         Complete
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 7.0
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow the Cisco IOS
command authorization to be bypassed, allowing a remote,
authenticated HTTP or HTTPS session to execute any Cisco IOS command
that is configured for its authorization level.

Workarounds
===========

If the HTTP and HTTPS servers are not required, they may be disabled
with the commands no ip http server and no ip http secure-server.

However, if web services are required, a feature was introduced in
12.3(14)T and later in which selective HTTP and HTTPS services could
be enabled or disabled. The WEB_EXEC service provides a facility to
configure the device and retrieve the current state of the device
from remote clients.

It is possible to disable the WEB_EXEC service while still leaving
other HTTP services active. If an installation does not require the
use of the WEB_EXEC service, then it may be disabled using the
following procedure:

 1. Verify the list of all session modules.
        Router# show ip http server session-module
        HTTP server application session modules:
        Session module Name  Handle Status   Secure-status  Description
        HTTP_IFS              1      Active   Active         HTTP based IOS File Server
        HOME_PAGE             2      Active   Active         IOS Homepage Server
        QDM                   3      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Server
        QDM_SA                4      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Signed Applet Server
        WEB_EXEC              5      Active   Active         HTTP based IOS EXEC Server
        IXI                   6      Active   Active         IOS XML Infra Application Server
        IDCONF                7      Active   Active         IDCONF HTTP(S) Server
        XSM                   8      Active   Active         XML Session Manager
        VDM                   9      Active   Active         VPN Device Manager Server
        XML_Api               10     Active   Active         XML Api
        ITS                   11     Active   Active         IOS Telephony Service
        ITS_LOCDIR            12     Active   Active         ITS Local Directory Search
        CME_SERVICE_URL       13     Active   Active         CME Service URL
        CME_AUTH_SRV_LOGIN    14     Active   Active         CME Authentication Server
        IPS_SDEE              15     Active   Active         IOS IPS SDEE Server
        tti-petitioner        16     Active   Active         TTI Petitioner
 2. Create a list of session modules that are required, in this
    example it would be everything other than WEB_EXEC.
        Router# configuration terminal
        Router(config)# ip http session-module-list exclude_webexec 
        
        HTTP_IFS,HOME_PAGE,QDM,QDM_SA,IXI,IDCONF,XSM,VDM,XML_Api,
        ITS,ITS_LOCDIR,CME_SERVICE_URL,CME_AUTH_SRV_LOGIN,IPS_SDEE,tti-petitioner
 3. Selectively enable HTTP/HTTPS applications that will service
    incoming HTTP requests from remote clients.
        Router(config)# ip http active-session-modules exclude_webexec
        Router(config)# ip http secure-active-session-modules exclude_webexec
        Router(config)# exit
 4. Verify the list of all session modules, and ensure WEB_EXEC is
    not active.
        Router# show ip http server session-module 
        HTTP server application session modules: 
        Session module Name  Handle Status   Secure-status  Description 
        HTTP_IFS              1      Active   Active         HTTP based IOS File Server 
        HOME_PAGE             2      Active   Active         IOS Homepage Server 
        QDM                   3      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Server 
        QDM_SA                4      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Signed Applet Server 
        WEB_EXEC              5      Inactive Inactive       HTTP based IOS EXEC Server 
        IXI                   6      Active   Active         IOS XML Infra Application Server 
        IDCONF                7      Active   Active         IDCONF HTTP(S) Server 
        XSM                   8      Active   Active         XML Session Manager 
        VDM                   9      Active   Active         VPN Device Manager Server 
        XML_Api               10     Active   Active         XML Api 
        ITS                   11     Active   Active         IOS Telephony Service 
        ITS_LOCDIR            12     Active   Active         ITS Local Directory Search 
        CME_SERVICE_URL       13     Active   Active         CME Service URL 
        CME_AUTH_SRV_LOGIN    14     Active   Active         CME Authentication Server 
        IPS_SDEE              15     Active   Active         IOS IPS SDEE Server 
        tti-petitioner        16     Active   Active         TTI Petitioner 

For further information on the selective enabling of applications
using an HTTP or secure HTTP server, consult the Cisco IOS network
management configuration guide, release 12.4T, at: 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netmgmt/configuration/guide/nm_http_app_enable.html

If the HTTP server and WEB_EXEC service are required, it is a
recommended best practice to limit which hosts may access the HTTP
server to allow only trusted sources. An access list can be applied
to the HTTP server to limit which hosts are permitted access. To
apply an access list to the HTTP server, use the following command in
global configuration mode: ip http access-class {access-list-number |
access-list-name}.

The following example shows an access list that allows only trusted
hosts to access the Cisco IOS HTTP server:

    ip access-list standard 20
         permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
         remark "Above is a trusted subnet"
         remark "Add further trusted subnets or hosts below"
        
    ! (Note: all other access implicitly denied) 
    ! (Apply the access-list to the http server)
    
         ip http access-class 20

For additional information on configuring the Cisco IOS HTTP server,
consult Using the Cisco Web Browser User Interface.
