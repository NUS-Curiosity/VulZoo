Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-043 - MultiBlock
	- Cross Site	Scripting

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-0XX
  * Project: MultiBlock [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The MultiBlock module allows an administrator to create multiple instances of
blocks provided by other modules. The module does not properly sanitize the
block title provided by a block administrator, leading to a cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Such an attack may lead to a malicious user
gaining full administrative access. A user must have a role with the
permission 'administer blocks' to exploit this vulnerability.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * MultiBlock 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.4.
  * MultiBlock 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed MultiBlock [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the MultiBlock module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to MultiBlock
    6.x-1.4 [4]
  * If you use the MultiBlock module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to MultiBlock
    7.x-1.1 [5]

Also see the MultiBlock [6] project page.
