Or clamp down even further using SELinux, which can get you to the
point of "only /usr/bin/httpd can read this file".  Combine this with
"only the init process can launch httpd", and it gets pretty hard for
an attacker to get at the passwords without a complete system
compromise.

(Yes, it's still vulnerable to "exploit allows running arbitrary code
in the httpd process's context" and similar. I *said* "pretty hard",
not "impossible" ;)
