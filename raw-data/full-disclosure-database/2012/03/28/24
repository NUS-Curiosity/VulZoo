Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-047 - Ubercart
	Views - Information	disclosure

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-047
  * Project: Ubercart Views [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Ubercart Views provides Views integration for the Ubercart shopping cart
module, and includes default views that contain a critical information
disclosure bug. In some versions, these views are disabled by default, but
still disclose information if you enable them.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

All versions of Ubercart Views for Drupal 6.x prior to 6.x-3.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Ubercart Views
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Ubercart Views module for Drupal 6.x upgrade to Ubercart
    Views 6.x-3.2 [4]

After installing, if you have enabled or previously edited the "orders" or
"order_management" views, you must either revert these views to their default
settings, or edit the "access" settings for these views and ensure that all
displays require the "view all orders" permission.

Also see the Ubercart Views [5] project page.
