Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-045 - AddToAny -
	Cross Site	Scripting

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-045
  * Project: Share Buttons (AddToAny) by Lockerz [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to add Lockerz/AddToAny's universal sharing buttons
to your site.
Previously, the module did not sanitize some of the user-supplied data before
displaying it, leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer addtoany".

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * 6.x-3.x versions prior to 6.x-3.4 [3]

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Share Buttons
(AddToAny) by Lockerz [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Lockerz/AddToAny module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to version
    6.x-3.4

Also see the Share Buttons (AddToAny) by Lockerz [5] project page.
