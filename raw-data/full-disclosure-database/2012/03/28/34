Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-055 - Fusion
	theme - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-055
  * Project: Fusion [1] (third-party theme)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Fusion is a base theme that provides a configurable grid system and modular
styling for common Drupal UI components.

The theme outputs a CSS class for the tag based on the current URL, but does
not provide sufficient filtering to prevent a Cross site scripting (XSS)
attack.

This vulnerability affects all sub-themes of Fusion.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Fusion 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.13

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Fusion [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

If you utilize Fusion or a Fusion-based theme, you should upgrade to Fusion
6.x-1.13 [4].

  * Most Fusion sub-themes will inherit this fix.
  * If you copied code from Fusion core's template.php file into a custom
    sub-theme's template.php file you should compare your code to the changes
    made in this release to ensure the vulnerability has not been duplicated.
    In YOURTHEME_preprocess_page() look for this code:
    $vars['body_id'] = 'pid-' . strtolower(preg_replace('/[_+\/]/', '-',
    drupal_get_path_alias($_GET['q'])));

    If this code exists within your sub-theme, there are two possible
    solutions:

     1) *Recommended:* Delete the line of code. It is unnecessary in your
        sub-theme since the sub-theme will inherit this functionality from
        Fusion Core
     2) Replace the code with the following:
        $vars['body_id'] = 'pid-' .

strtolower(fusion_core_clean_css_identifier(drupal_get_path_alias($_GET['q'])));

        fusion_core_clean_css_identifier() is a function added in this
        security release of Fusion. Making this change to your sub-theme's
        code without updating Fusion core will result in a WSOD.
