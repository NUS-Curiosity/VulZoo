Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software
Traffic Optimization Features

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120328-mace

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 March 28 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS Software contains a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability
in the Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature that
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the router
to leak memory or to reload.

Cisco IOS Software also contains a DoS vulnerability in the
Measurement, Aggregation, and Correlation Engine (MACE) feature that
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the router
to reload.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending transit
traffic through a router configured with WAAS Express or MACE.
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the router to leak memory
or to reload. Repeated exploits could allow a sustained DoS
condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120328-mace


Note: The March 28, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes nine Cisco Security Advisories. Each
advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as
the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in
the March 2012 bundled publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response:
Semi-Annual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication"
at the following link:

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable
when they are configured with the "mace enable" or "waas enable"
interface configuration commands on one or more interfaces. Additional
configuration is required for WAAS Express or MACE to be configured;
more details follow.

Note: Cisco IOS Software is vulnerable only when configured for WAAS
Express or MACE. Cisco IOS Software configured for WAAS, not WAAS
Express, is not vulnerable.

For more information on WAAS Express, see
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps11211/index.html.
For more information about MACE, see
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/netmgtsw/ps11709/ps11671/guide_c07-664643.html.


To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco
product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the "show
version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco
IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by
"Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices
do not have the "show version" command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

Router> show version 
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release
naming conventions is available in "White Paper:
Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature allows
optimization of the WAN bandwidth required to access centrally located
applications. WAAS Express allows the traffic to be optimized by a Cisco
Integrated Services Router (ISR G2), with no other devices required.

The Cisco Measurement, Aggregation, and Correlation Engine (MACE) is a
Cisco IOS feature that is used for measurement and analysis of network
traffic. The feature may be used with WAAS Express to give details
of optimized traffic or used by itself to help measure application
performance.

Cisco IOS Software contains a DoS vulnerability in the WAAS Express
feature that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
the router to leak memory or to reload. This vulnerability is documented
in Cisco bug ID CSCtt45381 and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-1314.

Cisco IOS Software contains a DoS vulnerability in the MACE feature that
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the router to
reload. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCtq64987 and
CSCtu57226 and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-1312.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending transit
traffic through a router configured with WAAS Express or MACE.
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the router to leak memory
or to reload. Repeated exploits could allow a sustained DoS
condition.

A configuration similar to one or more of the following configuration
excerpts will exist if WAAS Express or MACE is configured on the
router.

The following example shows a partial WAAS Express configuration:

parameter-map type waas waas_global
 tfo optimize full
class-map type waas match-any HTTP
 match tcp destination port 80
class-map type waas match-any NNTP
 match  tcp destination port 119
 ...
policy-map type waas waas_global
 class HTTP
  optimize tfo dre lz application Web
 class NNTP
  optimize tfo dre lz application Email-and-Messaging
 ...
interface <egress interface>
 waas enable

The following example shows a partial MACE configuration with WAAS
Express already configured as shown in the preceding excerpt:

flow record type mace my-flow-record
 collect art all
flow exporter my-flow-exporter
 export-protocol netflow-v9
 destination 10.101.200.1
flow monitor type mace my-flow-monitor
 record my-flow-record
 exporter my-flow-exporter
mace monitor waas all my-flow-monitor
interface <egress interface>
 mace enable

The following example shows a partial MACE configuration without WAAS
Express:

flow record type mace mace-flow-record
 collect datalink mac source address input
 collect ipv4 dscp
 collect interface input
 collect interface output
 collect application name
 collect waas all
flow exporter flow-exporter1
 destination 10.101.200.1
 source <interface>
 output-features
 transport udp 32001
flow monitor type mace mace-flow-monitor1
 record mace-flow-record
 exporter flow-exporter1
class-map type waas match-any HTTP
 match  tcp destination port 80
 match  tcp destination port 8080
 ...
policy-map type mace mace_global
 class HTTP
  flow monitor mace-flow-monitor1
 ...
interface <egress interface>
 mace enable

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================
