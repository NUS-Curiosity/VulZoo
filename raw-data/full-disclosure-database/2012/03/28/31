Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-054 - Chaos tool
	suite - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-054
  * Project: Chaos tool suite (ctools) [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This suite is primarily a set of APIs and tools to improve the developer
experience. It also contains a module called the Page Manager whose job is to
manage pages. In particular it manages panel pages, but as it grows it will
be able to manage far more than just Panels.

The module doesn't appropriate filter user signatures when rendering
comments.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "post comments" and a site must use Chaos tool suite to
render comments.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Chaos tool suite 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.0.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Chaos tool
suite (ctools) [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Chaos tool suite module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Chaos
    tool suite 7.x-1.0 [4]

Also see the Chaos tool suite (ctools) [5] project page.
