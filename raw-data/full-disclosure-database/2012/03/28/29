	- Unsupported

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-050
  * Project: CDN2 Video [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

CDN2 is a plug and play module and video management service for Drupal.
The module does not sanitize output correctly, allowing for a cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Additionally, the Form API is not correctly
utilized allowing for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attempts.

This module relies on a backend service that is no longer active therefore
the project is unsupported.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

All versions are affected.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed CDN2 Video [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Uninstall the module. This module is no longer supported.

Also see the CDN2 Video [4] project page.
