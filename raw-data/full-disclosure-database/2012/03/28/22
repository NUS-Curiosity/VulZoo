Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-044 - Contact
	Forms - Cross Site	Scripting

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-044
  * Project: Contact Forms [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module expands the features of the site wide contact form. It eliminates
the drop down category menu by generating a clean looking contact form with a
unique path, for each of the contact form categories.

The module doesn't sufficiently filter user text of the page title and
additional information, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer site-wide contact form" and the core contact
form needs to be enabled.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Contact forms 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.13 [3].

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Contact Forms
[4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Contact Forms module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to 6.x-1.13
    [5]

Also see the Contact Forms [6] project page.
