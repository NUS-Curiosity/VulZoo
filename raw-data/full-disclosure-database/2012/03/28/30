Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-053 - Organic
	Groups - Access Bypass

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-053
  * Project: Organic groups [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

Organic groups (OG) enables users to create and manage their own 'groups'.
Each group can have subscribers, and maintains a group home page where
subscribers communicate amongst themselves.

The module's Views integration does not filter out information from display
groups to which the current user does not have access, exposing private group
titles and the fact that the content is associated with the group.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Organic Groups 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Organic groups
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Organic Groups module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Organic
    Groups 6.x-2.3 [4]

Also see the Organic groups [5] project page.
