Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-049 - ShareThis -
	Multiple	Vulnerablies

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-049
  * Project: ShareThis [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-28
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The ShareThis module allows you to display social networking tools to users.

The administration forms of the module do not properly use the Form API
allowing a malicious user to inject unexpected settings, allowing for
cross-site scripting attacks (XSS). Additionally, the module had an
incomplete feature for updating these settings outside of the Form API which
was vulnerable to a cross site request forgery attack.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer sharethis".

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * ShareThis 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed ShareThis [3]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the ShareThis module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to ShareThis
    7.x-2.3 [4]

Also see the ShareThis [5] project page.
