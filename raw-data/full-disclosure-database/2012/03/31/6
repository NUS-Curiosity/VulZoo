Subject: IPv6 stable privacy addresses

Folks,

We've just posted a revision of our IETF Internet-Draft entitled "A
method for Generating Stable Privacy-Enhanced Addresses with IPv6
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)".

The document is available at:
<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-gont-6man-stable-privacy-addresses-01.txt>

The abstract of the document is:

---- cut here ----
   This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface
   Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC), such that addresses configured using this method are stable
   within each subnet, but the Interface Identifier changes when hosts
   move from one network to another.  The aforementioned method is meant
   to be an alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on
   IEEE identifiers, such that the benefits of stable addresses can be
   achieved without sacrificing the privacy of users.
