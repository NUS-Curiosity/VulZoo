He knows there’s nothing to any of these advisories – he just does it to drive traffic to his site for Google Ads.

He also considers it a vulnerability to tell a new user that the username they've picked out has been taken by another user.

Same type of vulnerabilities exist in 99,999...% of all web applications
including your website. Even if you can't bruteforce all the time, you can
adjust it with timing, and e.g., proxies, different user-agents, etc., and
then you have "Timed Bruteforce Attacks" which works on pretty much all
websites. Did you also mention this 5-10 years ago on your web site about
website security named websitesecurity.com.ua<http://websitesecurity.com.ua>?

Also, when will you stop posting about: bruteforce/full path
disclosure/locking actual users out/and other low priority
"vulnerabilities" that exist in most web apps, and completely move on to
vulnerabilities that matters? Seriously, anyone can find these
"vulnerabilities" and the reason why anyone hasn't reported / disclosed /
complained about them is because they exist in most apps and doesn't
compromise the security of the end-user nor the website.

Will the next thing you disclose be about bruteforcing SSH because it by
default doesn't lock users out? It's been like this for +10 or +20 years.


What I find funny is that either you:
A) Say a web app has a vulnerability because it doesn't lock the
"offending" user out because of too many password tries, OR
B) Say a web app has a vulnerability because it does lock out the
offending user because of too many password tries.

It's almost a contradiction and an endless evil circle. You can't have
both, ever.


No offense intended of course.
