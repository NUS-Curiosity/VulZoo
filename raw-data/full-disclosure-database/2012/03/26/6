YMMV, but I always figured attempting to grab things with links or lynx from a command-line GNU/linux environment ought 
to be fairly safe, even for files that I'm pretty certain contain viral/trojan code (and to state the obvious, I don't 
execute anything that I download, I simply use tools to view).   And for the record, I didn't get a chance to do that in 
this case, as I missed the original post.

     best,
