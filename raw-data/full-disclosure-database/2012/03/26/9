Not everything.

Consider Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  There are very few people with enough
number theory clue that it's "obvious" as to *why* DH works on a first
explanation . Most people can eventually convince themselves that it can be
used to exchange numbers.  Convincing yourself that it's done in a
non-interceptible manner is a  lot harder..

Or consider BPG wedgies - if it's obvious to you why they're peristent,
you should be applying for a job as a senior BGP engineer at a major
network. ;)
