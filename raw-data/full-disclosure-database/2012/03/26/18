Hello,

I'm one those who clicked on it (and to make matters wors : after it 
was discover and discussed).

Why I click on it : it's a big thread and wanted to begin the reading 
with the first post ^^.

The fact that I run it on a noscript activated up to date firefox 
doesn't change the fact that I run it without too much attention and I'm 
the one to blame it.

So for the possible "aggressive reacions" : yes, but only about myself.

To be frank, the first things I was thinking after seeing what was the 
link was "well : owned like a newbie".

Cordially.
