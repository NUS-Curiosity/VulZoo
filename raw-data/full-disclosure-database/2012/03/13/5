==[Overview]==
GrrCON is an information security and hacking conference held annually
in the Midwest. This conference was put together to provide the
information security community with a venue to come together and share
ideas, information, solutions, forge relationships, and most importantly
engage with like minded people in a fun atmosphere. We completely sold
out in 2011 and have increased capacity in 2012.

First round or speakers have already been announced.

==[GrrCON is DIFFERENT]==
We are not JUST a Hacker Conference talking about pen testing and
exploits NOR are we JUST an Information Security Conference discussing
risk and strategy. GrrCON is unique in we have significant portions
DEDICATED to both. We bring together the CISO, the hacker, the security
practitioner, and the researcher in an intimate one-of-a-kind experience
you CANNOT get elsewhere.

We’ve taken ideas from all the major security conferences and put the
best ones into GrrCON to provide the most value to our attendees.
Whether you are a Fortune 500 executive, security researcher, security
industry professional, student, or a hacker of “flexible” morals you
will find something for you at GrrCON. 


==[Why GrrCON]==
We offer two tracks, training, workshops, solutions arena, Bsides,
contests, an after party, and more to ensure you get the most out of the
event.

-= oh yea.. and FREE BEER and FOOD both days for EVERYBODY =====
-= As always we try to PAY our speakers as much as possible for speaking
at GrrCON =====

Not all speakers or presentations are created equally, we hold to this
ideal by varying the honorarium we provide. 
-= For example, in 2011 the honorariums we paid out ranged from $200 to
over $4,000 per speaker =====

We also understand not all speakers can accept payment. Therefore,
speakers can negotiate additional tickets in exchange for honorariums,
subject to approval on an individual basis. Like everything we do,
we’re flexible and want to ensure everybody (even our speakers) have a
great time. If you have any thoughts or crazy negotiation ideas let us
know.
-= All accepted speakers will also receive a VIP Ticket for themselves
to enjoy the rest of the conference =====


  
==[Submit your CFP SOOON]==

-= Call for papers will close on June 1st or when we have filled all
available slots.
