Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in ZyXel GS1510 web front end

*Advisory Summary*

IT Security Geeks have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the ZyXel
1510 24-port Ethernet switch, these include Admin password stored in
Cookie, reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and clear-text password
submission.

*Vendor*

Zyxel

*Affected Software*

V1.00(BVN.1)

This is the firmware that runs on the ZyXel model GS1510-24 switch.

*Description of Issue*

The GS1510-24 ZyXel switch, running firmware V1.00(BVN.1), is susceptible
to multiple vulnerabilities, these are all within the management web
interface, and are as follows:

1. The management web interface Cookie contains both the username and the
password for the Admin user to log into the switch.

2. Cleartext submission of password. The page contains a form with the
following action URL, which is submitted over clear-text HTTP:

http://192.168.1.5/webctrl.cgi

The form contains the following password field:

password

3. Cross Site Scripting

The payload fe07b</title><script>alert(xss)</ script>b7e71e54af6 was
submitted in the name of an arbitrarily supplied request parameter.

This input was echoed unmodified in the application’s response.

*PoC*

2. Cleartext submission of password.

http://192.168.1.5/webctrl.cgi

Request

GET /login.htm HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.5
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_1)
AppleWebKit/534.48.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.1 Safari/534.48.3

Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: admin=password123
Pragma: no-cache

3. Cross Site Scripting

The payload fe07b&lt;/title&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/
script&gt;b7e71e54af6 was submitted in the name of an arbitrarily supplied
request parameter.

This input was echoed unmodified in the application’s response.

This proof-of-concept attack demonstrates that it is possible to inject
arbitrary JavaScript into the application’s response.

Request
