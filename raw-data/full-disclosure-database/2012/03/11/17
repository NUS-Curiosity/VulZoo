Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in EJBCA

Hello list!

I want to warn you about multiple security vulnerabilities in Enterprise
Java Beans Certificate Authority (EJBCA). These are Cross-Site Scripting,
Brute Force and Abuse of Functionality vulnerabilities.

EJBCA it's a PKI server. Citation from official web site: A Certification
Authority and a complete enterprise PKI management system, EJBCA is a PKI
server used to issue, manage and maintain digital certificates - with
exceptional flexibility and strength.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are EJBCA 4.0.7 and previous versions.

Developers have fixed this XSS vulnerability in new version EJBCA 4.0.8, 
which has been released at 09.02.2012, but at that they decided to not fix 
BF and AoF vulnerabilities, considering them as low risk. But I've suggested 
them to fix them too.
