Subject: Informations about old
	Sun-java-System-Web-Server/7.0

Hello list!

I recently discovered that a sensible state service is running the 
mentioned java web server (Sun-java-System-Web-Server/7.0).
After some quick wikipedia researches, I found out that it's quiet old 
(2009: opensourced by Sun; 2010: renamed by Oracle)..

Does any of you know about security holes, or, better, known bugs of 
this app ?

My aim is to point them, so that the state may consider to change it 
(for something up-to-date, or, better, real opensource)

I know that our dear Oracle loves to keep security holes/bugs secret, 
but hey, we're on Internet. Anything can be known ;). I just don't know 
where to search - google (and others) return the default webpage served 
by a LOT of servers (yeah, the "it works" thing)...

Thanks in advance!

C.
