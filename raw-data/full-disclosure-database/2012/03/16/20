Something to keep in mind is that big customers call their provider of bit-pipe
a "carrier".  If you call it an ISP, you're almost by definition a small fish.
And the profit margin on small fish is pretty low - even at the pay scales for
call centers outsourced to Bangalore or Nairobi, a *single* support call from a
small-fish subscriber can easily wipe out the ISP's profit for that customer
for the year if it drags on too long or escalates to an engineer that has a
clue.  That's why they'll do almost anything to get rid of you whe you call...
