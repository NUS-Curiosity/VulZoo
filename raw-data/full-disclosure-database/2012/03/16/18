Chances are a datacenter monkey pulled a power cable out, or they meant router and didn't want to confuse you.

Worked for a couple of ISPs, they all send the same emails out when something breaks.

Shouldn't worry about it. Also wouldn't get all higher-than-thou/ "who are these noobs".

Just get on with your life and admit they're lying to you and couldn't give a fuck whether you know it or not.
