No, they'd use private VLANs with the default router in a promiscuous 
sub-VLAN. That way they won't have to waste 4 IPs for every customer. 
Customers with multiple IPs can be put in community sub-VLANs, if they 
pay for it.
Networking works very differently within Service Provider networks. A 
lot of it is technology that makes itself look like other technologies 
you might be familiar with, but what is happening behind the scenes is 
actually completely different.
