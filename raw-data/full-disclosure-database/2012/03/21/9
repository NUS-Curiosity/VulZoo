Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-042 - Wishlist
	Cross Site Scripting	(XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-042
  * Project: Wishlist Module [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-21
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Wishlist Module allows users to maintain shared wishlists for special
events and holidays.

Impact:
The module doesn't sufficiently filter user supplied text from the URL. This
can be used to perform a reflected cross site scripting (XSS) attack. User
account credentials could be exposed or compromised, or users could be
redirected to sites designed for phishing or hosting malware. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that users must be tricked into
visiting a specific link and then manipulating the show/hide purchase details
drop down. This drop down is only rendered if the user is viewing their own
Wish List and the module is configured to hide the purchased status from
them.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Wishlist Module 6.x-2.x versions prior to 6.x-2.6.
  * Wishlist Module 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.6.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Wishlist
Module [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION

  * If you use the Wishlist module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Wishlist 6.x-2.6
