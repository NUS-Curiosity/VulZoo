Subject: Permanent XSS on the nuit du hack webmail service

So I was bored with the nuit du hack prequals and decided to test a bit
the e-mail service.

The guys have a cool XSS injection on the fake webmail service which can
be exploited with a properly crafted subject (i.e.
<script>alert('Hello!');</script> ). I thought the guys behind nuit du
hack were a bit more serious than this...
