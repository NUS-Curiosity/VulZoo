It's a pretty safe bet that most of the 300 clicky-clicky types did *not* use
wget to test what it was.

Well, assuming that the perpetrator doesn't have a 0-day for wget. ;)

"should" is the operative term.  But that only works if the miscreant is lazy
enough to point their link directly at the malicious content.  If they're
smart, they'll point at a page that looks legit, but loads Javascript from some
3rd party that loads more Javascript from a 4th party that that loads more crud
from a server you've pwned. I've hit pages on mainstream websites with noscript
enabled, and had 25+ different sites' Javascript blocked, and as you enable
sites you just get *more* sites in the list.

I just hit http://www.msnbc.msn.com, and NoScript blocked something from
2011.wimbleton.com. Malicious? Out of date?  What *other* domains will that
site end up loading *more* crud from?  Who knows?

Trying to sort this type of stuff out is part of the reason why drive-by pwning
is so common - the fact that the page came from someplace reasonably trustable
like the BBC or similar tells you *nothing* about where alll the content on the
page came from.
