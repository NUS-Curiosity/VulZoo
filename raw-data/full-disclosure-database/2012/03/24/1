A tad extreme, perhaps.  There *are* 7 billion people on the planet, most of
whom have never heard of you either..  Of course, the ones that you never hear
from don't matter, and I *will* agree that if your computer does hear from
somebody, they most likely *are* looking to extract something from you. ;)

Including advice that tells you to trust no one. ;)

Probably not, unless somebody figures out how to monetize it before handing it to you. ;)
