Package        : libtasn1-3
Vulnerability  : missing bounds check
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1569

Matthew Hall discovered that many callers of the asn1_get_length_der
function did not check the result against the overall buffer length
before processing it further.  This could result in out-of-bounds
memory accesses and application crashes.  Applications using GNUTLS
are exposed to this issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-1+squeeze+1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.
