No, not *all* the files, for the same reason that if you visit a page with
NoScript enabled, you may end up with missing content and/or big open spaces on
the page.

Consider a page that has Javascript on it:

todaysfile = "http://www.news-site.com/" + date_as_string;
document.load(todaysfile);

Unless you interpret the javascript, you don't know what URL will get loaded,
because yesterday and tomorrow will get a different URL.  So basically,
if you try to pull it down with wget or similar, you will miss *all* the stuff
that's pulled down via Javascript (and probably via css as well - does wget
know how to follow CSS references?).  On many modern web designs,
this ends up being the vast majority of the content.
