Pretty much as I thought. I investigate some, (when not too busy) of the links in the unsolicited mails I receive and concur with what you have
written here. I always browse with NoScript/adblock/cookie monster/Ref control enabled regardless of whether I think I can trust the site or
not. I learned a long time ago to ditch Outlook/IE and only view email in plain text.

I am curious and I do like to play with malware on a VM. I am also a novice, so perhaps I am over cautious. Then again, I think there is no such
thing as over cautious when a great deal of the miscreants trying to own systems or phish for credentials are more knowledgeable than I.

I just wish I had more time to study and research.

Doesn't the the -e, robots=off, --page-requisites and -H wget directives enable one to collect all the necessary files that are called from a page?

Cheers
Dave
