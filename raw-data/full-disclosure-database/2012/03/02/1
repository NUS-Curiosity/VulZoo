Linode has confirmed that the error was due to a fault on their side.

Hello Marek-

We were alerted to the suspicious activity and have identified and
corrected the issue. Our investigation has revealed a customer support
interface was used to access your account. The compromised credentials
have been restricted and we are discussing policy changes to prevent this
from recurring.

We regret that this incident has occurred, and apologize for the
unnecessary work this may have caused you.

We appreciate your business and certainly want to keep you as a happy and
satisfied customer. If there is anything we can do to make this up to you,
certainly let us know.

Regards,

Thomas Asaro
Vice President
