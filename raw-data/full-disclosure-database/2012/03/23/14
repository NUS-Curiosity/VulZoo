And I thought curiosity killed only pussy cats.
I don't consider myself a security professional, but playing around with computers since the early 80's has certainly taught me that:

i) 	Most links in forums.emails.blogs etc. benefit only the poster when clicked upon.
ii)	Paranoia is healthy. If one runs a computer most people ARE out to get you.
iii)	Lots of people are smarter than I.
iv)	If the curiosity is irresistible... use a VM.
v)	Browse unknown sites with scripting/cookies/etc disabled or use wget/lynx or see above.
vi) 	Trust no one, Trust nothing.
vii)	At the first sign of compromise format and reinstall from trusted media.

I really shouldn't be trying to teach grannies to suck eggs but...
The last computer virus/compromise that affected a computer I owned, apart from those I purposely infect VM's with was the Saddam virus on my Amiga.

Now in my smugness, I expect I will be handed my ass later....

que sera sera

QR tags (matrix barcode)  now there's some fun waiting to happen ;-)
