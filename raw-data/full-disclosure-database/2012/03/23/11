Subject: Re: Apple IOS security issue pre-advisory record

he he, good catch :)
Anyway, it doesn't hurt anybody: it's just a vote.
Well, let me explain. I'm a journalist (non IT, mainstream) preparing an
article about different internet communities behaviors. I've posted similar
messages talking about a security issue, pron pics, divx, software and
breaking news in several famous boards accordingly to analyze the different
related communities behaviors.
Each one links to a vote for different video contests so that I can measure
the hints.
Good to notice: this message has generated about 300 votes in the first 15
minutes, making it the second score behind "divx" for now on.

Thank you, and sorry for inconveniences (if any) !
