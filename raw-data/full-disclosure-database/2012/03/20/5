Package        : nginx
Vulnerability  : sensitive information leak
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1180
Debian Bug     : 664137

Matthew Daley discovered a memory disclosure vulnerability in nginx. In 
previous versions of this web server, an attacker can receive the content of 
previously freed memory if an upstream server returned a specially crafted HTTP 
response, potentially exposing sensitive information.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.67-3+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.17-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
