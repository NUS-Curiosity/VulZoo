Subject: [HITB-Announce] HITB2012AMS SIGINT - Call for
	Submissions

This is a call for submissions for the HITB SIGINT sessions at
HITB2012AMS - The third annual HITB conference in Amsterdam taking place
at the Okura from the 21st - 25th of May.

The HITB SIGINT (Signal Intelligence/Interrupt) sessions are designed to
provide a quick 15 - 30 minute overview for material and research that's
up and coming - stuff that isn't quite ready for the mainstream tracks
of the conference but deserve a mention nonetheless.

These sessions are not only for seasoned security professionals but are
also open to all final year students based in The Netherlands or around
Europe who want to present their projects to industry experts and prove
their worth before they graduate.

These sessions are held during the conference coffee and lunch breaks
and are strictly meant for research papers that are at least 50%
COMPLETE by the time of submission and are NON COMMERCIAL in nature.

INTERESTED IN SUBMITTING?
=========================

Send us your proposed talk abstract (1250 words), your bio (including
affiliations and interests) and above all else, tell us why you think
your presentation deserves it's 15 minutes of fame! Accepted speakers
will receive:

1 x complimentary pass to the quad track conference (worth EUR899)

1 x VIP invite to the post conference party sponsored by Microsoft and
IOActive

All submissions for HITB SIGINT sessions must be sent in via email to
hitb-sigint@...kinthebox.org  before the 14th of April

==

On a related note, we are happy to announce that the first set of
accepted speakers and submissions for HITB2012AMS includes a HISTORIC
FIRST TIME appearance by the iOS jailbreak 'Dream Team' comprising
members of both Chronic Dev and the legendary iPhone Dev Team!

In addition, former member of Last Stage of Delirium Group and the guy
who epically pwned J2ME in 2004, Adam Gowdiak, will be on hand with his
in-depth research on the insecurities of satellite television and
Digital Video Broadcast chipsets - research that he's been quietly
working on over the last year and a half!
