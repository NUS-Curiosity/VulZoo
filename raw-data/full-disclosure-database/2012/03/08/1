Subject: Stakeout: how the FBI tracked and busted a
	Chicago Anon

*"Yesterday, we learned that one of the top members of LulzSec (Sabu) had
been an FBI informant for almost 6
months<http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/03/06/1437241/lulzsec-leader-sabu-unmasked-arrested-and-caught-collaborating>,
and that this confidant of the LulzSec leader 'anarchaos' had given the
feds what they needed to take him down. More details have come out
now<http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/stakeout-how-the-fbi-tracked-and-busted-a-chicago-anon.ars>,
completing a picture of how the sting took place from start to finish. It
turns out that even the server space given from Sabu to anarchaos storing
the details of 30,000 credit cards (from the Stratfor hack) had been funded
by the FBI."
