Subject: Only two weeks left to Troopers12

Hi there,

just wanted to give you a quick update on TROOPERS12. Preparations are 
going well. Additionally to all the usual stuff we plan for you, we 
added some extra fun to make it an adequate 5th-year anniversary party.

Let's quickly run through some of the the 2012 highlights:
- Unique conference badge (check out last year's badge here: 
http://warrantyvoidifremoved.com/troopers).
- TROOPERS uniform (aka conference shirt) as well as some equipment all 
included with your ticket.
- Legendary TROOPERS 10k morning run to stay in shape ;)
- Big shared dinner in a historic venue with PacketWars hacking contest, 
live music and soldering fun.
- TROOPERS challenges competition with great prizes - Hint: Practice 
your morse codes as well as your drone piloting skills to have a fair 
chance!
- Extra: Some geeky 3D live printing! Did you hear about the Ultimaker? 
We have it right here.

Oh, did I mention that we also feature some IT security stuff there? ;)
- More than 25 international top-class speakers
- 10 Workshops
- Roundtables & trust panel discussion
- Additional topic this year: Focus on SAP Security

Join us in Heidelberg, Germany. The TROOPERS bootcamp is scheduled for 
March 19-23 2012. Workshops on Monday/Tuesday, main conference on 
Wednesday/Thursday and roundtables on Friday. Only a few tickets are left.

Looking forward to meet some of you there soon!
