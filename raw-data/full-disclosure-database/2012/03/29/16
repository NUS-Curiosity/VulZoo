Subject: New XSS vulnerabilities in Register Plus Redux
	for WordPress

Hello list!

I want to warn you new about security vulnerabilities in Register Plus Redux
for WordPress.

These are Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. After finding and fixing of
36 vulnerabilities in plugin Register Plus Redux in the end of previous
year, I've released my version of the plugin with fixed vulnerabilities of
original plugin. And recently during security audit of web site, on which
Register Plus Redux was using, I've found two new XSS vulnerabilities in
this plugin (which also take place on forks of this plugin).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Affected functionality appeared in Register Plus Redux potentially from
version 3.7.2.

Vulnerable are original Register Plus Redux and all plugins based on it.
Particularly vulnerable are Register Plus Redux 3.7.2 and next versions, my
versions Register Plus Redux 3.8 - 3.8.3, Register Plus Redux Auto Login
3.8.1 and previous versions.

At 25.03.2012 I've fixed these vulnerabilities in my version Register Plus
Redux 3.8.4.

Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

At page http://site/wp-login.php?action=register in parameters user_login
and user_email.

These vulnerabilities are concerned with variable-width-encoding (with using
of this technique it's possible to bypass protection filters). These
exploits are for IE6, for other browsers other characters need to be used
(this attack is possible in old browsers).

Timeline:
------------

2012.03.25 - found these vulnerabilities in the plugin.
2012.03.25 - fixed these vulnerabilities in my version of the plugin 
(Register Plus Redux 3.8.4).

version.
2012.03.27 - disclosed at my site.
