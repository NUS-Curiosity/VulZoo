Subject: Re: Iciniti Store SQL Injection - Security
	Advisory - SOS-12-003

This advisory is incorrect.

The reported SQL injection vulnerability is not present within the version
(4.3.3683.31484) of Iciniti Store claimed to be affected.

In addition, the legitimacy of the supplied proof of concept is
questionable. The SQL statement shown would only be syntactically valid
when injected and elicit a response containing the database version in the
rarest of circumstances. It appears to have not been verified by Sense of
Security.

ICINITI Corporation has been contacted to comment on this advisory.
