Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-034 - Node
	Recommendation Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-034
  * Project: Node Recommendation [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-7
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

This module shows users other nodes that they might be interested in based on
a simple logic and using taxonomy. The aim of this module is to provide
sensible defaults and an easy configuration for less-technical users and to
allow it to be manually overriden. The module doesn't sufficiently filter
user supplied text. The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an
attacker would need permission to create taxonomy terms or edit node titles
to exploit the issue.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Node recommendation 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.1.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Node
Recommendation [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Node recommendation module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Node
    recommendation 6.x-1.1 [4]

See also the Node Recommendation [5] project page.
