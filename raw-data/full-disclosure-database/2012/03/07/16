Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-031 - Multiple
	Modules Unsupported	- UC PayDutchGroup - Information leakage
	and Multisite Search	sql injection

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-031
  * Projects: UC PayDutchGroup / WeDeal payment [1], Multisite Search [2]
    (third-party modules)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-7
  * Security risk: Critical [3]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

UC PayDutchGroup / WeDeal payment [4] integrates the PayDutchGroup / WeDeal
payment gateway with Ubercart. The module exposes account credentials for the
store's PayDutchGroup account under certain circumstances allowing a
malicious user to login to the PayDutchGroup site as the store owner and
manage the store owner's account. The vulnerability is mitigated by an
attacker needing to gain an account with the ability to checkout of the
store.

Multisite Search [5] allows you to index and search content from all sites in
a Multisite configuration. The module doesn't sufficiently escape user input
when constructing queries. The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that in
order to execute arbitrary sql injection malicious users must have the
ability to administer multisite search.
