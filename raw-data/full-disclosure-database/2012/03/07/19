Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-033 - Read More
	Link - Cross Site	Scripting

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-033
  * Project: Read More Link [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2012-March-07
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Read More Link module allows you to move the "Read more" link from the
node's links area to the end of the teaser text.

A user could inject java script into pages affecting other site users. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with
the permission "access administration pages."

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Read More Link 6.x-3.x versions prior to and including 6.x-3.0.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Read More Link
(Drupal 6 and earlier) [3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Read More Link module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to version
    6.x-3.1 [4] or 6.x-5.0 [5]

See also the Read More Link [6] project page.
