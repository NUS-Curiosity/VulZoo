	- Cross Site	scripting

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-032

  * Security risk: Moderately Critical [2]

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The block class module allows users to add classes to any block through the
block's configuration interface

The class names in a block were not properly filtered. Someone with the
ability to modify or create blocks could inject java script that would be
rendered when viewing the block.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Block Class
[3] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the block class module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to block class
    7.x-1.1 [4]

See also the Block Class [5] project page.
