Details:

This talk will provide an in-depth treatment of satellite telephony networks from a security perspective. 
The overall system seems secure, but in reality, it cannot be expected to be fully reliable.

We will briefly cover the satellite mobile system architecture, then discuss GMR (GEO-Mobile Radio) system 
elements, e.g. GSS (Gateway Station Subsystem), MES (Mobile Earth Station), AOC (Advanced Operation Center), 
and TCS (Traffic Control Subsystem) for GMR-1 systems and NCC (Network Control Center), GW (Gateway), SCF 
(Satellite Control Facility) and CMIS (Customer Management Information System) for GMR-2 systems.

From there, we will discuss the security issues of GMR system as it shares similar vulnerabilities with GSM–GMR 
is derived from the terrestrial digital cellular standard GSM and support access to GSM core networks, along 
with some interesting demos.

Time permitting, a question and answer session at the end of the presentation will allow participants to cover 
any additional issues in satellite telephony system they’d like to discuss.
