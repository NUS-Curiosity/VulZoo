Debian Bug     : 659687

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in MySQL, a database
management system.  The vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading
MySQL to a new upstream version, 5.1.61, which includes additional
changes, such as performance improvements and corrections for data
loss defects.  These changes are described in the MySQL release notes
at: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-x.html

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.1.61-0+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.61-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.1 packages.
