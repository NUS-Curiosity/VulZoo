Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2012-035 - Webform
	Cross Site Scripting	(XSS)

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2012-035
  * Project: Webform [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x, 7.x
  * Date: 2012-March-07
  * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION  
---------------------------------------------------------

The Webform module allows content creators to assemble a survey for
end-users.
The module doesn't sufficiently filter user supplied text when displaying
radio buttons or checkboxes when used in combination with the Select or
Other... [3] module.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "create webform content" and the Select or Other...
module must be installed on the site.

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED  
---------------------------------------------------

  * Webform 6.x-3.x versions prior to 6.x-1.17.
  * Webform 7.x-3.x versions prior to 7.x-1.17.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Webform [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION  
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

  * If you use the Webform module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Webform 6.x-1.17
    [5]
  * If you use the Webform module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Webform 7.x-1.17
    [6]

If you do not use Select or Other... module, no action is necessary.

See also the Webform [7] project page.
