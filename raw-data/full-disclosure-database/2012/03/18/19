Its encumbered by Terms of Service. Its better to find an email
address so that (1) you are not bound by legal entanglements, and (2)
you have a written record of the correspondence.

I'd try RFC 2142 (MAILBOX NAMES FORvCOMMON SERVICES, ROLES AND
FUNCTIONS, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt). secure@...ebook.com
and securty@...ebook.com.
