Subject: Re: is my ISP lying or stupid?

Your ISP probably has their users are on different networks than their
servers.  Sounds like maybe they meant the switch you are on, not the
servers switch.  Need to troubleshoot, use a smart phone or some other OOB
capable device to test access to the ISP servers.  If you can access OOB,
then maybe they aren't lying.  Just a guess, you didnt provide much detail.
