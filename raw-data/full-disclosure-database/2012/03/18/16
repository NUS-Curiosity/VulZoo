Hi,

Without meaning to advertise, that is one of the reasons upSploit was
created - so that you could submit a vulnerability and then upSploit
automatically sends to the vendor. This way you and your friend don't have
to do any of the work on the disclosure.

https://www.upsploit.com - best of all, unlike some spammers on list, this
is free ;)

Thanks,
Thomas
