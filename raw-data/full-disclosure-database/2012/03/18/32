We don't just send the initial advisory... I guess I need to make the
website slightly more informative!

After the initial contact we have (currently) a 6 month disclosure policy.

We send an email every month, in the final month once a week and in the
final week once a day. This email is automatically generated and includes
information about how long is left, how many emails we have sent etc.

Please note that the 6 months is being changed to 1 month without contact 3
month fix (case by case) in the near future.

Thanks
