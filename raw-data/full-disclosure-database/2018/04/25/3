Subject: [FD] Authorization bypass in PHPLiteAdmin since 1.9.5

Hello,

I found a small issue in PHPLiteAdmin. It's an authorization bypass
which works since version 1.9.5 from 2014 (current is 1.9.7.1) because
PLA uses '==' instead of '===' for the password comparison in
'attemptGrant' of the 'Authorization' class. If the password is set to
one which correspondends to a number in scientific notation, one could
easier bruteforce the password or bypass it completely, e.g.:

php > var_dump('200' == '2e2');
bool(true)
php > var_dump('0' == '0e2');
bool(true)
php > var_dump('0' == '0e2342');
bool(true)

I opened an issue at GitHub for this[0] and have written about it[1]
(section 2 is the interesting one for this issue).

Best,

Karsten
