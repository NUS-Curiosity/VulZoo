Summary:  
The Dell EMC Common Object Manager (ECOM) component used in multiple Dell EMC products is affected by a XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability that may potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:	
ECOM is affected by a XXE injection vulnerability due to the configuration of the XML parser shipped with the product. XXE Injection attack may occur when XML input containing a reference to an external entity (defined by the attacker) is processed by an affected XML parser. XXE Injection may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to files containing sensitive information or may be used to cause denial-of-service. ECOM is used in Dell EMC products listed under affected products above.
