DSA-2018-071: Dell EMC ViPR Controller Information Exposure Vulnerability

Dell EMC Identifier: DSA-2018- 071
 
CVE Identifier: CVE-2018-1240 
Severity: Medium	
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 5.4 AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

Affected products:  
Dell EMC ViPR Controller versions 3.0.0.x
Dell EMC ViPR Controller versions 3.5.x
Dell EMC ViPR Controller versions 3.6.x

Summary:  
Dell EMC ViPR Controller contains fixes for an information exposure vulnerability in the configuration of Virtual Router Redundacy Protocol (VRRP) that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system. 

Details: 
Dell EMC ViPR Controller, versions after 3.0.0.38, contain an information exposure vulnerability in the VRRP.  VRRP defaults to an insecure configuration in Linux's keepalived component which sends the cluster password in plaintext through multicast. A malicious user, having access to the vCloud subnet where ViPR is deployed, could potentially sniff the password and use it to take over the cluster's virtual IP and cause a denial of service on that ViPR Controller system.

Resolution:  
The following Dell EMC ViPR Controller release contains resolutions to these vulnerabilities:
*	Dell EMC ViPR Controller version 3.6.1.4

Dell EMC recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
