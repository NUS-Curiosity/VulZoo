Subject: [FD] Seagate Personal Cloud allows moving of arbitrary files

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seagate Personal Cloud allows moving of arbitrary files
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yorick Koster, September 2017

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seagate Personal Cloud is a consumer-grade Network-Attached Storage
device (NAS). It was found that the web application used to manage the
NAS contains a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to
move arbitrary files. The move operation is done with root privileges,
which basically allows moving any file to any location. The only
limitation is that the destination path resides on the same file system
as the source path.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was tested on a Seagate Personal Cloud model SRN21C running
firmware versions 4.3.16.0 and 4.3.18.0. It is likely that other
devices/models are also affected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This vulnerability has been fixed in firmware version 4.3.18.4.
