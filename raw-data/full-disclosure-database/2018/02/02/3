Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Claymore’s Dual GPU Miner 10.5 and below is vulnerable to a format 
strings vulnerability. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to 
read memory addresses, or immediately terminate the mining process 
causing a denial of service.

1) By sending a custom request to the json api on port 3333 of the 
remote management service it's possible to leak stack addresses and 
possibly rewrite stack addresses with %p.  I wasn't able to break out of 
the json padding but someone else may be able to as %s also dumps string 
contents.

example - echo -e '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"1.0","method":"%x %x %x %x"}' | nc 
192.168.1.139 3333 & printf "\n".

2) Sending %n to the json api on port 3333 immediately kills the mining 
process.

example - echo -e '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"1.0","method":"%n"}' | nc 
192.168.1.139 3333 & printf "\n".

Solution
------------------------
