Subject: [FD] Microsoft Anti Ransomware mitigation bypass

Hi,

Since Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Microsoft added protection for
Ransomware in their product ‘Windows Defender’

By default, Office executables are included in the whitelist so these
programs could make changes in protected folders without restrictions.

This access level is granted even if a malicious user uses OLE/COM objects
to drive Office executables programmatically.

So a Ransomware developer could adapt their software to use OLE objects to
change / delete / encrypt files invisibly for the files owner.

More info with PoC code here (Also the surprising answer from Microsoft )
