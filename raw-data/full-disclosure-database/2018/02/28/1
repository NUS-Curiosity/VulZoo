Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult advises to immediately install the available updates as attackers
might gain access to sensitive data belonging to other users.

A thorough security review performed by security professionals is highly
recommended in order to identify potential further security deficiencies.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Insecure Direct Object Reference
An unauthenticated user can gain access to referenced files which are produced by
different test cases. By using a simple ID iterator, all produced output
data can be gathered from the whole system.

The actual impact strongly depends on the classification of the produced data
which is referenced. Therefore, the risk can vary from low to critical
depending on the use case.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Insecure Direct Object Reference
An unauthenticated attacker can download data from the TestLink environment
by using the following url:
http://<IP-Address>/lib/attachments/attachmentdownload.php?skipCheck=1&id=<ID>

The tag <IP-Address> specifies the target address and can also include a sub-
folder where the hosted TestLink application is located.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following versions have been tested and are vulnerable. It is assumed that
older versions are affected as well, e.g.:
* 1.9.16
* 1.9.15
* 1.9.14
