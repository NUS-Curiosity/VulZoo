         CVE Name       

    Description  By crafting an SDP message with an invalid media format      
                 description Asterisk crashes when using the pjsip channel    
                 driver because pjproject's sdp parsing algorithm fails to    
                 catch the invalid media format description.                  
                                                                              
                 The severity of this vulnerability is lessened since an      
                 endpoint must be authenticated prior to reaching the crash   
                 point, or it's configured with no authentication.            

    Resolution  Stricter validation is now done when pjproject parses an      
                SDP's media format description. Invalid values are now        
                properly handled.
