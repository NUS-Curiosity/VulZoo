Subject: [FD] WindScribe VPN 1.81 Privilege Escalation

Vulnerability Details:

WindScribe VPN uses OpenVPN client for connections. Also it creates a
system process named WindScribeService.exe
This process (WindScribeService.exe) establishes a NamedPipe endpoint that
allows WindScribe VPN process to connect and execute OpenVPN process or
other processes (like taskill etc.). Attacker can run any malicious process
in system privilege through this NamedPipe.


Also I've write about it here:
