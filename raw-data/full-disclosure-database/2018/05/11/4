Subject: [FD] CSRF in WP User Groups allows anybody to modify user groups
	and types (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: WP User Groups
Version: 2.0.0

CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4.3 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF in WP User Groups allows anybody to modify user groups and types

Vulnerability
================
WP User Groups creates new bulk actions to put users into (or remove them from) “groups” and “types”. A nonce is sent with the request, but it is not checked.

Proof of concept
================

Activate the plugin
Make sure you have a user with user_id=1
Visit http://localhost/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=user-group and create a group called “Cat” with slug “cat”
Visit http://localhost/wp-admin/users.php?users%5B%5D=1&action2=add-cat-user-group
If you go back to http://localhost/wp-admin/users.php you’ll see the user with user_id=1 is now in the group “Cat”


Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 2.1.1 or later.
