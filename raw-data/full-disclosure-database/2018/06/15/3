3. Vulnerability Description
============================
During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered
Cross-Site Scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities in Ultimate
Form Builder Lite WordPress plugin.

The Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability can enable the attacker to
construct the URL that contains malicious JavaScript code. If the
administrator of the site makes a request to such an URL, the
attacker's code will be executed, with unrestricted access to the
WordPress site in question. The attacker can entice the administrator
to visit the URL in various ways, including sending the URL by email,
posting it as a part of the comment on the vulnerable site or another
forum.

The easiest way to reproduce the SQL injection vulnerability is to
visit the provided URL while being logged in as administrator or
another user that is authorized to access the plugin settings page.
Users that do not have full administrative privileges could abuse the
database access the vulnerability provides to either escalate their
privileges or obtain and modify database contents they were not
supposed to be able to.
