Subject: [FD] Vulnerabilities in TP-Link TL-WR841N and TL-WR841ND

Hello list!

There are Brute Force and Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities in 
TP-Link TL-WR841N and TL-WR841ND.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next models: TP-Link TL-WR841N and TL-WR841ND, Firmware 
Version 3.16.9 Build 151216. All other versions also must be vulnerable.

----------
Details:
----------

Brute Force (WASC-11):

http://192.168.0.1

No protection from BF attacks in login form. By default access from Internet 
is closed, so it's possible to pick up password only via LAN. But via CSRF 
attacks it's possible to open remote access.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (WASC-09):

In section Remote Control.

Turn off access via Internet: 
http://192.168.0.1/YVNLOORCJBATZQDB/userRpm/ManageControlRpm.htm?port=80&ip=0.0.0.0&Save=1

Turn on access via Internet: 
http://192.168.0.1/YVNLOORCJBATZQDB/userRpm/ManageControlRpm.htm?port=80&ip=255.255.255.255&Save=1

For protection bypass it's needed to set Referer header and path 
(YVNLOORCJBATZQDB), that changes every time at login to admin panel. This 
path can be found through information leakage, social engineering  or XSS 
vulnerabilities in admin panel.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (WASC-09):

Logout from admin panel via request to page http://192.168.0.1.
