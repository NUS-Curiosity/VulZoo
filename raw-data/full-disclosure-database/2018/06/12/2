Subject: [FD] Reflected XSS in Tooltipy (tooltips for WP) could allow
	anybody to do almost anything an admin can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Tooltipy (tooltips for WP)
Version: 5.0
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/bluet-keywords-tooltip-generator/
Advisory report: https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/xss-in-tooltipy/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in Tooltipy (tooltips for WP) could allow anybody to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
Tootipy contains reflected XSS in the [kttg_glossary] shortcode meaning that admin users’ browsers can be hijacked by anybody who sends them a link. The hijacked browser can be made to do almost anything an admin user can normally do.

Proof of concept
================

Create a page containing the [kttg_glossary] shortcode
Visit the new page, and add the following to the end of the URL: ?cat=\'><script>alert(1)</script>
You’ll see an alert in browsers without XSS prevention such as Firefox

 

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 5.1 or later.
