Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
CWP
Product: CentOS Web Panel - (CWP) 0.9.8.12


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official CentOS Web Panel v0.9.8.12.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject script code to the client-side browser to application requests.

The client-side cross site web vulnerability is located in the `module` value of the `index.php` file GET method request.
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with a prepared malicious link to the centos web-panel application.
The request method to inject is GET and the attack vector is non-persistent. The injection point is the module parameter 
and the execution point occurs in the module exception.

The security risk of the web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.3. 
Exploitation of the non-persisten vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent 
external redirects to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] index.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] module


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and with low user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a sanitize of the vulnerable module parameters in the `index.php` file GET method request.
Disallow special chars and restrict the parameter input to prevent further client-side script code injection attacks.
Escape the output content of the error exception for invalid inputs to prevent the execution point of the client-side vulnerability.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability in the centos web panel is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.3).
