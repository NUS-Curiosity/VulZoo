Subject: [FD] RCE in DuoLingo’s TinyCards App for Android [CVE-2017-16905]

[Original post here:
https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/01/04/rce-in-duolingos-tinycards-app-for-android-cve-2017-16905/]

SUMMARY

The TinyCards Android application provided by DuoLingo can be injected
with malicious content by an MITM attacker. Because this application
is a web-app framed in an Android WebView, this can lead directly to
remote code execution (RCE) within the app. The root cause is lack of
SSL being used on app startup when the initial web content is loaded
into the WebView.

The vendor has fixed this issue in v1.0 (version code 10) that was
released via Google Play Store on November 20th, 2017 and users should
install the latest version. MITRE has assigned # CVE-2017-16905 to
track this issue.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

TinyCards is a flashcard application for preparing for tests and
memorizing vocabulary. It is made by DuoLingo, which provides a
platform for learning new languages. While monitoring network traffic
of a test device running Android, we observed that during application
startup an initial HTTP call is made to a non-HTTPS site, which then
redirects to an HTTPS version. Further research into the application
revealed that the application is essentially a thin browser wrapper
using Android’s WebView around a web application loaded remotely.

Because the initial call is done without HTTPS, it is possible for an
MITM attacker to intercept this traffic and inject their own content.
Since this is a web app, this can result in remote code execution
within the application since all the content is web based.

Screenshots of the captured traffic and relevant source code are in
the blog post

STEPS TO REPLICATE (ON UBUNTU 17.10)

1. Install the application on the Android device but do not start it.

2. Install dnsmasq and NGINX on the Linux host:

sudo apt-get install dnsmasq nginx

3. Modify the /etc/hosts file to add the following entry to map PIA’s
domain name to the Linux host:

192.168.1.x tinycards.duolingo.com

4. Configure /etc/dnsmasq.conf file to listen on the IP and restart DNSMASQ

listen-address=192.168.1.x
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart

5. Add a file with malicious content (you may need to use sudo):

cd /var/www/html
echo powned >index.html

6. Modify the settings on the Android test phone to static, set DNS to
point to “192.168.1.x”. AT THIS POINT – Android will resolve DNS
against the Linux computer and serve the large servers file

7. Open the app on the Android device and observe injected content.

All testing was done on v1.0 (version code 9)  of the Android
application using a Linux host running Ubuntu v17.10 and Android test
device running Android v7.

VENDOR RESPONSE AND MITIGATION

To fix this issue, the vendor has changed the initial URL for web
content being loaded within the app to use SSL. The vendor has fixed
this issue in v1.0 (version code 10) that was released via Google Play
Store on November 20th, 2017 and users should install the latest
version.
