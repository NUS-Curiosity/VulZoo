Vulnerabilities summary
The following advisory describes two (2) vulnerabilities found in
iB-WRA150N devices, firmware 1.2.6 build 110401 Rel.47776n.

iB-WRA150N is “a powerful solution to Internet connectivity at home, small
offices and work stations. The key is if you are using an ADSL2+ connection
now and later decide to change to Broadband or vice-versa you don’t need to
change your router. This iBall router is 2-in-1 and compatible to both –
Broadband connection as well as ADSL2 connection (Telephone connection or
cable operator connection). ”

The vulnerabilities found are:

Hard coded accounts
Remote command execution

Credit
An independent security researcher, maxki4x, has reported this
vulnerabilities to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.

Vendor response
We tried to contact iBall since December 20 2017, repeated attempts to
establish contact were answered, but no details have been provided on a
solution or a workaround.

Vulnerabilities details

Hard coded accounts
Username: admin
Password: admin

Username: support
Password: support

Username: user
Password: user

Remote command execution
After we logged in to the victims router – using the hard coded accounts,
we can trigger the second vulnerability and achieve remote command
execution.

User controlled input is not sufficiently filtered, allowing user to inject
arbitrary commands into ping test arguments in Diagnostics page.

By entering the following input in the ping test arguments in Diagnostics
page, the attacker can get the /etc/passwd file:

127.0.0.1;cat/etc/passwd
