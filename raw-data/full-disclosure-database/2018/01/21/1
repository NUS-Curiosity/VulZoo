Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Microsoft Academic is a free public search engine for academic publications and literature, developed by Microsoft Research. 
Re-launched in 2016, the tool features an entirely new data structure and search engine using semantic search technologies 
and it currently indexes over 150 million entities. The Academic Knowledge API offers information retrieval from the 
underlying database using REST endpoints for advanced research purposes.

Affected Product(s):
====================
Microsoft Corporation
Product: Academic - Online Service (Web-Application) 2017 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official Microsoft Academic online service web-application.
The vulnerability typ allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code to client-side browser to application web requests.

The cross site scripting vulnerability is located in the api of the web-application. Remote attackers are able to exploit via vulnerable 
`api/search/Getfilters` to byoass the current xss restriction filter. Thus allows the remote attacker to inject and execute client-side 
cross site scripting payloads. The request method to inject is GET and the attack vector is non-persistent. 

The security risk of the cross site vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.2. 
Exploitation of the client-side cross site vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects 
to malicious sources and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /api/search/Getfilters

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] query

Affected Module(s):
[+] Current XSS Filter Protection


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


PoC: Manual
1. Attackers can bypass the xss filter by using this payload through query api system. 
"%40%27%3E%3Cimg%20src=evil.source%20onerror=prompt(document.cookie)%3E%40"
2. Attackers can use the current url to execute the prompt dialog with successful response of xss payload execution
