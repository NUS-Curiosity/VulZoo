Subject: [FD] Seagate Media Server allows deleting of arbitrary files and
	folders

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seagate Media Server allows deleting of arbitrary files and folders
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yorick Koster, September 2017

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seagate Personal Cloud is a consumer-grade Network-Attached Storage
device (NAS). It was found that Seagate Media Server can be used by
unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files and folders on the
NAS. Since Seagate Media Server is running with root privileges it is
possible to remove almost any file on the NAS. The application lacks
protection against CSRF attacks, and is accessible via the
personalcloud.local domain name. Due to this it is possible to exploit
this issue via a malicious website without requiring the NAS to be
directly accessible over the internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was tested on a Seagate Personal Cloud model SRN21C running
firmware version 4.3.16.0. It is likely that other devices/models are
also affected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seagate has released firmware version 4.3.18.0 in which the vulnerable
endpoint is no longer exposed, which as a result fixes this issue.
