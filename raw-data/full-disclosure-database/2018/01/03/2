Subject: [FD] Gain Access to SSH Group via ssh-agent and OpenSSL

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Hello List,

Although for ssh-agent this is just a funny bug and no security
problem, other software might be vulnerable to privilege escalation.
And apart from escalation, the openssl code execution feature
is a nice and very reliable way to load and hide code in SSL-enabled
software. If done via ssh-agent, then this hidden code may not
even be coredumped or debugged by normal users.
