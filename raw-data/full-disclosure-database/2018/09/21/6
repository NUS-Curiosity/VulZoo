DSA-2018-152: RSA® Authentication Manager Multiple Vulnerabilities

Dell EMC Identifier: DSA-2018-152
 
CVE Identifier:  CVE-2018-11073, CVE-2018-11074, CVE-2018-11075
 
Severity: Medium
 
Severity Rating:  View the details below for the individual CVSS Score for each CVE.
 
Affected Products:
•         RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 Patch 3
RSA Authentication Manager web-tier server versions prior to 8.3 Patch 3
•         RSA Authentication Manager Language Pack versions prior to 8.3 Patch 3 (CVE-2018-11074 only) 
 
Summary:
RSA Authentication Manager contains fixes for multiple security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system.
 
Details:
Multiple components within RSA Authentication Manager have been updated to address various vulnerabilities.
 
The components are updated for the following vulnerabilities:
 
•         Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE 2018-11073)
RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Operations Console. A malicious Operations Console administrator could exploit this vulnerability to store arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code through the web interface. When other Operations Console administrators open the affected page, the injected scripts could potentially be executed in their browser.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
 
•         DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2018-11074)
RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 are affected by a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability which exists in its embedded MadCap Flare Help files. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim application user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the browser DOM, which code is then executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application
CVSSv3 Base Score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

 
•         Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2018-11075)
RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in a Security Console page. A remote, unauthenticated malicious user, with the knowledge of a target user's anti-CSRF token, could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim Security Console user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the vulnerable web application, which code is then executed by the victim's web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application.
CVSSv3 Base SCore: 5.8 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
