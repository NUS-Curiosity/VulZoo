Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.3.6

Hello participants of Mailing List.

Since announcement of DAVOSET in 2010 and after making its public release in
2013, I've made next update of the software. Recently DAVOSET v.1.3.6 was
released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

In new version there was added support of SSRF vulnerability in Splunk
Enterprise. Also there were added new services into lists of zombies and
removed non-working services from lists of zombies.

In total there are 210 zombie-services in the list.
