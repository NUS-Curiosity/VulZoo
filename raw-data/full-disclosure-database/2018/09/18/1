Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Remote Code Execution via PHP unserialize (CVE-2018-14630)
When importing a "drag and drop into text" (ddwtos) question in the legacy
Moodle XML format, the passed feedback answer is used unsanitized in an
unserialize() function, which leads to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability.
By providing a sophisticated PHP Object chain it is possible to leverage the
POI into a fully-blown arbitrary Remote Code Execution (RCE).

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs permissions to create a quiz
or at least be able to import questions. A user of the role teacher usually has
these permissions. However, students can also be assigned to the role teacher for
a specific course.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Remote Code Execution via PHP unserialize (CVE-2018-14630)
In order to exploit this issue an attacker has to open Moodle's question bank
for a specific course and import the following Moodle XML file. The answer
feedback contains a sophisticated PHP object chain which only contains objects
from Moodles library. After the parsing process the command "echo `whoami`" is
being executed.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<quiz>
  <question type="ddwtos">
    <name>
      <text>question name</text>
    </name>
    <questiontext format="html">
      <text><![CDATA[<p>How is the weather?<br></p>]]></text>
    </questiontext>
