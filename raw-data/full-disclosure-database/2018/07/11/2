Technical Details & Description:
================================
A filter bypass web vulnerability has been discovered in the official
Secutech DSL Wireless Router RIS 330 web-application.
The filter bypass web vulnerability allows an attacker to evade the
controls of a restriction- or protection mechanism.

The issue allows an attacker to change the wireless passphrase to an
insecure passphrase which is forbidden by the applications
javascript engine & the current measures of minimum WPA Length less than
8 keys. The vulnerability affects the `Secutech DSL Routers`
manufactured by Secutech Inc for communications.

The remote attacker can request to add/edit via POST which changes the
wireless passphrase. Then the attacker changes the followup
parameter `wirelesspassword` to manipulate. The filter won`t allow
authenticated users to set a passphrase less than 8 characters.
The attack results in bypass f the filter and allows the attacker to
setup any passphrase (wpa needs at least 8 chars) without
secure approval. Thus issue can be exploited by automated scripts to
perform attacks against the preeshare mechanism because of
no secure request validation and restriction.

The security risk of the bypass vulnerability is estimated as medium and
the cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count is 3.3.
Exploitation of the filter bypass vulnerability requires a privileged
web-application user account and medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized
access by setting a low secured passphrase key for WPA and WPA2.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] ./goform/wizardhandle

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] wirelesspassword


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The filter bypass vulnerability can be exploited by local attacker with
privileged user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Start the router for example in your local lan network
2. Access routers ui interface by usage of the network ip of the router
(exp. 192.168.0.1)
3. Login to the router and access the interface
4. Run a session tamper or any other tool to intercept the http
communication
Setup the javascript filter , and change the wireless password into less
than 8 or even just 1234
5. Process to submit the changes via POST
6. Successfully reproduce the local vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a restriction and approval of the
affected key parameter in the POST method request.
Disallow to save any input less then 8 characters to permanently grant
the security of the customer using the mentioned hardware.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the filter bypass router vulnerability in the
password setup module is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.3).
