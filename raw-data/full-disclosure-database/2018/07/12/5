Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Normally the hackrf is delivered with a hard metal case, metal plates
and some screws like you can see in the following picture.

In all our tests and developments, the case was maninly useless because
of the device access and weight.

The following print includes a special 3 part case for the HackRF device
(PLA or ABS). The 3 part case allows you to interact with the board
during a running mode. The first part is the main part that holds the
hackrf board safe. The size of the case has been optimized for the board
for a handy usage.

Next to that the weight of the new case is much lower. The case is
handier and slimmer cut although it has all the information elements
like the original case. The first and third part of the case shows all
information of the device with the specific declarations (clkin,
clkout, usb, leds and more), one part is directly connected to the lower
part, the third part is attached like a cover.

In the regular metal case you have to use the screws and in the new case
there is no requirement for them anymore because of the
board is already stabilised through the pin holes with the basic nut bolt.

The usage of ABS is a better solution for this case then using PLA to
make the case more heat resistant. The full case with the SLDPRT
(Editable) and STL (Print) files can be downloaded from the official
vulnerability laboratory page in the documents section. Enjoy to
use and share the new hackrf case for your developments or pentests.
