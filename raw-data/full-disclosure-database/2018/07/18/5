Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side html injection web vulnerability has been discovered
in the official GhostMail chat web-application.
The vulnerability allows to inject unauthorized malicious script codes
on the application-side of the affected module.

The issue exists in chat status of the application and is remotly
exploitable against other ghostmail user accounts.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on
the application-side of the affected online
service web-application. The encoding of the status message in the chat
client is broken. Local and remote attackers
can use the lack of validation to perform html injection attacks to
compromise user/moderator/admin session data.

The security risk of the html injection web vulnerability is estimated
as medium with a cvss count of 4.0.
Exploitation of the issue requires a low privileged web-application user
account and no direct user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the application-side vulnerability results in
session hijacking, persistent phishing,
persistent external redirects and persistent manipulation affected or
connected module context.

Vulnerable Domain(s):
[+] Ghostmail.com

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Status Message

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] Status message body context


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The html injection web vulnerability can be exploited by local and
remote attackers with low user interaction and low privileged
application user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability
follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual Steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Register an account and login to the ghostmail application
2. Move to the chat status contents
3. Close the tag of title with double quote "
4. Now, add a new malicious content as payload in the status title  for
the chat
5. Start to chat and in the same moment the execution of the script code
occurs at both party sides of the client
6. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!

Note: There is no filter validation or mechanism in place to prevent an
execution within the ghostmail web-application.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a parse and encode of the vulnerable
status mesage in the ghostmail chat client.
The issue has been reported in 2016 Q4 (2016-10-01) and was finally
resolved in 2017 Q3 - Q4 by the ghostmail developer team.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web
vulnerability in the chat module is estimated as medium (CVSS 4.0).
