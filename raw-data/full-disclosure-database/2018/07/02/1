Subject: [FD] Significant Vulnerabilities in Axis IP Cameras

Hello,

We have discovered and responsibly disclosed seven vulnerabilities affecting 390 Axis IP Camera models.
Chaining three of these vulnerabilities together, allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the cameras as root over the network.

A technical blog post with the vulnerabilities' details can be found at https://blog.vdoo.com/2018/06/18/vdoo-discovers-significant-vulnerabilities-in-axis-cameras/
The vendor's advisory, including a full list of affected models, can be found at https://www.axis.com/files/faq/Advisory_ACV-128401.pdf

This is the second of a series of blogs that will cover technical deep dives as part of our wide scope research of IoT safety and security products. Stay tuned.

Regards,
Or Peles, VDOO Vulnerability Research Team
