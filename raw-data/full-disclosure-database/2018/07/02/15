Subject: [FD] Faraday Beta V3.0 Released

Faraday helps you to host your own vulnerability management platform
now and streamline your team in one place.

We are pleased to announce the newest version of Faraday v3.0. In this
new version we have made major architecture changes to adapt our
software to the new challenges of cyber security. We focused on
processing large data volumes and to making it easier for the user to
interact with Faraday in its environment.

To install it you can checkout the new version on github:

Faraday just got much faster:
Architecture changes and a new database (PostgreSQL) gives us a new
and revamped structure that allows us to support new objects and a
bigger data volume. This dramatically improves most of the backend
services that directly impact your day-to-day use..

Big changes require time:
The total amount of work, in terms of commits, for the migration
consisted of 29% of the total work done for the the project to this
day.
We changed and reviewed around 75440 lines of code, including the
addition a lot of unit tests.

What’s new on the Backend:
- New Server: Implemented with Flask.
- New Database engine: PostgreSQL.
- New REST API: With complete support for CRUD for every object from
Faraday. It makes it simpler to do queries for the DB and it opens up
new ways for personalized integrations. Run python manage.py show_urls
to see all our new API endpoints.

Example usage for getting hosts from the new api:
curl 'http://localhost:5985/_api/v2/ws/europe'  -H 'Cookie:
AuthSession=[COOKIE]; session=[COOKIE];'

- Better scalability and performance improvements. There’s a drastic
reduction in time needed for searches in our API and with the new
architecture it’s significantly easier to scale-up horizontally.

What’s new on the front:
For this version we listened to feedback from our users to make
Faraday friendlier with a major focus on making specific data more
readily available and a faster interface.

The new dashboard:
The new dashboard has been organized with a new layout to show
relevant information first, helping users to find vulnerable spots in
their workspace.

Updated Status Report:
We changed and simplified the status report design

Redesign of the hosts list:
Now you can add and remove columns, plus see and filter by hostnames
and services:

Small improvements that make your day:

-Now you can import results from your scans directly on our Web UI:

Here’s an example of the new API:
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5985/_api/v2/ws/test/upload_report' -H
'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' -H 'Cookie: AuthSession=[COOKIE];
session=[COOKIE];' --data-binary $’[FILE BINARY DATA]’ —compressed

Dramatic performance upgrades.
-Simplification of the model we used. Say "adios" to the interface object.
-Access to the server using “/” instead of /_ui/ .
-Ability to edit the names of workspaces.
