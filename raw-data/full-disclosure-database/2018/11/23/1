Subject: [FD] CVE-2010-1910 - Multiple Consona Products Password Reset
 Security Bypass Vulnerability

Hi!!

8 years ago, I discovered this vulnerability, CVE-2010-1910, and now, you
can see the details.

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1910

The login page, "/sdcxuser/asp/login.asp", had a commented access to the
page that allowed to change the password of any user, with a link with text
"Forgot your password".

The link that had the vulnerability was: "/adccommonn/asp/forgotpass.asp".

You could enter any username and password without being authenticated and
change it, administrator or any other user.

it's not necessary to know the current one since it's not used.
