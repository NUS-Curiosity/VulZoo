Subject: [FD] Cradlepoint vulnerabilities

Hi,
This is a response to the Cradlepoint vulnerabilities posting by Crazy Owl on Nov 5th.
We appreciate that CrazyOwl brought to our attention these vulnerabilities and a coordinated disclosure that allowed us to address these issues and communicate with our customers prior to public disclosure. We take security very seriously, and took action as soon as we were notified. The specific steps we’ve taken are:

  1.  Confirmed the vulnerabilities – August 28th
  2.  Began design and code changes to correct or avoid those vulnerabilities – August 29th
  3.  Notified customers of the steps they needed to take to mitigate any risks – October 5th
  4.  Released updated software that eliminated those vulnerabilities and notified customers of the availability of that release – Nov 6th

As part of our response, we undertook an effort to formalize our vulnerability handling processes, create a vulnerability notification process, and make it straightforward for anyone to report a vulnerability. The results of this effort can be seen on the new Cradlepoint Trust page (https://cradlepoint.com/trust). That page contains the details of the vulnerabilities described by CrazyOwl, as well as other past vulnerabilities, any steps that customers should take to mitigate the risks of those vulnerabilities, as well as available software releases.

3 of the 4 vulnerabilities exploit systems that have not change their default passwords!

Best Regards,
Security@...dlepoint.com
