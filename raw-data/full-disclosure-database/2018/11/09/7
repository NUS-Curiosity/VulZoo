Subject: [FD] [CVE-2018-18941] Security Vulnerability in Vignette Content
 Management version 6

Some time ago I discovered some vulnerabilities and did not report them
over 2003 to 2010, the time came, better late than never :-D

<!--
# Exploit Title: Security Bypass Vulnerability in Vignette Content
Management version 6
# Date: 05-11-2018
# Exploit Author: Rafael Pedrero
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.vignette.com/
# Software Link: http://www.vignette.com/
# Version: Vignette Content Management version 6
# Tested on: all
# CVE : CVE-2018-18941
# Category: webapps

1. Description

In Vignette Content Management version 6, it's possible to gain
administrator privileges by discovering the admin password in the
vgn/ccb/user/mgmt/user/edit/0,1628,0,00.html?uid=admin HTML source code,
and then creating a privileged user account.


2. Proof of Concept

http://X.X.X.X/vgn/ccb/user/mgmt/user/edit/0,1628,0,00.html?uid=admin.

Once you authenticate you change the user by the administrator (uid =
admin) and you will see the asterisks in the password field that you can
use to authenticate later and create administrator users or modify any
feature of the CMS. I discovered this vulnerability in 2005.


3. Solution:

The product is discontinued. Update to last version this product. See more
