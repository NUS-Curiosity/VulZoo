Affected products:



Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.0

Summary:

Integrated Data Protection Appliance (iDPA) contains undocumented accounts with limited access which may potentially be used by a malicious user to compromise the affected system.



Details:

Integrated Data Protection Appliance versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 contain undocumented accounts named "support" and "admin" that are protected with default passwords. These accounts have limited privileges and can access certain system files only. A malicious user with the knowledge of the default passwords may potentially log in to the system and gain read and write access to certain system files.



Resolution:

Follow the steps below to remove the user accounts named "support" and "admin" from the impacted virtual machines in the Integrated Data Protection Appliance. There is no loss of supportability or any other product functionality as a result of the removal of these accounts.



Log in to Data Protection Advisor - Datastore Server Virtual Machine using an SSH client such as PuTTY, as root user and execute the following commands:



Delete the user "support"

userdel support



Delete the user "admin"

userdel admin



Verify that the accounts are deleted. The following commands should display "no such user" as the output.

id support

id admin



For Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.0 and 2.1, repeat the above procedure for Data Protection Advisor - Application server, Data Protection Advisor - Agent, Data Protection Advisor - DD Data Processor Tool and Appliance Configuration Manager Virtual Machines.
