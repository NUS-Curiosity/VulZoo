While I do agree with the decision of trust resting on the sysadmin's
shoulder, I disagree with trusting Microsoft just because they have
contributed to the kernel and have been supportive of open source. The
trust decisions have to be based on technical merit than societal
standing. For me, I disallow both Google and Microsoft to insert their
repo..

Thanks.
