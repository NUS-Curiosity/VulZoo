-=] About RootedCON

RootedCON is a technology congress that will be developed in Madrid
(Spain) 
from 28 - 30 of march 2019.

With an estimated seating from 2.000 and 2.500 people, is the most
relevant specialized

Europe, with 
attendee profiles ranging from students, Law Enforcenment Agencies to
professionals in the 
technology and information security market and, even, just passionate
people.

This is our X edition, *tenth anniversary!* We want it to be a special
edition,
in which we will bring various surprises :)

Already consolidated our additional tracks, including the collaboration
with Follow The

this year
will value the incorporation of a new specialized track. Stay tuned!

-=] Obligations and duties of the speaker

All speakers that inscribed a talk and get selected must:

If PoC are not available, it should be justified.

b) Send talk materials in the agreed dates before the congress. Please,
include details about the PoCs.

c) Accept in an explicit way that all the materials in the talk, as the
audio and video will be published, no matter the format and mechanism in
RootedCON's content management systems or others.

*Please*, make sure you understand your duties as a speaker before
submitting a proposal.

-=] Sponsors and partners

RootedCON is always looking for new quality sponsors. If you have a
propposal or feel your organization may be interested, please do contact
us in:

sponsors-AT-rootedcon.com

IMPORTANT: due to the mostly technical essence of the congress and the
prefences shown by our attendeess in multiple polls, we recommend to the
potential sponsors to work in a talk aligned with the expectation of our
public.

Any help, comment, idea, proposal or collaboration will be evaluated in
deep: it is very important for our Congress to receive this kind of new
ideas, as we depend on you to do our best in building the Event.


-=] Critical things to consider

1. Time management and talk duration are critical for the Congress. It
is better to 
ask for a longer slot, that to try to maximum twenty minutes, not having
time for 
interesting questions from the public.

2. We will evaluate with more interest those talks considered EXCLUSIVE,
not being 
shown in any other forum, blog, web, event or congress.

3. We believe in the responsible Full-disclosure so, if your idea is to
show a 0day, we need the confirmation that you have contacted the
vendor/victim. If this contact was not made, we can support you with
this.

4. We can cancel the relationship with the speaker if materials are not
provided in time. The delays may have an impact in travelling and
accommodation and other benefits.

5. PLEASE, it is quite important to *BE CLEAR* in the details of your
travelling and accommodation needs when you submit your talk; if you did
not confirmed your needs, Rooted keeps the right of not covering new
requirement not submitted initially.
