Subject: [FD] [CVE-2018-15379] Unauth RCE as root in Cisco Prime
	Infrastructure

Hi,

Here's a quick and easy unauth RCE as root in Cisco Prime
Infrastructure. This is a product widely deployed in data centers for
router management... good luck.

Thanks to Beyond Security SSD programme for helping me disclose this to
Cisco. Their advisory can be found at:
https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3723
And my own copy at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/advisories/cisco-prime-infrastructure.txt

Metasploit module has been submitted and waiting for PR:
https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/10765

Advisory follows:
>> Unauthenticated remote code execution and privilege escalation in
Cisco Prime Infrastructure
>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@...il.com), Agile Information
Security (http://www.agileinfosec.co.uk/)
==========================================================================
Disclosure: 4/10/2018 / Last updated: 8/10/2018


>> Introduction:
From the vendor's website ([1]):
"Cisco Prime Infrastructure simplifies the management of wireless and
wired networks. This single, unified solution provides wired and
wireless lifecycle management, and application visibility and control.
It also offers policy monitoring and troubleshooting with the Cisco
Identity Services Engine (ISE) and location-based tracking of mobility
devices with the Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE). You can manage
the network, devices, applications, and users – all from one place.
Cisco Prime Infrastructure offers support for 802.11ac, correlated
wired-wireless client visibility, spatial maps, Radio Frequency
prediction tools, and much more. Simplify the management of the wireless
infrastructure while solving problems faster and with fewer resources.
Cisco Prime Infrastructure offers new, guided workflows for the
Intelligent WAN and Converged Access, based on Cisco best practices.
These workflows make new branch rollouts easy and fast, from setting up
devices and services to automatically managing and monitoring them.
Cisco Prime Infrastructure offers fault, configuration, accounting,
performance, and security (FCAPS) management with 360-degree views of
Cisco Unified Computing System Series B Blade Servers and Series C Rack
Servers and Cisco Nexus switches, including the Application-Centric
Infrastructure–ready Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. Your data center
is critical to service assurance. Manage it effectively with Cisco Prime
Infrastructure.
Device Packs offer ongoing support of new Cisco devices and software
releases. It provides parity within each device family, eliminating gaps
in management operations, especially when it comes to service
availability and troubleshooting. Technology Packs deliver new features
between releases, accelerating time to value for high-demand functionality.
Large or global organizations often distribute network management by
domain, region, or country. Cisco Prime Infrastructure Operations Center
lets you visualize up to 10 Cisco Prime Infrastructure instances,
scaling your management infrastructure while maintaining central
visibility and control."


>> Background and summary:
Cisco Prime Infrastructure (CPI) contains two basic flaws that when
exploited allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code
execution. The first flaw is a file upload vulnerability that allows the
attacker to upload and execute files as the Apache Tomcat user; the
second is a privilege escalation to root by bypassing execution
restrictions in a SUID binary.

A Metasploit module has been released with this advisory, and can be
found at [2] and [3]. This module exploits the two vulnerabilities
described in this advisory to achieve unauthenticated remote code
execution as root on the CPI default installation. It should be
integrated into Metasploit's repository in the coming weeks.

A special thanks to Beyond Security and their SecuriTeam Secure
Disclosure (SSD) programme, which have helped me disclose this
vulnerability to the vendor. Their version of this advisory can be found
in [2].


>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Arbitrary file upload and execution via tftp and Apache
Tomcat
CVE-2018-15379
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.2 and later (latest version at the time
of writing is 3.4); earlier versions might be affected

Most web applications running on the CPI virtual appliance are deployed
under /opt/CSCOlumos/apache-tomcat-<VERSION>/webapps. One of these
applications is "swimtemp", which symlinks to /localdisk/tftp:

ade # ls -l /opt/CSCOlumos/apache-tomcat-8.5.14/webapps/
total 16
drwxrwxr-x.  3 root gadmin 4096 Mar 29 19:49 ROOT
drwxrwxr-x.  8 root gadmin 4096 Mar 29 21:44 SSO
lrwxrwxrwx.  1 root gadmin   36 Mar 29 21:32 SSO.war ->
/opt/CSCOlumos/wars/SSO-13.0.201.war
drwxrwxr-x.  4 root gadmin 4096 Mar 29 21:45 ifm_poap_rest
lrwxrwxrwx.  1 root gadmin   45 Mar 29 21:32 ifm_poap_rest.war ->
/opt/CSCOlumos/wars/ifm_poap_rest-3.70.21.war
lrwxrwxrwx.  1 root gadmin   16 Mar 29 19:49 swimtemp -> /localdisk/tftp/
drwxrwxr-x. 22 root gadmin 4096 May  2 15:20 webacs
lrwxrwxrwx.  1 root gadmin   30 Mar 29 21:32 webacs.war ->
/opt/CSCOlumos/wars/webacs.war

As the name implies, this is the directory used by tftp to store files.
Cisco has also enabled the upload of files to this directory as tftpd is
started with the -c (file create) flag, and it accepts anonymous
connections:
/usr/sbin/in.tftpd --ipv4 -vv -c --listen -u prime -a :69 --retransmit
6000000 -s /localdisk/tftp

The tftpd port is also open to the world in the virtual appliance
firewall, so it is trivial to upload a JSP web shell file using a tftp
client to the /localdisk/tftp/ directory.

The web shell will then be available at https://<IP>/swimtemp/<SHELL>,
and it will execute as the "prime" user, which is an unprivileged user
that runs the Apache Tomcat server.


#2
Vulnerability: runrshell Command Injection
CVE-2018-15379 (no specific CVE was attributed to this vulnerability by
Cisco)
Attack Vector: Local
Constraints: None
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.2 and later (latest version at the time
of writing is 3.4); earlier versions might be affected

The CPI virtual appliance contains a binary at
/opt/CSCOlumos/bin/runrshell, which has the SUID bit set and executes as
root. It is supposed to start a restricted shell that can only execute
commands in /opt/CSCOlumos/rcmds. The decompilation of this function is
shown below:

int main(int argc, char* argv, char* envp)
{
  char dest;
  int i;

  setuid(0);
  setgid(0);
  setenv("PATH", "/opt/CSCOlumos/rcmds", 1);
  memcpy(&dest, "/bin/bash -r -c \"", 0x12uLL);
  for ( i = 1; argc - 1 >= i; ++i )
  {
    strcat(&dest, argv[i]);
    strcat(&dest, " ");
  }
  strcat(&dest, "\"");
  return (system(&dest) & 0xFF00) >> 8;
}

As it can be seen above, the binary uses the system() function to execute:
/bin/bash -r -c "<CMD>"

... with the PATH set to /opt/CSCOlumos/rcmds, and the restricted (-r)
flag passed to bash, meaning that only commands in the PATH can be
executed, environment variables cannot be changed or set, directory
cannot be changed, etc.

However, due to the way system() function calls "bash -c", it is trivial
to inject a command by forcing an end quote after <CMD> and the bash
operator '&&':
[prime@...me34 ~]$ /opt/CSCOlumos/bin/runrshell '" && /usr/bin/whoami #'

root


>> Fix:
Vulnerability #1 has ben fixed fixed with the patch provided by Cisco in
[4]. Upgrade Cisco Prime Infrastructure to version 3.3.1 Update 02,
3.4.1 or above to fix it.
Vulnerability #2 does not appear to have been fixed as of the last
update of this advisory.

Please note that Agile Information Security does not verify any fixes,
except when noted in the advisory or requested by the vendor. The vendor
fixes might be ineffective or incomplete, and it is the vendor's
responsibility to ensure the vulnerablities found by Agile Information
Security are resolved properly.
