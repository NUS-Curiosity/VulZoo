Subject: [FD] Critical vulnerability in Cisco WebEx - "WebExec"

During a pentest a couple months back, me and my coworker (Jeff) stumbled
upon an 0-day in Cisco WebEx. It's neat because it's a remote code
execution vulnerability in a client-side app due to bad ACLs.

Here's a high-level doc we put together: https://webexec.org

And a technical deep dive:
https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2018/technical-rundown-of-webexec

You'll find Nmap and Metasploit modules linked from there.

Cheers!
Ron
