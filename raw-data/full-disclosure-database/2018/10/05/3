While things like this have appeared in the news,
http://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/07/14/malicious-software-packages-at-linux-repositories/,
I don't think this deserves a critical rating.  Are you going to give
Chrome for linux a critical rating because it installs the google
repository?  As a system administrator you have to make a decision about
how much you trust Google and Microsoft, Microsoft has contributed to the
Linux kernel and has been supportive of open source of late.
