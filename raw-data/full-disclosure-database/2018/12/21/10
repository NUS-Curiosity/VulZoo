Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.3.7

Hello participants of Mailing List.

update of the software. Recently DAVOSET v.1.3.7 was released - DDoS attacks
via other sites execution tool (http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

In new version there was added verbose mode and added SSRF vulnerability in
Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway 2010. Also there were added new
services into full list of zombies, changed default settings and removed
non-working services from full list of zombies.

In total there are 205 zombie-services in the list.

Best wishes & regards,
