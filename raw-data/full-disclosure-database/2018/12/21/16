I'm curious why do you post about minor memory leak after over year from fix,
from old version and tool (not the library)? Also note that
http://www.libtiff.org/tools.html says "Many of them however are more intended
to serve as programming examples for using the TIFF library."

You might want to test the latest version of the library. Their git can be
found from https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff.
