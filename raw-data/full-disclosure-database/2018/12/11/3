Subject: [FD] Dynamic Loader Oriented Programming - Wiedergaenger PoC (Proof
 of Concept) on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS - 2018

Hi all,

This is a great technique to reliably allow to escalate unbounded array
access vulnerabilities.

Full article/writeup of my experiences with screenshots is available at:

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-experiences-dynamic-loader-oriented-programming-poc-kozlowski/

or here as PDF:

https://github.com/marcinguy/LOP-wiedergaenger/blob/master/wiedergaenger.pdf

Repo URL, with samples, is at:
https://github.com/marcinguy/LOP-wiedergaenger

Again, I think this is a great technique and some more word should be
spread about it.

In case of further questions, feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
Marcin
