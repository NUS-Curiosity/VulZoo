Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the official microsoft skype 
v8.12 and v8.13 mobile software clients for apple ios or google android.
The denial of service web vulnerability allows attackers to crash the skype application by malformed message content transmit.

The vulnerability is located in the function to convert the size of transferred images when displaying. When transferring an image 
from the skype windows software client (computer system) to the mobile skype clients (iOS & android), a memory error occurs when 
adapting the smilie graphics. Attackers can copy the incorrectly formatted smilie by quota from the message, that is sent in broken 
format with a permanent resize request. The Attackers can now transfer the copied smilie into conversations to crash it with a memory 
error. When transferring the smilies by quote or by copying, the harmful content can be transferred to other input fields, which 
then also cause a local memory error on display. The demo video demonstrates how an attacker can use the content locally to crash 
himself or other Skype clients like Samsung's. The memory error can be used locally and remotely, but it is not possible to overwrite 
active registers from the process to compromise them permanently. The exploit of the vulnerability leads to crashes, massive sync 
problems and untreated memory errors in the mobile Skype iOS & Android software client. Skype for windows, linux & macos operating 
systems are not affected by the issue but must be used to bring the malicious content to the mobile skype client message board.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be reproduced by local or remote attackers without user interaction and with low privileged skype user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Setup a windows 10 default system and install skype v7.40.0.151
2. Setup a mobile iOS device and install the latest skype v8.12.0.14 & v8.13
3. Now open the windows 10 skype client and add the contact of the mobile device
4. Open the mobile device and confirm the user add request
5. Move back into the windows 10 client and send the mobile skype client 2 kiss smilies for example
6. Close the skype client and reopens the client
7. Now the smilies graphics are glitching inside by a resize of the image (view demo vide)
8. Now the message with the smilies must be quoted or copied and then transfered to any other skype input field were smilies are supported
9. Pasting around 50 of them results in an unexpected memory errors and uncaught exceptions or access violations
Note: Tested for Android Samsung and Apple iOS. The resize of the larger image results in a memory corruption
10. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!


PoC Video: Shows the local issue and the remote triggered bug ...

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Secure memory allocation when resizing emoticons images during rendering in transfers through the skype mobile software client.
Microsoft resolved the vulnerability and prepared an updated version v8.17 & v8.18. In both versions the security issue is known as patched.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the vulnerability in the skype mobile software client for ios and android is estimated as medium (cvss 4.7).
