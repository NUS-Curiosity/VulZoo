01/25/2018 - We replied notifying you that we’ve opened a ticked with the relevant team
01/26/2018 - We asked for a working PoC
01/31/2018 - You replied with a theoretical “PoC” (no code, just a few steps which didn’t really help, sadly)
02/01/2018 - We replied asking for a script, a piece of code, a video, anything that backs up your claim since we didn’t reproduce it based on the steps you provided.
02/12/2018 - We notified you that we closed the ticket since you stopped replying

We take our bugbounty programs very seriously and other than some Nigerian princes and fake LinkedIn invites we reply to _all_ reports, valid, invalid or incredibly ridiculous alike. As such, you may imagine why, when we saw an advisory with our name saying “Vendor did not respond”, the team felt a bit disappointed for failing to reply for the first time in a few years. Thankfully this was not the case.

If you still believe this is a genuine issue, exploitable in real life and you have some evidence to back that up, let us know and we’ll gladly reopen the ticket.

Cheers,
