1. General Overview
===================
During the security audit of Magento Open Source 1 and 2 a
vulnerability was discovered that could allow an attacker to force
an authenticated admin to perform backups and put the store into
maintenance mode during backups, which could serve as a denial of
service attack vector.


2. Software Overview
====================
Magento is an ecommerce platform built on open source technology
which provides online merchants with a flexible shopping cart system,
as well as control over the look, content and functionality of their
online store. Magento offers powerful marketing, search engine
optimization, and catalog-management tools. It is a leading
enterprise-class eCommerce platform, empowering over 200,000
online retailers.

3. Vulnerability Description
============================
During the security analysis of Magento 2 and 1 Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered that could allow an
attacker to force an authenticated admin to perform backups and put
the store into maintenance mode during backups, which could
potentially serve as a denial of service attack vector.

When a backup HTTP request is changed from POST to GET, the lack of
form_key parameter which serves as a CSRF token is completely ignored
and thus allows the request to be abused for CSRF attacks. The
following URL is used in the attacks:

Magento 2:
http://website.com/admin/backup/index/create/?isAjax=true&type=db&maintenance_mode=0&backup_name=test-DefenseCode&exclude_media=0

Magento 1:
http://website.com/index.php/admin/system_backup/create/?isAjax=true&type=db&maintenance_mode=0&backup_name=test3&exclude_media=0

The prerequisite for this attack is that the Add Secret Key to URLs
option is disabled. Secret keys are an additional anti-CSRF measure
in Magento, with form keys being the primary measure (that can not
be disabled). In a team setting this option is often disabled in
order to be able to to pass admin links to coleagues, tickets, chat,
etc.


4. Solution
===========
Vendor fixed the reported security issues and released a new version.
All users are strongly advised to update to the latest available
version.
