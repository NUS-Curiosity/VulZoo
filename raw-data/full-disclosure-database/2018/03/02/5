TITLE

Content Injection in Samsung Display Solutions Application for Android
[CVE-2018-6019]

SUMMARY

Samsung Display Solutions App for Android did not use encryption (SSL)
for information transmission, thus allowing an MITM attacker to inject
their own content into the app. The vendor fixed this issue and users
should install the latest version (3.02 or above). MITRE has assigned
CVE-2018-6019 to track this issue.

DETAILS

Samsung makes an Android application that allows users to browse B2B
content related to Samsungâ€™s display products. While performing
network level testing, we discovered that the content shown in the app
was loaded via server calls made by the application without any kind
of encryption (SSL). This allowed an MITM attacker to inject their own
content into the app.

To observe the issue on v3.01:
1. Install the application on the device.
2. Setup an MITM proxy but do not install the SSL certificate on the
device (we used PacketCapture).
3. Start the proxy. At this point all network traffic will be going
through the proxy with the SSL traffic being encrypted by a
self-signed certificate which is not trusted by the device.
4. Open the app.
5. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application version 3.01.
Network captures were performed using an on-device proxy
(PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.

VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor fixed this issue and users should install the latest
version (3.02 or above).
