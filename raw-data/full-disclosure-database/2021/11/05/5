Vulnerability Details:

Pentaho implements a series of web services using the SOAP protocol to
allow scripting interaction with the backend server. HAWSEC identified that
the services userRoleListService and ServiceAction exposed through the
"/pentaho/webservices/userRoleListService" and
"/pentaho/ServiceAction?action=SecurityDetails" endpoints are not enforcing
sufficient access controls. Specifically, an authenticated user can list
all application usernames present in the Jackrabbit Repository.
