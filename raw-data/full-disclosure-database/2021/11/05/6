Vulnerability Details:

Pentaho allows users to upload various files of different file types. The
upload service is implemented under the "/pentaho/UploadService" endpoint.
The file types allowed by the application are “csv, dat, txt, tar, zip,
tgz, gz, gzip”. When uploading a file with an extension other than the
allowed file types, the application responds with the error message of
"UploadFileServlet.ERROR_0011 - File type not allowed. Allowable types are
csv,dat,txt,tar,zip,tgz,gz,gzip". However, the file extension check can be
bypassed by including a single dot "." at the end of the filename.
