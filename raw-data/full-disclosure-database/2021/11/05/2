Vulnerability Details:

Pentaho allows users to create and manage Data Sources. Users can select a
Data Source when creating a Dashboard through the Pentaho User Console.
When a Data Source is added, Pentaho makes a HTTP request to the dashboards
editor (/pentaho/api/repos/dashboards/editor) in order to test the
connection by executing a test SQL query. However, further examination
revealed that by utilizing CVE-2021-31602 ( Authentication Bypass of Spring
APIs ) it is possible for an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL
queries on any Pentaho datasource and thus retrieve data from the related
databases.
