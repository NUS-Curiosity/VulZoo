CALL FOR PAPERS
=====================================

4th International workshop in Artificial Intelligence and Industrial 
Internet-of-Things Security (AIoTS)

Co-located with ACNS2022 (June 20-23), Rome, Italy.
=====================
Workshop description:
=====================

In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has got a lot of 
attention, especially, for the success of deep learning to address 
problems that were considered hard before. Big players such as Google, 
Amazon and Baidu are exploring the application of AI in different 
markets like healthcare, FinTech and autonomous vehicles. Along with AI, 
other technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) have boosted other 
areas like the case of Industry 4.0, where through the adoption of 
Industrial-IoT (IIoT) into the production chain companies want to have a 
smarter manufacture that can be adapted to their customers’ needs. The 
accelerating adoption of new technologies brings new challenges 
especially associated with the cybersecurity of the applications, where 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of data are important. 
Security incident in IIoT impacts the safety properties since 
applications interact physically with people or other assets. The 
intersection of AI and cybersecurity can be seen as a two-fold 
relationship. On the one hand, AI techniques can be adopted to improve 
the state-of-the-art of security solutions, while on the other hand, 
cybersecurity can contribute to improve the study of the security of AI 
algorithms through the exploration of adversarial machine learning. This 
workshop aims to open a space where new research ideas from different 
areas converge into the intersection of AI, IIoT, Cyber-Physical Systems 
(CPS) and cybersecurity. We encourage researchers and experts in the 
fields of AI, embedded systems, CPS and cybersecurity to take the 
opportunity to use this workshop for sharing their work and open the 
discussion of new ideas in this always-evolving topic.
