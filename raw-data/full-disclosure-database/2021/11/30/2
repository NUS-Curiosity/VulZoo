Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Coredoor.10.a
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 21000. Third-party attackers
who successfully logon can abuse the backdoor FTP server as a
man-in-the-middle machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using
Nmap. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse your system and
discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims will then think these
scans are originating from the infected system running the afflicted
malware FTP Server and not you.
