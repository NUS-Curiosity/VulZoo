Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site web vulnerability has been discovered in the official My Movie Collection Sinatra v2018 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the `title` and `comment` parameters of the `movies/new` module.
Authenticated remote attackers with user privileges are able to process manipulated post method requests for movie creates to inject
own malicious script code with persistent attack vector. The request method to inject is post and the attack vector is located on
the application-side. The execute of the payload occurs as well on preview of all videos by all users.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external
redirects to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] movies/new

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Create New Movie Below:
[+] Description (Comment)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] title
[+] comment

Affected Module(s):
[+] movies


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with user account and with low user interaction.
