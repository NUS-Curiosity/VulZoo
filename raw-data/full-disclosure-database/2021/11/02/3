Threat: Trojan.Win32.Phires.zm
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates an dir with insecure permissions
containing a registry file with a ".desc" extension, under c:\ drive
granting change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the file dropped by the malware to disable it or replace
it with their own. Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected
machine to potentially escalate privileges.
