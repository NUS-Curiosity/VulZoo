Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple non-persistent cross site web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official My Movie Collection Sinatra web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with non-persistent attack vector to compromise browser
to web-application requests by the client-side.

The non-persistent cross site scripting web vulnerabilities are located in the username and password input fields of the login and signup module.
Unauthenticated remote attackers are able to process manipulated post method requests for logins or signup to inject own malicious script code
with non-persistent attack vector. The request method to inject is post and the attack vector is located on the client-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects
to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] ./login
[+] ./signup

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Username
[+] Password

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] username
[+] password


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
