Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Agent.ad
Vulnerability: Insecure Credential Storage
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 87, its default password
"hoanggia" is stored in the Windows registry in cleartext under "clrprv.oo"
in "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\System\NPP". The password is
also set as cookie value "Cookie: pass=hoanggia; day=14; month=11;
year=2021", which also gets sent over the network in plaintext. Third party
attackers who can access the system or sniff traffic can grab the password,
then execute any programs and or run commands made available by the
backdoor.
