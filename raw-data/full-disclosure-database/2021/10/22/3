## Affected Components Description

The SAP Enqueue server is the component that manages the lock table. There
is
only one ENQ server in a distributed SAP System. It receives a lock request
and
checks the lock table to determine collision. This is a mandatory service
for
SAP Netweaver system, whitout it any modification in the SAP system is not
possible.

## Vulnerability Details

CVE-2021-27606: Attacker can craft malicious enqueue packet to force a read
out
of memory bound in function `EncOAMParamStore()`. A comparaison value in a
loop
can be tricked and forced to a high value. Eventually crashed when some
relevant
register was overwritten.

CVE-2021-27629: Attacker can craft malicious enqueue packet to force a read
out
of memory bound in function `EncPSetUnsupported`. A counter for a movs
instruction can be controlled by an attacker leading to a crash.

CVE-2021-27630: A NULL pointer dereference exists in `EnqConvUniToSrvReq`
when
the program tries to calculate the size of part of the message from the
input
packet. A register points to the content of the packet and could be
controlled
by the attacker.

CVE-2021-27631: A NULL pointer dereference exists in `EnqConvUniToSrvReq`
when
the program tries to calculate the size of part of the message from the
input
packet. A register points to the content of the packet and could be
controlled
by the attacker.

CVE-2021-27632: A NULL pointer dereference exists in `EnqConvUniToSrvReq()`,
where the function reads inputs from the provided packet then uses them to
calculate an offset for a pointer. Both inputs are user controlled, and can
lead
to dereference a register that will be used in `EnqConvObjToStr`.


## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3020104 which provide patched versions of the
