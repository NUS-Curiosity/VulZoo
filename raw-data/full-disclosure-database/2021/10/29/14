Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Prorat.ntz
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The malware runs an FTP server that listens on TCP port 2121.
Third-party attackers who successfully logon can abuse the backdoor FTP
server as a man-in-the-middle machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan
attacks using Nmap. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse
your system and discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims will then
think these scans are originating from the infected system running the
afflicted malware FTP Server and not you.
