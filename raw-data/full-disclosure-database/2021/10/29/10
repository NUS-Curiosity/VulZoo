Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Mazben.es
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Description: The malware listens on random TCP ports like 2608, 6751, 3087,
5947. Third-party attackers who can connect to the infected system can
relay requests from the original connection to the destination and then
back to the origination system. Attackers may then be able to launch
attacks, download files or port scan third party systems and it will appear
as the attacks originated from that infected host.
