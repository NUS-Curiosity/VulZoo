Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Hupigon.afjk
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The malware runs an FTP server "huigezi Ftp" that listens on
TCP port 2121. Third-party attackers who successfully logon can abuse the
backdoor FTP server as a man-in-the-middle machine allowing PORT Command
bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This vulnerability allows remote attackers
to abuse your system and discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims
will then think these scans are originating from the infected system
running the afflicted malware FTP Server and not you.
