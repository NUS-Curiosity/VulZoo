Subject: [FD] Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part 78): completely
	outdated,
	vulnerable open source component(s) shipped with Windows 10&11

Hi @ll,

in December 2017, Microsoft announced to ship curl.exe and tar.exe
with Windows 10:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20171219-tar-and-curl-come-to-windows>

But they failed once again, MISERABLY, at least for curl: they took
the sources released 2017-11-14, let them rot for 2 years, applied
some patches, only to let them rot again since then!

| C:\Users\Public>winver
| Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19042.1083]
|
| C:\Users\Public>curl -V
| curl 7.55.1 (Windows) libcurl/7.55.1 WinSSL
| Release-Date: 2017-11-14, security patched: 2019-11-05
| Protocols: dict file ftp ftps http https imap imaps pop3 pop3s smtp smtps telnet tftp
| Features: AsynchDNS IPv6 Largefile SSPI Kerberos SPNEGO NTLM SSL

Version 7.55.1 is 34 releases and at least 15 (in words: FIFTEEN)
CVEs behind the current version 7.79.1: see 
<https://curl.se/docs/releases.html> and
<https://curl.se/docs/vulnerabilities.html>

Most obviously Microsoft's processes are so bad that they can't
build a current version and have to ship ROTTEN software instead!

stay tuned, and far away from such poorly maintained crap
