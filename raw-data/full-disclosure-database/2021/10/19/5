Threat: Trojan-Spy.Win32.Ardamax.ocx
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates an dir named "MUWOCI" or "28463" with
insecure permissions under Windows\SysWOW64 granting full (F) permissions
to the Everyone user group. Standard users can rename the executable
dropped by the malware to disable it or replace it with their own
executable. Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected
machine to potentially escalate privileges.
