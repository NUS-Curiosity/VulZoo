Product Description
===================================================
The most sensitive areas of your systems are your employees’ workstations. Where attachments are opened, passwords are entered, and sensitive data is processed. The servers that make connections across the entire network. And smartphones that come and go with your employees every day. This is precisely where our endpoint security solutions protect your company assets. [https://www.gdata-software.com/business/endpoint-security]

Vulnerability Description
===================================================
The underlying problem was, that the GdAgentSrv (which is running as SYSTEM) tried to load its OpenSSL configuration from the non-existing path C:\Jenkins\vcpkg-master\packages\openssl-windows_x86-141-static\openssl.cnf (newer versions load from C:\Jenkins\vcpkg-master\packages\openssl-windows_x86-static\openssl.cnf). This can be abused by any local user to load arbitrary libraries (DLLs) and execute untrusted code in the affected process. This leads to a privilege escalation from non-admin user to SYSTEM.
