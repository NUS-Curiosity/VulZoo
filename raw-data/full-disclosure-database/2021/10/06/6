Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Hupigon.gy
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 8080, 1080. Third-party
attackers who can connect to the infected system can relay requests
from the original connection to the destination and then back to the
origination system. Attackers may then be able to launch attacks,
download files or port scan third party systems and it will appear as
the attacks originated from that infected host.
