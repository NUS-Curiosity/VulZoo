Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Prorat.lkt
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan (MITM)
Description: The ProSpy Server V1.9 malware runs an FTP component that
listens on TCP port 2121. Third-party attackers who successfully logon
can abuse the backdoor FTP server as a man-in-the-middle machine
allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This
vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse your system and
discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims will then think
these scans are originating from the infected system running the
afflicted malware FTP Server and not you.
