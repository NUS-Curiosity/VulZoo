Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql-injection vulnerability has been discovered in the official creative zone web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject or execute own sql commands to compromise the dbms
or file system of the application.

The remote sql injection web vulnerabilities are located in the `id`, `shippingid` and `zoneid` parameters of the
`category`, `products` and `shipping_charges` modules. Remote attackers with privileged panel access are able to
inject and execute own malicious sql commands to compromise the integrated database management system (mysql).
The request method to inject and execute is GET and the attack vector is located on the client-side.

Exploitation of the sql injection vulnerability requires no user interaction and a privileged application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] category
[+] products
[+] shipping_charges

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] id
[+] shippingid
[+] zoneid


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql-injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged account and without user interaction.
