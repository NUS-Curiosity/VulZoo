Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official Simplephpscripts Simple CMS v2.1 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with non-persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests by the client-side.

The cross site scripting vulnerability is located in the `id` parameter of the preview.php file. The request method to inject the malicious
script code is GET and the attack vector of the vulnerability is non-persistent. The execution of the script code occurs in the undefined
exception-handling output message.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects
to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Preview (Pages)

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] preview.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] id

Affected Module(s):
[+] Undefined Exception-Handling (Preview)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The non-persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user account with low user interaction.
