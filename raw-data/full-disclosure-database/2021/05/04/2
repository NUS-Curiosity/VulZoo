Subject: Re: [FD] Two vulnerabilities found in MikroTik's RouterOS

[Update 2021/05/04] Two CVEs have been assigned to these vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-20221: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers
from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the
/nova/bin/cerm process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial
of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.

CVE-2020-20218: Mikrotik RouterOs 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers from a
memory corruption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/traceroute process. An
authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due via the
loop counter variable.
