Subject: [FD] QNAP MusicStation/MalwareRemover Pre-Auth Root Remote Code
	Execution

QNAP MusicStation (5M+ installs) and MalwareRemover (pre-installed and
"non-removable") official apps are affected by an arbitrary file upload
and a command injection vulnerabilities, leading to pre-auth remote
command execution with root privileges on the NAS.

QNAP has already released updates with patches in April.
