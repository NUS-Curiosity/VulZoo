 Threat Investigations - Now Published

Dear   Cybersecurity Researchers,
          Red || Yellow || Blue Teamers,

International Journal of Cyber Forensics and Advanced Threat
Investigations (IJCFATI) is the first open access, peer-reviewed,
scholarly journal dedicated entirely to the study of tools,
techniques, procedures, and methodologies of Red, Yellow, and Blue
teamers.

IJCFATI is a gold-open access journal, which means it does not charge
fees neither to authors nor to readers and is entirely maintained by
the Association of Cyber Forensics and Threat Investigators.

IJCFATI has just published its latest issue at
https://conceptechint.net/index.php/CFATI/issue/view/2
We invite you to review the Table of Contents here and then visit our
website to review articles and items of interest.

Authors are solicited to contribute to this journal by submitting
articles that illustrate original research, practical, review, case
studies, and legal analysis reports related to all areas of
cybersecurity, digital forensics, incident response, and threat
investigations. Please browse through the journal website to find out
more information about the author's guidelines

A hallmark of IJCFATI is the developmental approach to reviewing; the
editorial team works closely with authors to help them develop their
works. The goal is to bring good ideas to light, rather than to put up
roadblocks.

Thanks for the continuing interest in our work.
