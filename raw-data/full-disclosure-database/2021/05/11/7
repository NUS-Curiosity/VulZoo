Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Antilam.13.a
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
Description: The malware drops an executable named "scandisk.exe" that
listens on TCP ports 47891 and 29559. Third party attackers who can reach
infected systems can execute commands made available by the backdoor.
Netcat utility worked the best for running commands, which are supplied as
numeric values or hex characters. The values sent correspond to different
commands mapped in the backdoor. Example, to get the date/time we can enter
015 or the hex value 0xF.
