Threat: Packed.Win32.Black.d
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 1080 and 8080 and drops a
hidden executable named "Hacker.com.cn.exe" under Windows dir" that runs
with SYSTEM integrity. Third-party adversaries who can connect to the
infected system can relay requests from the original connection to the
destination and then back to the origination system. Attackers may then be
able to launch attacks, download files or port scan third party systems and
it will appear as the attacks originated from that infected host. The relay
does not require authentication or any special User-agent check and
leverages the HTTP Host header in the request to connect to third-party
systems.
