Threat: Backdoor.Win32.NinjaSpy.c
Vulnerability: Remote Command Execution
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 2003, 2004 and drops a DLL
named "cmd.dll" under Windows dir. Connecting to port 2003, you will get
back a number "9951" from the infected host. If we send the value 1000 we
get a message in Portugese "Pisca Pisca Ativado" translates to "Blink Blink
Activated". If we connect to port 2004 and send "abc123" we get message
"Acesso negado..." translates to "Access denied". However, if you take the
initial number we received earlier (9951) when connecting to port 2003 and
apply some calculation we expose hidden functionality. Take the 9951 value
and invert the first two digits to 66 and then add together the last two 5
+ 1 to equal 6 for a final value of "666". Example, initial number (9951)
99 inverted equals 66 and 5 + 1 = 6. Enter and send the constructed value
of "666" to port 2003 and TCP port 999 is opened. Connect to port 999 and
you get back a remote shell.
