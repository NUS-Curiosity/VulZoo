Threat: Trojan.Win32.Agent.xdtv
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates an insecure installation dir under
"C:\Program Files (x86)" and grants full (F) permissions to the Everyone
user group. Standard users can rename the executables dropped by the
malware to disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait
for a privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially
escalate privileges.
