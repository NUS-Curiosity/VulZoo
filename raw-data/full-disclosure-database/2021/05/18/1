C a l l F o r P a p e r s

2nd Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy (CPSIoTSec 2021)

Seoul, South Korea, November 15 (Monday), 2021

URL: https://cpsiotsec.github.io

co-located with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications 
Security (ACM CCS 2021)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===================
CONFERENCE OUTLINE:
===================

The Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy invites academia, 
industry, and governmental entities to submit:

- Original research papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
- Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on the security and privacy 
of CPS&IoT
- Demos (hands-on or videos) of testbeds/experiences of CPS&IoT security 
and privacy research

We seek submissions from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds tackling 
security and privacy issues in CPS&IoT,
including but not limited to:

- Mathematical foundations for secure CPS/IoT
- Control-theoretic approaches
- High assurance security architectures
- Security and resilience metrics
- Metrics and risk assessment approaches
- Identity and access management
- Privacy and trust
- Network security
- Game theory applied to CPS/IoT security
- Human factors, humans in the loop, and usable security
- Understanding dependencies among security, reliability and safety in 
CPS/IoT
- Economics of security and privacy
- Intrusion and anomaly detection
- Model-based security systems engineering
- Sensor and actuator attacks
- CPS/IoT malware analysis
- CPS/IoT firmware analysis
- Hardware-assisted CPS/IoT security

Also of interest will be papers that can point the research community to 
new research directions, and those that
can set research agendas and priorities in CPS/IoT security and privacy. 
There will be a best paper award.

=================
PAPER SUBMISSION:
=================

Submissions include long papers (12 pages), short papers (6 pages), and 
abstracts (1 page):

- Long papers include a) Original research on a CPS/IoT security and 
privacy topic, b) Systematization of Knowledge of CPS/IoT security and 
privacy;
- Short papers include original work-in-progress research on a CPS/IoT 
security and privacy topic; and
- 1-page abstracts include demos/interesting findings/insights on 
CPS/IoT security and privacy, which will be accompanied by a hands-on 
demo during the workshop.

Submitted papers must include appendices and references (except for SoK 
papers where references are excluded).

Submissions must use the ACM SIG Proceedings Templates (see 
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template,
with a simpler version here: https://github.com/acmccs/format). Only PDF 
files will be accepted.

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press and/or the ACM 
Digital Library. Submissions must not substantially overlap
with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously 
submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Each
accepted paper must be presented by a registered author. Submissions not 
meeting these guidelines risk immediate rejection.
For questions about these policies, please contact the chairs.

NEW FOR 2021: The workshop will feature a second paper submission 
deadline for papers that have been submitted but not accepted to the 
main conference.
The deadline will be 10 days after the paper notification is out. 
Authors are not required to upload CCS reviews; verification of CCS 
submission status will be done
by informing the program chairs of the paper ID of the CCS submission.
