Subject: [FD] Unicorn Emulator 1.0.3 is out!

Greetings!

We are very happy to announce version 1.0.3 of Unicorn Emulator!

This version fixes some minor issues of v1.0.2 in the core and some
bindings. We also added a new binding in Rust. For more details, see

We wish to express our sincere gratitude to all contributors, who
generously supported us to maintain the Unicorn project!

What is next now? Let us look forward to the next major update:
Unicorn 2! Please contact if you want to support our work.

(For those who do not know, Unicorn is an open source multi-arch,
multi-platform emulator engine, with a homepage at

Thanks,
