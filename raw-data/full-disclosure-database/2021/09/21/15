Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Hupigon.asqx
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 8080. Third-party attackers
who can connect to the infected system can relay requests from the original
connection to the destination and then back to the origination system.
Attackers may then be able to launch attacks, download files or port scan
third party systems and it will appear as the attacks originated from that
infected host.
