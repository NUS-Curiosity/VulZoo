Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Hupigon.fjcd
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 8080, 1080. Third-party
attackers who can connect to the infected system can relay requests from
the original connection to the destination and then back to the origination
system. Attackers may then be able to launch attacks, download files or
port scan third party systems and it will appear as the attacks originated
from that infected host.
