Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Nyara.aq
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates a dir with insecure permissions under c:\

Standard users can rename the executable dropped by the malware to disable
it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user
to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
