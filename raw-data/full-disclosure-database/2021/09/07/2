Subject: Re: [FD] Mirror on the Fly Attack

yeah but nothing new with this, you are making it over no TLS connection.

if you make similar to this attack over hardened TLS (hardened mean 
support hsts,hsts-preload,ocsp..supported) or Tor hidden services 
(called onion services as well) or I2P eepsites .. yeah that would be 
something new and interesting.

anyway thanks for sharing :) .
