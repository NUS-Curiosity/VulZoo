Threat: Backdoor.Win32.VB.awm
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass - Information Leakage
Description: The "Cryptech Heat" malware listens on TCP port 3786 and has
an option to set an remote access password. The malware also runs a
keylogger, we see imports for GetAsyncKeyState, GetKeyState, keybd_event
and GetActiveWindow modules. Third-party attackers connecting to the
infected system can use any password and will essentially see anything the
victim types, searches or programs they run. As all information is piped
out to whatever remote endpoint is connected.
