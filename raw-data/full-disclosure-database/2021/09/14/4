Threat: Backdoor.Win32.WinterLove.i
Vulnerability: Hardcoded Weak Password
Description: The WinterLove malware requires authentication for remote user
access. However, the password "plunix" is weak and hardcoded in plaintext
within the executable. Interestingly, the password also suffers from reuse,
even used as part of the domain name for the website and the authors
handle. Therefore, just trying the domain name and or handle as the
password is enough without even inspecting the binary. Third-party
attackers who connect will get handed a shell with SYSTEM integrity.
Type: PE32
