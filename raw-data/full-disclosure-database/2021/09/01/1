Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2021-39279)
An authenticated command injection vulnerability can be triggered by issuing a
GET request to the "/forms/web_importTFTP" CGI program which is available on
the web interface. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to compromise the
operating system of the device. This issue was found by emulating the firmware
of the device.

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Manipulated Config-File (CVE-2021-39278)
Via a crafted config-file, a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability can
be exploited in the context of the victim's browser. This config-file can be
uploaded to the device via the "Config Import Export" tab in the main menu.

3) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235)
The used GNU glibc in version 2.9 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235,
gethostbyname "GHOST" buffer overflow) was verified by using the MEDUSA
scalable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
Multiple outdated software components containing vulnerabilities were found by
the IoT Inspector.

The vulnerabilities 1), 2) and 3) were manually verified on an emulated device
by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2021-39279)
The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating in the web interface to the
tab:

"Main Menu"->"Maintenance"->"Config Import Export"

The "TFTP Import" menu is prone to command injection via all parameters. To
exploit the vulnerability, an IP address, a configuration path and a filename
must be set.
If the filename is used to trigger the exploit, the payload in the interceptor
proxy would be:

http://192.168.1.1/forms/web_importTFTP?servIP=192.168.1.1&configPath=/&fileName=name|`ping localhost -c 100`


2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Manipulated Config-File (CVE-2021-39278)
The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating in the web interface to the
tab:

"Main Menu"->"Maintenance"->"Config Import Export"

The "Config Import" menu is prone to reflected cross-site scripting via the
upload of config files. Example of malicious config file:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[board]
deviceName="WAC-2004_0000</span><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"
deviceLocation=""
[..]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uploading such a crafted file triggers cross-site scripting as the erroneous
value is displayed without filtering characters.


3) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235)
GNU glibc version 2.9 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-1234, CVE-2015-7547, CVE-2013-7423, CVE-2013-1914, and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the
help of the exploit code from https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274. It was
compiled and executed on the emulated device to test the system.


4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
The IoT Inspector recognized multiple outdated software components with known
vulnerabilities:

BusyBox         1.18.5   06/2011
Dropbear SSH    2011.54  11/2011
GNU glibc       2.9      02/2009
Linux Kernel    2.6.27   10/2008
OpenSSL         0.9.7g   04/2005
Only found in the program "iw_director"
OpenSSL         1.0.0    03/2010

to be vulnerable:
