Vulnerability Details:

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory,
but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


This vulnerability allows to use the Web-filtering page to read any file on the system.


This vulnerability exists in the used cgi function, which is a build in part of the proxy.
This board has a security flaw in the CGI main.cgi that lets an attacker read arbitrary files with the privileges of the http daemon (usually root or nobody).
We were able to read the passwd, so we assume the http deamon runs with root-priviledges.
