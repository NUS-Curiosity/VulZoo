Subject: [FD] Mirror on the Fly Attack

Dear all,

I’d like to share an attack concept study with you.

With the help of new technologies in the application engineering (especially in the web application area) now it is possible to create man in the middle attacks that can bypass too many security countermeasures (2FA, OTP, CAPTCHA, SSL, Security Picture, Browser Remembering, etc.) by utilizing an approach we called mirroring on the fly...

At the mirroring on the fly approach, man in the middle attack happens on the fly by mirroring/cloning a valid resource simultaneously in the real time. During the cloning and mirroring process it is possible to modify and eavesdrop the communication.

Mirror on the Fly Attack (a replacement for SSLStrip and many MitM attacks)
