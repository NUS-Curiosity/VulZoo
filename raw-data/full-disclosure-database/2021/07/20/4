Hahahaha.... That teleportation technology can be exploited by many
alien races in the galaxy, yes, but it will depend a lot on the pilot
experiencies and in the environment in which the aircraft has been built.

Some use transparent proxies to avoid going further in those techniques...

Others simply do not launch the tool using the privileged user (root),
knowing that UFONet is designed to prompt you when required, for example
when creating certain network packages ...

Ahhaha, I don't think so...but, when to send the solution with the piece
of code already fixed?..

Ouch! {troll}

Thank you very much for the report and for doing it in such a funny
tone... ;-)
