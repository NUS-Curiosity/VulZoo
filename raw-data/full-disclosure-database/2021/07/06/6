Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.SVB.cz
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan (MITM)
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 8181 (default) and has an FTP
component that listens on port 1212 and accepts null creds. Third-party
attackers who successfully logon can abuse the backdoor FTP server as a
man-in-the-middle machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using
Nmap. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse your system and
discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims will then think these
scans are originating from the infected system running the afflicted
malware FTP Server and not you.
