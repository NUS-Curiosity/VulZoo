Threat: Backdoor.Win32.WinShell.40
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass Command Execution
Description: Malware WinShell v4.0 by janker listens on TCP port 5277 and
allows for setting a password for remote access. However, after setting the
password any combination of the characters used for the password will allow
access. E.g. if the password is set to "abc123"  interestingly the chars
"eutn" allows access. Also, password combinations like: abc321, 321abc,
132abc, a1b2c3, cba123, bca321, bac321, cab123, cab231, cab312, cab213,
ab1c23 will also authenticate successfully. Sometimes when attempting to
authenticate with a derived password and it fails, try it again and boom it
works!
