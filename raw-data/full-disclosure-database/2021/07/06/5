Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.SVB.cz
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass RCE
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 8181 (default) and has several
protocols that can be enabled, FTP port 1212 and WEB port 80 and drops its
executable under AppData\Local\Temp. The FTP component accepts empty
credentials for authentication as the default settings are set to blank.
Third-party attackers who can reach an infected host can potentially gain
access to the machine before or if no password is set.
Type: PE32
