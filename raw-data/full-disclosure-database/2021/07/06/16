Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Zombam.l
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated URL Command Injection
Description: Zombam malware listens on TCP port 80 and deploys a HTML Web
UI for basic remote administration capability. The RAT has option to kill
processes by clicking a link E.g. href="/kill&smss.exe&" this would
terminate the smss.exe process. By changing "kill" to exec
"exec&<command-to-run>" you can start arbitrary processes. Crafting a
successful injection requires padding an extra character to the end of the
executable extension you want to call, otherwise it gets truncated and will
fail. Example, curl http://x.x.x.x/exec&calc.exe results in the following
message: "error! calc.ex cannot be executed". However, padding the extra
character so ".exe" becomes ".exee", curl http://x.x.x.x/exec&calc.exee
will successfully process and we will get the response "calc.exe executed".
