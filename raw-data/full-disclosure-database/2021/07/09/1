Subject: [FD] Novus Managment System Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34820,
	CVE-2021-38421)

Hello,

Vulnerabilities mentioned below are fixed in the NMS with 1.51.2 version.
Vendor has already published the patches. Please visit
https://nms.aat.pl/en/ to download patches for the NMS software. I believe
that all NMS software with version below 1.51.2 is affected by Web Path
Traversal and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. However the vendor was
not able to provide a clear statement  about affected versions of NMS
software.

CVE-2021-34820  - Web Path Directory Traversal

Web Path Directory Traversal in the Novus HTTP Server. The Novus HTTP
Server is affected by the Directory Traversal for Arbitrary File Access
vulnerability. A remote, unauthenticated attacker using an HTTP GET request
may be able to exploit this issue to access sensitive data. The issue was
discovered in the NMS (Novus Management System) software.

Severity: Critical CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L (10)

CVE-2021-38421 Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)

The NMS before version 1.51.2, the WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling
implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the
issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of
the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text
tags.

Severity: Medium CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (5.3)
