Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Surila.j
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The malware listens on random TCP high port numbers typically
starting with "1" E.g. 12356, 14985, 13850, 19050, 13137. The malware has
an FTP component that accepts any username/password credentials.
Third-party attackers who successfully logon can abuse the backdoor FTP
server as a man-in-the-middle machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan
attacks using Nmap. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse
your system and discreetly conduct network port scanning. Victims will then
think these scans are originating from the infected system running the
afflicted malware FTP Server and not you.
