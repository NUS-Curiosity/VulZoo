Are we tracking vulnerabilities in malware now? Improve the malware to be
more resilient?

I'm just as likely to remove malware without vulnerabilities, as I am
malware WITH vulnerabilities.

Surely there are no bug bounties or upcoming patches (lol) for these.

I guess I'm confused about the purpose of these disclosures.
