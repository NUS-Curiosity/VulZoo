Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Zxman
Vulnerability: Missing Authentication
Description: Backdoor.Win32.Zxman by Zx-man listens on TCP port 2048
for commands. However, anyone who can reach the infected host can take
control as there is no authentication in place. Not much of a
self-respecting backdoor. Third party intruders or incident responders
who logon will be greeted with a welcome screen and help menu allowing
for a wide-range of commands.

Welcome to REMOTE_CONTROL_SYSTEM by Zx-man (zx-man@....net)
