Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Onalf
Vulnerability: Missing Authentication
Description: WinRemoteShell (Onalf) listens for commands on TCP port
2020. Interestingly, it will only start listening once it can connect
outbound to SMTP port 25. Not much of a self respecting backdoor, as
it allows anyone to logon without requiring a password. After logon
you are greeted with Welcome to WinRemoteShell(c)Chernickevich
http://onehalf.hotmail.ru.
Type: PE32
