Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Kraimer.11
Vulnerability: Missing Authentication
Description: Kraimer listens for commands on TCP port 6668, due to a
lack of authentication anyone can telnet to the infected host. Seems
only one established connection at a time is allowed, so if you telnet
in then no other connections are honored. Therefore, if you make TCP
connection and  theres already an established connection you will get
refused.

Successful backdoor logon:
