> How should we be treating the stream of malware vulnerabilities you’ve reported recently? If something is malware, surely I want to remove it from my machine anyway? I’m all for full disclosure, but I’m just trying to understand if there’s anything actionable list members could do with this information. Thank you for your work on this, which is quite interesting to follow by the way.
I personally think that those malware vulnerabilities are a great way to detect malware, however, they may be used a lot to infect vulnerable computers with even more malware. But it's still a backdoor and those are great for education about how such backdoors can be prevented, as list subscribers can see what mistakes did the programmer do and what mistakes they should not make.

Regards!
