Threat: Trojan.Win32.Pincav.cmfl
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The trojan creates an insecure dir named "Windupdt" under c:\
drive, granting change (C) permissions to authenticated users group.
Standard users can rename the malware and reboot to disable it or replace
it with their own executable to escalate privileges when a privileged user
logs on. The malware also creates registry key under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run for
persistence. To successfully rename the malware we have to call Windows
"attrib -h" command to unhide the executable or the rename will fail.
Type: PE32
MD5: 9d296ebd6b4f79457fcc61e38dcce61e
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0104
Dropped files: winupdate.exe
Disclosure: 02/21/2021

Exploit/PoC:
#include "stdio.h"
#include "windows.h"

void main(void){

    system("attrib -h C:\\Windupdt\\winupdate.exe");
    puts("Unhiding the malware to rename it...");
    system("RENAME C:\\Windupdt\\winupdate.exe  13");

    Sleep(1000);
    puts("[+] Disabled persistence by renaming winupdate.exe to 13 ...\n");
    puts("Restart your computer ...");

    puts("[+] Trojan.Win32.Pincav.cmfl PWNED!\n");
    puts("[+] MD5: 9d296ebd6b4f79457fcc61e38dcce61e\n");
    puts("[+] By Malvuln\n");
    system("pause");
