Vulnerability (CVE-2021-27189)

Overview

"CIRA Canadian Shield protects you from online threats such as
malicious domains, phishing websites and helps to keep your personal
data private. It also provides DNS privacy by keeping your DNS
requests in Canada. This app works by changing your phone's DNS
settings to run your requests through CIRA's Canadian server network."

(https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cira-canadian-shield/id1499859661)

Issue

The Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) Canadian Shield
iOS application (version 4.0.12 and below), does not validate the SSL
certificate it receives when connecting to the application server.

Impact

An attacker who can perform a man in the middle attack may present a
bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Sensitive information could be captured by an attacker without the
user's knowledge.
