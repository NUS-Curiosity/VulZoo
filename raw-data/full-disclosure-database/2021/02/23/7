Threat: Trojan.Win32.Pluder.o
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Creates an insecure dir named "z_Drivers" under c:\ drive,
granting change (C) permissions to authenticated user group. Pluder.o also
creates several registry key entries under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run for
persistence. Standard users can rename the malware and reboot to disable it
or replace it with their own executable to escalate privileges when a
privileged user logs on. When renaming the malware it checks the dir and
creates a new "svchost.exe" each time so we need to take additional step to
create our own fake one in order to disable it. To successfully rename the
malware we have to call Windows "attrib -h" command to unhide the
executable or the rename will fail.
Type: PE32
