Threat: Backdoor.Win32.DarkKomet.irv
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: DarkKomet.irv creates an insecure dir named "Windupdt" under
c:\ drive, granting change (C) permissions to authenticated user group.
Standard users can rename the malware and reboot to disable it or replace
it with their own executable to escalate privileges when a privileged user
logs on. DarkKomet also creates auto start registry keys under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
"Userinit" and drops three other files under "AppData\Local\Temp". To
successfully rename the malware we have to call Windows "attrib -h" command
to unhide the executable or the rename will fail.

Type: PE32
MD5: a229acff4e0605ad24eaf3d9c44fdb1b
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0105
Dropped files: winupdate.exe, [TGS]CAPUB V1.11.EXE, [TGS]CAPUB V1.11.DLL,
dclogs.sys
Disclosure: 02/21/2021

    system("RENAME C:\\Windupdt\\winupdate.exe  13");

    Sleep(1000);
