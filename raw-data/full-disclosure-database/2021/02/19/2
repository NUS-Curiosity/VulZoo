Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Agent.aak
Vulnerability: Weak Hardcoded Credentials
Description: The HTTP backdoor server HBKDR v0.3 listens on TCP port 8080
and accepts HTTP POST requests in order to execute commands on the infected
system. The malware hardcodes two sets of weak Base64 encoded credentials
in the malware "ZnVjazpkYXY=" (fuck:dav) and "ZGV2Om51bGw=" (dev:null). The
credentials can be viewed easily running string util against the malware
executable. The backdoor also uses insecure BASIC authentication disclosing
the username/password on the wire in a packet sniffing scenario.
Type: PE32
