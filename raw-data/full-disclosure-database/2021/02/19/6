Subject: [FD] Multiple remote memory corruptions in Telegram's handling of
 animated stickers

I have recently found and reported 13 memory corruptions to Telegram
(https://telegram.org), you can find the just-published technical blog
post at

and advisories at https://www.shielder.it/advisories/

The vulnerable official clients for android, ios and macos have already
been patched on september 30 and october 2, have a look at the blog post
