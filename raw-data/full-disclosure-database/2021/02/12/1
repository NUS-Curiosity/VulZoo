1. Vulnerability Description

 

SolarWinds Serv-U File Server through 15.2.1 does not correctly validate path information, allowing the disclosure of files and directories outside of the user's home directory via a specially crafted GET request.

 

 

2. PoC

 

On a vulnerable Serv-U installation issue the following GET request to get a listing of files and directories above the user's directory:

 

https://<serv-u host>/Web Client/?Command=List&dir=\..\*.*

 

The user *MUST* be locked to their directory, and only access granted must be the said directory. Directory listing must be enabled. If any of the above is not present, the exploit will not work.

 

3. Solution

 

The vendor provides an updated version (15.2.2) which should be installed immediately.
