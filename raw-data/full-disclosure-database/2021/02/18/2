Subject: [FD] AST-2021-002: Remote crash possible when negotiating T.38

               Asterisk Project Security Advisory - AST-2021-002

          Product         Asterisk                                            
          Summary         Remote crash possible when negotiating T.38         
     Nature of Advisory   Denial of service                                   
       Susceptibility     Remote authenticated sessions

          CVE Name        CVE-2021-26717                                      

      Description     When re-negotiating for T.38 if the initial remote      
                      response was delayed just enough Asterisk would send    
                      both audio and T.38 in the SDP. If this happened, and   
                      the remote responded with a declined T.38 stream then   
                      Asterisk would crash.                                   
    Modules Affected  res_pjsip_session.c, res_pjsip_t38.c                    

    Resolution  When re-negotiating for T.38, and a delay occurs Asterisk     
                now sends SDP only for the expected T.38 stream. A check was  
                also put in place to ensure an active T.38 media stream is    
                active within Asterisk when attempting to change state for    
                fax.
