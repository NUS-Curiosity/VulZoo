         CVE Name       CVE-2021-26712                                        

      Description     An unauthenticated remote attacker could replay SRTP    
                      packets which could cause an Asterisk instance          
                      configured without strict RTP validation to tear down   
                      calls prematurely.                                      
    Modules Affected  res_srtp.c res_rtp_asterisk.c                           

    Resolution  Asterisk now implements SRTP replay protection via a          
                ���srtpreplayprotection��� option in rtp.conf. The default is     
                ���yes���
