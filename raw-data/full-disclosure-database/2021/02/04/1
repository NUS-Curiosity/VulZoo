Subject: [FD] null pointer deference in mfmp4srcsnk.dll in latest windows 10

Found a null pointer deference in mfmp4srcsnk.dll in latest windows 10 by
accident.

Download mov file here:

Your explorer will crash. If not use windows media player.

I know MSRC usually do not fix null pointer deference but I reported to
them just in case. And as I expected they closed the case.
