Subject: [FD] Bug bounty failure stories to learn from: how we ended up to
 hack a bank with no reward

Hi,
bug bounty programs are spreading more and more nowadays.We would like 
to share our experience in this area but from a different angle this 
time: failure stories rather than success stories.

We provide some hints and talk about side effects (for example how one 
can end up hacking a bank as happened to us), as well as the reasoning 
behind the choices about targets and approaches followed during the 
bounty campaign.

Full stories here ->

regards
Red Timmy Security
