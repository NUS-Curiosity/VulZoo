Threat: Trojan.Win32.NanoBot.onh
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: NanoBot.onh creates an insecure dir named "AppData" under c:\
drive and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group.
Standard users can rename the executables dropped by the malware to disable
it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user
to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges. In
this case the dropped file "amsiproxy.bat" is actually an PE32 executable
as indicated by the presence of MZ header field and binary data.
Type: PE32
MD5: 9fff4c02274c0162880844f27ff91407
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0173
Dropped files: amsiproxy.bat  (PE32)
