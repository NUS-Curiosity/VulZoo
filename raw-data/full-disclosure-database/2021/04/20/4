Threat: Trojan.Win32.Agent.zfgh
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Agent.zfgh creates an hidden insecure dir named "drv" under
c:\ drive and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user

disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges
