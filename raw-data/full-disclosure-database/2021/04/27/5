Threat: Virus.Win32.Banka.a
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Banka.a creates an insecure dir named "Anak Bangka Hidden
Folders" under c:\ drive and grants change (C) permissions to the
authenticated user group. The virus also drops two files named "Bangka
Island.jpg" and "Pulau Bangka.jpg" under c:\ which are actually
executables. Standard users can replace the "Pasir Padi.pif" shortcut
created by the malware to disable it or replace it with their own. Then
wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially
escalate privileges.

Type: PE32
MD5: 6a3329d12323f4920dbf13afe1be6acd
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0184
Dropped files: "Pasir Padi.pif", "Bangka Island.jpg", "Pulau Bangka.jpg"
