RCE in SAP all SMD Agents connected to SAP SolMan

- Vulnerability Class: [CWE-306] Missing Authentication for Critical
Function
- CVSS v3 score: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- Severity: Critical
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2020-6207
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 2890213

## Affected Components Description

SAP SolMan 7.2 introduces a bunch of web services which run on top of the
SAP
Java NetWeaver stack. The affected versions have a vulnerable web service
exposed without authentication.

## Vulnerability Details

The EemAdminService/EemAdmin web service endpoint, which is exposed by
default
in SolMan 7.2, does not require user authentication when someone tries to
use it.
As a SOAP endpoint, any unauthenticated attacker just with HTTP(s) access
to the
system will be able to send particular crafted SOAP messages in order to
make use
of the different actions that this endpoint provides.

This web service, present only in the Solution Manager, allows users to
upload scripts
that will be afterwards executed in the SMD agents connected to the
targeted SolMan.
Because of a lack of sanitization, it is possible to craft particular
scripts that
could end up executing OS commands with SMD Agent user privileges.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 2890213 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2890213.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
