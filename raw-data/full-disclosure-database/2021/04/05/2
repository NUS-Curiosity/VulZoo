 Multiple root LPE through SAP Host Control

# Onapsis Security Advisory 2021-0002: [CVE-2020-6234] - SAP Multiple root
LPE through SAP Host Control

## Impact on Business

A malicious authenticated attacker, with privileges of SAP SMD Agent
access, can exploit
certain SAP Host Control functions due to missing input checking, in order
to escalate its
privileges and execute commands as root/system user.

## Advisory Information

- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2021-0002
- Vulnerability Submission ID: 802, 803, 804
- Researcher(s): Pablo Artuso, Yvan Genuer

## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - SAPHOSTAGENT 7.21 SP045 and lower

  (Check SAP Note 2902645 for detailed information on affected releases)
- Vulnerability Class: [CWE-78] Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
in an OS Command
- CVSS v3 score: 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- Risk Level: High
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2020-6234
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 2902645

## Affected Components Description

The SAP Host Agent is an agent which allows controlling and monitoring SAP
and non-SAP instances.

## Vulnerability Details

Some processes part of the SAP Host Agent run as root. This product is
usually installed
automatically when a new SAP system is installed. In order to expose its
functionalities,
the SAP Host Agent provides a SOAP interface, on ports 1128 or 1129 (TLS).
Every function exposed by this service requires high privileges.

If an attacker gets privileges of SAP SMD Agent OS user, it will be able to
interact with
the Host Agents’ exposed SOAP interface, allowing them to execute any
functionality. Because
of a lack of sanitization of certain parameters,  several exposed functions
were vulnerable
to OS command injection.  As some of these functions are executed with
root/system privileges,
it is possible to perform a local privilege escalation from SAP SMD Agent
user to root/system.

## Solution
SAP has released SAP Note 2902645 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2902645.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
