Threat: HEUR.Trojan.Win32.Bayrob.gen
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description:  The malware creates a insecure dir named "rlpzeasjvgnb" under
c:\ drive and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user
group. Standard users can rename the executables dropped by the malware to
disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
