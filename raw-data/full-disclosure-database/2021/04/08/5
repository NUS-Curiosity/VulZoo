Threat: Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Genome.qiw
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Genome.qiw creates an insecure dir named "tmp" under c:\ drive
and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the executables dropped by the malware to disable it or
replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user to
logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
