Vendor description:
-------------------
"BMD develops high-quality business software and is one of the leading software
manufacturers in Austria. But also many customers in Germany and Switzerland as
well as in the international European region rely on the software solutions developed
by BMD."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a software update which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the BMD Web
product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential
further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Stored Cross Site Scripting (Outdated software library)
BMDWeb 2.0 uses DOMPurify version 1.0.10 (released in Feb 19, 2019) for sanitizing
untrusted user input. This outdated version suffers from many vulnerabilities that allow
bypasses of the sanitization logic.

A few examples:
- https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/issues/482
- https://research.securitum.com/dompurify-bypass-using-mxss/
- https://research.securitum.com/mutation-xss-via-mathml-mutation-dompurify-2-0-17-bypass/
- https://portswigger.net/research/bypassing-dompurify-again-with-mutation-xss

An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's BMD
session, thus perform all actions in BMD, exfiltrate information, etc.

Note for DOMPurify users:
DOMPurify should be updated regularly. The project provides a mailing list with the
latest security information.

Further information: https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify#security-mailing-list

Additionally, input validation is another measure against Stored Cross Site Scripting.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Stored Cross Site Scripting (Outdated software library)
The following XSS vector can be used in all kinds of BMD user input fields, e.g.
time recording comment, service entry comment, etc.

<math><mtext><table><mglyph><style><![CDATA[</style><img title="]]&gt;&lt;/mglyph&gt;&lt;img&Tab;src=1&Tab;onerror=alert(0)&gt;">

This JavaScript code will then automatically get executed when the site which contains
the payload is visited by the victim.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerability has been found in BMD 23.45.32 (Build 1004581) which was the
latest version at the time of discovery.


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2021-02-22: Contacting vendor
2021-02-22: Conference call to discuss vulnerability.
2021-03-02: Vendor publishes patch.
2021-04-22: Coordinated release of security advisory.


Solution:
---------
Install BMD 24.01.21 or 24.02.11 or higher versions which are available to all customers
with support contract.


Workaround:
-----------
None
