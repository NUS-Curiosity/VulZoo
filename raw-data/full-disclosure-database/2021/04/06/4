Threat: Trojan.Win32.Sharer.h
Vulnerability: Anonymous Logon MITM Port Bounce Scan
Description: Sharer.h by GOLDSWORD - www.daokers.cn can run several types
of services one is an FTP server named "20CN MINIFTP" TCP port 21.
Third-party adversaries can abuse the server as a man-in-the-middle machine
allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This vulnerability
allows remote attackers to abuse your system and discreetly conduct network
port scanning. Victims will then think these scans are originating from the
infected system running the afflicted malware FTP Server and not you. The
FTP server default configuration is username "anonymous" and no password,
any password will allow logon. Running this malware you may get missing
"picclp32.ocx" error just run it again and it should work.
