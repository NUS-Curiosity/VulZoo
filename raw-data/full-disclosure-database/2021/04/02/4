Threat: Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Delf.nzg
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Win32.Delf.nzg creates an insecure dir named "Arquivos de
Programas" under c:\ drive and grants change (C) permissions to the
authenticated user group. Standard users can rename the executables dropped
by the malware to disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then
wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially
escalate privileges.
