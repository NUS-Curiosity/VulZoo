That's nothing compared to Sharepoint and sharepointonline.com. I get
10 to 20 pieces of offensive emails daily from Microsoft's cesspool.
All using those useless redirects under the guise of "sharing a
document" with me and offering me sex.

Microsoft has more garbage spewing from their web properties than
Amazon, Google, IBM, Salesforce and Rackspace combined (based on my
experience).

sharepointonline.com is the crack neighborhood of the virtual world.
Microsoft is a slumlord...
