Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Hupigon.aejq
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 2121, its FTP component
accepts any username/password credentials. Third-party attackers who
successfully logon can abuse the backdoor FTP server as a man-in-the-middle
machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This
vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse your system and discreetly
conduct network port scanning. Victims will then think these scans are
originating from the infected system running the afflicted malware FTP
Server and not you.
