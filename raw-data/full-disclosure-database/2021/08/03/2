Subject: [FD] Stb_truetype library heap buffer overflows (many CVEs,
	no CVEs yet)

Hi list,

Posting here for transparency reasons. A 16k stars project, used in, I can
imagine game engines, UI, Android/iOS/embedded. Used in another 30k stars
project and 11k from even Google (also possibly not fixed). OpenCV 55k
stars seems to be also affected (new branch only). Attack vector through
malicious font. Buy me a beer if you will get bounty on it and initial
fuzzing person https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/618

Should this have a codename "BadSTB" lol. Thoughts?

Per Developer library was not intended to work with untrusted data.

Be careful when using it, consider a replacement. This is PSA.

Thanks,
