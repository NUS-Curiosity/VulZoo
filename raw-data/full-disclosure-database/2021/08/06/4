Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Small.fp
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Description: The malware listens on random TCP ports like 2904, 1200 etc.
Third-party attackers who can connect to the infected system can relay
requests from the original connection to the destination and then back to
the origination system. Attackers may then be able to launch attacks,
download files or port scan third party systems and it will appear as the
attacks originated from that infected host.
