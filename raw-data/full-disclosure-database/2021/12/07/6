Introduction:
When editing the license file, it is possible for an admin user to enable an option to run arbitrary executables.
An attacker can exploit this to run a malicious binary on startup, or when triggering the "Reread/Restart Servers" function on the webserver. (Exploitation does not require CVE-2018-15573, because the license file is meant to be changed in the application.)

Vulnerability:
A license file containing the following, would execute calc.exe as an example of this vulnerability, it is also possible to provide arguments to the executables:

ISV demo "C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"

If CVE-2018-15573 remains unpatched, files could be created on the system and then executed. 

Recommendation:
Don't allow user-specified binaries to be run. Use a allow-list if absolutely required.
