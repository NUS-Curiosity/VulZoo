Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Mechbot.a
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates a dir with insecure permissions under c:\
drive granting change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group.
Standard users can rename the executable dropped by the malware to disable
it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user
to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
