Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Phase.11
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
Description: The phAse zero server v1.1 by njord of kr0me corp listens on
TCP port 555. Third-party attackers who can reach an infected system can
run commands made available by the malware and execute arbitrary programs
further compromising the host. Using telnet to connect worked best, to
start programs you need to pass an "S" argument preceding the program name
like... EXEC S PROGRAM_NAME. Other commands are CURDIR, SHOWMSG etc. The
ftpd command can also be initiated to third-party FTP servers to download
tools to the infected host.
