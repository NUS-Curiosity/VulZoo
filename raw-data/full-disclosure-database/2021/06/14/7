# Onapsis Security Advisory 2021-0011: Missing authorization check in
SolMan End-User Experience Monitoring


## Impact on Business

Any authenticated user of the Solution Manager is able to craft/upload
and execute EEM
scripts on the SMDAgents affecting its Integrity, Confidentiality and
Availability.


## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 06/14/2021
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2021-0011
- Researchers: Gonzalo Roisman, Pablo Artuso


## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - SAP Solution Manager 7.2

  (Check SAP Note #2983204 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: [CWE-862]: Missing Authorization
- CVSS v3 score: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)
- Risk Level: High
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2020-26830
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE #2983204


## Affected Components Description

SAP SolMan 7.2 introduces a bunch of web services which run on top of
the SAP Java
NetWeaver stack. The affected versions have a vulnerable web service exposed.
Affected components:
* Solman 7.20
* Solman Java Stack NW 7.5
* LM-SERVICE: 1000.7.20.9.14.20200731160700

(Check SAP Note #2983204 for detailed information on affected releases)


## Vulnerability Details

The main objective of the End-user Enterprise Monitoring (EEM) app is
to upload scripts
which will mimic user actions in order to be able to automatically perform
different kinds of tests.

This process is intended to be carried out by SAP administrators who
want to monitor their
instances. However, due to a lack of authorization check, any valid
user from the Solution
Manager is able to fully utilize this application.

In other words, any valid user is able to craft its own script, upload
it and force its execution
by an SMD Agent. Some tasks that can be carried out are:

* Execution of arbitrary HTTP requests from the SMD Agent.
* Disclosure of sensitive content.
* Resource consumption of specific services.


## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note #2983204 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded
fromhttps://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2983204.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
