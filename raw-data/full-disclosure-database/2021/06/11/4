Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Zombam.gen
Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Description: Zombam malware listens on TCP port 80 and deploys a HTML Web
UI for basic remote administration capability. One feature lists running
processes on the infected host using a GET request for /proc URL.

E.g.

{ welcome 2 HTTP_RAT infected computer }

menu [running processes] [browse] [computer info] [stop httprat] [have
suggestions?] [homepage]

running processez

[System Process]
System [kill]
smss.exe [kill]
csrss.exe [kill]
wininit.exe [kill]
csrss.exe [kill]
winlogon.exe [kill]

The malware fails to sanitize the URL and echoes back user controlled input
for the running processes webpages /proc menu link. Third-party attackers
can craft malicious HTML links to execute client side code in the security
context of the current user if they visit a malicious server or click the
infected link.
