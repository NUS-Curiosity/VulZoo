Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Googite.a
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Description: Googite malware drops several executables under dirs
(SysWOW64/System32) and listens on non-specific but semi-predictable TCP
ports as ports "1202, 1200" repeat often. On reboot ports 1202, 1200 became
6064, 6062 and pattern is that the ports are two digits apart each time.

2522,2520
9914,9912
1202,1200 (repeat)
1202,1200 (repeat)
1398, 1396
1794,1792
5337,5335
1202, 1200 (repeat)
1626,1624
1260,1258
1202,1200 (repeat)
2504,2502
9242,9240
1229,1227
1202,1200 (repeat)

The executables take CL args for the Port like svchosts.exe -p1200, and
also allows spoofing the Host header when making HTTP requests to
third-party systems. Third-party adversaries who can connect to the
infected system can relay requests from the original connection to the
destination and then back to the origination system. Attackers may then be
able to launch attacks or download files from third party systems and it
will appear the attacks or downloads originated from the infected host. The
relay does not require authentication or any special User-agent check and
leverages the HTTP Host header in the request to connect to third-party
systems.
Type: PE32

Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0240
Dropped files: svchostc.exe, svchosts.exe, surte.exe

Exploit/PoC:
1) DOOM.exe lives on 192.168.18.128
2) Use lower port of the two, high port (1650) will send RST packet when
try to download.
