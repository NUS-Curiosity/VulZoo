Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Neakse.bit
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates two insecure dirs housing DLLs under c:\
drive and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group.
Standard users can rename the executables dropped by the malware to disable
it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user
to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
Type: PE32
