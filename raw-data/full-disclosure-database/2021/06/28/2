Threat: Backdoor.Win32.ReverseTrojan.200
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass Empty Password
Description: ReverseTrojan by satan_addict listens on TCP ports, 12000 and
21. The malware accepts empty credentials for authentication as the default
settings are set to blank. Third-party attackers who can reach an infected
host can potentially gain access to the machine before or if no password is
set.
Type: PE32
MD5: 3fbec7c0623f5f80e4d9c096a50b0d59
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0256
