Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Scrop.dyi
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates a hidden dir named "gFnFILdc" with
insecure permissions under c:\ drive and grants change (C) permissions to
the authenticated user group. Standard users can rename the executable
dropped by the malware to disable it or replace it with their own
executable. Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected
machine to potentially escalate privileges.
