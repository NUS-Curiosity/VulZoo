Threat: IRC-Worm.Win32.Jane.a
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass MITM Port Bounce Scan
Description: The backdoor FTP server listens on TCP port 21, upon
connecting the server responds with banner "JANE_FTP Server is ready to be
hacked !!! thx Del_Armg0 ...   ; )" making it easily identifiable.
Third-party adversaries can abuse the server as a man-in-the-middle machine
allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This vulnerability
allows remote attackers to abuse your system and discreetly conduct network
port scanning. Victims will then think these scans are originating from the
infected system running the afflicted malware FTP Server and not you. This
is easily accomplished as the malware allows anyone to logon using any
username password combination.
