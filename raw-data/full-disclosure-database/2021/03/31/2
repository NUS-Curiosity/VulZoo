Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Burbul.b
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass MITM Port Bounce Scan
Description: The backdoor runs an FTP server that listens on TCP port 2121.
Third-party adversaries can abuse the server as a man-in-the-middle machine
allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This vulnerability
allows remote attackers to abuse your system and discreetly conduct network
port scanning. Victims will then think these scans are originating from the
infected system running the afflicted malware FTP Server and not you. This
is easily accomplished as the malware also suffers from a authentication
bypass as any username password combination can be used to authenticate.
