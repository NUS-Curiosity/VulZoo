Adapting the Mechanics of Vulnerability Disclosure to an area where 
Privacy Rights need to be scrutinized and where transparency becomes

===================================================================

On the 29.05.2020 I reported a way to bypass the GDPR as the Data 
Protection Authorities claimed to not have a possibility to act against
such abuse.

I am happy to announce that a Patch is being developed and that NOYB is
taking the CNPD to court on this matter. You can read more about it here:

How to effectively evade the GDPR and the reach of the DPA (CDPWE-0001)
________________________________________________________________________

Company : Rocketreach
Status  : DPA does not pursue any further
CDPWE   : CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the 
European Union

Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: https://caravelahq.com/b/policy/20949


I. Background
----------------
RocketReach is selling access to millions of European Data Subjects 
without recognising it is a Data Controller, without a representative
in the EU (ART.27) and with a questionable legal basis for processing.

II. Impact
----------------------------
Companies around the World can Process and sell Information about 
European data subjects without that the DPA sanctions them for doing
so by simply not designating a EU Representative accourding to Art.27 of 
the GDPR.

Note: That representative would be held accountable, without it the CNPD 
(LUX DPA) argues that their is no way for them to proceed.

III. Advisory
----------------------------
If your data is also included in Rocketreach (just search on their 
website), then file a complain with your local DPA (it's usually very 
easy and fast) .


V. Timeline
----------------------------

5th of April  2019 - Issued a DSAR to RocketReach
5th of April  2019 - Rocketreach responds by deleteing my data
5th of April  2019 - File a complain via my national DPA (CNPD)
6th of March  2020 - The CNPD agrees with my position but claims to not 
be able to pursue further.
