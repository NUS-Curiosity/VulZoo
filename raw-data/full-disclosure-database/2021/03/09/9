Threat: Backdoor.Win32.GTbot.c
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: GTbot creates an insecure dir called "WINNT" under c:\ drive
and grants change permissions (C) to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the malware to disable it or replace with their own
executable. Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected
machine to potentially escalate privileges.
