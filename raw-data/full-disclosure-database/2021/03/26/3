Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Kwak.12
Vulnerability: Port Bounce Scan
Description: The backdoor runs an FTP server that listens on TCP port
37885. Third-party adversaries can abuse the server as a man-in-the-middle
machine allowing PORT Command bounce scan attacks using Nmap. This
vulnerability allows remote attackers to abuse your system and discreetly
conduct network port scanning. Victims will then think these scans are
originating from the infected system running the afflicted malware FTP
Server and not you. This is easily accomplished as the malware also suffers
from a authentication bypass issue reference MVID-2021-0147.
Type: PE32
