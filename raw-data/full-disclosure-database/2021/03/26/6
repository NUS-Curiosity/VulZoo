Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Delf.zs
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
Description: Backdoor Delf.zs c0ded By Eb0La, is used to build backdoors
that listen on TCP port 2005. Upon building it drops an executable named
"[Shell_Me]_Server.exe." The name for the spawned backdoor defaults to
"Syst32.exe" but can be customized. Third-party attackers who can reach
infected systems can execute arbitrary commands by simply connecting to the
backdoor which will return a remote shell to the infected host as no
authentication exists.
