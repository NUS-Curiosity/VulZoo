Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Dycler.yhb
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Dycler.yhb creates a dir named "RECYCLER" under c:\ drive and
grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the "cft_mon.exe" executable dropped by the malware to
disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
