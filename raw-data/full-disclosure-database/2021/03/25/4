Threat: Worm.Win32.Ngrbot.abpr
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Ngrbot.abpr creates a dir named "Win.Msi" under c:\ drive and
grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename several of the executables dropped by the malware to
disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
