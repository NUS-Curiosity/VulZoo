Threat: Worm.Win32.Detnat.c
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Detnat.c creates a dir named "Recycled" under c:\ drive and
grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the "svch0st.exe" executable dropped by the malware to
disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
