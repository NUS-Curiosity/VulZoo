Threat: HEUR.Trojan.Win32.Generic
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The specimen creates a dir named "RECYCLER" under c:\ drive
and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Within
the RECYCLER dir exists an hidden dir named with security identifier (SID),
which in turn contains a dropped executable named "i7764tg.exe". Standard
users can rename the executable dropped by the malware to disable it or
replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a privileged user to
logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate privileges.
