Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Demp.rft
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The specimen creates a dir named "tmp" under c:\ drive and
grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the "DaumCleans.exe" executable dropped by the malware to
disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
Type: PE32
MD5: db01783710e0c5aff92156a0e76deade
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0138
Dropped files: DaumCleans.exe
