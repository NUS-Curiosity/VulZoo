scholarly journal, that is dedicated entirely to the study of tools,
techniques, procedures, and methodologies of Red, Yellow, and Blue
teamers.

IJCFATI is a gold-open access journal, which means it does not charge
fees neither to authors nor to readers and is entirely maintained by
the Association of Cyber Forensics and Threat Investigators.

IJCFATI has just published its latest issue at
