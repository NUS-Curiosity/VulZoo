Threat: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Delf.p
Vulnerability: Missing Authentication
Description: Delf.p drops an executable named "mmtask.exe" under system32
dir, it listens on TCP ports 3080,1180,1181,1182,1183 and UDP ports 53,
52304. The malware accepts TCP connections, connects to a destination, and
relays requests from the original connection to the destination and then
back to the origination system. Attackers who can reach an infected system
may launch attacks or port scan third party systems and will appear as the
attacks originated from that infected host. The malware can make
connections to various protocols like TELNET, HTTP, SSH, POP3 etc
