Subject: Re: [FD] Data Manipulation with X-Forwarded-For header at WordPress

I'm not sure I understand what's going on here: The "vulnerability" is 
that "X-Forwarded-For" can be manipulated by the client?

> VII. PROOF OF CONCEPT

> Affected Component: Wordpress core
> Affected version Wordpress 5.1

This doesn't make any sense.

There is nothing on Wordpress' website ( 
https://wordpress.org/news/category/security/ ) about an issue like this 
one, nor on the mitre's website ( 
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35539 ).

Can you please elaborate on this issue?
