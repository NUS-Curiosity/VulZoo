Threat: Trojan.Win32.Scar.dxir
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: Scar.dxir creates an insecure dir named "P2" under c:\ drive
and grants change (C) permissions to the authenticated user group. Standard
users can rename the hidden "phate2.exe" file dropped by the malware to
disable it or replace it with their own executable. Then wait for a
privileged user to logon to the infected machine to potentially escalate
privileges.
