Threat: Backdoor.Win32.DarkKomet.irv
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: DarkKomet.irv creates an insecure hidden dir named "updter"
under c:\ drive and drops executable "updt.exe". The backdoor grants change
(C) permissions to the authenticated user group for the "updter" dir.
Standard users can rename the malware to disable it or replace with their
own executable. Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected
machine to potentially escalate privileges.
Type: PE32
MD5: 341b2c3222122bd25c8509fc09534dec
Vuln ID: MVID-2021-0118
Dropped files: updt.exe
Disclosure: 03/02/2021
