Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Nightmare.25
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
Family: Nightmare
Type: PE32
MD5: 0fe8f37543e8face08941899add38e35
SHA256: 591e348b2c1f25a23f0acf55ba10a71957683b54a5682902c2fa179ba278fff6
Vuln ID: MVID-2024-0687
Disclosure: 08/09/2024
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 666, 5401 and 5402.
Third party adversaries who can reach an infected host on TCP port 666
can issue commands made available by the backdoor. The FTPON command
starts an FTP service on TCP port 21, supply any single character
after the command E.g. "FTPON x". Furthermore, the FTP server allows
for any username/password combination for authentication. Attackers
can then upload their own executable to the victim machine using the
FTP STOR command. This can undermine the initial adversary intrusion
allowing potential takeover by a totally different attacking entity.

Commands available:
RUN (run programs)
FTPON x  (starts FTP)
SHOWCHAT x
LOGOFF x  (logs out current user)
KILLAPP
LISTAPP
KILL x (shuts down the backdoor)
