Subject: [FD] CVE-2024-30925: XSS Vulnerability in DerbyNet v9.0 via
	photo-thumbs.php

CVE ID: CVE-2024-30925

Description:
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in DerbyNet version 9.0, specifically within the `photo-thumbs.php` component. This issue enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code through the improper handling of the `racerid` and `back` parameters. The vulnerability arises because the application dynamically generates URLs for navigation without adequately sanitizing these parameters, thus allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Vendor of Product: DerbyNet - Available on GitHub: https://github.com/jeffpiazza/derbynet

Affected Product Code Base: DerbyNet - v9.0

Affected Component: photo-thumbs.php

Attack Type: Remote

Impact: Code execution

Attack Vectors:
The XSS vulnerability can be exploited through manipulation of the `racerid` and `back` parameters in the URL. Examples of such manipulation include:
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/photo-thumbs.php?repo=head&racerid=</script><script>alert(1)</script>
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/photo-thumbs.php?back="><script>alert(1)</script></div>

These URLs demonstrate how an attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the user's browser session.
