Subject: [FD] CVE-2024-30927: XSS Vulnerability in DerbyNet v9.0 via
	racer-results.php

CVE ID: CVE-2024-30927

Description:
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in DerbyNet version 9.0, specifically within the `racer-results.php` component. This issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code through the improper handling of the `racerid` parameter. The vulnerability is notably present within the HTML `<title>` tag, where the `racerid` parameter value is dynamically inserted directly into the page content without any sanitization or encoding.

Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Vendor of Product: DerbyNet - Available on GitHub: https://github.com/jeffpiazza/derbynet

Affected Product Code Base: DerbyNet - v9.0

Affected Component: racer-results.php

Attack Type: Remote

Impact: Code execution

Attack Vectors:
The XSS vulnerability can be exploited by inserting malicious JavaScript code into the `racerid` parameter of the URL. For example:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/racer-results.php?racerid=</title><script>alert(1)</script>`

This method demonstrates how an attacker could manipulate the `racerid` parameter to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of a user's session.
