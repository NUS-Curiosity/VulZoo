Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Agent.ju (PSYRAT)
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass RCE
Family: PSYRAT
Type: PE32
MD5: 0e6e40aad3e8d46e3c0c26ccc6ab94b3
Vuln ID: MVID-2024-0677
Disclosure: 04/01/2024

Description: The PsyRAT 0.01 malware listens on random high TCP ports
53297, 53211, 532116 and so forth. Connecting to an infected host returns a
logon prompt for PASS. However, you can enter anything or nothing at all
and execute commands made available by the backdoor. The malware will
return a BADPWD and or "Invalid command" error string but the command
executes regardless. Custom client is required as it seems to dislike CRLF
\r\n characters when using netcat or telnet.
