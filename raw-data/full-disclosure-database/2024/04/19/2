Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor was unresponsive/uncooperative during multiple months of trying to
establish a security contact and to send them our findings. There is no patch/
solution available. Try to contact your local support team and request a patch
for this issue. Stay up-to-date with firmware and app installations and be vigilant.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Broken authorization
An owner of the robot vacuum cleaner device can share it with other users via the
app. The privileges of the shared users are very limited. It is not possible to
interact with photos and videos from within the mobile application, but it was
identified that it is possible to delete and list all images/videos of the main
account and even download the encrypted images/videos by sending the requests
with the JWT of the shared user. The encryption was not reverse-engineered but
it could potentially be possible for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive
imaging data.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Broken authorization
To exploit the vulnerability it is sufficient to follow these steps:
1. Connect a robot vacuum cleaner to the Dreamehome app (in our case the device
    "Dreame L10S ultra" was used).
2. Take a photo and video with the Dreamehome app using the connected device.
3. Share the robot vacuum cleaner with another user.
4. The "shared user" can list the photos using the following curl command:
    (It is necessary to set the "did" of the device)

[ POC removed]

5. The "shared user" can list the videos using the following curl command:

[POC removed]

6. The response with the list of photos/videos contains an "id" parameter. Knowing
this "id" parameter, a shared user can delete the photos/videos using the value
of "id" in the "ossIds" parameter using the following command:

[POC removed]

7. Furthermore, the responses with the list of photos/videos contains a "filepath"
parameter with the URL to the encrypted photo/video. Any user even without a valid JWT
token can download the encrypted photo/video using this URL. The encryption was not
reverse-engineered but it could potentially be possible for unauthorized users to gain
access to sensitive imaging data.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following versions have been tested which were the latest version available
at the time of the test:
* Dreamehome app 2.1.0 (tested with Dreame L10S ultra device)
* Dreamehome app 2.1.5 was tested later on 2024-04-12 and found to be vulnerable
   as well.

It is assumed, that other platforms (Google Android) are affected as well.


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2024-01-24: Contacting vendor through support.us@...ame.tech; aftersales@...ame.tech
2024-02-05: Contacting vendor through support.us@...ame.tech; aftersales@...ame.tech

2024-04-11: Sending final email to support.us@...ame.tech; aftersales@...ame.tech
             and marketing@...ame.tech. Requesting security contact again. As they
             are unresponsive, setting release date to 18th April.
2024-04-11: Same ticket auto-response (#82521551) as from 2024-02-06:
               "Thank you for your great support and interest in our products!

                Feel free to contact us with product related issues or concerns you
                may have."
2024-04-11: Sending them once again that marketing does not respond (and should not
             be responsible for security) and that we proceed to release the advisory
             on 2024-04-18.
2024-04-12: Vendor: "Thank you for reaching Dreame. We're sorry for the inconvenience.

                      Your kind understanding and patience are greatly appreciated."
2024-04-18: Public release of security advisory.
