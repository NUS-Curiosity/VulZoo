SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20240524-0 >
=======================================================================
               title: Exposed Serial Shell on multiple PLCs
             product: Siemens CP-XXXX Series (CP-2014, CP-2016, CP-2017, CP-2019, CP-5014)
  vulnerable version: All hardware revisions
       fixed version: Hardware is EOL, no fix
          CVE number: -

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The hardware is no longer produced nor offered to the market. Hence
HW adaptions resulting in modified products are not possible anymore.
The described HW behavior on this generation of devices cannot be
corrected by means of FW patches.

The risk of successful exploitation is considered low as physical access to
those devices is needed.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Exposed Serial Shell on multiple Siemens PLCs
A serial interface can be accessed with physical access to the PCB. After
connecting to the interface, access to a shell with various debug functions
as well as a login prompt is possible.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Exposed Serial Shell on multiple Siemens PLCs

* CP-2016 (Figure 1)
The serial interface on the CP-2016 can be accessed by connecting to the
following through hole pins of an unpopulated header:

  +-+
  |o|
  |o|RX
  |o|TX
  |o|
  |o|
  |o|GND
  +-+

* CP-2019 (Figure 2)
The serial interface on the CP-2019 can be accessed by connecting to the
following through hole pins of an unpopulated header:

  +-+
  |o|
  |o|RX
  |o|TX
  |o|
  |o|
  |o|GND
  +-+

  * CP-2014 (Figure 3)
The serial interface on the CP-2014 can be accessed by connecting to the
following through hole pins of an unpopulated header:

  +-+
  |o|GND
  |o|
  |o|
  |o|RX
  |o|TX
  |o|
  +-+

  * CP-2017 (Figure 4)
The serial interface on the CP-2017 can be accessed on the compute module
by connecting to pins 9 and 10 on the populated SMD connector:

   1              TX RX
   '-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'
  /-------------------\
  |                   |
  |-------------------|
  +'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'+
   11                20


* CP-5014 (Figure 5)
The serial interface on the CP-5014 can be accessed on the compute module
by connecting to pins 1 and 2 on the populated SMD connector:

  RX TX              10
   '-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'
  /-------------------\
  |                   |
  |-------------------|
  +'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'-'+
   11                20


All serial connections allow access to the SH1703 shell in version 1.00.
The shell requires no authentication and allows the usage of multiple
commands.

The following output can be seen on all devices:

---------------------------------------------------
    XXXXX  XXX XXX      X     XXXXX    XXX     XXX
   X     X  X   X     XXX     X   X   X   X   X   X
   X        X   X       X        X    X   X       X
    XXXXX   XXXXX       X        X    X   X     XX
         X  X   X       X       X     X   X       X
   X     X  X   X       X      X      X   X   X   X
    XXXXX  XXX XXX    XXXXX    X       XXX     XXX

2024-04-29: Informed Siemens about planned publication of advisory.
2024-04-30: Siemens, requests draft of advisory. Advisory is sent for review.
2024-05-07: Siemens requested small changes in the Solution and Business
             Recommendation.
2024-05-24: Public release of security advisory.


Solution:
---------
The hardware is no longer produced nor offered to the market. Hence HW
adaptions resulting in modified products are not possible anymore. The
described HW behavior on this generation of devices cannot be corrected
by means of FW patches.

The risk of successful exploitation is considered low as physical access to
those devices is needed.


Workaround:
-----------
Make sure to strictly limit physical access to the PLC during and also
after its life cycle.
