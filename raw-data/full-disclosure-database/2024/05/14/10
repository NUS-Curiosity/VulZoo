Subject: [FD] Research about consistency of CVSSv4

Hello there,

The University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Germany) is conducting a research 
study to investigate the reliability of CVSSv4 (Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System). We conducted a survey on CVSSv3.1 in winter 2020/21 and 
found out that the ratings are not always consistent [1]. Now we want to 
investigate the latest version CVSSv4. If you are currently assessing 
vulnerabilities using CVSS, we would greatly appreciate your 
participation which contributes to the improvement of vulnerability 
management.

The survey takes 30 min on average. This is a direct link:

The survey will be running until the beginning of June. It would be 
great if you could complete it as soon as possible for you.
If you are not scoring vulnerabilities using CVSS, but know people who 
are, we would be very grateful if you helped us and distributed this 
survey to them.

Thank you!

Julia & colleagues (in CC)
