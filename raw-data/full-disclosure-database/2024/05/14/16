Description: The smokebot admin web panel is written in PHP for remote
administration capability. The panel has multiple features like Bot List,
Task List, Stealer, Miner, Email Grab, KeyLogger etc. The "control.php" PHP
page contains an HTML FORM that uses $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] for the form
action method. This is a super global variable that returns the filename of
the currently executing script. There is no secure coding practices of
filtering input or sanitization of output e.g "htmlspecialchars()".
Therefore, panel users who visit a third-party adversary website or click
an infected link, can trigger arbitrary client side JS code execution in
the security context of the current user. This can result in data theft or
GEO location disclosure of the user accessing the smokebot web interface.

PHP snippet.

if ($_GET["mode"] === "reports"){
   $url_pattern = $_GET["logs_sru"];
   $id_pattern = $_GET["logs_sri"];

$action = $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]."?page=stealer&mode=reports";
%3Cform method=\"get\" action=\"{$action}\"%3E

Interestingly, they use PHP function htmlspecialchars() when retrieving
data from the "smoke bot" MySQL database.

$r = mysqli_query($dbcon,"SELECT * FROM `stealer` WHERE `cname`='{$id}'");
   while ($v = mysqli_fetch_assoc($r)){
   $stealer_host = htmlspecialchars($v["host"]);

However, it doesn't wrap $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] on the action method for the
FORM {$action} variable that handles user input.
