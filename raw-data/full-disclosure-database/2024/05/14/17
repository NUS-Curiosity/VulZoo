Threat: Panel.SmokeLoader
Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Family: SmokeLoader
Type: Web Panel
MD5: 4b5fc3a2489985f314b81d35eac3560f  (control.php)
SHA256: 8d02238577081be74b9ebc1effcfbf3452ffdb51f130398b5ab875b9bfe17743
Vuln ID: MVID-2024-0682
Disclosure: The smokebot admin web panel is written in PHP for remote
administration capability. The panel has multiple features like Bot List,
Task List, Stealer, Miner, Email Grab, KeyLogger etc. The "control.php" PHP
page contains an HTML FORM using POST method, however there is no CSRF
security token used by the FORM. This is a unique token per session within
the FORM, used as a challenge to the server to help prevent
cross-site-scripting attacks. Therefore, third-party adversaries who can
lure a panel user to visit an attacker controlled webpage or click an
infected link may result in the panel users submitting FORMS on an
attackers behalf. This may result in code execution, data theft, GEO
location disclosure.


Exploit/PoC:
1) CSRF to add your own Miner Pool
