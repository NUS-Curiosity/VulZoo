Summary:
   According to the Product Website Drupal-Wiki is an enterprise grade Wiki platform.
   The comment function of a Drupal-Wiki-Page is prone to persistent Cross-Site Scritping 
   Attacks (persistent XSS).
   
Effect:
   A remote attacker that is allowed to edit a wiki page or comment to a wiki page is able to 
   execute arbitrary (javascript) code within a victims' browser after the victim has opened
   a wiki page with malicous comments or content. 

Example:
	1) XSS in comments to a Wiki Page
	The Following steps are needed to exploit the vulnerability on a Wiki-Page assuming
	that no login is needed to comment on a page.
		1. Go to an arbitrary Wiki-Page.
		2. Click on "submit comment" at the lower end of a Wiki Page
		3. Enter the following into the comment form overlay and click on 
        the "save" button:
		   "'><img src=x onError=alert('XSS!')>
	
	The above code creates a harmless JavaScript alert box whenever the Wiki-Page gets
	loaded.
	2) XSS in captions:
	Open a Wiki-Page, insert a caption with the payload from example 1) and save it.
	
	
	3) XSS in image titles
	Open a Wiki-Page, insert an image with the payload from example 1) as title and save it.
	
	
Solution
	Update to release 8.31.1 or newer.
