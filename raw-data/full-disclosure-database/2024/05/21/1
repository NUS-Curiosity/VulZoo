CVSS score: tbd* (but "High")
CVSS vector: tbd*
CWE: CWE-79

*Needs to be calculated, taking into consideration the initial partial base string "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N" since the Privileges Required of who send the mail with the payload is none as well as User Interaction (who is receiving the mail, just visualizing it could trigger the payload - like, for example, to grab session cookie) despite arguable by someone, Scope and C/I/A (surely from Low to High) must be contextualized from the perspective of the application, what it is used for, contains/impacts and is connected to it: indeed, being a sensitive component "through a modern user interface and a single authentication, it allows access to company mail, calendars, contacts, tasks, documents and much more, in a shared and secure platform" (quoting the product description), that means any kind of highly confidential information, even connected cloud instance (also outside the private network) and mobile devices synchronization.
