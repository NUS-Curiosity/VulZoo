Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the
product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential
further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Local Privilege Escalation via writable files (CVE-2024-0670)
In some cases, the software creates temporary files inside the directory
C:\Windows\Temp that get executed afterwards. An attacker can leverage this
to place write-protected malicious files in the directory beforehand. The files
get executed by Checkmk with SYSTEM privileges allowing attackers to escalate
their privileges.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Local Privilege Escalation via writable files (CVE-2024-0670)
In the first step, the filename that will be used by Checkmk needs to be found.
The application creates temporary files with name cmk_{}_{}_{}.cmd. The
placeholders are replaced with a string, the process id and a counter. The first
string was always 'all' and the counter usually is 0. The process id is not
exactly predictable. However, Windows assigns those numbers in increasing order.
This allows to observe the currently used process ids and define a limited
range of probable ids.

In the second step, the attacker places the malicious binary into the folder
C:\Windows\Temp multiple times. The filenames are constructed using the above
pattern for all different probable ids. After placing the files, the attacker
marks them as read-only. Both can be automated using the following powershell
command. Here, the range of probable ids was determined to be between 10000
and 30000. The file C:\Users\attacker\Desktop\mal.exe is the malicious file.

10000..30000 | foreach {
	copy C:\Users\attacker\Desktop\mal.exe C:\Windows\Temp\cmk_all_${_}_1.cmd;
	Set-ItemProperty -path C:\Windows\Temp\cmk_all_${_}_1.cmd -name IsReadOnly -value $true;
}

For this proof of concept, a binary was created using msfvenom that executes
the command whoami and writes the result to a file. This will allow to verify
the successful execution as the SYSTEM user. The following command was used:

msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='cmd /c "whoami > C:\abc\file"' -f exe -o mal.exe

It should be noted, that the folder C:\abc has to exist and that the anti-virus
solution must be disabled to execute this particular binary.

The final step is to force Checkmk to write and execute those temporary files.

It was observed that repairing the software is enough. This repair process can
be initiated via the Windows GUI or using the following command. The name
fafda3e.msi will be different on every system. The folder C:\Windows\Installer
can be investigated to find the correct name on a given system.

msiexec /fa C:\Windows\Installer\fafda3e.msi

After the repairing finished, the file written by the malicious binary can be
checked. It was created and contains the string "nt authority\system".
