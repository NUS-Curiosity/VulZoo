Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Jeemp.c
Vulnerability: Cleartext Hardcoded Credentials
Description: The malware listens on three TCP ports which are randomized
e.g. 9719,7562,8687,8948,7376,8396 so forth. There is an ESMTP server
component "jeem.mail.pv" requiring authentication for the GDATA, SDATA
commands and sample is packed using UPX. However, it is trivial to unpack
using the -d flag which reveals the cleartext hardcoded credentials
"jeepower" and "jeespower" in the PE file.
