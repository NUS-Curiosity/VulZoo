WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION
The societies of today's world are becoming increasingly dependent on online
services, where commercial activities, business transactions, government
services and biomedical diagnostics are realized. This tendency has been
evident during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. These developments, along with
the growing number of military conflicts worldwide (Ukraine, Israel, etc.),
have led to the fast development of new cyber threats and numerous
information security issues that are exploited by cybercriminals. The
inability to provide trusted, secure services in contemporary computer
network technologies has a tremendous socio-economic impact on global
enterprises as well as individuals.

Moreover, the frequently occurring international frauds impose the necessity
to conduct investigations spanning multiple domains and countries. Such
examination is often subject to different jurisdictions and legal systems. A
good illustration of the above is the Internet, which has made it easier to
prepare and perpetrate traditional - but now cyber-enabled - crimes. It has
acted as an alternate avenue for criminals to conduct their activities and
launch attacks with relative anonymity, a high degree of deniability, and
the opportunity to operate in a border-agnostic environment. Worrying
developments in the abuse of artificial intelligence and machine learning
technologies lead to the increased capabilities of malign actors who
leverage these tools to design and propagate disinformation, which is
especially dangerous (and effective) during emergencies and crises of all
kinds. The developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence have also
enabled the increase of criminal capabilities in the production,
dissemination, and weaponization of high-quality, convincing fake contact
(text, audio, images, and videos), which translates not only to the truth
and trust decay among the affected societies but also to the enhanced
capabilities in orchestrating the sophisticated cyber crimes. 

Furthermore, nowadays, the majority of life-science-based techniques and
resulting data hinge on information technologies. Despite their considerable
advantages, dependence on cyber technologies also exposes vulnerabilities.
Various threats in the digital realm could target biomedical systems,
leading to adverse consequences. The field of CyberBioSecurity was
established to assist bio-related sciences in comprehending potential cyber
threats and formulating defense approaches, recovery protocols, and
resilience strategies. The increased complexity of communications and the
networking infrastructure is making the investigation of these new types of
crimes difficult. Traces of illegal digital activities are difficult to
analyze due to large volumes of data. Nowadays, the digital crime scene
functions like any other network, with dedicated administrators functioning
as the first responders. 

This poses new challenges for law enforcement and intelligence communities
and forces computer societies to utilize digital forensics to combat the
increasing number of cybercrimes. Forensic professionals must be fully
prepared to be able to provide court-admissible evidence. To make these
goals achievable, forensic techniques should keep pace with new
technologies. Prevention, mitigation, and interdiction of new and emerging
threats necessitates an increasingly thorough and multidisciplinary
approaches, but also requires the collaboration of all relevant actors and
stakeholders in designing the technology regulation and cyber governance
measures.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together the research outcomes provided
by researchers from academia and the industry. The other goal is to show the
latest research results in digital forensics and cyberbiosecurity amongst
others. We strongly encourage prospective authors to submit articles
presenting both theoretical approaches and practical case reviews, including
work-in-progress reports.
