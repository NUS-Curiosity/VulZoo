Vuln ID: MVID-2024-0686
Disclosure: 06/17/2024
Description: The PlugX malware installs a service "McAfeeOEMInfoOME"
which runs as SYSTEM. It also creates a hidden directory
"TaskSchedulerome" under C:\ProgramData, granting full (F) permissions
to the Everyone user group. Any user can replace the PE files dropped
by the malware to disable it or replace it with their own executable.
Then wait for a privileged user to logon to the infected machine to
potentially escalate privileges.

Exploit/PoC:
cacls C:\ProgramData\TaskSchedulerome\mcf.exe
ProgramData\TaskSchedulerome\mcf.exe Everyone:(OI)(CI)F

attrib -s -h C:\ProgramData\TaskSchedulerome

dir /a C:\ProgramData\TaskSchedulerome

 Directory of C:\ProgramData\TaskSchedulerome
