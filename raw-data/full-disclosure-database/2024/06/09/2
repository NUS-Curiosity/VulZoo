Threat: Trojan.Win32.DarkGateLoader (multi variants)
Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution
Description: Multiple variants of this malware look for and execute
x32-bit "urlmon.dll" PE file in its current directory. Therefore, we
can hijack that DLL and execute our own code to intercept and
terminate the malware. Once loaded the exploit dll will check if the
current directory is "C:\Windows\System32", if not we grab our process
ID and terminate. Leverage RansomLord v3.1 for DLL generation, while
written as a proof-of-concept to specifically defeat ransomware, it
can also be used to generate DLLs to try an exploit other types of
malwares. All basic tests were conducted successfully in a virtual
machine environment.

Family: DarkGateLoader
Type: PE32
MD5: afe012ed0d96abfe869b9e26ea375824
SHA256: 18d87c514ff25f817eac613c5f2ad39b21b6e04b6da6dbe8291f04549da2c290

Disclosure: 06/05/2024

Exploit/PoC:
1) Download RansomLord v3.1
    https://github.com/malvuln/RansomLord
2) Locate the x32 urlmon.dll entry using the -m flag (DLL Map)
3) Use -g flag (Generate Exploit) to output an x32 DLL urlmon.dll,
based on an existing vulnerable malware in the victims list.
4) (Optional) -e flag to setup Windows event IOC logging in the
registry, this will attempt to log the SHA256 hash, full path and
filename.
