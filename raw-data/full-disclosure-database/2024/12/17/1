Subject: [FD] RansomLordNG - anti-ransomware exploit tool

This next generation version dumps process memory of the targeted
Malware prior to termination The process memory dump file MalDump.dmp
varies in size and can be 50 MB plus RansomLord now intercepts and
terminates ransomware from 54 different threat groups Adding GPCode,

RansomLordNG leverages code execution vulnerabilities and saving
process memory to disk prior to termination of the Malware
pre-encryption. This may be useful as we can possibly avoid unpacking,
anti-debugging techniques or fully executing the malware. The MalDump
feature is optional and can be toggled to enabled=1 or disabled=0
