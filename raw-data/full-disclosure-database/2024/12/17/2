Subject: [FD] [KIS-2024-07] GFI Kerio Control <= 9.4.5 Multiple HTTP
 Response Splitting Vulnerabilities

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GFI Kerio Control <= 9.4.5 Multiple HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Links:

https://gfi.ai/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/keriocontrol
http://download.kerio.com


[-] Affected Versions:

All versions from 9.2.5 to 9.4.5.


[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

There are multiple HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities in GFI
Kerio Control. Following are some of the affected pages:

- /nonauth/addCertException.cs
- /nonauth/guestConfirm.cs
- /nonauth/expiration.cs

User input passed to these pages via the "dest" GET parameter is not
properly sanitized before being used to generate a "Location" HTTP
header in a 302 HTTP response. Specifically, the application does not
correctly filter/remove linefeed (LF) characters. This can be
exploited to perform HTTP Response Splitting attacks, which in turn
might allow to carry out Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and
possibly other attacks.

NOTE: the Reflected XSS vector might be abused to perform 1-click
Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.
