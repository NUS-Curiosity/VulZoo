Subject: Re: [FD] null pointer deference in nano via read_the_list()

Hi Meng,

In your recent mass posts to FD, are you reporting vulnerabilities or 
bug reports which have words like "segfault" in the title? What benefit 
do you see this having? Have you spoken to each upstream project before 
requesting a CVE be assigned?

Thank you,
Mark Esler
