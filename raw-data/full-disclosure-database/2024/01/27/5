More specifically, this issue is an out-of-bounds read.

AFAICT the issue was actually introduced in Graphviz 2.36. It was fixed 
in commit a95f977f5d809915ec4b14836d2b5b7f5e74881e (essentially 
reverting cf95714837f06f684929b54659523c2c9b1fc19f that introduced the 
issue), but there has been no release yet since then. The next release 
will be 10.0.0. So affected versions would be [2.36, 10.0.0).

To exploit this issue, you need to modify a typically-root-owned file. I 
am not suggesting it is hard to exploit, but see my remarks below.

Why was this issue gifted a CVE? If you want an out-of-bounds access in 
Graphviz, there is much lower hanging fruit.

As Alan Coopersmith has noted in a separate thread,¹ this stream of 
issues seems to have been bulk-created without much analysis. The CVE 
details still appear to be RESERVED in NVD. The Graphviz maintainers do 
not intend to contest this CVE, but I expect the details to be 
inaccurate when released as I’ve noted above.
