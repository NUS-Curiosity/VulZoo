Threat: TrojanSpy Win32 Nivdort
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions - EoP (SYSTEM)
Family: Nivdort
Type: PE32
MD5: 15bda00b57e2ed729a45f7cfa62165da
Vuln ID: MVID-2024-0668
Dropped files: dqrpgvnkh, egjrdhynfm, nhefhloix, rvoyf6ljtqg4zejno.exe

Description:
The malware creates a service which runs as SYSTEM and grants change (C)
permissions to the authenticated user group on its installation directory.
Standard low integrity users can still rename the service executable while
it is running, replace the PE file with their own and restart the infected
system to start the service.
