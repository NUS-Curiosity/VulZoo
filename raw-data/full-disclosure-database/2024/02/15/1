Talks are 45 minutes long with 5 minutes for Q&A. Workshops of flexible
length with a minimum of 60 minutes.

]-- Submissions

Submissions should be sent via the CFP website (https://cfp.44con.com/).
Submissions are reviewed by a panel consisting of end-user industry 
specialists, from industry rock stars and CxOs to burned out techies.

In particular, we are looking for original talks of the highest quality 
in the following areas:

9. Networking and Comms
10. UK and European Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)

New talks tend to score higher than repeat talks in the CFP review stage
but this is not a hard and fast rule. If you plan to repeat a talk less 
than 6 months after 44CON, we need to know when and where so we can plan
for it.

Note: this is not an exhaustive list. If you have a good talk proposal 
covering something not mentioned above, please let us know.
