Subject: [FD] Research about usage & possible issues of the NVD

Hello there!

The University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Germany) is conducting a research 
study to investigate the usage and possible issues of the NVD (National 
Vulnerability Database). If you are using the NVD regularly, we would 
greatly appreciate your participation which contributes to the 
improvement of vulnerability management. You can read more about the 
survey here:

The survey takes 10 min on average. This is a direct link:

The survey will be running until the middle of March. It would be great 
if you could complete it as soon as possible for you.
If you are not using the NVD regularly, but know people who are, we 
would be very grateful if you helped us and distributed this survey to them.

Thank you!
