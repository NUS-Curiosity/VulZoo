Threat: Backdoor.Win32.JustJoke.21 (BackDoor Pro - v2.0b4)
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution
Family: JustJoke
Type: PE32
MD5: 4dc39c05bcc93e600dd8de16f2f7c599
SHA256: 55662483e663bde98d729489c6b25986003a40df1e2be376b0c3b20d2d6c7987
Vuln ID: MVID-2024-0689
Dropped files: Scanvegw.exe
Disclosure: 09/03/2024
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 28072.  Upon execution,
throws an error alert dialog with message: "File DATA1.CAB not
found!". The backdoor then drops a hidden PE file named "Scanvegw.exe"
in SysWoW64 use attrib -s -h. The malware then makes outbound
connections to SMTP port 25. Hit enter twice when sending commands use
"E" for Execute and "T" for Terminate. Calling programs incorrectly
still gives a response of "Executed!" when it actually fails. The
malware calls Win32 WinExec API, supply full path to the file.
