~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The software product C-MOR is an IP video surveillance system.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"With C-MOR video surveillance, it is possible to check your
surveillance over network and the Internet. You can access the live
view as well as previous recordings from any PC or mobile device.
C-MOR is managed and controlled over the C-MOR web interface.
IP settings, camera recording setup, user rights and so on are set
over the web without the installation of any software on the
client."[1]

Due to improper input validation, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable
to reflected cross-site scripting attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

By analyzing the C-MOR web interface, it was found that different
functions are prone to reflected cross-site scripting attacks due to
insufficient user input validation.

This kind of attack allows an attacker to send a manipulated link to
an authenticated victim in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript code
in the context of the victim's web browser.

Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were found in the
following C-MOR scripts and exploited via different URL parameters,
for instance the parameter "ujava":

* index-de.plm
* list-timelapse.plm
* list-motion.plm
* setdelays.plm
* show-movies.plm
* show-movies-f.plm
* uploadcambackup.plm

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The following three sample attack vectors exemplarily demonstrate
the found security issue.

1) index-de.plm

The following URL is an example of an attack vector exploiting a
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability via the URL parameter
"ujava" of the web interface index page "index-de.plm":

https://<HOST>/index-de.pml?ujava="><script>alert("SySS XSS!")</script><z="


2) list-timelapse.plm

The following URL is an example of an attack vector exploiting a
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the page
"list-timelapse.plm" via the URL parameter "days":

https://<HOST>/list-timelapse.pml?days=1100&cam=cam1"><script>alert("SySS 
XSS!")</script><z="


3) show-movies.plm

The following URL is an example of an attack vector exploiting a
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the page
"show-movies.plm" via the URL parameter "days":

https://<HOST>/show-movies.pml?cam=cam1&days="><script>alert("SySS 
XSS!")</script><z="

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

Install C-MOR Video Surveillance version 6.00PL1.
