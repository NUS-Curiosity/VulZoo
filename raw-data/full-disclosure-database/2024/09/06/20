~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The software product C-MOR is an IP video surveillance system.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"With C-MOR video surveillance, it is possible to check your
surveillance over network and the Internet. You can access the live
view as well as previous recordings from any PC or mobile device.
C-MOR is managed and controlled over the C-MOR web interface.
IP settings, camera recording setup, user rights and so on are set
over the web without the installation of any software on the
client."[1]

The C-MOR system uses several outdated third-party software components
with known security vulnerabilities.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

By analyzing the C-MOR system, it was found that the C-MOR system depends
on several outdated third-party software components with known security
vulnerabilities, for instance an old Linux kernel, Apache HTTP Server
2.2.16, PHP 5.3.3, or Python 2.6.

Some of the used software components have also reached their end of life
and are not supported anymore by a maintainer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The following excerpt of the "dpkg-query" output illustrates some outdated
third-party software components used on the C-MOR system:
