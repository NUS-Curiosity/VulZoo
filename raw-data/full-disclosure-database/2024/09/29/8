Vuln ID: MVID-2024-0700
Disclosure: 09/27/2024
Description: The RAT listens on TCP ports 200 and 15000. Third-party
adversaries who can reach an infected host, can execute commands made
available by the malware. Commands are sent in Spanish, using netcat
or telnet fails to run cmds after connecting as they send CRLFs e.g.
"quitar\r\n" fails "quitar" succeeds. Therefore, we need a custom
client to send commands to the Benju RAT.
