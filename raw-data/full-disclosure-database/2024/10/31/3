Subject: [FD] xlibre Xnest security advisory & bugfix releases

XLibre project security advisory
---------------------------------

As Xlibre Xnest is based on Xorg, it is affected by some security issues
which recently became known in Xorg:

  CVE-2024-9632: can be triggered by providing a modified bitmap to the
X.Org server.
  CVE-2024-9632: Heap-based buffer overflow privilege escalation in
_XkbSetCompatMap

See:  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-9632


Affected versions:

   * 24.1.0
   * 24.2.0


24.1.x release:

    Repo:   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/metux/xserver.git
    Branch: xlibre/xnest/24.1
    Tag:    xnest-24.1.1
    SHA:    11450b0946c1035944c5946d665f21f83356b6b9

24.2.x release:

    Repo:   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/metux/xserver.git

These bugfix branches also contain several other pointer and bounds
related problems that haven't been rated as possibly exploitable yet,
but no other unnecessary changes which don't fix actual bugs.

All users are strongly advised to upgrade to the fixed mainenance
releases ASAP.
