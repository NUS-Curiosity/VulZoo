Subject: [FD] [RESEARCH] DTLS 'ClientHello' Race Conditions in WebRTC
	Implementations

Dear Full Disclosure community,

We've released a white paper detailing a critical vulnerability affecting multiple WebRTC implementations: "DTLS 'ClientHello' Race Conditions in WebRTC Implementations".

White paper: https://www.enablesecurity.com/research/webrtc-hello-race-conditions-paper.pdf

Key points:

1. Vulnerability: Failure to properly verify the origin of DTLS "ClientHello" messages in WebRTC sessions.
2. Impact: Potential for denial of service attacks.
3. Affected implementations (all Open-Source projects have been patched in latest versions):
   - RTPEngine
   - Asterisk
   - FreeSWITCH
   - Skype (PSTN)

4. Tested but not vulnerable:
   - Janus, Discord, Dolby.io, Facebook Messenger, Google Meet, LiveKit Meet, Webex, Zoho Meeting, Zoom, Mediasoup

5. Root cause: Not a specification bug, but a common implementation oversight.

Methodology:
- Extensive testing on open-source and proprietary WebRTC implementations
- Focus on media servers and popular communication platforms

This research expands on our previous blog post, providing more comprehensive details and analysis.

We invite the community to review our findings, methodology, and recommendations. Your feedback and further research into WebRTC security is welcome.
