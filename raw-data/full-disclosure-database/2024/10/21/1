CVE-2024-48939: Unauthorized enabling of API in Paxton Net2 software


========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
Bypass of Paxton Net2 API license. Possible leaking of PII and access to 
admin functionality.
No physical access to computer running Paxton Net2 is required.

========================================================================
Product
========================================================================
* Paxton Net2  (version < 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4))

========================================================================
Detailed description
========================================================================
Paxton Net2 software offers an API. This API offers the user access to 
sensitive data such as access logs and other
user data.[2]
In order to enable the API a license file is needed. The license file is 
trivial to generate as demonstrated in POC in ref [1].
This is possible while the signature checks in the Net2 software were 
not functional for the license file.
Additionally to the license file user credentials are needed to 
authenticate against the API.
The vendor has fixed this in version 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4) of the Net2 
software.

========================================================================
Solution
========================================================================
Upgrade Paxton Net2 to version 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4)

========================================================================
Mitigation
========================================================================
1) If an upgrade is not an option - as `anyone' can create valid license 
files; ensure that the filesystem of
computers running Paxton Net2 are not reachable by unauthorised entities.
2) Evaluate the impact of the disclosure of any configurations rolled 
out prior to these mitigation steps
