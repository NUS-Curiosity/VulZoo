      "document": "# CVE-2019-16113 Bludit Directory Traversal Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nBludit is a web application written in PHP to build your own website or blog, free and open source. It uses files in JSON format to store the content, so it is configuration-free.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in the upload-images.php file, where a remote user could upload a fake image file that is actually a malicious PHP payload, and gain remote code execution.\r\n\r\n## Technical Analysis\r\n\r\nThe vulnerable file (upload-images.php) is written as follows:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php defined('BLUDIT') or die('Bludit CMS.');\r\nheader('Content-Type: application/json');\r\n/*\r\n| Upload an image to a particular page\r\n|\r\n| @_POST['uuid']\tstring\tPage uuid\r\n|\r\n| @return\t\tarray\r\n*/\r\n// $_POST\r\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n$uuid = empty($_POST['uuid']) ? false : $_POST['uuid'];\r\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n// Set upload directory\r\nif ($uuid && IMAGE_RESTRICT) {\r\n\t$imageDirectory = PATH_UPLOADS_PAGES.$uuid.DS;\r\n\t$thumbnailDirectory = $imageDirectory.'thumbnails'.DS;\r\n\tif (!Filesystem::directoryExists($thumbnailDirectory)) {\r\n\t\tFilesystem::mkdir($thumbnailDirectory, true);\r\n\t}\r\n} else {\r\n\t$imageDirectory = PATH_UPLOADS;\r\n\t$thumbnailDirectory = PATH_UPLOADS_THUMBNAILS;\r\n}\r\n$images = array();\r\nforeach ($_FILES['images']['name'] as $uuid=>$filename) {\r\n\t// Check for errors\r\n\tif ($_FILES['images']['error'][$uuid] != 0) {\r\n\t\t$message = $L->g('Maximum load file size allowed:').' '.ini_get('upload_max_filesize');\r\n\t\tLog::set($message, LOG_TYPE_ERROR);\r\n\t\tajaxResponse(1, $message);\r\n\t}\r\n\t// Convert URL characters such as spaces or quotes to characters\r\n\t$filename = urldecode($filename);\r\n\t// Move from PHP tmp file to Bludit tmp directory\r\n\tFilesystem::mv($_FILES['images']['tmp_name'][$uuid], PATH_TMP.$filename);\r\n\t// Transform the image and generate the thumbnail\r\n\t$image = transformImage(PATH_TMP.$filename, $imageDirectory, $thumbnailDirectory);\r\n\tif ($image) {\r\n\t\t$filename = Filesystem::filename($image);\r\n\t\tarray_push($images, $filename);\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\t$message = $L->g('File type is not supported. Allowed types:').' '.implode(', ',$GLOBALS['ALLOWED_IMG_EXTENSION']);\r\n\t\tLog::set($message, LOG_TYPE_ERROR);\r\n\t\tajaxResponse(1, $message);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\najaxResponse(0, 'Images uploaded.', array(\r\n\t'images'=>$images\r\n));\r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first thing that happens is that the code retrieves the \"uuid\" parameter from a POST request:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$uuid = empty($_POST['uuid']) ? false : $_POST['uuid'];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe uuid is used as part of the image directory path. If the path doesn't exist, then it will be automatically created:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif ($uuid && IMAGE_RESTRICT) {\r\n\t$imageDirectory = PATH_UPLOADS_PAGES.$uuid.DS;\r\n\t$thumbnailDirectory = $imageDirectory.'thumbnails'.DS;\r\n\tif (!Filesystem::directoryExists($thumbnailDirectory)) {\r\n\t\tFilesystem::mkdir($thumbnailDirectory, true);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, the code starts uploading the file by accessing the `$_FILES` variables. In here, the content of the uploaded item isn't checked, which means even though the file expects an image file, it doesn't actually have to be. A malicious PHP payload could be uploaded instead:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nforeach ($_FILES['images']['name'] as $uuid=>$filename) {\r\n  // ... code ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, the file is moved from PHP's temp file to a custom tmp directory:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nFilesystem::mv($_FILES['images']['tmp_name'][$uuid], PATH_TMP.$filename);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though the image upload is uploaded to Bluedit's tmp directory, you can actually also upload a .htaccess file to allow the PHP payload to be accessed remotely, and gain remote code execution.",

Just noticed https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/12565 which might be useful as well.\r\n\r\nShodan only shows _maybe_ one host on the internet exposing this port in something that could plausibly look like JMX. The next great internet work this will not be: https://www.shodan.io/search?query=port%3A18983\r\n\r\nI'm giving this a high attacker utility but _also_ a low urgency to patch, because the patch is almost irrelevant here. If you're using the default solr config, your solr install probably doesn't work anyway! The patch isn't really required to fix this configuration bug,, and you could be vulnerable with or without updating to a newer version. Even if you patch, if you have the a bad config, it's not necessarily going to auto-update either. Any authenticated vuln scan is probably going to produce misleading results about whether you're actually vulnerable or not, unless it checks your config file. Doing a remote scan is much better.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation is really just making sure you don't deploy a config that leaves unauth RMI servers on a network, but nothing really stops you from shooting yourself in the foot either. Note that Solr's own docs tell you how to enable this bit, but also it says to not use it in production. https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_0/using-jmx-with-solr.html\r\n\r\n",

A user needs to open a handle to this device and issue `NtDeviceIoControlFile` using the IOCTL `0x22a050` to trigger the vulnerable code path. The buffer to be passed to the process is the target PID to open and 0 packed as two QWORD values (`buffer = [pid, 0].pack('QQ')`. This ultimately leads to a call to `ZwOpenProcess` which does not perform as many security checks as `NtOpenProcess`, thus allowing a user to open a handle to an arbitrary process.\r\n\r\nTo gain code execution from this vulnerability, the `user32!LockWindowStatoin` function can be hooked within the `winlogon` process. This process and function are ideal targets because `winlogon` runs as `NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` and the function can be triggered on demand. As a by product of exploiting this, the screen will be locked, which may tip off an observant user who is interacting with the system at the time of exploitation.\r\n\r\nExploitation of this vulnerability is quite reliable as it does not rely on memory corruption.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n* https://warroom.rsmus.com/cve-2017-9769/\r\n* https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/windows/local/razer_zwopenprocess.rb",

      "document": "This plugin has approximately 1000 active installations and 24,816 downloads according to [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plainview-activity-monitor/advanced/). The vulnerable versions are approximately 25% of the active installations, which is not that much. Also, the attacker needs to be authenticated with a privileged account to make it exploitable, which reduce the likelihood of exploitation. However, the vulnerability is very easy to exploit: a simple HTTP POST request with a specially crafted `ip` parameter:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -b '<your_session_cookie>;' \\\r\n     -d 'ip=127.0.0.1|cat%20/etc/passwd&lookup=Lookup&submit=Submit%20request' \\\r\n     'http://my_wordpress.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=plainview_activity_monitor&tab=activity_tools'\r\n```\r\n The root cause is a call to `exec()` with concatenation of unsanitized input (activities_overview.php:357):\r\n```php\r\nexec( 'dig -x ' . $ip, $output );\r\n```",

      "document": "A vulnerability exists within the Razer Synapse driver `rzpnk.sys` in the IOCTL dispatch routine for 0x226048 that can allow an attacker to pass an input buffer which can trigger an out of bounds read operation. A handle can be opened to issue this IOCTL from `\\\\.\\47CD78C9-64C3-47C2-B80F-677B887CF095`. The result will cause a denial of service condition on the system in the form of a blue screen of death (BSOD).\r\n\r\nThe first four bytes of the buffer are used as the size, first to allocate space and then to read from the source. Since the allocation is of the proper size, an out of bounds write can not be accomplished. If however the specified size is larger than the buffer, then the `memcpy`will continue to read data after the buffer ends.\r\n\r\nBuild the buffer to trigger the exception in Python:\r\n```\r\n# the first 4 bytes are the size then it must be padded to at least 0x220 bytes\r\nbuffer_ = struct.pack('I', 0x70000000) + (b'\\x00' * 0x21c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nProof of Concept code:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/zeroSteiner/829c313b942f944375b67a6535f01992#file-cve_2017_9770-py",

      "document": "This vulnerability [appears](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679) to be based on a web request to a `/vpns/` resource containing a directory traversal reference. The traversal reference seems to grant access to the admin portal. This specifically is blocked by the `skip_systemaccess_policyeval` flag in the [interim fix](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679) published by Citrix. Based on what information is available publicly, the vulnerability can be exploited to gain code execution on the Citrix server without authentication information. This would be very useful to an attacker because it could be exploited remotely, without authentication and due to the nature of Citrix servers often having a lot of traffic which could facilitate an attacker's efforts to obfuscate their activity.\r\n\r\nIn some environments, Cirtix servers may not be patched as frequently as other systems due to their mission critical nature of providing applications for external users. In this case, attackers may have an easier time in escalating their privileges once code execution has been obtained. This would only be necessary if the initial vector did not already yield `NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges which the current information does not specify.",

Getting root on an RD Gateway server would be super useful for all sorts of internet crime, and this is an ideal sort of vulnerability for just that -- pre-auth, on first connection.\r\n",

      "document": "I played around trying to create a module for this, and it matches the original PoC put out by Polarbear.  The way it works is that on a VM with the proper version of VMWare tools installed, you can run the repair operation and briefly, a trusted file in a trusted location (C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\VMware\\\\VMware CAF\\\\pme\\\\scripts\\\\stop-listener.bat) has permissions lowered.  If an attacker can touch the file at the right time, they can maintain control over the file after the repair is over if the timing is right.  The method to take that overwrite to SYSTEM is still as yet unreleased, as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nDefenders can watch for some obvious behaviors just in this process.  The attacker has to run a specific command (msiexec /fa <installer file>), then while it is running, continually attempt to access a specific file (C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\VMware\\\\VMware CAF\\\\pme\\\\scripts\\\\stop-listener.bat), and once they control that file,  they must include malicious code and somehow somehow run it resulting in a privilege escalation.  Defenders can add this behavior to HIDS signatures as a stopgap.\r\n\r\nThis exploit relies on previous access, and results in further compromise of the VM.  While important, there are challenges to get to a location that this exploit is useful, the required files represent a bottleneck on behavior, mitigations will not affect most users, the results are limited to the VM, and a patch is already out.  Defenders should patch as soon as possible, and add mitigations quickly, but for this to be a problem, attackers must already have a foothold into the computer.",

      "document": "This appears to be a bug with the authentication of elliptical curve cryptographic certificates definitely related to file source authentication through signing and possibly channel communications; there are unsubstantiated rumors about RCE, though I don't see a pathway for that beyond a MitM attack.  This is going to serve primarily as a local privilege escalation tool because Microsoft OSs depend on file authentication and privileged execution in some instances to avoid a requirement for user authenticated elevation for execution.  I am unclear on how difficult breaking into an established session might be, but certainly spoofed signed files would be useful to a hacker.\r\nOf the two likely scenarios, local privilege escalation seems the most likely, with MitM attacks possible.  This is likely not a wormable threat and will require some amount of time and effort on the part of the attacker.  Nation-state-level players might abuse this by owning update servers or routers and serving clients malicious signed updates or other binaries, but that's not a likely threat model for average person or even company.  In addition to the personalized nature of the attack vector, I imagine the barrier to writing even a local exploit would be higher than most, as cryptography is hard.\r\nThis is interesting, it is bad, and it should be patched, but it is not at the level of something like eternalblue or even bluekeep, in my opinion.  I think that it was reported by the NSA has caused a bit more attention to it than the vulnerability warrants, but since there is a path to exploitation and a simple patch out that should have little effect on users, you should patch immediately.",

      "document": "This is one of a set of vulnerabilities discovered in the AMD Radeon graphics drivers for VMWare workstation by Talos including DoS vulnerabilities CVE-2019-5124, CVE-2019-5147, CVE-2019-5146.  2019-5183 is important because it allows overwriting the vtable and causing arbitrary code execution on the host OS, ~~~likely as a privileged~~~ user under vmware-vmx.exe.  The breakout allows an assailant to leave the Guest OS and enter the host OS.\r\nWhile it poses a risk, many mitigating factors affect the utility of the vulnerability.  This is a local exploit to the guest operating system, and thus requires previous access through another means.  Talos performed coordinated disclosure, so this vulnerability is already patched, allowing a fast mitigation strategy.  Further, given the limited and local nature of VMWare workstation, as well as the necessity for a specific driver to be in use, the reduced surface area for attackers decreases the return on investment to develop an attack which to my knowledge has not been seen in the wild, yet.\r\nBottom line is that this poses a risk and should be addressed, but it is not a scary, immediate risk.  Continue to patch through patching cycles and add signatures to IDS systems, but unless you have a very aggressive threat model, this is not an immediate threat.",

      "document": "This vulnerability originally outlined by [bishopfox](https://know.bishopfox.com/research/cve-2019-18935-remote-code-execution-in-telerik-ui) is a variation on CVE-2017-11317. The patch for CVE-2017-11317 introduced encryption on the object which prevents an attacker from modifying the object in such a way to achieve file upload as the original did. This mitigation, however uses a default value for the encryption key of `PrivateKeyForEncryptionOfRadAsyncUploadConfiguration` that if left unchanged can be used to encrypt an object to reproduce similar conditions to CVE-2017-11317. With the ability to upload an arbitrary file, a Mixed Mode Assembly can be uploaded to achieve RCE through the deserializeation functionality in `JavaScriptSerializer.\r\n\r\nUsers should change their encryption key (as [recommended](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security?_ga=2.98618715.414867971.1580929998-674280231.1580929998) by Telerik) to a strong password and restart their server to mitigate this vulnerability. At that point an attacker would have to recover that secret value to leverage this attack chain. Versions after and including R2 2017 SP1 are not configured with a default encryption key, making exploiting this dependent on recovering the key through another means.\r\n\r\nMitigation Strength set to 3/5 due to it being dependent on the strength of the password.",

      "document": "Wrote up a technical analysis of this bug for Exodus Intelligence at https://blog.exodusintel.com/2019/05/17/windows-within-windows/. The bug itself is relatively easy to trigger if you understand how Window messages work, but is a bit tricky to understand if your not familiar with this. Exploit reliability is high unless exploiting from the Chrome sandbox; in these scenarios it is still possible to exploit the target on older versions of Windows (Windows 7 and prior) however we did find that there was some interesting behavior going on with the Chrome sandbox escape shellcode as while it would disassociate the current process with the Chrome sandbox job (and henceforth the job's limitations), it would occasionally trigger APC_INDEX_MISMATCH errors under certain conditions, particularly if the target user was an administrator.\r\n\r\nTLDR: This exploit does takes a bit of knowledge of Win32k.sys and Windows internals to exploit, but provided an attacker has this knowledge, or has access to the public exploit, they can easily escalate their privileges to a SYSTEM user from any privilege level.",

      "document": "This is a vulnerability within NtGdiEnsureDpiDepDefaultGuiFontForPlateau() on Windows 10 which I wrote up an analysis of at https://versprite.com/blog/security-research/silently-patched-information-leak/. Originally I thought this was a silently patched bug, but Matt Miller corrected me on this (see https://twitter.com/epakskape/status/1215698153346744321)  The bug occurs due to the fact that GreEnsureDpiDepDefaultGuiFontForPlateau() naturally leaks the value of the win32kbase!gahDpiDepDefaultGuiFonts pointer under certain conditions. which can allow attackers to potentially bypass KASLR under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, this was fixed by Microsoft patching NtGdiEnsureDpiDepDefaultGuiFontForPlateau() so that it always returns 0 by adding an extra instruction which does:\r\n\r\nxor eax, eax\r\n\r\nThis is shown in the screenshots in the article. As NtGdiEnsureDpiDepDefaultGuiFontForPlateau() was only added within Windows 10 v1709 (see j00ru's system call list at https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/win32k/64/ and search for NtGdiEnsureDpiDepDefaultGuiFontForPlateau() ) , this bug is unique to Windows 10 hosts despite the fact that this CVE actually covers several related bugs (see Matt Millers comment on this at https://twitter.com/epakskape/status/1217189528806412288).",

      "document": "As a privilege escalation does still need an initial vector onto the phone, so requires either another exploit or additional tradecraft. This is unlikely to work in conjunction with a Chrome exploit today because many phones run a 64-bit kernel + 32-bit Chrome, perhaps for this very reason!.\r\n\r\nAfter testing the [Metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/12465) it took a considerable amount of specific targeting effort to get just the right model, and because the phone has a feature/bug that made it difficult to downgrade firmware (and the phone likes to upgrade on its own very easily), targeting this after disclosure may be very difficult.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you can find this bug or a similar one on a common phone that is past applying security updates, it could be useful for privesc from a malicious app. But I think the issue that plagues a lot of Android binary exploitation vulns is the lack of generality and there being lower-hanging fruit.",

The vulnerability itself exists within CWerService::SvcMergeETWLogs within Wersvc.dll according to the writeup.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see in the writeup the bug is a race condition which is relatively difficult to exploit, however because it is within the Windows Error Reporting Service it should be available by default on most Windows systems. Successful exploitation will result in arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user.\r\n\r\nRated this as medium on exploitation as whilst it is a race condition, the fact that one is able to gain a 4-5 second window to exploit the bug by taking advantage of how the GetTempFileNameW() operation works. for generating the temp file name. Basically by prepopulating a directory with all file names from WER0000.tmp to WERFFFE.tmp (aka 0000 to FFFE), one forces GetTempFileNameW() to generate a file with the name WERFFFF.tmp.\r\n\r\nThen following steps are executed (taken from writeup):\r\n\r\n\r\nThen , I put all the WER***.tmp in $pwd\\1\\, and junction $pwd\\2\\ -> $pwd\\1\\;\r\n\r\nwe create a process to continuously trigger this function with the path $pwd\\2\\. and create the other process to continuously execute the command SetOplock $pwd\\1\\WERFFFF.tmp;\r\n\r\nOnce the Oplock is triggered , we junction $pwd\\2\\ -> \\RPC CONTROL\\, and then create object symbolic \\RPC CONTROL\\WERFFFF.tmp -> $target and \\RPC CONTROL\\WERFFFF.tmp.etl -> $target\r\n\r\nRelease the oplock , the target file will be deleted with system privilege\r\n\r\n",

I will put a few quotes in here as they display my ideas of why this should be considered high priority and have better writing skills than I do, unfortunately. \r\nI was initially alerted (again) to this CVE with the Thread linked here : https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1232368620270911488\r\nI agree, enterprise environments with Internet facing Exchange. As stated in the thread, you can see a simple search with shodan.io will expose this vulnerability. There are thousands that qualify. \r\n\r\nHere is another, more formal and thorough analysis I think you will find helpful: https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/2/24/cve-2020-0688-remote-code-execution-on-microsoft-exchange-server-through-fixed-cryptographic-keys\r\n\r\nHere is a video of bug in action. \r\nhttps://youtu.be/7d_HoQ0LVy8\r\n\r\nThis is a RCE vulnerability that effects Microsoft Exchange Server. Now a patch was released, but Microsoft has not classified this as critical, so we will see how effective it is. \r\n\r\n\"Instead of having randomly-generated keys on a per-installation basis, all installations of Microsoft Exchange Server have the same validationKey and decryptionKey values in web.config. These keys are used to provide security for ViewState. ViewState is server-side data that ASP.NET web applications store in serialized format on the client. The client provides this data back to the server via the __VIEWSTATE request parameter. \"\r\n\r\nI welcome any discussion, please tell me if I missing something. I would love to hear more about this and if any Blue Team has had an incident already. \r\nTake care!",

The [write up](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/2/24/cve-2020-0688-remote-code-execution-on-microsoft-exchange-server-through-fixed-cryptographic-keys) by ZDI outlines an exploitation path in grate detail how the vulnerability would be leveraged to gain command execution as `NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` on the server.\r\n\r\nThe root of the issue is that the `validationKey` is not randomized at installation time, resulting in Exchange servers using an attacker known value. This value can be used to submit crafted data to the server that passes validation checks and is ultimately deserialized which can result in code execution.\r\n\r\nThe important values from the write up are:\r\n``` \r\nvalidationkey = CB2721ABDAF8E9DC516D621D8B8BF13A2C9E8689A25303BF\r\nvalidationalg = SHA1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI anticipate that the largest barrier to developing a PoC for this will be setting up and configuring a target environment. Exploiting this vulnerability requires authenticating as a user. The user must be a member of the `Domain Users` group and have a configured mailbox in Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe ViewState must be transferred within a GET request, POST can not be used.

      "document": "\" Multiple ZyXEL devices achieve authentication by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username parameter contains certain characters, it can allow command injection with the privileges of the web server that runs on the ZyXEL device. Although the web server does not run as the root user, many ZyXEL devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges.\r\n\r\nExploit code for this vulnerability that targets NAS devices is available on the internet. \"\r\n\r\nExploits are available. What interests me is this shodan.io search posted with 138,000+ devices still vulnerable. A firmware update has been released for most versions of device however, \" Block access to the ZyXEL device web interface \" is the advice for remaining or an alternative. \r\nHere is the shodan search I put in as a reference for the topic as well. Again, you're expert opinion is much more valuable than mine at this early stage. I am unfortunately unable to test these in my lab environment due to other commitments. \r\n\r\nedit: I might be mistaken CVE-2020-9054 is listed as the exploit here: https://kb.cert.org/artifacts/cve-2020-9054.html\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.shodan.io/search?query=ssl.cert.subject.CN%3Ausg\r\nhttps://www.nist.gov/fusion-search?s=CVE-2020-9054\r\nhttps://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1231987991473602561",

      "document": "The TL;DR from the technical whitepaper found here: https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ESET_Kr00k.pdf\r\n\r\n If there are outbound TX queue packets for certain common WiFi devices, and a disassociation management packet is sent, the device will clear the encryption key to all zeros, and send the remaining packet data in the queue with that hardcoded key. If an attacker can send diassociate packets and then listen for any residual data frames, they can decrypt whatever traffic remains in the TX queue on those devices, which may be a few hundred packets depending on the data rate involved.\r\n\r\nWhile this seems like a real risk, I'm firmly in the camp that relying on the physical layer in the first place for data protection is misguided, and that really end-to-end security is still the only way to - Wifi has proven over and over to be a weak security boundary. By the time this is wide-spread fixed, we'll all be using DNS-over-HTTPS by force from browsers anyway. So, from an end-point consumer PoV, this isn't a big deal. Not any worse that connecting to that unencrypted hotel network you may have used earlier.\r\n\r\nSome potential future vuln predictions here: https://twitter.com/vanhoefm/status/1232738451587555328\r\n\r\nThinking through situations where an attacker might find this useful would be in physically accessing business-local OT networks, like point-of-sale, manufacturing, or other squishy-on-the-inside networks. Expect to see this show up in the next Wifi Pineapple release or in your next pen test physical engagement report.",

      "document": "This vulnerability only exists if the High Availability (HA) service of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem is enabled, which is not by default. This service enables an attacker to authenticate using a high-privilege default account with a static password (hardcoded). This attack could be executed by anyone without any specific skills, all he has to do is to authenticate using the default password, and no valid login is even required.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a critical vulnerability, since you can have access (read and write) to the system's data and change configurations. However, it looks like the level of privileges would not grant access to the sensitive parts of the system. So, that said, and considering the affected service is not enabled by default, it does not look that critical.\r\n\r\nThis requires more investigation to understand what can be done with this level of privileges. I did a very quick search on the internet and was not able to find this default password. Some patch reversing might need to be done to find it and start investigating.\r\n",
