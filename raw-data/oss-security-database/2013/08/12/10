That looks like the wrong fix to me. Surely if the assumption is that
the application will be used on a large number of heterogeneous embedded
devices (with inconsistent software stacks), where random sources are
unsuitable for cryptographic usage, the solution should not involve
them.

Why can't bincoin use deterministic signatures again?
