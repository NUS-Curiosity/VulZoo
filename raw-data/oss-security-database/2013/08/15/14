Dragging this back onto the original topic, hopefully, the above
concerns are far less relevant for a tool focused on downloading
packages from a single site. The gem utility could absolutely pin
its validation expectations to a single signing authority or even to
a single server certificate (and make it a configurable list to
support private package repositories and mirrors where desired). The
transport security implications for a system with basically one
distribution endpoint offer significantly different solutions than a
many-to-many association like Web browsing.
