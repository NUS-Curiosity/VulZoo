So it states for the first one:

Problem Description: TYPO3 bundles flash files for video and audio
playback. Old versions of FlowPlayer and flashmedia are susceptible to
Cross-Site Scripting. No authentication is required to exploit this
vulnerability.

so it sounds like embedded third party software, there appear to be
some older CVE's for flowplayer, I'm guessing it might be one of
these? Can the typo3 people please provide details (e.g. code patches)
of exactly what they fixed?

For the second one "Vulnerable subcomponent: Backend File Upload /
File Abstraction Layer" code execution please use CVE-2013-4250 for
this issue.
