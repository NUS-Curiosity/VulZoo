Subject: Possible CVE request: dovecot crash when disconnecting during pop3 LIST

Hi,

Dovecot's 2.2.5 release notes mention a fix for a client-triggered
assert when disconnecting during a pop3 LIST[1]. Without more details,
I can't tell if a CVE id should be assigned. Timo, could you please
shed some more light, or provide a pointer to more details?

Thanks in advance.
