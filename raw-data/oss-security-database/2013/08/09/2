In this specific situation, it happens to be possible for MITRE to
arrange for the CVE web site's CVE-2013-3544 entry to refer to
CVE-2012-3544 as the correct identifier. There's a standard wording
that we use for this scenario, so the entry will end up looking very
similar to this one:

  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5217

This should be completed on the CVE web site in the coming days. In
general, the cve-assign@...re.org address can be used for any reports
of a CVE typo in a disclosure. Depending on the exact state and usage
of each of the CVEs, sometimes we need to do a multi-vendor typo
coordination, and sometimes it's simpler than that.
