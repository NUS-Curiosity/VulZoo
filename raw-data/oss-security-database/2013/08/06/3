Subject: [OSSA 2013-019] Resource limit circumvention in Nova private
 flavors (CVE-2013-2256)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-019
CVE: CVE-2013-2256
Date: August 6, 2013
Title: Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors
Reporter: hzrandd (NetEase)
Products: Nova
Affects: All versions

Description:
hzrandd from NetEase reported a resource limit circumvention
vulnerability in Nova's handling of private flavors. Any tenant is
able to show and boot any other tenant's private flavors by guessing
a flavor ID. This not only exposes the flavor's name, memory and
disk size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor
properties, but potentially allows circumvention of any resource
limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.

Havana (development branch) fix:

Grizzly fix:

Folsom fix:

Notes:
This fix is included in the havana-2 development milestone and will
appear in a future 2013.1.3 release.
