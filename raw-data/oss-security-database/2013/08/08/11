Long dead actually; I have kept it working in the past but have no real
interesting in doing that in the future.  Intel hasn't been involved in
their wimax stack or drivers for about 2+ years.

The code is *horrible* and it's a complete port of the Windows wimax
stack over to Linux, including re-implementing crypto, liked-lists, and
a whole bunch of other stuff.  It's just awful.

If anyone does patches I'm happy to review them and (maybe) test them
and push them to my wimax clone repos on git.freedesktop.org, but I
unfortunately don't have time to do it.

There don't have to be public bugs yet, but if nobody writes patches in
a reasonable amount of time perhaps they should just be made public.
