Well, there's a problem with HTTP -> HTTPS transition if it happens
during or after user authentication: if a login form resides on a page
obtained through HTTP, there's a opportunity for an attacker to steal
users' credentials by tampering the page's content during MitM before
the transition occurs. Of course you can redirect users to a separate
login page over HTTPS, but:
- IMHO, if they get used to HTTP and the lack of HTTPS indication
during their anonymous experience, then the chances they will check the
bar before filling the form may be lower than if they would have been
using HTTPS by default.
- Some people may consider it much less ergonomic and somewhat
contrary to the original look and feel, especially for the Pjax-based
sites.
