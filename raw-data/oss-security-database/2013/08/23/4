I know of one instance where this has fooled a developer into thinking that
'nice' drops privileges (because they were executing a shell script through
nice).

One could argue that the developer is at fault and that programs that use
suid bits require extra-special care - but it's often not the developer
that needs protecting.

Could an alert (via stderr or syslog) be presented when the mitigation is
activated implicitly?
