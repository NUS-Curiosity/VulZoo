Not sure if anyone had this idea before: Browsers could mitigate this 
by not sending "Accept-Encoding: gzip" if a request is cross-domain 
and contains some sort of credentials (HTTP-auth, cookies with the 
'secure' attribute, client certificate, ...). This would stop the vast 
majority of attack scenarios while leaving compression enabled for 
most requests.
