To close the loop on this, the CVE should probably be rejected.
According to upstream, this is done by design.  One of our users noted
it in our bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=978531#c11

He has a thorough explanation, but the bottom line is this seems to be
by design, as noted in the changelog:

http://www.nagios.org/projects/nagioscore/history/core-3x

* Users can now see hostgroups and servicegroups that contain at least
   one host or service they are authorized for, instead of having to be
   authorized for them all (Ethan Galstad)

I suspect this CVE should be rejected as this is done by design.
