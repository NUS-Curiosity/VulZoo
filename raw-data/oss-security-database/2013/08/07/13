Okay, so the first bug is an integer overflow in j variable, it occurs
here :
https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L1852

The second bug is a heap overflow and can be triggered in two functions
abc_MIDI_drum :
https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L3211
and
abc_MIDI_gchord :
https://github.com/gardaud/libmodplug/blob/master/src/load_abc.cpp#L3258

h->gchord and h->drum are static buffers and are filled until the copied
byte is in the charset (respectively 'fbcz0123456789ghijGHIJ' and
'dz0123456789')

It's up to you to open one or multiple CVE.

Don't hesitate if you want more information.

Thx
