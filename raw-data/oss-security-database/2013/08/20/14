None of the above represent the dominant set of keyservers currently
actively gossiping on the 'net today.  Probably the best mechanism to
track actively-syncing peers is pool.sks-keyservers.net  (*not*
sks-keyservers.net on its own).  The various pools in the
pool.sks-keyservers.net subzones are well-maintained DNS round-robins.

for more details, see:

 http://sks-keyservers.net/overview-of-pools.php

If you want to discuss the keyserver network, the dominant keyserver
implementation (SKS) or the DNS pools, the best place to do so is:

  SKS development list <sks-devel@...gnu.org>

GnuPG's default keyserver of keys.gnupg.net is now a CNAME for
pool.sks-keyservers.net, fwiw.

---------------

I agree with Moritz Naumann's analysis of the weakness of the postgresql
RPM key overall -- a 5.5 year-old 1024-bit DSA key is probably not
appropriate for use any more.  If the psql RPM folks are going to do any
work to improve this, they're probably better off starting with a new,
strong key entirely.

If they want to upgrade their key but don't want to change their
documentation at all, they can contact me off-list and i'll help them
generate a 4096-bit RSA key that has the matching short keyID, since
short keyIDs are trivial to spoof these days :P
