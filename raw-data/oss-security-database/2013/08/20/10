Do you have an idea in mind how to do that in practice? E.g with
openssl? Checking name constraints and the logic of verifying server
identifiers is at different layers there. Ie openssl makes sure
certificate name constraints on subjAltNames are applied but the special
interpretation of the CN as host name is left to the applications
unfortunately.

An alternative approach would be to disallow that legacy CN
interpretation as host name in chains that use name constraints.
