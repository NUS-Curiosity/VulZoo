Agreed, we should. Regardless of it being on the proper keyservrers or
not. In fact, we do this for Debian/Ubuntu already at
https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc. The intention was
to do it for the rpm keys as well, but that seems to have slipped off
the todo list somehow.

Devrim, can you provide the key for this, and update the instructions
accordingly? I believe you have the required commit bit on the website
repository, but if not, send me the keyfile as it should be, and I can
apply it for you (and of course, confirm out of band what the
fingerprint is of the correct key).

Thanks!
