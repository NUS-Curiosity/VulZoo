Use CVE-2013-5654. Support for anonymous upload is, at least, rare in
HTTP servers and this behavior would seem to violate reasonable user
expectations.

If you have any further information about the specific statements in
OSVDB entry 96720, please let us know. For example, have you confirmed
that the default configuration of this HTTP server enables a PHP
interpreter, such that uploads of .php files are especially dangerous?

Use CVE-2013-5655.

We're not immediately assigning a CVE ID for this authentication
behavior because it might be an intentional part of the vendor's
design, and might have been reasonable in the vendor's envisioned
development environment. If there is any documentation suggesting that
this is instead an authentication bypass (e.g., the product allows the
user to configure a username/password combination), the assignment can
of course be reconsidered.
