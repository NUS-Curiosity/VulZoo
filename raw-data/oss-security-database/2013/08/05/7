Looking at [2] there are no reference to oC-SA-2013-029 and
oC-SA-2013-030 and CVE assignments for these issues. Where they
already requested? (Cc'ing also the security@...cloud.com team,
reading from [3] it's not clear if they where already assigned).

But the following might be emphasized (from [3]):

[11:38:54] <AnybodyElse> Luigi12_work: I'll release them as soon as possible. Sorry. I'm actually *very* busy with my job.
[11:40:00] <AnybodyElse> Luigi12_work: that said: the vulnerabilities aren't really severe and only exploitable in some very special and unusuable setups
