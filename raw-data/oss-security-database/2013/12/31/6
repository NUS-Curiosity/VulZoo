Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: net: memory leak in recvmsg handlermsg_name
 & msg_namelen logic

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the networking support(CONFIG_NET) is vulnerable to an 
information leakage flaw in the socket layer. It could occur while doing 
recvmsg(2), recvfrom(2) socket calls. It occurs due to improperly initialised 
msg_name & msg_namelen message header parameters.

A user/program could use this flaw to leak information from kernel memory 
bytes.

Upstream fix:
-------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c

Reference:

Thank you.
