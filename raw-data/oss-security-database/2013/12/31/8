OK, there is no CVE assignment for this. Just for clarification, the
"denial of service" theory was related to:

  https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/commit/cf26a04b356ad2161c4c6160260eb870a3de5328

specifically:

   -  resources :users, :id => /\d+/ do
   +  resources :users, :id => /\d+/, :except => [:index, :destroy] do

and:

   -   it "recognizes and generates #destroy" do
   -      { :delete => "/users/1" }.should route_to(:controller => "users", :action => "destroy", :id => "1")
   +    it "doesn't recognize #destroy" do
   +      { :delete => "/users/1" }.should_not be_routable

in which a reader might infer that a "destroy" of some data associated
with a user account would be a denial of service.

Our understanding now is that the presence of ":destroy" in the added
code string:

   , :except => [:index, :destroy]

does not prevent any type of attack, and therefore it is not a
vulnerability fix.
