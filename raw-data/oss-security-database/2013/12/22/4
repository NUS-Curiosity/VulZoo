A bit of background on this issue:

I discovered the issue on the 19th of December ant contacted:
 * Debian security team
 * Maintainer of the Debian package: Kyle Willmon
 * Upstream: Phil Schwartz

Example exploit:

ssh -l 'Invalid user root from 123.123.123.123' 21.21.21.21

This causes a log line of the form

sshd[123]: input_userauth_request: invalid user Invalid user root from 123.123.123.123 [preauth]

and results in both IP addresses being blocked.

CVE-2013-6890 was assigned from the Debian pool.

The proposed solution is to tighten up the regular expressions for
matching log file entries. Specifically including the $ pattern to match
the end of log lines. For your convenience I attach the final patch.

The Debian security advisory is the initial public disclosure.

I am not aware of any upstream response to this issue and the last
denyhosts release is from 2008.
