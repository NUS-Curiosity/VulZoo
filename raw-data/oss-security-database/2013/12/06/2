Subject: CVE request: Kernel: ping: NULL pointer dereference on write to
 msg_name

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the TCP/IP networking support(CONFIG_NET) is 
vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur via a plain 
read(2) call on a ping socket. Usage of ping sockets is generally restricted 
to privileged users.

A user/program able to read from ping sockets could use this flaw to crash a
system resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------
  -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/cf970c002d270c36202bd5b9c2804d3097a52da0

Reference:

Thank you.
