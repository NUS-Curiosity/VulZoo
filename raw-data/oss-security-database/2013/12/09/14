In reading this, we were not sure what vulnerability or
vulnerabilities you are referring to. First, the Subject line mentions
session fixation, but the body of the message doesn't mention session
fixation.

https://github.com/mikaku/Monitorix/issues/30 says "The remote host is
running a web server that fails to adequately sanitize request strings
of malicious JavaScript. By leveraging this issue, an attacker may be
able to inject arbitrary cookies. Depending on the structure of the
web application, it may be possible to launch a 'session fixation'
attack using this mechanism." This suggests some possibility that the
session fixation issue is resultant from an XSS vulnerability. In that
situation, the session fixation issue could not be assigned a separate
CVE ID.

Also, https://github.com/mikaku/Monitorix/issues/30 says "The remote
host is running GoScript. The installed version fails to properly
sanitize user-supplied input to the 'go.cgi' script. An
unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this flaw to execute
arbitrary commands on the remote host." This is apparently a 2004
issue but does not have a CVE ID. Monitorix 3.3.1 apparently has a
patch for it.

http://www.monitorix.org/news.html says "3.3.1 version released ...
21-Nov-2013 ... This is a maintenance release that fixes a serious bug
in the built-in HTTP server. It was discovered that the
handle_request() routine did not properly perform input sanitization
which led into a number of security vulnerabilities." (This is about
some or all of the https://github.com/mikaku/Monitorix/issues/30
page).

http://www.monitorix.org/news.html also says "3.4.0 version
released ... 02-Dec-2013 ... This version also fixes an important
number of bugs and two security issues ... not covered yet in the
previous 3.3.1 version." These would very likely need separate CVE
IDs.
