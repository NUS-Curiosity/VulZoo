It is possible to have a CVE ID for multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities but this can usually only occur when the expectation
is that no details will be available. In this case, a previous message
said:

>> From: Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com>

suggesting that some information gathering may be in progress.

Although these items:

>> 1) A double-free error exists within the "unrar_extract_next_prepare()"
>> function (libclamunrar_iface/unrar_iface.c) when parsing a RAR file.
>> 
>> 2) An unspecified error within the "wwunpack()" function
>> (libclamav/wwunpack.c) when unpacking a WWPack file can be exploited to
>> corrupt heap memory.

can have CVE IDs, we can't correctly define the scope of any CVE ID
until more is known about what was fixed in 0.9.7. For example, in
some cases, two different double-free issues fixed in 0.9.7 would be
covered by a single CVE ID.

So, it is probably best to wait a short time for the information
gathering.
