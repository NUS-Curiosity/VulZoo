Older releases of Monitorix are available from http://www.monitorix.org/old_versions/ , and browsing the source for 3.3.1, you will find the commit from  https://github.com/mikaku/Monitorix/commit/ff80441be7089f774448dfe4b49e6fced70e71cb is indeed included in that, as reflected in both the ‘Changes’ and ‘lib/HTTPServer.pm’ files.
