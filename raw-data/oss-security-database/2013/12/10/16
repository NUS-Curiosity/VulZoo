Yes, we recognize that http://secunia.com/advisories/55857/ is an
additional reference. Relative to what we previously posted, existence
of this reference does not simplify the situation, because it says
"Two vulnerabilities have been reported" and then perhaps proceeds to
state what only one of the vulnerabilities is. Or, alternatively,
maybe that Secunia advisory is implicitly categorizing $target and
$target_cgi as separate vulnerabilities.

Does anyone wish to contribute the information about whether the first
problem fix (involving allowable characters in the $target and
$target_cgi variables in lib/HTTPServer.pm) was part of 3.3.1, or only
part of 3.4.0? If not, we can have someone at MITRE try to locate a
copy of 3.3.1 later.

https://github.com/mikaku/Monitorix/blob/master/Changes says

   Fixed to correctly sanitize the input string in the built-in HTTP server
   which led into a number of security vulnerabilities. [#30]

in both the 3.3.1 and 3.4.0 changelog entries. Also, as we previously
posted, the vendor referred to "two security issues ... not covered
yet in the previous 3.3.1 version" when announcing 3.4.0. We see that
there is a second XSS-related commit involving the PATH_INFO (aka the
$url variable) but this isn't necessarily "two security issues" by
itself. So, we still don't know how many CVE IDs to assign, and we
would prefer not to assign any CVE IDs until the meaning and scope of
each ID is at least somewhat understood.
