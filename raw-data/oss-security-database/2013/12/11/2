Subject: CVE request: devscripts (uscan) command execution flaw

Good morning,

A flaw was reported in the uscan script of devscripts:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=731849

>From that bug report:

""
The newfangled debian/copyright-driven repacking can be exploited by
malicious upstream to execute arbitrary code.
""

The fix:

http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=collab-maint/devscripts.git;a=commitdiff;h=91f05b5

Can a CVE please be assigned? (I guess this is not Debian specific,
devscripts looks like it is/will be in the next Fedora release.)

Thanks!
