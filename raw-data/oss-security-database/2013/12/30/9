Use CVE-2013-7240 for this dew_file directory traversal issue.

When a vulnerability originally came into existence through a single
action of a single developer, we currently don't like to assign
multiple CVE IDs on the basis of the vulnerable code later being
shipped in many separately maintained products. We can enter an
internal issue report about the effect on CVE usability because of this
"difficult to coordinate" observation.

Just to clarify: the dewplayer.swf file is thought to be essentially
the same in these two cases, and you're asking for two different CVE
IDs to be assigned? It seems very unlikely at this point that we can
provide more than one CVE ID for those, but we just wanted to confirm
that we're answering the right question.

If we think the vendor's security policy is that dewplayer.swf should
not be able to reference off-site media files in this way, then the
issue is currently eligible for a CVE assignment. We're not sure that
a spoofing impact would be the primary motivation for changing this.
Perhaps a stronger motivation is that the vendor doesn't want
dewplayer.swf to trigger arbitrary outbound TCP traffic from the web
host, possibly including traffic to intranet servers in some
environments.
