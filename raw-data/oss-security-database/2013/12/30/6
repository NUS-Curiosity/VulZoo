Subject: CVE to the ntp monlist DDoS issue?

There's a recent rash of DDoS involving the monlist functionality
in older ntp.org ntp.  Has anyone thought about assigning a CVE to
this?  It looks like the issue may have been addressed back in 2010, 
but only in the context of ntp.org's "dev" tree, not "stable".
