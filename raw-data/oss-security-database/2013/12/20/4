It is missing because that disclosure does not qualify for a CVE ID.
The rationale sent to upstream was:

'We don't think we'll be able to assign a CVE number for the
downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2013-007.html announcement. As
far as we can tell, the announcement is about introducing an optional
new security feature. An example of a type of issue that could have a
CVE assignment is: ... a third party ships a product based on
Asterisk ... this product implements an external control protocol that
is capable of calling the SHELL and FILE functions with untrusted user
input ... the third party publishes a security announcement stating
that the new release of their product ships with a revised
asterisk.conf containing a "no" value for the "live_dangerously"
option, in order to fix this vulnerability ... We would generally
assign one CVE number for each such security announcement, if any are
found.'
