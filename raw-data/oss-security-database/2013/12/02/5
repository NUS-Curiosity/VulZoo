Subject: CVE request: samba pam_winbind authentication fails open

Just cutting-and-pasting from the bug I just filed.  The following was
reported to us, but had been reported upstream last year.

It was reported [1] that Samba's pam_winbind module would fail open (allowing
access) when the require_membership_of option is used as an argument to
pam_winbind, and contains a non-existent group as the value.  In such a
configuration, rather then failing and not permitting authentication which is
what would be expected, pam_winbind will allow authentication to proceed.

For instance, if the following is specified and the user is not a member of the
group 'Admin', they will not obtain access to the system:

auth        sufficient    pam_winbind.so use_first_pass require_membership_of=Admin

On the other hand, if the non-existent group 'AdminOops' is specified, the user
is obviously not a member of said group, authentication will be permitted:

auth        sufficient    pam_winbind.so use_first_pass require_membership_of=AdminOops

The commit [2] that most likely introduced this flaw indicates that this was
introduced October 2009 and another commit [3] looks like the fix, although
that is for another bug [4] that's somewhat related to this issue and somewhat
not.

Could a CVE be assigned to this issue?
