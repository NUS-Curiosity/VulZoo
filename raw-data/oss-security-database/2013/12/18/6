Subject: CVE already assigned for 1026891?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/12/18/3 raises the
question of whether there is a CVE assignment in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1026891 already, in order
to avoid a duplicate assignment. Our guess is that security issues
tracked privately by Red Hat typically do have pre-assigned CVE IDs,
so MITRE will delay a CVE assignment indefinitely.

Although it would be great to know what CVE ID you have assigned,
replying with something like "yes, it has a CVE ID, but it's only
being shared with the embargo audience" would be quite useful as well.
