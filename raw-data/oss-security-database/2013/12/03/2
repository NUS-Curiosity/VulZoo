To be clear I asked Mitre for the CVE for AMD (since it's not open
source software). I didn't think to tell them it was embargoed since
the AMD release notes and so on were public. However in future with
hardware related CVE's I'll make sure to ask Mitre to keep them
private if the software side is still embargoed as appropriate.
