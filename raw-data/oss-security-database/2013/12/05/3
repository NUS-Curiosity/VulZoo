Subject: Re: Re: [CVE-2013-4491] Reflective XSS Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails

Hello everyone,

Just to clarify I18n.enforce_available_locales quickly, when I18n initialises, it creates an array of the known locales called I18n.available_locales.
Typically, this array is created by scanning for YML files (in config/locales for a Rails app).
With I8n.enforce_available_locales set to true, we check that the locale we're trying to use (eg. translate or localize) is included in the available_locales. This means we're certain it can't be malicious user submitted data even outside of the scope of a Rails app.

I could really use a hand with the CVE announcements, I literally have no idea about any of this!

Cheers,

-- Chris

PS. Including Sven's correct email address.
