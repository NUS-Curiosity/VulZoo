Subject: CVE Request: Proc::Daemon writes pidfile with mode 666

Hi Kurt,

christian mock <cm@...etec.at> has reported[1] that Proc::Daemon, when
instructed to write a pid file, does that with a umask set to 0, so
the pid file ends up with world-writable permissions.

Upstream bugreport is at [2].

 [1] http://bugs.debian.org/732283
 [2] https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91450
 
Axel Beckert has commited a patch to the Debian packaging[3] and
forwarded it to upstream.

 [3] http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=pkg-perl/packages/libproc-daemon-perl.git;a=blob;f=debian/patches/pid.patch

Could a CVE be assigend for this issue?

Regards and thanks in advance,
Salvatore
