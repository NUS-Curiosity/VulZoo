Subject: Reject augeas CVE-2012-6607

Hi!

I'd like to request rejection of augeas CVE-2012-6607, which was
assigned by Mitre as an issue separate from CVE-2012-0786.  I tried to
figure out what is the different vector mentioned in the description
for CVE-2012-6607.  My notes, along with comment form upstream, are in
the following bug:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1034243#c1

It seems the id was assigned to something that wasn't a problem
before.  Can the id be rejected, or can I get further info on what 
CVE-2012-6607 is meant to refer to if my analysis in the above bug is
incorrect.

Thank you!
