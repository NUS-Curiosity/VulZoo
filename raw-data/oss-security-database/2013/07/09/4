I checked this and we had opened a security bug as the bug initially
arrived at xorg_security... We did not untag it for security so
it went to our process with the incorrect tagging and no CVE.

I see that we missed to record the follow up discussion which was
probably the reason for that.

Sorry for the confusion.
