Subject: Possible CVE request: virtualbox virtio-net host DoS

Hi,

Quoting [1]:

The bug is said to be worked around in version 4.2.14 and really fixed
in 4.2.16, but the changelog of either version doesn't reference that
ticket.

Rumors say that virtualbox makes the host randomly hang, but since
there is an actual bug report and confirmation from upstream this time
I guess a CVE id should be assigned.
