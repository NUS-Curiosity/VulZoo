This was my fault, I forgot about that part of the list rules, my
intent was all the CVE's I assign should eventually show up here so
Mitre/etc don't have to chase down 1000 project sites/mailing lists to
find them. For large projects like FreeBSD this obviously won't be a
problem. But what should we do in future to make it easy to see what
happened to CVE assignments? cve-advisories@? tell people I assign to
email mitre directly (but I have no way to know if that gets
done/etc.), something else? Steven any requests/comments?
