Subject: CVE Request -- phpMyAdmin 3.5.8.2 and 4.0.4.2 are released

Hello Kurt, Steve, phpMyAdmin security team, vendors,

  phpMyAdmin upstream has recently released 3.5.8.2 and 4.0.4.2 of phpMyAdmin
administration too:
  [1] http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/news.php#phpMyAdmin_3.5.8.2_and_4.0.4.2_are_released

correcting multiple security flaws (PMASA-2013-10.php is reserved for future use, see [1]):

Doesn't look CVE identifiers have been already allocated to these?

Could you assign them? (Cc-ing phpMyAdmin security team to confirm
these weren't assigned yet [and Mitre's CVE assigning department
since having an impression, we have previously discussed this and
the conclusion was Mitre CVE department will assign them {but maybe
it wasn't case of phpMyAdmin, not sure right now}]).

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
