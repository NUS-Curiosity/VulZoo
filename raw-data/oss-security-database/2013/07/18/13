That said, a statement by a lead developer of Wordpress is important for this clarification ;-)  Andrew, can you confirm for sure that CVE-2012-2399 is *also* the same as CVE-2012-3414 for Neal Poole's movieName vector?

Negative, I was mistaken. Sorry for the confusion. CVE-2012-2399 was a
separate XSS, affecting buttonText, and reported by Szymon Gruszecki.
CVE-2012-3414 was Neal Poole's report, affecting movieName.

So, CVE-2013-4145 is a duplicate of CVE-2012-3414, *not* of CVE-2012-2399.

That said, given that CVE-2012-2399 was not publicly described at the
time, I would not be surprised if one or more CVEs have been issued
for the same XSS via buttonText at one point.

Related, for those who haven't seen, WordPress forked SWFUpload last
month. Both Neal and Szymon have been helping us with the fork, as
well. At this point, in terms of issues known to us, only the image
injection issue is unfixed.
