Subject: CVE Request -- Linux kernel: ipv6: BUG_ON in fib6_add_rt2node()

If two router advertisment speaker announce seperate default gateways
with infinite timeout the kernel currently packs these routes together
into an ecmp route set. If one of the RA speaker now changes the
advertised expiration to a lower value and a third route with infinite
timeout pops up we end up with a BUG_ON.

Remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.
