Sorry thought i had replied to this. I need links to the code
commits/vuln code so I can confirm these.

To reiterate: so I can confirm CVE assignments, and prevent duplicate
assignments you *MUST* provide links to the code commits/vulnerable
code. I don't have the time to go hunting through your source code for
them. People need to start making better CVE requests, or you're not
going to get CVEs from me.
