I am relatively new at CVE requests so I am learning-by-doing.
I must have missed the original comment you feel you're
re-iterating to me.

Relevant code can be found here:

[1] 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/miscellaneouspa/files/glibc217/xlock
more-5.42-glibc217-crypt.diff

Upstream doesn't appear to have a public version control repo
which is why I didn't post link(s) to commit(s). I mistakenly
thought their changelog annoucement would be enough.

I enjoy contributing time to the community via code submissions
and by making flaws/fixes known to vendors via this list. I just
hope they don't all have to raise my blood pressure in the future.
