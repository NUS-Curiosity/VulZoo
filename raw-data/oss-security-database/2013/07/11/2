Subject: CVE request: SQUID-2013:2: buffer overflow in HTTP request handling

Hi,

Squid has released a security advisory[0]:

> overflow attack when processing specially crafted HTTP requests.

Could a CVE id be assigned please?

Thanks in advance.

[CC'ing squid's security address so that they can include the id in
the advisory once assigned]
