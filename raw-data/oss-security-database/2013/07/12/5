That is a good question. The short answer is there isn't a
re-spawn of crashed processes. The longer answer is cyrus-sasl's
saslauthd defaults to starting up 5 round-robin listening
threads (configurable via -n switch).

Under a default scenario, authentication would continue to be
available until the 5th NULL ptr. dereference.
