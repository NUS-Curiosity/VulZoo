  It's one of those non-portable Linux socket options.

===
$ man 7 udp 
 ...
 UDP_CORK (since Linux 2.5.44)
              If  this  option is enabled, then all data output on this socket
              is accumulated into a single datagram that is  transmitted  when
              the  option is disabled.  This option should not be used in code
              intended to be portable.

Though the crash is more of due to IPV6_MTU value set. (from commit log)
