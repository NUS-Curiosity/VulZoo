Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: panic while appending data to a corked
 IPv6 socket in ip6_append_data_mtu

   Hi,

Linux kernel built with the IPv6 networking support is vulnerable to a crash
while appending data to an IPv6 socket with UDP_CORKED option set. UDP_CORK
enables accumulating data and sending it as single datagram.

An unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the kernel, 
resulting in local DoS.
