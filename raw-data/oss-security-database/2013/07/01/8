Speaking personally, not on behalf of Red Hat here, yeah, I can't find
ANY security related info on your website for your products.
Personally speaking, I would strongly oppose membership even if they
throw up some security related web pages as it's obvious that this
isn't a long term effort but "oh we should join distros@, throw some
web pages up? ok, done!" Until a vendor has shown some long term
effort to do security properly I suspect letting them onto distros@
would only increase the chances of a leak and devaluing the list in
general.
