Yeah this was discussed internally a bit at Red Hat after you filed
the bug, it's a messy problem. I think one concern was where do you
want to place policy decisions for key usage and trust, in GPG, in the
app using it, or something else? One concern I have is I sometimes
used to (not any more!) download all the signing keys for keys I was
using to see if I could establish a web of trust. Of course anyone can
sign someone elses key and upload that to the public key servers, so
then the potential for grabbing a key from a bad guy increases
significantly.

Any ways for evolutions please use CVE-2013-4166 for this issue. Has
anyone checked other popular mail clients like thunderbird/mutt/etc?
