Subject: Two OpenAFS security advisories

As previously disclosed on distros, and now disclosed here per the distros
policy.

The first one is a somewhat odd special case, as this isn't a
newly-discovered vulnerability.  However, it's become clear that
brute-force attacks on DES are immediately practical, prompting a
reimplementation of the security layer that's being treated as a security
release by the OpenAFS project.  (Also, it's been an embarassment for some
time that AFS didn't have crypto agility and didn't support anything
stronger than DES.  That's finally fixed.)

The two vulnerabilities are:

OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-0003 (CVE-2013-4134)

    OpenAFS uses Kerberos tickets to secure network traffic. For
    historical reasons, it has only supported the DES encryption algorithm
    to encrypt these tickets. The weakness of DES's 56 bit key space has
    long been known, however it has recently become possible to use that
    weakness to cheaply (around $100) and rapidly (approximately 23 hours)
    compromise a service's long term key.

    This vulnerability is a particular problem for OpenAFS because DES is
    the only encryption algorithm supported in current releases.

OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-0004 (CVE-2013-4135)

    The -encrypt option to the 'vos' volume management command should
    cause it to encrypt all data between client and server. However, in
    versions of OpenAFS later than 1.6.0, it has no effect, and data is
    transmitted with integrity protection only. In all versions of
    OpenAFS, vos -encrypt has no effect when combined with the -localauth
    option.

The upstream advisories, patches, upgrade instructions, and so forth are
