It's not that we don't care about CVE IDs. But "upstream VLC" is upstream
VLC, i.e. the VLC code base. We just do not have the resources and
expertise to evaluate FFmpeg/libav security issues individually.

Besides, VLC can be linked dynamically with many different FFmpeg or libav
versions. So keeping track of their security issues within the context of
VLC is more or less impossible. That is up to the VLC binary packagers, not
to upstream developers.
