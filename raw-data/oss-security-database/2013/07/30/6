So it sounds like 1.3.x was definitely vulnerable to this with no way
to disable it, 1.4 was vulnerable by default but could be made safe,
and 1.5 is vulnerable but safe by default, is that correct?

I'm not sure in this case MD5 alone is a security vulnerability, I
think previously it had been decided that just because it uses MD5
wasn't ernough to get a CVE, it had to have some specific use that
made MD5 a problem. OTOH DES is at this point worthy of a CVE since
you can crack it in a reasonable amount of time on AWS/etc for a few
hundred bucks or less. Personally I would assign a CVE to everything
using MD5 by default to try and help kill it off, but that would be a
lot of CVEs.
