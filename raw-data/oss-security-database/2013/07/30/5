The central index is pypi.python.org and historically (and at the time of that commit) it was
not accessed securely (plaintext HTTP, no authenticity checks etc). The mirroring support,
(located at, a.pyp.python.org, b.pypi.python.org, â€¦) which that commit adds and PEP381
deals with, was supposed to have authenticity checking preventing a malicious mirror
operator from attacking you by checking a html manifest that included hashes was signed
by a key owned by the central index (pypi.python.org). That commit does not include
checking that the mirrors are not hosting content that differs from the central index.

So basically the lack of authenticity checking when installing directly from the central index
is a separate issue which has been (mostly) addressed with pip 1.3, and more so with 1.4. 
However this request deals explicitly with the implementation of the protocol for installing
from the hosts that mirror the central index, but are not the central index.

For what it's worth my PR to fix it is here https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/1098

Between myself, the comment on the PR, and the mailing list I have 3 pip developers +1ing
the change so it's likely it's going to land unless one of the others has concerns.
