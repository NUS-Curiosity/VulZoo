Subject: CVE Request: kernel -- local DOS (endless loop with interrupts disabled)

Hi,

Eric Dumazet recently fixed a local DOS in commit 77c1090 "net: fix
infinite loop in __skb_recv_datagram()"? An unprivileged local user
can easily trigger this bug and lock-up the system.

A reproducer is attached.

Thanks,
Mathias
