    Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-0216,CVE-2013-0217 / XSA-39
			      version 2

          Linux netback DoS via malicious guest ring.

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The Xen netback implementation contains a couple of flaws which can
allow a guest to cause a DoS in the backend domain, potentially
affecting other domains in the system.

CVE-2013-0216 is a failure to sanity check the ring producer/consumer
pointers which can allow a guest to cause netback to loop for an
extended period preventing other work from occurring.

CVE-2013-0217 is a memory leak on an error path which is guest
triggerable.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest can mount a DoS affecting the entire system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems running guests with access to PV network devices are
vulnerable.

CVE-2013-0216 affects both mainline ("pvops") and classic-Xen patch
kernels.

CVE-2013-0217 affects only mainline ("pvops") kernels.

MITIGATION
==========

Running HVM guests with only emulated or passthrough NICs or PV guests
with only passthrough NICs will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches in sequence resolves this issue.

xsa39-pvops-*.patch            Apply to mainline Linux 3.8-rc2
xsa39-classic-*.patch          Apply to linux-2.6.18-xen tree.

All patches for the given branch should be applied in numerical order.
