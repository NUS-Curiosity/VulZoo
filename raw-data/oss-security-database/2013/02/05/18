[ This is mostly directed to Red Hat at this point. We'll expand to
the other recipients or vendors later. ]

We're not exactly sure that MITRE has the next step here. A CVE
exists, CVE-2013-0169, that was issued by the Red Hat CNA. When the
CVE assignment was made, presumably one or more persons at Red Hat had
a working understanding of what the name CVE-2013-0169 means. (For
example: was the CVE assigned with a multi-vendor scope in mind? Was
the CVE assigned to cover the entirety of the content of the
www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf research paper?) MITRE would, in
general, want to preserve this original meaning if it makes sense to
do that. Because there's no specific statement on this list about what
CVE-2013-0169 means, we'd next go to

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-0169

to see if that may be a canonical statement of what CVE-2013-0169
means. But there's nothing there yet.

Before offering a guess from MITRE, we'll wait for some more
information.
