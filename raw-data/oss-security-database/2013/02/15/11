Please unsubscribe me from the distros list. I handed over maintenance
of Frugalware security issues to James Buren, but he's not releasing
security advisories[1] nor taking part of such discussions actively, so my
membership is no longer useful and it's no point in askig for membership
for him.

Thanks,

Miklos
