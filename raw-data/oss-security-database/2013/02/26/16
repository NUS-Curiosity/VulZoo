It appears my ~/.cache and your ~/.cache are mode 0700. Directories
underneath are already unaccessible by other users, except if one of your
programs passes a filedescriptor to a directory to another user's process
(say, cwd is in ~/.cache/psi+ and then executes a setuid program, or
uses unix(7) SCM_RIGHTS to pass a directory file descriptor to another
program).

Are there environments where ~/.cache isn't 0700 by default?

Thanks
