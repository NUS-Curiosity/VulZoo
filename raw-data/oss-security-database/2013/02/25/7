So it looks like those guys have been exploiting this bug for quite a
while. Good that it's fixed, now!

Did you even try to run the exploit on a v3.2 kernel? Or even more
simple, looked at the code of a v3.2 kernel? There is no sock_diag
anywhere in the kernel; there is only inet_diag. And inet_diag hadn't
and still does not have the out-of-bounds access issue. So no, this
bug is non-existent on a v3.2 kernel.

Thanks,
