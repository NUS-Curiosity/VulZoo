Nice find!  Do you happen to know of distro backports of the affected
code to older kernels?  When you wrote that the bug is "in there for
ages", did you mean that 3.3 has been out "for ages" or something else?

SynQ posted a (different?) PoC here:

https://rdot.org/forum/showthread.php?p=30828

Apparently, high values of mmap_min_addr (like 131072) happen to work
against this one, but they might not work against other attack vectors
or/and kernel builds.  The bug is not a NULL+offset dereference, so
mmap_min_addr was not supposed to help against its exploitation - it
just happens to, sometimes.
