No.  I think my role in this discussion is to bring up the right
questions and have you answer them, for others to have those answers.
I hope you don't mind. :-)  Personally, I don't care about this specific
bug much (not relevant), but I do care about handling of Linux kernel
bugs in general.

While we're at it, I notice that lately many of us use "kernel" in the
Subject to refer to the Linux kernel.  I wonder if this little detail
makes this mailing list a little less comfortable for non-Linux folks.
Maybe we should put "Linux" or "Linux kernel" into the Subject on those
occasions, not to discourage non-Linux discussions in here.

Thanks!
