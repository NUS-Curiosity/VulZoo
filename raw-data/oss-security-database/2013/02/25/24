Apparently, the bug is only triggerable on builds with CONFIG_NUMA.
Otherwise mpol_parse_str() is dummy, so it never sets the mpol pointer
(which I guess is then left at NULL both at original mount and at any
remount).

RHEL5'ish kernels appear not vulnerable: they directly use a couple of
integers in place of mpol struct pointers.  I did not check RHEL6.

This is also relevant to OpenVZ (and perhaps to other container-based
virtualization systems/patches for Linux), where in-container root can
mount/remount tmpfs.  While I did not check RHEL6 kernel code yet, I
just had a quick look at OpenVZ's default config for those kernels, and
it does include CONFIG_NUMA=y.  So if the code has the vulnerability,
then OpenVZ based on these kernels is likely affected.  (Need to check
this when I have more time, or maybe someone else will.  Luckily, we're
still at RHEL5'ish OpenVZ kernels in released Owl versions, and we also
don't build them with CONFIG_NUMA.)
