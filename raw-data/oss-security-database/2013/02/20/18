Yeah I'm pretty sure that's a less than ideal solution. Less ideal in
the sense of "breaking a whole bunch of customer software without much
warning, some of which is probably closed source and can't be modified
so that it works with these new "improved" xml libraries" is not the
way to go. So that's not gonna happen for most major Linux vendors (in
other words we'll have to find better ways to fix this).

Like Linus says, we can't just start breaking things. That's not how
you fix things.
