Subject: Re: RE: Handling CVEs for the XML entity expansion
 issues


Hi Kurt and Steve,

I have been investigating XXE issues and how they may be exploited off
and on for the last year.  Most modern/maintained XML libraries enable
parsing of inline DTDs (in DOCTYPE headers), as well as external
entities defined there, by default.  Indeed, this is something that
the XML standard includes (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/) and I'm
guessing library implementors have a strong desire to comply.

This is stupid, on two levels:

- Most applications that actually apply DTD or schema validation will
be working from a predefined definition.  Many applications don't
bother to do any up-front validation.  In either case, what is the
point in allowing a DTD (or schema) to be defined *within* the
document that is being supplied?  From a security perspective, this is
like say "Hey Mallory, I need to validate that search string input
field.  Could you supply me with the regex so I can validate your
data?"  I'm sure there are some odd contexts where XML developers find
this feature useful, but I'm pretty sure they are few and far between.
DTDs should be ignored by default by libraries unless supplied
separately through the API.

- External entities are a pretty dumb idea indeed.  I mean, I
understand why someone might want them.  Makes it easy to stitch
together multiple documents.  But in the vast majority of cases I've
discussed XXE with developers, they have no idea that you can even
define custom XML entities, let alone external ones.  These, too,
should be off by default.


So clearly this combination is pretty serious and this is why XXE is
*everywhere*.  You can ask library developers to turn them off of
course, but since these features are in the standards with no clear
language indicating that these are optional or dangerous (that I'm
aware of), then of course there can be significant reluctance in
disabling them.  Yet is is also rediculous to ask every application
developer to explicitly disable these features each time they use XML.


Kurt, in regard to your question, my current opinion is that if an XML
library doesn't make it easy/possible to disable these features, then
yes they should be hit with a CVE.  But if they do make it possible,
then it is the application developer's responsibility to turn these
things off explicitly.  No, this isn't a good long-term solution, but
it doesn't make sense to slap a CVE on a library that at least gives
you the option.


HTH,
tim
