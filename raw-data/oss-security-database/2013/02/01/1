Subject: CVE Request -- Corosync (X < 2.0.3): Remote DoS due improper HMAC
 initialization and improper junk filtering when different encryption keys
 used

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Corosync upstream has recently released 2.0.3 version correcting
one security issue:

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Corosync,
the cluster engine and application programming interfaces,
performed processing of certain network packets, when different
encryption keys were used. Previously the HMAC key was not initialized
properly, which allowed certain packets to pass through to the internal
phases of the Corosync packet validation process, possibly leading
to corosync daemon crash.

The HMAC initialization has been corrected in upstream via:

but there might be more changes needed (Cc-in Fabio and Jan).

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
