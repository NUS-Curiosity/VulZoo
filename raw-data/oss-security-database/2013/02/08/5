Subject: CVE request: XSS flaws fixed in ganglia

A number of XSS issues were fixed in ganglia's web ui:

https://github.com/ganglia/ganglia-web/commit/31d348947419058c43b8dfcd062e2988abd5058e
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=892823

I think one CVE would cover all of these since they were fixed at the
same time, in the same commit.

Thanks.
