No I didn't. This is why I require good quality requests, anything
else is a waste of my time. If it doesn't meet an easy "definitely a
security bug" I push it back to people and keep poking them with
annoying questions, in some cases this takes weeks or months to be
resolved (some are quite subtle, like that IPv6 Kernel stuff).

I assigned 1600-2000 CVEs last year, it will be more this year. At one
hour per CVE that would be a full years work right there. Even at 1-5
minutes per CVE it's still a huge time sink. The Kernel people are
working with roughly an order or two magnitude more bug reports to
assess (because even trivial looking things can turn out to have nasty
consequences or even represent entirely new classes of flaws, just
look at the recent Ruby stuff or XML stuff).

This also goes for security people. If we had any sense we'd go live
in the woods in a cabin and drink moonshine and go hunting. I'm still
assigning CVE's for /tmp file vulns. That's just inexcusably stupid.
