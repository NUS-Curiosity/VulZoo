I did yesterday, actually. I saw some commit that said "use after
free!", saw that it was triggerable by an unpriv'd user, and sent it
into the list. Kurt took a look at it, agreed with the assessment, and
assigned a CVE. The commit itself said "use after free" -- I didn't
even have to do any heavy lifting or hair-splitting investigation.
