Subject: CVE Request: poppler 0.22.1 security fixes

Hi,

poppler 0.22.1 was released without much ado, it however contains various security fixes.

The security fixes apparently come from AdressSanitizer work and fuzzing provided
by the Google Security Team.

The page:
http://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=1507

explains most of it, and while it focuses on Adobe Acrobat Reader, they also covered
poppler testing inside.

So far I see:

As the blog page mentions "Huzaifa Sidhpurwala from RedHat Security", perhaps Redhat has assigned CVEs already.

Otherwise one ore more CVEs are required. 

Ciao, Marcus
