At least send oss-sec an email after the commit goes into the tree.
The people who are up to no good will see the commit and notice it (if
they didn't already notice it when the vuln was committed prior).
Might as well let distros and CVE people know about it too so they can
backport it into whatever stable kernel they maintain. Right now
there'll be a commit in the public repo for a bug sent to security@,
and oss-sec isn't informed.
