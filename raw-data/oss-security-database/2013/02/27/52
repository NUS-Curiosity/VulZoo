What Jason is asking for (at least to my understanding) is that if we are 
fixing a bug from a known-to-automatically-be-security-issue, we let the 
world know explicitly.
We are not pro-actively doing that now, are we?

Yes, there are going to be lots and lots of bugs which turn out to be 
security issues once analyzed by super-smart guys wearing their 
darker-coloured hats, and that's unavoidable.
Killing all the efforts that try to mitigate this effect with as little 
investments as possible seems to be slightly counter-productive though.

We are not going to be perfect at it, ever, sure. Perfect is the enemy of 
good.
Also, defining the list in a sensible way is challenging of course, but 
let's have this for starters:

- use-after-free
- null(+epsilon) pointer dereference
- array access overflow
- signedness problem in sizeof() with argument coming from userspace
- operating VMAs without mmap_sem
- ...

Hmm?
