Recent?  I've been involved in oss-sec from the very start of it, and
before that, I was on vendor-sec since 2000 or so.

I will say flat out that this is an impossible task to accomplish.

As proof of that, I suggest you do this for just one major kernel
release cycle (2-3 months long).

You do know the number of patches applied to the Linux kernel every
hour, right?

Would you have caught the patch that started this thread?  I sure
didn't, and I was the one who originally applied it to the kernel tree
in the first place.  Doing "root-cause" research for every patch is
non-trivial, as I know you realize.

I'm not apathetic at all, you are underestimating the ability for
something like this to be even possible.

What anger?  I push out on average, 100 kernel bugfixes a week publicly
for all to see, for multiple kernel versions.  Trying to do the
categorization you wish for above for just that small number of patches
is impossible to do, ask the people who have tried to do it.

I would be very happy to see just these bugfixes to be categorized, and
if people wish to dig further into the patches I miss, I would be more
than willing to take them into the stable kernel releases as well.

I gladly welcome any help in this area, and always have.

thanks,
