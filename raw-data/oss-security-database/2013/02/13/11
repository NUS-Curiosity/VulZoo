 Wildcard matching in SSL hostname verifier incorrect (a different issue than
 CVE-2012-5783)

We'll REJECT it.

Researchers in general should remain aware that bugs in security features do not necessarily constitute vulnerabilities.  And, as already implied in this thread - if functionality is broken but there is no attacker role, or if the affected software is effectively placed into a more restricted "security policy" than intended, then this behavior would be treated as a bug (or feature), not a vulnerability, so it would not receive a CVE.
