Subject: CVE Request -- gpsd 3.9 fixing a denial of service flaw

Hello Kurt, Steve, Eric, Miroslav, vendors,

  GPSD upstream has released 3.9 version:
  [1] http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/gpsd-dev/2013-05/msg00000.html

correcting one denial of service problem [2]:
A denial of service flaw was found in the way AIS driver packet parser of
gpsd, a service daemon for mediating access to a GPS, processed certain
malformed packets. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
device input that, when processed would lead to gpsd's packet parser
crash (gpsd daemon termination).

Candidate upstream patches [*]:
[3] http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gpsd.git/commit/?id=08edc49d8f63c75bfdfb480b083b0d960310f94f

[*] Candidate because upstream #38511 is private currently:
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?38511 => hard to say
    if [3] is fixing this issue, or the DoS would be caused
    by the malformed packet crash / sample, as listed in [4].
    
@Eric - Eric, could you please help us to solve this doubt? (which
of the patches is the correct one to fix the above mentioned DoS
/ security issue)

Thanks: Goes to Miroslav Lichvar for bringing this one to my attention.

Kurt, could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
