Oh, I'm not muddled, I was using the word "trust" as it appears (34
times) in RFC 4880 - mostly relating to 5.2.3.13 "Trust Signature" and
5.10 "Trust Packet".

And if you seriously think someone who searches for my public key on a
webserver, or through mail, or business card, etc, downloads my public
key from one of the servers, imports it into their own pubring, signs
it with their own private key, then mails it to me, or uploads it to
one of the key servers, all without trusting me in any way, then I'll show
you a pretty awful stalker (and fairly inefficient one, due to the
need to sign my pubkey), a fan boy (which is hardly likely to happen
in my case), or someone who is rather sad. (I'm discounting impaired
judgement due to the baroque processes involved here, sorry xkcd).

i.e. no-one goes to that kind of trouble just to say "I know this
person" - that's what facebook and google+ are for.

Alistair
