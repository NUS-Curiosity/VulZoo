Right.  And that's part of the problem with using existing PGP key
signatures.  They don't convey the piece of information that the project
probably actually cares about.  Open source projects rarely care that I'm
*actually* Russ Allbery, rather than just using that name on-line while
actually legally being named Roger McDowell.  Lawyers may care if they
want to be able to sue me, but that's an edge case.  What projects
actually care about is that I'm the same person, by whatever name, who has
an established track record in multiple other projects and an established
trust basis in the broader community.

You can kind of get there by tying together multiple different pieces of
data, but it's certainly not directly conveyed by PGP key signatures.
