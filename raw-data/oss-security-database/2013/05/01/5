Subject: CVE Request: httplib2 ssl cert incorrect error handling

Hello,

httplib2 only validates SSL certificates on the first request to a
connection, and doesn't report validation failures on subsequent requests.

Bugs:

http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=282
https://bugs.launchpad.net/httplib2/+bug/1175272

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Thanks,

Marc.
