Subject: CVE request: password exposure in kdelibs when showing "internal
 server error" messages

I've not seen this yet; could a CVE be assigned to the following issue?

It was reported that when KDE encounters an "internal server error"
and also prints out the URL that caused the error that it would include
the username and password (if supplied) to the resource that caused the
error.  For instance, it would show
"https://user:password@...otehost.com" or similar.  This is due to
kioslave/http/http.cpp using m_request.url.url() rather than the
sanitized m_request.url.prettyUrl().  This issue is fixed in git.

Note that this information is printed out to the local user actively
using the computer.
