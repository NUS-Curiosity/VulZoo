Subject: CVE Request: kdelibs

Hello Kurt, Steve, all,

A bug in our Launchpad [1] refers to KDE Bug 319428 [2] as fixing a
security issue: displaying raw URLs, including passwords, in a handful
of error messages. A patch is in git [3] to sanitize URLs before
displaying them in the affected error messages.
