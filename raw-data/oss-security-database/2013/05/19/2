Subject: More zPanel security flaws? Trying to sort them out

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

So the head of the zPanel project "ballen" ("Bobby Allen" according to
Google) reports:

======
4) Security issues raised
The security issues mentioned in the following article
(http://imgur.com/a/lzRuo) are already fixed, however we are a short
way off being able to release the new version. All known security
vulnerabilities have been announced on here with fixes and guides.
======

I'm unable to find this list or a dedicated security page (apart from
a list of 4 security features at
http://www.zpanelcp.com/about/features/#tab-1-3).

Can you please send me that list with URLs and ideally source code
commits so we can get CVE #'s assigned to the zPanel vulnerabilities?
Alternatively if anyone in the community wants to do it that'd be
great as well. Thanks in advance.
