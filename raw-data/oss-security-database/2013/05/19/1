Sorry about that. I was in the midst of bumping packages in gentoo to
the snapshot where you had fixed the issue, when I figured it might be
wise to also get the issue tracked with a CVE asap. Sorry for jumping
the gun.

The quote was "I haven't looked into why this happens or if memory
corruption / code execution is a possibility, but at the very least,
it's a nasty DoS."

Which is why I figured it was already a public issue, and therefore
not an issue to track it with a CVE. But apologies, nonetheless, for
jumping the gun. I'll coordinate with you more closely in the future.
