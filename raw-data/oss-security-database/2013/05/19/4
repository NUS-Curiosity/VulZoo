Yes, that would have been much nicer.

We discovered the CVE request at the same time as everyone, on two
public lists along with a script that allows any kiddie to trigger
it... sent by a package maintainer we had talked to minutes ago to
explain the issue and who knew the fix release was two days away.

Anyway, what's done is done, we released earlier, hopefully we get
a bit more coordination next time.

Hopefully, we don't need too many CVE request anyways ;-)
