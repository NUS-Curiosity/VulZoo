Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: net: oops from tcp_collapse() when using
 splice(2)

    Hello,

Linux kernel which supports splice(2) call to move data across file/socket
descriptors via a pipe buffers, is vulnerable to a kernel crash that occurs
while calling splice(2) over a tcp socket which in turn calls tcp_read_sock().

A user/program could use this flaw to cause system crash, resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:

Thank you.
