There should be no need for two separate CVEs for this issue.
Problematic match_hostname was developed in Python 3.  As its
functionality is needed by Python 2 users, and it is not provided by
the standard library, Python 3 implementation was made available via
different module.  It's the same code, packaged in python (3.x) and
python-backports-ssl_match_hostname packages.  The same CVE should
apply to both.

Given that CVE-2013-2099 was assigned to Python 3 ssl, CVE-2013-2098
seems like the one to reject as dupe.
