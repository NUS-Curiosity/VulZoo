Subject: CVE request: CHICKEN Scheme incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122 (select() fs_set buffer overrun)

Hi all,

I'd like to request a CVE for a select() fd_set buffer overrun problem
in CHICKEN Scheme before 4.8.2 and all stable versions up to and
including 4.8.0.3, on non-Windows systems.

The bug exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122.  Originally,
only the userland thread scheduler's use of select() was rewritten to
use POSIX poll().  It was later discovered by Florian Zumbiehl and Joerg
Wittenberger that select() was still being used in three other places.

This bug is remotelye xploitable in networking code, under the right
conditions (if the "ulimit -n" value exceeds FD_SETSIZE).

The announcement can be found at
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2013-05/msg00000.html

There are two commits which together fix the bug:
