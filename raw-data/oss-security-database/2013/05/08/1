Sorry, seem I missed some earlier mail, probably due to my DNS being
temporarily deranged after I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04.

Not quite right.  The problem was with NMEA0183, not with NMEA2000.  But yes,
this crash has been seen in the wild, though not in conjenction with an 
identified attack.

Correct.  The potential AIS overrun has *not* been observed.  The
possibility was reported by someone reading the code.

It is a preventive measure.  I don't think it is presently exploitable,
but I'm not *certain* it isn't.
