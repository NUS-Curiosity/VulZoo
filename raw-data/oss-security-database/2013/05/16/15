Ack, sorry, I considered asking for a CVE and then decided not to since I
wasn't sure anyone would really care given the limited deployment of the
affected code.  That was probably the wrong decision, particularly based
on Kurt's comments yesterday, so I probably should have gone ahead and
done it and included it in the advisory.

I'm happy to include a CVE in the advisory and in the Debian experimental
changelog going forward.
