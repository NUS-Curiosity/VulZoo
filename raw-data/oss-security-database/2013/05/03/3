So this is observed / experienced DoS, right? Kurt, assuming the 
CVE-2013-2038 identifier:
  http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/05/02/17

has been assigned to this sub-case, correct?

Meaning this wouldn't be a DoS attack vector? (asking to know if a
separate / second CVE identifier is needed for this case yet, or not)

Application of the patch looks reasonable. Just would be good to know
if it was applied just like a preventive measure (no DoS right now, just
prevent its [possible] occurrence in the future in case of code change)
or if under certain circumstances it might be used to DoS gpsd too?

Ok, good.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
