Subject: nginx security advisory (CVE-2013-2070)

Hello!

A security problem related to CVE-2013-2028 was identified,
affecting some previous nginx versions if proxy_pass to 
untrusted upstream HTTP servers is used.

The problem may lead to a denial of service or a disclosure of a
worker process memory on a specially crafted response from an
upstream proxied server.

The problem affects nginx 1.1.4 - 1.2.8, 1.3.0 - 1.4.0.

The problem is already fixed in nginx 1.5.0, 1.4.1.  Version 1.2.9
was released to address the issue in the 1.2.x legacy branch.

Patch for nginx 1.3.9 - 1.4.0 is the same as for CVE-2013-2028:
