Subject: CVE Request (minor) --  python-backports-ssl_match_hostname: Denial
 of service when matching certificate with many '*' wildcard characters

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way python-backports-ssl_match_hostname,
an implementation that brings the ssl.match_hostname() function from Python 3.2 to
users of earlier versions of Python, performed matching of the certificate's name
in the case it contained many '*' wildcard characters. A remote attacker, able to
obtain valid certificate [*] with its name containing a lot of '*' wildcard characters,
could use this flaw to cause denial of service (excessive CPU time consumption) by
issuing request to validate that certificate for / in an application using the
python-backports-ssl_match_hostname functionality.

Upstream bug report (no patch yet):

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this (it's possible that 
Python 3.2 implementation is vulnerable to the same problem too,
will check that case yet)?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

[*] Would be minor issue because ability to obtain such valid certificate would
    mean the necessity to use some compromised CA. On the other hand though
    being corner case, can't be completely excluded.
