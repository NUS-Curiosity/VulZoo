Subject: CVE Request: YaBB 2.5.2 and earlier arbitrary code execution

Hi everyone,

Yet another Bulletin Board (YaBB) 2.5.2 and earlier allow arbitrary code
execution through a combination of file uploads with predictable
locations and unsanitized use of the "guestlanguage" cookie in file paths.

This problem is similar to CVE-2007-3295.

The vulnerability can be mitigated by setting the $enable_guestlanguage
variable to 0 in the YaBB configuration or applying the patch provided
in the links.
