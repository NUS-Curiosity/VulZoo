Subject: CVE-2013-2073 transifex-client: Does not validate HTTPS server
 certificate (fixed in transifex-client v0.9)

Hello Steve, vendors,

  It was found that Transifex command-line client, a command line tool for Transifex
translation management, did not perform X.509 certificate verification when using
secured SSL connection. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof
a Transifex server via an arbitrary certificate.

The CVE identifier of CVE-2013-2073 has been allocated to this issue.
