Timo, in relation with the previous (similar) one (thanks to Tomas Hoger for
pointing out):
  [1] http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/8916/focus=8934
  [2] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=695138#15

this time the CVE identifier should be allocated / issue is valid, right?

While in the former [1], [2] case just the connection for the user issuing
the command would crash, this time (assuming) either whole dovecot daemon
might hang or even if the whole daemon wouldn't hang (and request is handled
within a thread), that request would made the particular thread to consume
excessive amount of CPU due to infinite loop, right?

Timo, can you confirm / disprove a CVE identifier should be assigned to this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
