Good morning Alex, the issue you point out below was an unintended result of our upgrade earlier in the week. We will work to have this issue resolved as quickly as possible.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

Hello,

a few days ago, CVE links using the scheme noted in the subject stopped working, and started returning HTTP 404 error codes.
Is this intended?

We have been using this URL scheme for our advisories for the better part of 2 years now, and as we publish advisories via mailing lists and several sites import our advisories, we have no way to retroactively change most of the links. If the change was intended, could you at least have the 'old' URLs reply with a permanent redirect to a new, valid URL?

Thanks,
