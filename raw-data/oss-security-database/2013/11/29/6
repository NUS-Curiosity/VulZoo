Subject: CVE request: ClamAV vulnerabilities

It's a bit late, but i would like to request CVE for two
vulnerabilities, that present in ClamAV before 0.97.7[1]:

1) A double-free error exists within the "unrar_extract_next_prepare()"
function (libclamunrar_iface/unrar_iface.c) when parsing a RAR file.

2) An unspecified error within the "wwunpack()" function
(libclamav/wwunpack.c) when unpacking a WWPack file can be exploited to
corrupt heap memory.
