Subject: CVE request: rubygem omniauth-facebook CSRF vurnerability

# RubyGem omniauth-facebook CSRF vulnerability

There is a security vulnerability in the CSRF protection of
omniauth-facebook 1.4.1.

    Versions affected: 1.4.1
    Not affected:      <= 1.4.0 (*)
    Fixed versions:    >= 1.5.0

(*) Versions <= 1.4.0 did not have any CSRF protection. So, while this
vulnerability does not directly affect versions <= 1.4.0, downgrading
to <= 1.4.0 is not a fix.

## Impact

Because of the way that omniauth-facebook supports setting a
per-request state parameter by storing it in the session, it is
possible to circumvent the automatic CSRF protection. Therefore the
CSRF added in 1.4.1 should be considered broken.

If you are currently providing a custom state, you will need to store
and retrieve this yourself (for example, by using the session store)
to use 1.5.0.

All users running an affected release should upgrade to 1.5.0.

## Releases

The 1.5.0 releases is available at the normal locations.


## Workarounds

None.
