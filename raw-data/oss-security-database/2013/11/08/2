Subject: CVE Request - OpenSSH

Hello Kurt, vendors, et al.

OpenSSH has released an advisory[1] detailing a memory corruption
vulnerability in the post-authentication sshd process when using an
aes*-gcm@...nssh.com cipher.

OpenSSH 6.4/6.4p1 were released to address the problem.

Would you please allocate a CVE for this issue? Thanks.
