Oh sure, I totally agree with you.  But sysadmins and programmers
don't make the decisions on when to assign a CVE.  My recommendation
here applies to security people trying to decide whether or not to
call the baby ugly.  Once the CVE is published (with a description of
actual risk) , sysadmins can just apply the patch.
