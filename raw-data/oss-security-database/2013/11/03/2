Subject: CVE request for a vulnerability in OpenStack Nova

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public,
although an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: XenAPI security groups not kept through migrate or resize
Reporter: Chris Behrens (Rackspace) and Vangelis Tasoulas
Products: Nova
Affects: Folsom, Grizzly

Description:
Chris Behrens with Rackspace and Vangelis Tasoulas reported a set of
vulnerabilities in OpenStack Nova. When migrating or resizing an
instance, including live migration, existing security groups may not
be reapplied after the operation completes. This can lead to
unintentional network exposure for virtual machines. Only setups
using the XenAPI backend are affected.
