RC4 should absolutely not be included.

RC4 is just as broken, if not broken worse than other cryptographic
algorithms. I recommend you check out Matthew Green's blog:
http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/03/attack-of-week-rc4-is-kind-of-broken-in.html

If you search around, you can find similar stories of problems with
RC4 (like this one from Qualys:

 )
