Subject: possible CVE request: Tryton client input sanitization flaw

Hello,

An input sanitization flaw was found in the Tryton client:

http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2013/msg00203.html
https://bugs.tryton.org/issue3446
http://hg.tryton.org/tryton/rev/357d0a4d9cb8

A malicious server could use this flaw to write to files accessible to 
the user running the Tryton client.

There is some discussion in issue3446 about why a CVE may not be needed 
(starting at msg14493), and msg14507 notes a CVE could have possibly 
been assigned via OpenBSD ... so I defer to the CVE experts.

Cheers,
