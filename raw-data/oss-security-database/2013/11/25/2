Subject: CVE request: Kernel MSM - Memory leak in drivers/base/genlock.c

Hello,

The Genlock driver does not properly initialize all members of a structure
before copying it to user space. This allows a local attacker to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via ioctl system
calls.

Upstream fixes:
https://www.codeaurora.org/cgit/quic/la/kernel/msm/commit/drivers/base/genlock.c?id=e3c43027bdb59f03eec7ead0a01c77e4bf801625&h=jb_3.2.3

Could you please assign a CVE id for this issue?

Thanks,

- Jonathan
