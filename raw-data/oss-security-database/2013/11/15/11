Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: net: ipvs stack buffer overflow

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the IP Virtual Server(CONFIG_IP_VS) support is 
vulnerable to a buffer overflow flaw. It could occur while setting or 
retrieving socket options via setsockopt(2) or getsockopt(2) calls. Though a 
user needs to have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to perform these IP_VS operations.

A user/program with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use this flaw to further 
escalate their privileges on a system.

Upstream fix:
-------------
  -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/04bcef2a83f40c6db24222b27a52892cba39dffb
