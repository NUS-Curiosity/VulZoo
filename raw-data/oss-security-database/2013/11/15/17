We don't have a choice? We already paid our money and as far as I know
we have no recourse? We can buy "not that vendor" but all the vendors
do this, simple economics, you paid for it, why would I spend money
supporting it? Especially when that model is no longer being
manufactured. Especially when my customers appear to have no
expectation that I'll support it?

This is why I bought a "dumb" TV. And why I won't get a carrier
controlled Android phone ever (they have a less then perfect upgrade
track record). But most people are not crazy and paranoid like me.

We can't force stuff to die, and I bet those security engineers
usually lose to managers talking about margins and such.

I can't speak to that, even if we support OpenSSL/whatever long term
that's only the tip of the proverbial ice berg. The supply chain for
this stuff is _deep_.
