Subject: CVE Request: Linux kernel: net: uninitialised memory leakage

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the networking support(CONFIG_NET), is vulnerable to a 
memory leakage flaw. It occurs while doing the recvmsg(2), recvfrom(2), 
recvmmsg(2) socket calls.

A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.

Upstream fix:
