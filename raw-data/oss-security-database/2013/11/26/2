I wrote a response to Kurt, suggesting that he had mis-diagnosed the
problem but did not send my response when I found that his message said
the same thing mine said once you replace his first ',' with a ';'. Try
this instead:

[Kurt's words with the first comma replaced with a semicolon.]

It's amazing what a difference two pixels can make. :)

I came up with CWE 212 before I properly parsed Kurt's mail:
CWE-212: Improper Cross-boundary Removal of Sensitive Data

With so much to chose from it's surprising the fix is one line of code. :)
