Subject: CVE Request --  Review Board: Stored XSS due improper sanitization
 of user's full name in the reviews dropdown (fixed in upstream v1.7.10,
  v1.6.17 versions)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  A persistent / stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in
the way reviews dropdown of Review Board, a web-based code review tool,
performed sanitization of certain user information (full name). A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when visited would
lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of
Review Board user's session.
