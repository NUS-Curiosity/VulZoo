Subject: CVE-2013-2850: Linux kernel iSCSI target heap overflow

I found an unauthenticated remote heap buffer overflow in the Linux
iSCSI target subsystem. If there is a target configured and listening
on the network, a remote attacker can corrupt heap memory, and almost
certainly gain kernel execution control. I only got as far as proving
it could Oops the server.

It has been fixed in the upstream iscsi tree:

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/nab/target-pending.git/commit/?id=cea4dcfdad926a27a18e188720efe0f2c9403456

A follow-up has been posted fixing similar anti-pattern uses of
strncpy(dst, src, strlen(src)) in the rest of the kernel:

Thanks,
