Please let me know about this laong with impact/etc so I can confirm
they are security related. It's probably easiest to either post the
CVE requests here if the issue is public, if it needs to be private I
suggest using distros@ or emailing me directly. I would also ask that
you notify distros@ of security issues in any event so vendors can
coordinate releases. For more info people see:

It's the most efficient, I mean Fedora/Debian/etc all have thousands
(Debian is 50k?) packages, that's a lot of software, asking security
researchers to be intimately familiar with it isn't realistic. Plus
most Open Source upstreams want to secure their code and won't mind
(usually).
