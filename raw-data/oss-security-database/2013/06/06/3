Subject: CVE Request: Linux Kernel - Leak information in cdrom driver.

Hi,

When we read a block from the disk it normally fills a buffer but if
the drive is malfunctioning there is a chance that it would only be
partially filled. The result is an leak information to userspace.

Patch applied and committed in the next-line :

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c?id=050e4b8fb7cdd7096c987a9cd556029c622c7fe2


Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks,

-- Jonathan
