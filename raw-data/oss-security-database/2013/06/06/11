We can handle nobody well enough by correcting its mis-use every time
we spot it. There are enough purpose-specific users on a typical system
these days to just give the impression that any new service should get
its own corresponding user, so the temptation to use 'nobody' is lower
than it used to be.

Of course, if a different user account gets abused for both chrooted and
non-chrooted use, that's harder to combat, short of reminding people
that chroot is filesystem and _only_ filesystem..
