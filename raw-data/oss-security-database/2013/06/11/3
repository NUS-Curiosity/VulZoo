Subject: CVE request: WordPress 3.5.1 denial of service vulnerability

There is denial of service vulnerability (CWE-400) in WordPress 3.5.1. Could you
assign CVE identifier, thanks.

Advisory URL: https://vndh.net/note:wordpress-351-denial-service
PoC: https://vndh.net/snippet:wordpress-351-denial-service:wordpress-py
Status: Reported to vendor by founder. No reply.
Reproduced: https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/issues/219
Note: "Exploitation of this vulnerability is possible only when there is at
least one password protected post on the blog."

I have no idea how many uses password protected blog posts and there isn't easy
way to find out. This might also affect multisite installations. There is patch
in advisory, which I did not verify.
