I guess the big question then is what is the way forward?  I'm not that
familiar with CPAN other than occasionally using it, but is there some
kind of governing body that this can be brought up to?  I imagine
someone is going to have to host this and start the wheels moving, but
I honestly have no idea who that might be.

I think it would be ideal to do something like this (in fact, I wish
that all of the module repositories for various programming languages
would do the same).  It might be a great opportunity to show some
leadership in this area so that other languages may adopt something
similar.
