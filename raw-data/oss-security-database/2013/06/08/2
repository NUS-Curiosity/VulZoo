Subject: CVE request: Debian's package "mysql-server" leaks credential
 information

Hi,

The file "/etc/mysql/debian.cnf", which contains plain text credentials
for the "debian-sys-maint" mysql user, is created in an insecure manner
during the package installation phase.  This can lead a non-privileged
local user to disclose its content and use this special account to
perform administration tasks.

Could you allocate CVE id for this issue?

Thank you,
vladz.
