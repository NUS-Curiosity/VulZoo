Subject: CVE Request: Linux kernel: fanotify: info leak in
 copy_event_to_user

    Hi,

Linux kernel built with the Filesystem wide access notification 
(CONFIG_FANOTIFY) support is vulnerable to an information leakage flaw. The 
leaked bytes could be accessed via read(2) call on the fanotify descriptor.

A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.

Upstream fix:
