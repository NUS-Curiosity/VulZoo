Before we were checking PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_PERM_PLM bits.
PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_PERM_PLM is defined as 

#define PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_PERM_PLM \
        (PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_KERNEL |\
         PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_HV)

Can you please explain why that was considered as wrong bits? Shouldn't
we also check for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_HV now? I admit that it has now
more sense that before and it will actually work after you reorganized
and moved the check the way you did, but ain't we leaking some useful
privileged info by not checking for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_PERM_PLM but only
for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_KERNEL?
