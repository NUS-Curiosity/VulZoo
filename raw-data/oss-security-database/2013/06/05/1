Subject: CVE request: kernel: cpqarray/c: info leak in ida_locked_ioctl()

   Hello

A Linux kernel built with the Compaq SMART2(CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_DA) & Compaq Smart 
Array 5xxx(CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA) support is vulnerable to an information 
leakage flaw. This could occur while doing an ioctl(2) calls on the block 
device with command `IDAGETPCIINFO' or `CCISS_PASSTHRU32'.

A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.
