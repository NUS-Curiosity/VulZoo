I care a lot less about what is "officially endorsed" or not endorsed
and a lot more with what is actually going on. If a large percentage
of people are exposed to a vuln, even if they "shouldn't" be then it
would still get a CVE. I see a lot of CVEs that should never be
exploitable, but people do crazy things/configurations.
