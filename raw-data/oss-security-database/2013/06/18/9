In this case the repository key is the former maintainer's personal
PGP key, which it appears he uses to sign deb-multimedia.org (the same
set of packages as the former debian-multimedia.org). I would assume
that it is unlikely to be held on a HSM, but I don't see any reason
why it would now be less safe than it was while debian-multimedia.org
was active.

Anyone who doesn't/didn't trust the maintainer of that repository (and
in particular, anyone who doesn't/didn't trust him to store keys
securely) shouldn't have added that repository's key as "trusted" in
the first place.
