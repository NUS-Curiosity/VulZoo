Subject: CVE request: gnome-shell crash, screen unlock on resume

Upstream GNOME recently fixed a bug that could crash gnome-shell 
immediately after resume:

As noted here, the impact is that after resume, the password entry 
dialog disappears and the user is dropped into the pre-existing X session:

I haven't figured out the exact trigger conditions, but this has 
happened to me a couple of times since switching to Fedora 19 last 
weekend.  It does not appear to be a once-in-a-blue-moon bug.

I think this needs to be tracked as a security bug because screen 
locking is a security feature (which is part of many security policies).
