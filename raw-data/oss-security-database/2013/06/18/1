Looking at man capabilities:

CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
* Use reserved space on ext2 file systems;
* override disk quota limits;
* increase resource limits (see setrlimit(2));
* override RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit;

so it would seem a user/process with this capability can DoS the
system regardless. However in this case would it be possible for the
attacker to trigger a DoS that is difficult (if not impossible) to
trace back to the attacker? In this case it might qualify for a CVE,
but I'd also want to get Steven's thoughts (cc'ed directly).
