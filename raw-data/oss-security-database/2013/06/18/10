Hey,

If a weakness in Debian's package management system signature
verification was identified recently, then this specific issue of
debian-multimedia deserves dedicated attention as it would be a useful
contributing vector; but until then - this isn't an documentable
exposure risk IMO.

Comparing to the definition we use for 'Exposure', a "system
configuration issue" certainly fits the grounds to be assigned a CVE
identifier, but arbitrary package archives which are signed are not
tied to a specific host (re-mirroring is often encouraged), as the
assurance is provided by the signature - not by any means of
transport.

I think the direction Kurt is moving towards is making sure every
distro is thinking what would happen if a popular update domain
changes ownership, is this case considered?  If a CVE identifier helps
make this co-ordinated, then - well, there have been worse uses for
identifiers. :).
