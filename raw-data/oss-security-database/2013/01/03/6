Subject: CVE Request -- rpm (X >= 4.10 and X < 3d74c43 commit): Signature
 checking function returned success on (possibly malicious ) rpm packages

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  RPM upstream has corrected the following security issue:
  [1] https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=796375
  Relevant upstream patch:
  [2] http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=3d74c43

Affected rpm versions include rpm >= 4.10.0 [3] and < than [2] commit.

An attacker could use this flaw to create a syntactically valid rpm
package, that could bypass the signature check.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
