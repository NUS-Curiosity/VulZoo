Subject: DoS vulnerability in the BIND resolver (and potentially others)

Scott Brynen described a behavioral change in some of the UltraDNS
authorative name servers:

Mark Andrews of ISC confirmed that this triggers a denial of service
condition in the BIND recursive resolver:

<https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2013-January/009506.html>

I think he is right, but this obviously has to be fixed in the
resolver.  Can this be assigned a CVE?
