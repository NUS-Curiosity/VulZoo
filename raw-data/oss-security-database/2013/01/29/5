We had no problem having a CVE for this and I initially asked for one.
However, no vulnerability can be described, precisely because haproxy
is designed *not* to access the FS at all once started. The normal way
of working is to start it as root, jail into a chroot and drop privileges,
as it's just a network daemon. That's also why it logs over UDP, as it
cannot access /dev/log. The user/group priv drop are just a hardening
measure "just in case". Same for the chroot. Still, many people run it
as root because they need transparent proxy support, and other ones don't
chroot it because they start it as an application user. That does not
make them vulnerable at all. So if normal use cases are not vulnerable,
it seems reasonable to think that the slightly hardened ones are not much.

But again, I'm not against a CVE, quite the opposite! Someone just has
to describe how to abuse it for this I think.

Regards,
Willy
