Subject: CVE Request: Charybdis and ircd-ratbox remote crash flaw

Hi All,

Saw this report about Charybdis and ircd-ratbox remote crash flaw at:

http://rabbit.dereferenced.org/~nenolod/ASA-2012-12-31.txt
http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/12/31/2241229/efnet-paralyzed-by-vulnerability

Researcher advisory suggests both the products are affected.

Sadly i could not get the contact details of either of the products
to copy on this email.

Should we be assigning CVEs to these issues?
