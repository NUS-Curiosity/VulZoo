Do you believe this would be the case with modern GCC/Glibc hardening
though?  Wouldn't this just be rendered a crash?

But even then, if we're talking about logfiles (which is a reasonable
case) you'd have to be allowing user-controlled input to your logs,
which would mean you'd have another problem.

I'm also assuming, based on the comments in the first bug, that you need
a really large line (not just an entire file, but one line).  How likely
is it that you would be grepping a log file with ~10MB of data on one
line?

Perhaps root grepping/sorting/etc. a logfile is a valid use-case and
some user-supplied input could be stored in there (perhaps a crafted
apache url, etc. or maybe a local user running logger to inject a custom
log entry), but do these programs even allow for a ~10MB in length URL
or data?

(I've not looked, maybe they do?)
