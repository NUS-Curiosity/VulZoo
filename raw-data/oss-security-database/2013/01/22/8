Subject: predictable /tmp filename in git-extras

Please assign a CVE identifier for the obvious predictable /tmp filename
used in git-effort[1] and git-changelog[2]. The latter was discovered by
Jonathan Wiltshire after my initial discovery of the former. The issue
is already tracked within Debian[3] and there also is a solution[4].

Thanks

Helmut
