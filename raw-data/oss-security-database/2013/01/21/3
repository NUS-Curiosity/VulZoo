Subject: Re: [security] CVE Request - SA-CORE-2013-001 (one JQuery X < 1.63
 issue and two Drupal modules issues)

CVE assignment team: Please at least copy security@...pal.org when all four
CVE identifiers have been assigned, and we'll make sure they're publicly
attached to the vulnerabilities as usual. Thanks again to Jan for ferreting
out this issue.

Best,
Forest
