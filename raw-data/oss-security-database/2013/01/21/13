Subject: Re: CVE Request - Wordpress 3.5 Full-path disclosure vulnerability

Yes, I also agree that wordpress should fix this and I understand that this
is a low-priority mostly configuration related issue. I was just not sure
if this was eligible for a CVE or not. I'll keep this reference in mind for
future times.

Thanks for the help!
