It's less about severity (there are actually CVE's with a CVSS2 score
of 0), and more about documentation in this case. Setting
"display_errors" to "On" for PHP is an EXPLICIT security NONO and
generally well known (and the default is "Off"), so basically this is
a "don't point the gun at your foot and pull the trigger because it
will hurt" situation.
