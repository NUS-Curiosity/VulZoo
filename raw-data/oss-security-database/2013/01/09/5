Subject: Xen Security Advisory 33 (CVE-2012-5634) - VT-d interrupt
 remapping source validation flaw

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-5634 / XSA-33
                             version 2

	   VT-d interrupt remapping source validation flaw

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When passing a device which is behind a legacy PCI Bridge through to
a guest Xen incorrectly configures the VT-d hardware. This could allow
incorrect interrupts to be injected to other guests which also have
passthrough devices.

In a typical Xen system many devices are owned by domain 0 or driver
domains, leaving them vulnerable to such an attack. Such a DoS is
likely to have an impact on other guests running in the system.

IMPACT
======

A malicious domain, given access to a device which is behind a legacy
PCI bridge, can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole
system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen version 4.0 onwards is vulnerable.

Only systems using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough are vulnerable.

Any domain which is given access to a PCI device that is behind a
legacy PCI bridge can take advantage of this vulnerability.

Domains which are given access to PCIe devices only are not able to
take advantage of this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices which are
behind a legacy PCI bridge to untrusted guests.

NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO TIMELINE
===============================

After discussion with the discloser we have decided to set a longer
than usual embargo in order to avoid public disclosure during the
holiday period.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
