Subject: CVE Request: remote command-injection flaw in HTTP::Body::Multipart
 versions 1.08 and later

Good morning,

A remote command-injection flaw was reported in HTTP::Body::Multipart 
versions 1.08 and later:

- http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=721634
- https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=88342
- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1005669

The affected code is noted in the Debian bug report.

Could a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already?

Thanks,
