Honestly I don't know what the rule is, 10? 100? 1000? 10000? 65536?

Also I assume it would depend on impact, e.g. a remote code execution
flaw  in a low use product, but one that is critical to the
internet/specific industry would maybe be seen as CVE worthy since it
helps get people on fixing these things.

Mitre: any hints?
