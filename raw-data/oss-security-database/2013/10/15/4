Subject: Report - Stack-based buffer overflow and memory disclosure in camera
 driver (CVE-2013-4748 CVE-2013-4739)

Source: https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/security-advisories/stack-based-buffer-overflow-and-memory-disclosure-camera-driver-cve-2013-4748-cve-2013-4739



Description

A stack-based buffer overflow and a kernel memory disclosure
vulnerability have been discovered in the system call handlers of the
camera driver.

CVE-2013-4738:
The camera post processing engine (CPP) and video processing engine
(VPE) provide an ioctl system call interface to user space clients for
communication. When processing arguments passed to the
VIDIOC_MSM_CPP_DEQUEUE_STREAM_BUFF_INFO or
VIDIOC_MSM_VPE_DEQUEUE_STREAM_BUFF_INFO ioctl subdev handlers, a user
space supplied length value is used to copy memory to a local stack
buffer without proper bounds checking. An application with access to
the respective device nodes can use this flaw to, e.g., elevate
privileges.

Access Vector: local
Security Risk: high
Vulnerability: CWE-121 (stack-based buffer overflow)

CVE-2013-4739:
The Gemini JPEG encoder and the Jpeg1.0 common encoder/decoder engines
of the camera driver are not properly initializing all members of a
structure before copying it to user space. This allows a local
attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via ioctl system calls.

Access Vector: local
Security Risk: low
Vulnerability: CWE-200 (information exposure)

Affected versions
All Android releases from CAF using a Linux kernel from the following heads:

msm-3.4
jb_3*
