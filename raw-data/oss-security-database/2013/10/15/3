>I don't think web browser dos's are suppose to be CVE worthy.

A complete crash of a typical web browser is currently always eligible
for a CVE assignment from MITRE. This, of course, doesn't mean that a
Red Hat Security Advisory would necessarily be published for that
issue alone. It also doesn't mean that browser vendors actively
request CVE assignments for all such issues.

An example where a CVE assignment isn't made is a clean crash (no
memory corruption) of a single process associated with browsing a
single web site, i.e., a "tab crash" in some browsers. This might be
caused by a malicious web site that triggers a divide by zero. In that
situation, it's generally not possible for the crash to disrupt the
end user's ongoing work.
