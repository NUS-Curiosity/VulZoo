Sorry forgot to reply. I'm not sure this is CVE worthy. In general
crash bugs in services are CVE worthy, but crashes in client software
are usually limited to things like email clients or web browsers where
there is a high potential for processing untrusted data without much
user interaction (e.g. displaying some random email or web page) whre
you also have the potential to lose work (so there is an impact).

In the case of VLC you load a nasty file, it crashes, you don't do it
again. There's not really any impact. You don't lose any work.

Now the question becomes "possible code execution" is how possible?
This is based on the fact that memory corruption occurs, or is there
more evidence?
