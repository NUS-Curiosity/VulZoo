Apologies I should have been more explicit. The difference is that
with a stateful backend when the user  hits log out they are logged
out in the back end, so the cookie can't be used any more. With these
stateless solutions there is no way to prevent cookie reply other than
encoding a time out in the cookie (so I guess you could encode like a
short time out and keep rotating the cookie to close the window of
opportunity).

The concern is people using public terminals, cookie stealing attacks,
XSS in the website you're using, etc allowing an attacker to snag your
cookie and use it post "log out".
