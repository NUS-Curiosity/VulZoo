Subject: Re: A note on cookie based sessions

I don't think this really is a vulnerability is it? I mean it's basically how
the internet works. The only difference between a cooke backed session
and a regular session is that there's no server side session to destroy.
At least in Django's case, It's not a permanent session though, they are
only good for a limited amount of time before the signature on the cookie
expires.

If you have access to the session cookie you've already won the game, you've
gotten an XSS or MITM and can do much worse then a session cookie.
