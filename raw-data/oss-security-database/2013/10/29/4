Subject: CVE request for a vulnerability in OpenStack Keystone

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public,
although an advisory was not sent yet.

"""
Title: Unintentional role granting with Keystone LDAP backend
Reporter: The IBM OpenStack test team
Products: Keystone
Affects: Grizzly, Havana

Description:
The IBM OpenStack test team reported a vulnerability in role change
code within the Keystone LDAP backend. When a role on a tenant is
removed from a user, and that user doesn't have that role on the
tenant, then the user may actually be granted the role on the tenant.
A user could use social engineering and leverage that vulnerability to
get extra roles granted, or may accidentally be granted extra roles.
Only Keystone setups using a LDAP backend are affected.
