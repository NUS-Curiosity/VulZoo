That's the right patch.

That should be https://secure.ucc.asn.au/hg/dropbear/rev/d7784616409a 
for the user disclosure.

I don't think the constant-time memcmp (a625f9e135a4) is
worth noting with a CVE. The packet HMAC is non-repeatable
for an attacker. The password crypt comparison has too long
a delay between tries, I think the majority of programs
would use straight strcmp().

Cheers,
Matt
