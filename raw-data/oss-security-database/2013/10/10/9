The duplicate issue is still embargoed, the other one is also an
embargoed issue. I have made notes in our system to notify
oss-security/Mitre when they unembargo (so we'll announce the details
then).

In future should we hold CVE reject notifications until we can provide
the information as to why? I figured sooner was better (but I can also
see holding off until details can be released being a sane choice).
