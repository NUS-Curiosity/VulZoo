Subject: CVE request: slapd segfaults on certain queries with rwm overlay
 enabled

The following was reported to us, but has already been reported
publicly upstream.  Could a CVE be assigned to it?

It was discovered that OpenLDAP, with the rwm overlay to slapd, could
segfault if a user were able to query the directory and immediately
unbind from the server.  This seems to be due to the rwm overlay not
doing reference counting properly, so rwm_conn_destroy frees the session
context while rwm_op_search is using it.  This condition also seems to
require multiple cores/CPUs to trigger.

This is currently not fixed upstream.
