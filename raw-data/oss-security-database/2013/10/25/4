Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: net: memory corruption with UDP_CORK and
 UFO

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with an Ethernet driver(ex virtio-net) which has UDP 
Fragmentation Offload(UFO) feature ON is vulnerable to a memory corruption 
flaw when UDP_CORK socket option is set. It could occur when sending large 
messages, wherein all messages are not greater than maximum transfer unit(MTU) 
of the underlying medium.

An unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting 
in DoS, or potentially execute arbitrary code to escalate privileges to gain 
root access to a system.

Upstream fix:
