Subject: CVE Request: lightdm no longer confines guest profile with AppArmor

Hello,

Christian Prim discovered that Light Display Manager 1.8.0 and later no longer
use the appropriate wrapper when launching guest sessions, resulting in the
session not being confined by AppArmor.

Bug report:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/1243339

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Thanks,

Marc.
