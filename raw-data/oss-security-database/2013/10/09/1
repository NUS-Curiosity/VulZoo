This is primary and undoubtedly correct recommendation.

True.

Well, hashing functions may be reverted using rainbow tables, but
even this simple recommendation pushes web developers to think
about their sites' security.

This document is destined for people who never cared of security,
so I'd suggest only one addition:

"To prevent password recovery using the rainbow tables, don't use
these functions on a plain password; instead, choose some string
to be used as a salt, and use hash(hash(password)+salt) values."

This is not a bug, this is incompleteness. Minor one, I'd say...
