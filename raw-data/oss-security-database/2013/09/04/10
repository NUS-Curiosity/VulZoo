I'm curious about this.  If, say, a modern TLS library some day decides
to get around to implementing (old, deprecated, known-insecure,
previously-unimplemented) SSLv2, and announces it as a feature, and
enables it by default, is the consensus of this group that we would not
treat it as worthy of a CVE, despite being a clear security weakening?

At what point does the security community override the upstream
decisions and declare the packages vulnerable?
