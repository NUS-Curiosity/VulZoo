Well, what choice do any of us have? I understand the attacker could know a 
hole in the program doing disassembly or categorization of the file, but I have 
to assume any bug there will be found eventually as gcc stack protector and 
other mitigations get better. But we have to have a starting point.

I don't believe in giving up. I can verify most rebuilds right now. When holes 
are found they get addressed. So far, there has been great feedback on this. I 
am adapting the detections based on this feedback. It may never be 100% fool-
proof. The build environment could be thoroughly trojaned or the OS. But let's 
start in the direction of proof and see what we find.

For example, this tool kit might be of interest where people outsource 
augmentation of a system and want to check what all the contractor changed. 
You don't always need to think you are against the NSA to do something that is 
worthwhile. But, hopefully, its tight enough to catch that threat eventually.

That was changed to a sed '1,2d' which takes care of the same problem better.

This script is under development and not finished. I have only setup the 
detection of jar files with the intent of completing their comparison by 
unzipping them and doing a file by file comparison and/or further expansion 
because it could contain more jar files. The whole purpose is to eliminate the 
inherent time stamp in the file. The next major release should have this 
solved.

I appreciate the feedback. I want to make it better.
