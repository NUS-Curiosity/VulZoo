Subject: Buffer overrun vulnerability in CHICKEN Scheme

Hi all,

I'd like to request a CVE for a recently discovered vulnerability in
CHICKEN Scheme.  It affects a very particular, not very common use
of the read-string! procedure.  If given a buffer and #f (the Scheme
value for "false") as the buffer's size (which should trigger automatic
size detection but doesn't), it will read beyond the buffer, until the
input port (file, socket, etc) is exhausted.  This may result in the
typical potential remote code execution or denial of service; in
CHICKEN, these buffers are initially allocated on the stack and moved
to the heap upon GC.

In normal usage, users would usually pass in the buffer's size.  This
is also the workaround for this bug.

For the official announcement, see
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2013-09/msg00000.html

The discussion thread's final accepted patch is at
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2013-09/msg00009.html
which got applied as http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commit;h=cd1b9775005ebe220ba11265dbf5396142e65f26

All versions of CHICKEN prior to 4.8.0.5 and 4.8.3 (not yet released)
are affected.

Cheers,
Peter Bex
