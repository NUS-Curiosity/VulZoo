Subject: CVE request: X2Go server

Hi all,
I couldn't find a CVE, so I would like to request one for a
vulnerability in X2Go Server. The vendor reported an issue where a
remote user could execute arbitrary code as the x2go user, apparently by
leveraging a setgid executable which did not have a hardcoded path to
"libx2go-server-db-sqlite3-wrapper.pl". [1] is the commit fixing the
vulnerable code, [2] is the upstream release announcement.

Thanks,
Chris Reffett
