Upstream is CCd so they can and should reply in case I made errors in this email.

Could not reproduce this issue:

Multiple XSS issues in fixed in ./Sources/ManageServer.php by changing
addslashes to preg_replace. I don't know who reported these or if these fixes
are related to vulnerabilities listed below.

From http://hauntit.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/en-smf-204-full-disclosure.html

"""
First of all, let's check a local file include vulnerability. If admin will not
delete the install.php file after installation, attacker is able to run command
and compromise the server. Idea is simple. User who is able to put php-file
(with webshell) at SMF-installed-server, can exploit a require_once() function
to get a shell at remote host.
"""

No CVE as per installation requests user to delete install.php and offers easy
way to do it in the installation process. Please comment if you feel otherwise.
Did not try to reproduce this issue. Probably not the only issue if user does
not delete install.php file.

SMF guys, this CSRF should help to verify this issue. Can you fix this in next
release? Contact me in case you need help.
