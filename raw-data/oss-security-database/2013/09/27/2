FWIW, when we build compilers (and then all other binaries) at Google, 
we don't just aim for, but actually achieve bit-identical rebuilds.

New GCC releases often break this, but a few patches later the 
capability is restored. Latest example: 
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/127875

The ability to do bit-identical rebuild is critical to our build system 
(http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/09/build-in-cloud-distributing-build-steps.html) 
and in particular the high cache hit rates it achieves.
