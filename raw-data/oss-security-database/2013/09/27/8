I was there but the talk was too technical ;)

After some thinking (and after reading Alexander's emails) I think that
producing byte-for-byte identical builds is the only sane choice we are
left with.

I had this "byte-for-byte" clause in my initial version of the proposal
but I dropped it, thinking that it was too "ambitious" for an initial
proof-of-concept. It was probably a bad decision on my part. 

That being said, we have started working towards getting byte-for-byte
identical builds.
