This use of CVE-2013-5903 is a typo. The original CVE for this
disclosure was correctly entered by the researcher at:

  http://ceriksen.com/2013/08/20/graphite-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-advisory/

(Also, the original CVE was not intended to be an XSS CVE.)

The correct assignments are:

CVE-2013-5093: unsafe use of Python's pickle module in render/views.py

CVE-2013-5942: unsafe use of Python's pickle module in other 0.9.10
               files that were not mentioned in the ceriksen.com post

CVE-2013-5943: XSS, as reported in 0_9_11.rst

CVE-2013-5903: a rejected CVE - a use of this CVE could conceivably mean
               any of CVE-2013-5093, CVE-2013-5942, or CVE-2013-5943
