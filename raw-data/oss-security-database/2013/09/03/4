Until and unless upstream acknowledges that this isn't by design (which
the changelog entry most definitely indicates it _is_ by design) then I
don't think there's anything we can do.

I mean, if someone wants to shoot themselves in the foot and document it
as a feature, who are we to say otherwise?  We may not agree with it,
but it's a documented feature (deliberately changed), so we can't just
very well call it a security flaw because we don't like the new
behaviour.

Having said that, it would be fantastic if the folks at Nagios would
speak up and put this to rest.  It could be a design decision that went
too lax (thus being a flaw, exposing more than intended), or this might
actually be what was meant.  Until upstream says one way or another, I
would consider this not a security flaw.
