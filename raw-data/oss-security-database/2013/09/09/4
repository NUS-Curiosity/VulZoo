Subject: CVE request: Torque privilege escalation

>From the torque advisory 
http://www.supercluster.org/pipermail/torqueusers/2013-September/016098.html :

*Vulnerability:* A non-privileged user who can run jobs or login to a
node running
pbs_server or pbs_mom can submit an arbitrary job to the cluster; that job
can run as root. The user can submit a command directly to a pbs_mom daemon
to queue and run a job. A malicious user could use this vulnerability to
remotely execute code as root on the cluster.


*Versions Affected:* All versions of TORQUE


*Mitigating Factors:*

- The user must be logged in on a node that is already legitimately able to
contact pbs_mom daemons or submit jobs.

- If a user submits a job via this defect and pbs_server is running,
pbs_server will kill the job unless job syncing is disabled. It may take up
to 45 seconds for pbs_server to kill the job.

- There are no known instances of this vulnerability being exploited.
