* Kurt Seifried:

> Format String please use CVE-2013-4258

This was actually fixed in r285, before the report:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=E1Rp1rP-00038Z-VJ%40sfp-svn-6.v30.ch3.sourceforge.com&forum_name=nas-commits

In case someone else is wondering why there hasn't been a recent
commit fixing a format string issue. :-)
