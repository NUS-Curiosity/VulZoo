In openSUSE we have reproducible binaries to a certain extend. That
project was started some years ago with different (non-security)
intentions. Since the build service rebuilds packages automatically
if any depending package changes, a way was needed to avoid publishing new
rpms if the build result result didn't actually change. So there are
now some scripts that automatically run at the of a new build and
determine with some heuristics whether the new rpms match the old
rpms¹. You can see the output of that script in every build log in
openSUSE:Factory.
