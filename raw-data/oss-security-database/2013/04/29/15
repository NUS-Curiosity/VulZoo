In general if you support SSL the assumption is you do it sanely, e.g.
verify certificates/hostnames/etc, because if not the whole thing is
useless since an attacker can MitM you easily (generally the thing SSL
is designed to stop). So worthy of a CVE generally.

Please use CVE-2013-2025for this issue.
