Subject: Re: Nginx ngx_http_close_connection function integer
 overflow - can anyone confirm this?

hey Andrew,

I wrote a test program[1] that would generate a bunch of random bytes
as http post payload. I ran it for hours but only make the
r->count==>4. It seems like Nginx community not confirm this issue
yet. I tried to contact 360 guys but didn't get reply.
