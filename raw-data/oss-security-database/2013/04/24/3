Subject: Multiple potential security issues fixed in ClamAV 0.97.8 - any
 further details?

Hello Felix,

  this is due the ClamAV 0.97.8 release:
  [1] http://blog.clamav.net/2013/04/clamav-0978-has-been-released.html
  [2] https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-devel/blob/0.97/ChangeLog
  [3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=956176
  [4] https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=816865

Could you clarify how many and what kind of possible security issues
has been corrected within this release? (so we would know how many
CVE identifiers should be allocated to these)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
