The x86 verion is ok but asm-generic version of get_user() doesn't
clear x.

include/asm-generic/uaccess.h

   226  #define get_user(x, ptr)                                        \
   227  ({                                                              \
   228          might_sleep();                                          \
   229          access_ok(VERIFY_READ, ptr, sizeof(*ptr)) ?             \
   230                  __get_user(x, ptr) :                            \
   231                  -EFAULT;                                        \
   232  })
