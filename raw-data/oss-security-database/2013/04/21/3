Coming from one of the common upstreams (X.Org), it would really be
helpful if there was a "Best Practices" page we could reference, since
we've gotten a couple complaints that we're not doing enough, but not
concrete enough suggestions that we can go modify our release script to
implement them.   (Currently we include MD5, SHA1, & SHA256 checksums in
the release announcement e-mails, which we tell maintainers to pgp sign
with their own keys when sending - though unfortunately most of the
mailing list archives break the ability to verify when they mangle
email addresses to prevent spam harvesting from their archives.)

If there was a common standard, with instructions, we'd be far more
likely to spend the time to adopt it, than just a "make signatures
appear somewhere, in an unspecified format".
