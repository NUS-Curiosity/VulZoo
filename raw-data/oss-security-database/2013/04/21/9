OK, I've just subscribed you.

I think it wouldn't have been unreasonable for the oss-security
community to expect you "to form a more official security response"
before joining linux-distros, so now you're sort of in debt. ;-)

Specifically, there doesn't appear to be an announcement channel for
Arch Linux security updates, nor even an issue tracker or change log
with security issues and fixes clearly marked as such.  You've listed a
bug tracker URL at:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors#arch-linux

which is:

https://bugs.archlinux.org

Going to that URL, I see a list of all sorts of bugs.  Searching it for
"security", I find only 2 bugs.  Perhaps there were many more security
issues that you've actually dealt with, and you need to start
documenting them as such for your users.
