Subject: CVE Request: VLC Buffer Overflow in ASF Demuxer

Hi Kurt

I have not found a CVE assigned for the following issue already (note
upstream advisory also has only a CVE reference reference marked):

VLC Security Advisory 1302 is about Buffer Overflow in ASF Demuxer:

http://www.videolan.org/security/sa1302.html

With upstream git commit:

http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commitdiff;h=b31ce523331aa3a6e620b68cdfe3f161d519631e

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue (in case it's not yet in progress)
to better track the issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
