Subject: CVE Request: kernel information leak in fs/compat_ioctl.c
	VIDEO_SET_SPU_PALETTE

Hi,

Should also get a CVE.

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/12176503366885edd542389eed3aaf94be163fdb

commit 12176503366885edd542389eed3aaf94be163fdb

    fs/compat_ioctl.c: VIDEO_SET_SPU_PALETTE missing error check

    The compat ioctl for VIDEO_SET_SPU_PALETTE was missing an error check
    while converting ioctl arguments.  This could lead to leaking kernel
    stack contents into userspace.

    Patch extracted from existing fix in grsecurity.

Ciao, Marcus
