This is a great article and I really appreciate the work that went into the research.

This is a good discussion to have.  I've recently started working on "best practices" articles at Red Hat and feel this would make an excellent article on how we can all improve the security of our source code that inevitably gets pushed into the various distributions.  

What is really the best, most proper way of desiminating releases?  I really don't like the use of MD5 for checksums (I'd prefer something out of the SHA-2 or SHA-3 family of hashing algorithms) and I really *do* like the use of PGP for signing the code.  I do foresee some practices within the use of PGP that might not be great, though.

So what is the best way of authenticating the source code?
