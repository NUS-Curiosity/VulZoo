Looking at this list, is there some way to restrict this new 
functionality to, say, membership in a certain group?  At present, most 
system users (daemons) do not need this functionality, so it would make 
sense to restrict access to it.

Or is the expectation that we disable CONFIG_USER_NS until things 
stabilize further?
