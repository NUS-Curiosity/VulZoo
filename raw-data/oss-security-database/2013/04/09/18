Subject: Re: Postfix incorrect permissions on
 configurations. Request.

The scripts inside are -world- executable, is the main concern here.  Certainly this can be changed by the end user but seems like an insecure default.  I've seen discussions and CVE's assigned for past cases where log directories are world readable and vice versa, if this is not the correct place to send, please advise.
