I've seen discussions and CVE's assigned for past cases where log directories are world readable and vice versa, if this is not the correct place to send, please advise.

What's wrong with the scripts being world-executable?
They run with user permissions, if the user can't read
or write something the script wont do it either.
There's no need to change the default.

And especially there's no need to change permissions
for main.cf and master.cf - these files don't contain
private information (if you use, say, sql map, its
username+password is stored in a separate file with
proper permissions).

Please don't top-post.

Thanks,
