Arch Linux does have similar system (our package building infrastructure
uses PGP signature verification if available, any of a variety of
checksums).

The point of my post was that if upstream does not provide anything when
they release a tarball, then they really do not help that much...  It
just verifies that the source the packager downloaded is the same as the
source you have.  It does not save you if the source was altered before
the packager obtained it.
