Subject: CVE Request -- drupal7-views : SA-CONTRIB-2013-035 - Views - Cross
 Site Scripting (XSS)

Hello Kurt, Steve, Drupal Security Team, vendors,

  Drupal upstream has released:
  [1] http://drupal.org/node/1948358

and updated version of the Views module (Views 7.x-3.6):
[2] http://drupal.org/node/1948354

correcting one cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.

AFAICT from [1], there doesn't seem to be a CVE identifier
for this issue yet.

Could you allocate one?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
