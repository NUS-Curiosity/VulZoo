Sure thing; I'm not asking you to go through that list. It's just that
it is a kind of indicator that there are potentially quite a number of
issues that aren't being tracked properly.

And thanks for clarifying your position regarding the original sources
of information. I hope that in the future there won't be any such
cases where an id isn't assigned due to miscommunication.
