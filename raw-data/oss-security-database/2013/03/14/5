This is timely:

http://cr.yp.to/talks/2013.03.12/slides.pdf

one quote:

2012.06.07 Stevens: "A chosen-
prefix collision attack against
MD5 has been used for Flame.
More interestingly ... not our
published chosen-prefix collision
attack was used, but an entirely
new and unknown variant."

CrySyS: Flame file wavesup3.drv
appeared in logs in 2007; Flame
"may have been active for as long
as five to eight years".
