It's not just for kernel vulns? At this point I literally don't
understand the conversation, it appears some people have theoretical
concerns about openness/etc. but I'm not seeing anything remotely
evidence based to support their positions. OTOH we have the kernel
devs like Greg who are making arguments based on past
behaviour/evidence of basically what works/what doesn't work. I should
note that the standards and current processes have worked quite well
AFAIK (I've only really been tracking Linux security closely for 14
years now, prior to summer of 1999 I can't really say).

If anyone has really evidence based problems/issues to bring up,
please do so. Otherwise can we stop with all the hand waving, keep
doing what we have been doing which seems to work quite well and let
Greg/etc. get back to work?

If you want to discuss the theoretical/philosophical nature of
information security as applied to the Linux kernel I'd be happy to
set up a separate list for that, OSS-Security isn't really the right
venue.
