Aren't these problems true for any source whether it be primary,
secondary, tertiary, or so on?

I don't understand the purpose of excluding an entire project's
sources.  Should redhat's bugzilla, gentoo, etc. also be excluded for
the same reason?  If not, why do they get special treatment?

Is there really a problem at all?  The debian report included the
upstream commit, so you had a link to a primary resource anyway.  So,
I think a simple solution to this 'problem' of secondary sources is
follow them to the primary one?

Best wishes,
