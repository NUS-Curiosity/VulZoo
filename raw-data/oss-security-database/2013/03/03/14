This actually raises a good point, due to Debian being a secondary
source in most cases (e.g. upstream has a bug report which is then
copied into Debian's bug tracker since Debian ships it) the dates and
sometimes information is wrong. I will no longer be issuing CVE's for
issues brought up through the Debian bugtracker without an original
source to back it up, otherwise more mistakes will happen which is not
good.
