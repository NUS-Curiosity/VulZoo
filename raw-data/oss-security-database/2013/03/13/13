Subject: Temporary Notifications of New CVE Entries During NVD Outage


As some people know, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is
having a temporary outage.  At http://nvd.nist.gov/, NIST says "We are
working to restore service as quickly as possible."

Many people rely on NVD feeds to learn about newly-updated CVEs.  The
CVE web site does not provide such feeds, since that would duplicate
NVD functionality.

However, the CVE project sends notification emails for newly-updated
CVEs to a limited set of CVE-compatible users, often several times a
day.  Until NVD service is reliably restored, I will be posting these
"CVENEW" messages to the Vulnerability Information Managers (VIM)
list.  While CVENEW messages do not contain the extra data that NVD
provides, such as CVSS and CPE names, hopefully this will help some
people to monitor new CVEs.

CVENEW messages will be found in the VIM archives at:

    http://www.attrition.org/pipermail/vim/2013-March/thread.html

Note that the VIM list is not the place to post general vulnerability 
announcements; it is specifically for maintainers of vulnerability 
databases and information services, who use VIM to discuss accuracy 
problems and other challenges in the post-disclosure analysis of 
vulnerability announcements.

This is only a temporary action for the convenience of the security
community.  We will disable the CVENEW announcements to the VIM list
once NVD service has been restored.
