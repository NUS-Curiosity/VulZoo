Yes, I've found that while investigating the possible impact. Also,
the random.c doesn't use the data directly, but instead hashes it.

But my opinion stays exactly the same: devices should be 0644, and
only trusted random data sources should be used to add entropy to
the pool via add_device_randomness(). For my own needs, I prefer a
$5 hardware RNG (consisting of ATtiny85 and LM393) plugged to USB,
or even several such devices working in parallel.

So, I'll just restrict the access to /dev/{,u}random locally :-)
