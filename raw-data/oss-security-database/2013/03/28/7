There is also openscap if you are wanting security auditing.
http://www.open-scap.org/page/Main_Page

You can get SCAP content from various places.

As far as tools, I often look at the collection at the owasp web site:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Phoenix/Tools

web scarab and sqlmap are good.

There are lots of tools here as well:

There are so many tools, its hard to find the ones that are well maintained. 
Many are good at first and then bit rot over the years.
