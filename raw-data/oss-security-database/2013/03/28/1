Hi,

I am sometimes using Splint. From http://www.splint.org/ "Splint is a 
tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and 
coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a better 
lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs, 
Splint can perform stronger checking than can be done by any standard lint."

Cheers.
