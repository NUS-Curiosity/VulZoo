That's a load of crap.

Seriously, you know it only benefits the "bad guys" if I were to say,
"This patch just went into Linus's tree that fixes a security problem
that you can exploit in this manner".  No user would have a chance to
fix their systems before the vulnerability was added to the
"ultra-sploit" tool and everyone would have their systems trashed.

If you so strongly believe this, why is there a linux-distros list in
the first place?

Come on, be realistic people.
