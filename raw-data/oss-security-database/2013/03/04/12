I think there's a difference between disclosing the vulnerability and 
disclosing it with a related exploit. The first one allows to fulfill what 
Michael Gilbert explains without the consequences that you focus on.

And as Michael Gilbert insisted on, I deeply think that the asymmetry of the 
problem should be taken into account for defining the way of dealing with 
security flaws.
