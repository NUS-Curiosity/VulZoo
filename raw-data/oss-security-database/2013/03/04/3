Sorry yeah I should have been more clear. This goes for all the major
secondary sources (Debian, SUSE, etc.).

I didn't say I;'m excluding them. I simply will require an original
source, in this case the year is probably wrong.

Yeah, and people can post them to the list. As stated before, I assign
a lot of CVEs. One minute extra per CVE is about 20 hours a year. It
adds up. So from now on I'll be needing original source confirmation
in the emails to oss-sec.
