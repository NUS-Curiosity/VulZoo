Reconsider just what specifically?  You bring up a bunch of issues that
the distros need to consider, what can the Linux kernel security team do
differently?  We were asked to notify the linux-distro list, and now we
will be doing that.  Should we not and just go back to how things were
before?

Again, I don't think anyone that is part of security@...nel.org minds
about having the issues publicized, after linux-distro has their time
to get things fixed and to their users.  If the linux-distro people care
about that, that does not seem to be a security@...nel.org group issue,
right?

totally confused,
