This is a very weak security measure, but yes, the need to check the
reverse DNS results with a forward DNS query to make the security check at
all useful has been well-known going all the way back to the days when TCP
wrappers was the UNIX firewalling system of choice.  I remember discussion
of this in security contexts in 1994, and I'm sure it was an old
discussion even then.
