Ldoce Ruby Gem:

Easily interface with the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API from Ruby:

NB currently mac only as it depends on the afplay command.

https://github.com/markburns/ldoce

Ldoce passes an mp3 url to commandline for audio output of the pronunciation of a dictonary word:

If the URL or filename for the mp3 files contain shell metï»¿acharacters code can be executed remotely as the client:

[./ldoce-0.0.2/lib/ldoce/word.rb]

      if mp3?
        unless File.exists? filename
          command = "curl #{mp3_url} -silent > {filename}"
          `{command}`
        end
        `afplay #{filename}`
      end
