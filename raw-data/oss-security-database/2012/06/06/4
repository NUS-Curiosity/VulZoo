Subject: CVE request: rack-cache caches sensitive headers (Set-Cookie)

Hi Kurt, Steve, vendors,

rake-cache caches sensitive response headers such as Set-Cookie. Attackers 
with access to the cache could possibly obtain other user's cookies to e.g. 
bypass authentication.

More information (including patch) available at our bugzilla:
  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=763650

Kurt, could you possibly assign a CVE for this issue, please? Thank you in
advance!

Matthias
