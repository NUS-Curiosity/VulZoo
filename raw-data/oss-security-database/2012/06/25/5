Subject: CVE 2011-* Request -- rhythmbox (context plug-in): Insecure temporary
 directory use by loading template files for 'Album', 'Lyrics', and 'Artist'
 tabs

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   An insecure temporary directory use flaw was found in the way Rhythmbox, an integrated music 
management application based on the powerful GStreamer media framework, performed loading of HTML 
template files, used for rendering of 'Album', 'Lyrics', and 'Artist' tabs. Previously the 
'/tmp/context' directory has been searched as module directory when loading the HTML template files. 
A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (possibly leading to 
attacker's ability to execute arbitrary HTML template file in the context of user running the 
rhythmbox executable).

Upstream bug report:
[1] https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678661

References:
[2] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=616673

Please note the [2] bug has been reported / opened on:
"Date: Sun, 06 Mar 2011 14:58:46 +0100" yet, so this should
get a CVE-2011-* identifier. Could you allocate one?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
