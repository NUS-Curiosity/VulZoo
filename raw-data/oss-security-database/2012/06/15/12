Subject: CVE request: java hashdos vulnerability

Hi,

Seems java is fixing HashDos finally:
http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2012-May/010238.html

They don't mention hashdos, but the interesting part is here:
"The enhanced hashing implementation uses the murmur3 hashing
algorithm[1] along with random hash seeds and index masks"

random hash seeds is what prevents hashdos.

Further info here:

Please assign CVE.

cu,
