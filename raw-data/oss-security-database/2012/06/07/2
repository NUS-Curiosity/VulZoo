Subject: CVE request: Mojarra allows deployed web applications to read FacesContext from other applications

Could a CVE please be assigned for this issue:

It was found that in Mojarra, the FacesContext that is made available during application startup is held in a ThreadLocal. The reference is not properly cleaned up in all cases. As a result, if a JSF WAR calls FacesContext.getCurrentInstance() during application startup, another WAR can get access to the leftover context and thus get access to the other WAR's resources.

Bug for JBoss-specific impacts: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-9197

Thanks
