Subject: CVE request: arbitrary code exec in bcfg2

bcfg2 suffers from an arbitrary code execution flaw due to the Trigger
plugin.  Upstream has corrected the issue in git, but no released
packages are available and it looks like this has been around for a
while (indicated that 1.x is affected as well, up to and including the
current 1.2.2 release).

Looks like an authenticated remote root compromise (need to be able to
log into bcfg2 to exploit it, and bcfg2 typically runs as root).

Could a CVE be assigned to this please?
