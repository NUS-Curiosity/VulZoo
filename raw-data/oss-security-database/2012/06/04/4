The message is seen here:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/30/15

The "month view" currently shows Subjects of only up to 10 messages per
day, with a "more messages" link in place of the 10th message in case
there are more than 10.  The "day view" shows all messages for that day:

Maybe we should adjust this setting - say, to 30 or even 100 (messages
per day shown in month view)?

I don't know why no one has replied.  I guess this was not intentional
and someone will reply now.  Kurt?
