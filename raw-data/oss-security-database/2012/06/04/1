Subject: CVE Request -- Symfony / php-symfony-symfony: Session fixation flaw
 corrected in upstream 1.4.18 version

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a session fixation flaw was found in the way Symfony, an open-source PHP web applications 
development framework, performed removal of user credential, adding several user credentials at once 
and 'user authenticated' settings change by regenerating session ID. A remote attacker could provide 
a specially-crafted URL, that when visited by a valid Symfony application user (victim) could lead 
to unauthorized access to the victim's user account.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (afaics there hasn't been
requested one for this issue yet during last month / from the start
of June 2012)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
