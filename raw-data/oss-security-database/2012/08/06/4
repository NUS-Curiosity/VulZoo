Hi there,

As you may have heard, Nokia has a few issues these days with MeeGo, so
it's not surprising that they haven't contacted upstreams if you
reported it to them  :-)

Calligra is a (maintained) fork of KOffice. At this point it's not clear
to me, based on commit activity, if KOffice is maintained.

Regardless, I guess I'd like a CVE for both (or two CVEs, depending on
your preferences).
