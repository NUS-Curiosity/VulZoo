Subject: Re: CVE request for Calligra

Hi Kurt.  

Yes, sorry I didn't report directly to the correct people.  I only knew that the vulnerability existed for sure in the Nokia Documents app and also in the version of Koffice I happen to have on my system.  I didn't know what library it was in (I'd never even heard of Calligra), if it was already known about upstream, what other software depend on this library, etc.  As you're probably aware, it can be a very time consuming process to try to get that stuff sorted out, so I just report it to the vendor and let them deal with these issues.  In that spirit, I reported to Nokia early last month.  As for your questions, I have not asked for CVE's for any of these vulnerabilities.  Feel free to request them yourselves.  I believe the only vulnerability I know enough details about to say is a security issue is the one in the document about parsing word documents.  I hope that clears up any questions you might have.  Thanks!

Charlie
