Subject: CVE Request: Heap-based buffer overflow in openjpeg

Hi Folks,

I discovered a heap-based buffer-overflow in openjpeg, when decoding
JPEG200 images. More details at:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=842918
http://code.google.com/p/openjpeg/issues/detail?id=170

This seems to affect versions 1.3 , upto the latest release
version.

Upstream is currently working on the fix.

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this flaw?
