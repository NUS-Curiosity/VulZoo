Subject: CVE request: letodms multiple issues

Hi,

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LetoDMS[1].
Could CVE ids be assigned, please? Thanks in advance.

They are said to be fixed in 3.3.7[2], quoting the changelog:

> --------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
>                     Changes in version 3.3.7
> -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
> major security update which fixeÑ• lots of possible XSS and
> CSRF attacts

Without looking at anything else other than the diff, I'm not personally 
convinced that the changes are enough/that there are no other 
vulnerabilities. That said, I'm most likely not going to spend time on it.
