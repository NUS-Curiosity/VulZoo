Thanks!  I'm happy to share the patches that I have for the Debian package
if Red Hat would also like to use them.  They're somewhat different than
upstream (or, rather, I had to layer additional patches on top of
upstream) because Debian adds support for the new rsync protocol flags and
for svnserve as a supported program, which required changes to the patch.
