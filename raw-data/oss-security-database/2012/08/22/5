Subject: CVE Request -- jabberd2: Prone to unsolicited XMPP Dialback attacks

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  a security flaw was found in the XMPP Dialback protocol implementation of jabberd2, OpenSource server implementation of the Jabber protocols (Verify Response and Authorization Response were not checked within XMPP protocol server to server session). A rogue XMPP server could use this flaw to spoof one or more domains, when communicating with vulnerable server implementation, possibly leading into XMPP's Server Dialback protections bypass.

Upstream patch:
[3] https://github.com/Jabberd2/jabberd2/commit/aabcffae560d5fd00cd1d2ffce5d760353cf0a4d

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
