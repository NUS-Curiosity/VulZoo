I'm unsure if you want to allocate CVEs for all this kind of issues, but
Andreas is currently reporting a bunch of bugs for those. See:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683649
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683647

and I guess there might be more to come since it's the result of
piuparts tests run against the whole archive.
