Subject: gnome-screensaver 3.4.2 locked only active screen

Hi,

(FYI ... if no one shipped g-s 3.4.2, it probably does not need a CVE.
 openSUSE 12.2 fixed it during development.)

gnome-screensaver 3.4.2 (the only version affected) had the screenlock
on multi-display settings only locking the screen with active focus.
The other displayscreens staid unlocked and usable.

Ciao, Marcus
