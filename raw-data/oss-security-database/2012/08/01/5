Well, getting rid of static groups like that is what consolekit and udev
are for. Ideally, permissions would be granted on the device based on
which user is at the console, as it currently done with other devices.
Unfortunately, the design of the binary driver makes it hard to do, as
it resets permissions itself when X loads.
