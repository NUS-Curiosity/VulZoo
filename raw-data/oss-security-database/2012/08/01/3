I know that at least Gentoo does this since ~2006:

35 # !!! SECURITY WARNING !!!
36 # DO NOT MODIFY OR REMOVE THE DEVICE FILE RELATED OPTIONS UNLESS YOU KNOW
37 # WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
38 # ONLY ADD TRUSTED USERS TO THE VIDEO GROUP, THESE USERS MAY BE ABLE TO
CRASH,
39 # COMPROMISE, OR IRREPARABLY DAMAGE THE MACHINE.
40 options nvidia NVreg_DeviceFileMode=432 NVreg_DeviceFileUID=0
NVreg_DeviceFileGID=VIDEOGID NVreg_ModifyDeviceFiles=1
