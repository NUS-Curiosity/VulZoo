Subject: CVE Request: NVidia Linux driver

Hello,

Could a CVE please be assigned to the following issue:

The binary NVidia Linux driver allows local users to access arbitrary
memory locations by leveraging GPU device-node read/write privileges,
and escalate privileges to root. Possibly an incomplete fix for
CVE-2012-0946.

See:

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/4

Thanks,

Marc.
