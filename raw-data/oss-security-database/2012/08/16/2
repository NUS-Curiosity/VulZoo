Subject: CVE Request: SquidClamav insufficient escaping flaws

Hi Kurt,

It appears that this has not yet received a CVE:

The upstream notification [1] shows SquidClamav 5.8 and 6.7 fixes a URL
escaping issue which could lead to a daemon crash [2]. SquidClamav 5.8
also fixes escaping issues in CGI scripts [3].
