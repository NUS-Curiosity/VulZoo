Subject: CVE Request: Java 7 code execution 0day

Hi All

A 0-day flaw exploited in the wild has been reported to affect Java 7:

This issue was confirmed to allow unsigned applet to bypass Java applet restrictions and run arbitrary code on users' systems. A lot of public information is now available for this flaw:

https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/52ca1083c22de7022baf7dca8a1756909f803341

This flaw does not have a CVE ID assigned. I contacted Oracle asking if they have assigned one, but got no response. Can someone please assign a CVE ID to this flaw?

Thanks
