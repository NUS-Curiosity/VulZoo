Subject: CVE-Request: apache2-mod_php5 AddHandler content confusion

Hi,

So far I have not seen any CVE for the recent
"apache2-mod_php5 remote code execution due to multiple extension feature of 'AddHandler's"
where you can treat a blah.php.gif as a PHP script due to sloppy
configs. [1]

Can someone assign a CVE? At the quick look, I cant see who actually
discovered this.

Sebastian
