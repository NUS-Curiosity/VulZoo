This issue is not new[1], however the most recent reporter (this issue
get "rediscovered" every once in a while) has been pushing it on Red
Hat/etc, as previously discussed by RedHat/SuSE this is a documented
issue and not really a security issue (in the sense that improper
configuration plus poorly written PHP applications can cause security
issues so "don't do that"), and it has been known for some time now
(e.g. 2006 and earlier):

[1] http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@httpd.apache.org/msg32365.html

Generally speaking the solution has been to fix the apps that do not
properly handle this (e.g. http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18854).

So unless something significant changes or new information comes to
light this specific issue will probably not receive a CVE.
