0. Release history
==================

2012-08-13 0.1	draft


1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP3, IMAP,
ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents. fetchmail supports SSL and TLS security layers
through the OpenSSL library, if enabled at compile time and if also
enabled at run time, in both SSL/TLS-wrapped mode on dedicated ports as
well as in-band-negotiated "STARTTLS" and "STLS" modes through the
regular protocol ports.


2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

Fetchmail version 5.0.8 added NTLM support. This code sent the NTLM
authentication request, but never checked if the received response was
NTLM protocol exchange, or a server-side error message.  Instead,
fetchmail tried to decode the error message as though it were
base64-encoded protocol exchange, and could then segfault depending of
buffer contents, while reading data from bad memory locations.


3. Solution
===========

Install fetchmail 6.3.22 or newer.

The fetchmail source code is always available from
<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824>.

Distributors are encouraged to review the NEWS file and move forward to
6.3.22, rather than backport individual security fixes, because doing so
routinely misses other fixes crucial to fetchmail's proper operation,
for which no security announcements are issued, or documentation.

Fetchmail 6.3.X releases have always been made with a focus on unchanged
user and program interfaces so as to avoid disruptions when upgrading
from 6.3.X to 6.3.Y with Y > X.  Care was taken to not change the
interface incompatibly.
