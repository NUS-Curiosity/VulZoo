Subject: ocPoral CMS 8.x | Session Hijacking Vulnerability

1. OVERVIEW

ocPoral CMS 8.x and lower versions are vulnerable to Session Hijacking
flaw which could allow attackers to compromise administrator session.


2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

ocPortal is the website Content Management System (a CMS) for building
and maintaining a dynamic website. ocPortal's powerful feature-set
means there's always a way to accomplish your vision. Not only does
ocPortal's CMS have all the features you'd expect: for instance photo
galleries, news, file downloads and community forums/chats, but it
does so whilst meeting the highest accessibility and professional
standards. It is also smart enough to go beyond page management, to
automatically handle search engine optimisation, and provide
aggressive hack attack prevention.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The ocPoral CMS generates 7-digit session IDs for logged-in users;
thus it is possible to work out a valid session ID through brute
forcing. Successful hijacking requires the "Enforce IP addresses for
sessions" option be disabled. However, when a user's IP is highly
dynamic, this option will likely to be disabled as it would invalidate
logged-in sessions. In other way, if a user and an attacker happened
to be within the same subnet, the attack would succeed regardless of
the "Enforce IP" setting turning on.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

Tested on version 8.1.2


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

sample session cookie: ocp_session=8711789


6. SOLUTION

No fix is available as of 2012-08-19.
Workaround is to set enabled for the option, "Enforce IP addresses for
sessions".
