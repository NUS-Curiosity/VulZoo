You are correct. This list isn't and shouldn't be in the future only about CVE-requests, but in my opinion one of the best sources to get CVE-identifiers for open source software vulnerabilities thanks to guys like Kurt. In my opinion well planned CTFs are welcome to list as long as it does not go to product marketing and similar activities.
