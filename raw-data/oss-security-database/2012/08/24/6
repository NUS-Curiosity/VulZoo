Subject: oVirt 3.1 does not validate server certificates in python sdk and
 cli (CVE-2012-3533)

Hi folks.  This is a heads-up for anyone who may be shipping oVirt.
oVirt 3.1 added a new python SDK and CLI which do various fancy things.
It supports connecting to servers over SSL, but did not have support for
validating certificates, which could lead to a mitm attack.

I've assigned CVE-2012-3533 to this issue.  It is corrected in git
already.
