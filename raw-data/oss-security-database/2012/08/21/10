Subject: CVE request: Typo3

Hi,
please assign CVE IDs for the latest Typo3 security issues:
http://typo3.org/support/teams-security-security-bulletins/security-bulletins-single-view/article/several-vulnerabilities-in-typo3-core/ :

1.

Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend Help System
Vulnerability Type: Insecure Unserialize leading to a possible Arbitrary Code Execution
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?)
Problem Description: Due to a missing signature (HMAC) for a parameter in the view_help.php file, an attacker could unserialize arbitrary objects within TYPO3. We are aware of a working exploit, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. A valid backend user login or multiple successful cross site request forgery attacks are required to exploit this vulnerability.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.19, 4.6.12 or 4.7.4 that fix the problem described!
Credits: Credits go to Felix Wilhelm who discovered and reported the issue.


2.

Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?)
Problem Description: Failing to properly HTML-encode user input in several places, the TYPO3 backend is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. A valid backend user is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.19, 4.6.12 or 4.7.4 that fix the problem described!
Credits: Credits go to Pavel Vaysband, Security Team Member Markus Bucher, Core Team Member Susanne Moog, Jan Bednarik,  who discovered and reported the issues.

3.

Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend
Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
Severity: Low
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?)
Problem Description: Accessing the configuration module discloses the Encryption Key. A valid backend user with access to the configuration module is required to exploit this vulnerability.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.19, 4.6.12 or 4.7.4 that fix the problem described!

4.

Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 HTML Sanitizing API
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?)
Problem Description: By not removing several HTML5 JavaScript events, the API method t3lib_div::RemoveXSS() fails to filter specially crafted HTML injections, thus is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. Failing to properly encode for JavaScript the API method t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue(), it is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting.
Note: Developers should never rely on the blacklist of RemoveXSS() alone, but should always properly encode user input before outputting it again.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.19, 4.6.12 or 4.7.4 that fix the problem described!
Credits: Credits go to Andreas Schnapp and Christian NÃ¶sterer who discovered and reported the issues.

5.

Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Install Tool
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Severity: Low
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (What's that?)
Problem Description: Failing to properly sanitize user input, the Install Tool is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.19, 4.6.12 or 4.7.4 that fix the problem described!
Credits: Credits go to Security Team Member Georg Ringer who discovered and reported the issue. 

Cheers,
