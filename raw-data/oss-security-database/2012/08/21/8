Subject: CVE Request -- inn (nnrpd): Prone to STARTTLS plaintext command
 injection

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  the STARTTLS implementation in INN's NNTP server for readers,
nnrpd, before 2.5.3 does not properly restrict I/O buffering,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands
into encrypted sessions by sending a cleartext command that
is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext
command injection" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
