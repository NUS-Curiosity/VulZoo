Further investigation into ticket 1488613 shows that the developer thinks 
that issue 2b doesn't need a backport to 0.7.  This would suggest a SPLIT 
based on different affected versions.

Plus it's not immediately clear whether this "self XSS" is really an XSS 
or not - if I can modify my own signature, then I already have the 
"privileges" on my browser to run script.  But, if this "self XSS" is 
really just reflected XSS, then that's a security issue to worry about. 
This requires expertise in the Roundcube codebase to answer for sure, 
though.

So, we should probably SPLIT this CVE.

CVE-2012-3508 - Issue 2a - Stored XSS in e-mail body

(new) CVE-2012-4668 - Issue 2b - Self XSS in e-mail body (Signature)
