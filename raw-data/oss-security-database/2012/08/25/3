Subject: information request on security bug fix in GNU Gatekeeper 3.1

Hi Jan,

On the announcement of release 3.1 of GNU Gatekeeper[1] there's a mention of 
a security bug fix.
Could you please shed some light on the security issue? is it related to the 
status port connection limit feature that was recently added in [2] and 
similar?

Thanks in advance.
