I find this suspicious. Surely this should be enumerating the modes
that are safe, rather than the modes that are not safe? With that
patch, if a new value for $mode is added, it's assumed to be a read
operation. It seems much safer to assume that unknown modes are writes:

    switch ($mode) {
        case 'r':
        case 'rb':
            break;
        default:
            if (!$this->is_writable($path)) {
                return false;
            }
    }
