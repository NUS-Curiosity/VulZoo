No it was added in 4.6 or 4.7 when we ported to akonadi2
In 4.4 it didn't use *WebKit*

and it didn't use same code :
it used DOM::

'  try {
   // Create a DOM Document from the HTML source
   DOM::HTMLDocument doc;
   doc.open();
   doc.write( htmlSource );
   doc.close();

   mIsQuotedLine = false;
   mIsFirstTextNodeInLine = true;
   processNode( doc.documentElement() );
   return doc.toString().string();
 }
'

So for me it's just kmail > 4.6 (we released an old 4.6-akonadi)

not necessary to try to fix in 4.4

I CC David if he has more infos.

I hope that it helps.

Security problem is that we allows to use javascript.
In 4.4 we don't have it.



Regards.
