And here's a testcase for the actual bug.
In kmail, Ctrl+O, open this .mbox, click on the HTML version, enable HTML 
rendering, a javascript messagebox pops up.
Not sure what can really be exploited here (xmlhttprequest?), but at least 
this way one can prove that 4.4 isn't affected, and test the 4.9 fix.
