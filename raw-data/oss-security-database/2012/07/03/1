Subject: CVE Request: Stability fixes in UDF Logical Volume Descriptor
	handling

Hi,

People (do not know who) reported to the kernel security team
and Jan Kara some UDF filesystem crashes.

Jan Kara did some fixes in the UDF fs and they were committed
to mainline already, both actual bugfixes and some more sanity
checking for hardening.

Buffer overreads or overwrites would have been possible.


I think a single CVE is sufficient.


The two mainline commits:

    udf: Fortify loading of sparing table

    Add sanity checks when loading sparing table from disk to avoid accessing
    unallocated memory or writing to it.

    udf: Avoid run away loop when partition table length is corrupted
    
    Check provided length of partition table so that (possibly maliciously)
    corrupted partition table cannot cause accessing data beyond current buffer.
