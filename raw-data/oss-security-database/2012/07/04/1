Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: epoll: can leak file descriptors when
 returning -ELOOP

An epoll_ctl(,EPOLL_CTL_ADD,,) operation can return '-ELOOP' to prevent
circular epoll dependencies from being created.  However, in that case
we do not properly clear the 'tfile_check_list'.

An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.

Regression introduced via 28d82dc1c4edbc352129f97f4ca22624d1fe61de
commit.

Upstream fix:
