You're welcome to absorb the transition costs. 8-) I looked into this 
briefly, and the potentially insecure getenv calls are not in the 
majority, so we'd have to expect quite a bit of breakage, or at least 
add a configurable whitelist of variable names in a file in /etc.

FWIW, I consider PAM and NSS (Name Service Switch) the major problem 
areas, too.  Do you know if the APIs would allow confining plug-ins to 
subprocesses?  Then we only have to solve the transparent child process 
problem.
