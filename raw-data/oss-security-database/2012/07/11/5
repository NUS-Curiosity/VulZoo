Subject: CVE request: glibc formatted printing vulnerabilities

Hi,

there are further vulnerabilities in glibc's formatted printing
functionality.

1) It was discovered that the formatted printing functionality in glibc
did not properly honor the size of a structure when calculating the
amount of memory to allocate. A remote attacker could provide a
specially crafted sequence of format specifiers, leading to an
undersized buffer allocation and subsequent stack corruption, resulting
in a crash or, potentially, FORTIFY_SOURCE format string protection
mechanism bypass, when processed.

2) It was discovered that the formatted printing functionality in glibc
used extend_alloca() incorrectly. "nspecs_max" is incorrectly passed to
extend_alloca, which modifies the value in "nspecs_max" when allocating
the memory. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted sequence
of format specifiers, leading to a desynchronization within the buffer
size handling, resulting in the use of uninitialized memory or,
potentially, FORTIFY_SOURCE format string protection mechanism bypass,
when processed.

It seems like 1) and 2) were introduced by the following commit:

3) It was discovered that the formatted printing functionality in glibc
did not properly restrict the use of alloca(). A remote attacker could
provide a specially crafted sequence of format specifiers, leading to a
crash or, potentially, FORTIFY_SOURCE format string protection mechanism
bypass, when processed.
