"Local access" doesn't imply the ability to reboot or interrupt the boot
loader of a machine.
There are some remote desktop/vm like uses (where people can sometimes
plug their own drives) or partially shielded kiosk like machines (where
you can unplug a usb keyboard/mouse).
Also hardened systems with full disk encryption or with a locked bios
which prohibits other boot orders are real targets in this cases.

An online attack is definitely more serious than the known offline
attacks for which most relevant machines are more or less shielded.
