Subject: CVE Request: XSS in a Mono System.web error page 

Hi,

A Nessus scan of a Novell product using Mono Web revealed a XSS attack
in the Mono System.Web library.

The Mono team commited a fix to their GIT.

	https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/d16d4623edb210635bec3ca3786481b82cde25a2

The XSS is in the error popup of the "Forbidden extension" filter method,
which filters out e.g. ".dll" files.

Ciao, Marcus
