I am fine with either solution and would prefer upstream patches
anyway, but it turned out in past that nobody from upstream
is willing to add such patches.
I tried a year ago with openssl and AFAIK its still suffering
(at least I never heared back).

If you compile your openssh '--with-ssl-engine' you have
an easy root exploit (given that ssh-keysign is mode 04755
such as on Debian) via OPENSSL_config().

If you ask me, thats quite poor for a framework that wants to
add security to the system.
So, I do not have any problems adding our own patch sets rather
than waiting for another year.

Another lib that should receive a patch is libudev.
