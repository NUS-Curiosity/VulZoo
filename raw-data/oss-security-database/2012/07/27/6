Subject: Zabbix SQL injection flaw (CVE request)

Could a CVE be assigned to this please?

An SQL injection flaw was found in Zabbix, where input passed via the
"itemid" parameter to popup_bitem.php is not properly sanitized before
being used in an SQL query.

The report was against version 2.0.1, but the upstream bug report [1]
indicates this also affects 1.8.x.  Upstream has patched [2] this, and
there is a potential patch for 1.8.x [3].

[2] http://git.zabbixzone.com/zabbix2.0/.git/commit/333a3a5542ba8a2c901c24b7bf5440f41f1f4f54
