Firewire has DMA.

eSATA - also does DMA.

Thunderbolt also does DMA. 

In other words a lot of the newer/higher end interfaces all do DMA which is ... a problem.

Thanks for bringing that up.  Student computer rooms are a
nice example, and a good old memory. ;-)

What else might be on this "untrusted" device list?  Firewire?
I guess those in the PC box don't count.
