If you'd like to do the work/research needed to nail these down I'm sure
someone (I can't speak on behalf of Mitre) would accept the data, but
speaking from experience (at iSIGHT/iDefense) it is a LOT of work in
some cases (you start going down rabbit holes pretty quickly, things
that appear simple often are not), so to do it consistently for all
issues (even within a "small" group of packages or vendors) is a full
time job for more than one person.
