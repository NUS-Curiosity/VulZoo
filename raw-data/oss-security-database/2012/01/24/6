First of all I am heavy user of OSVDB (http://osvdb.org/user/fgeek/profile). One should note that even OSVDB has a license, which will limit the usage of the data: http://osvdb.org/license and from my own experience I can say that this is definitely not always a good thing and might create new aspects for words open and free. For NDA reasons I can't say the case where this was a problem, but you can use your imagination.
