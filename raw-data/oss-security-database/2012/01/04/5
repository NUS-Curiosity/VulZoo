Subject: CVE request: ghostscript: system initialization file uncontrolled search path element

Hi Kurt,

We identified and are separating the bugs discussed in Bug 599564[1] in two
different issues. Can you assign a CVE Identifier to the following issue:

Ghostscript included the current working directory in its library search
path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the "-P-" option in an
attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript
library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript
code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working
directory for library files by default.[1]

Thanks,
