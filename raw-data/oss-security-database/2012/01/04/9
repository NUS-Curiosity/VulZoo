I don't have a strong opinion on this, but does this policy really make
sense if only X was tracked by a CVE for over half a year?

There might just as well be people, who addressed CVE-2011-3361 under
the impression that only X needs to be fixed and which will miss Y
if Y is folded into CVE-2011-3361.
