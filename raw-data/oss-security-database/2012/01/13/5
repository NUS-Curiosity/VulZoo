I'm not clear on how this crosses a security boundary. The attacker
would need to write a custom script that uses the "<sax:output
href="0wn3d.php" method="text">" and the user the script runs as (apache
usually or whatever local account is in use) would also need write
permissions to the directory in question. How is this different than say
using fopen/fwrite to create the file?
