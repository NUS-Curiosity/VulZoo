Subject: CVE affected for PHP 5.3.9 ?

Hello,

PHP released v5.3.9 earlier this month :
http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.3.9

I wonder if CVE identifiers were already affected to these security
vulnerabilities. I'm looking specifically for bug 54446 that I
reported : https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54446

Regards,
Nicolas
