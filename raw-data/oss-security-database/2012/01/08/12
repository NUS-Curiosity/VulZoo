One very interesting datapoint here is Antti Kantee's rump subsystem
in NetBSD

	http://www.netbsd.org/docs/rump/
	http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/runnable_userspace_meta_programs_in

which allows for userspace-mounting of devices and filesystems
thereon.  Unknown provenance USB sticks are one of the use cases
mentioned.

	+ rump_msdos:  USB sticks with FAT file systems are a common
	sight.  Mounting an untrusted image from removable media with
	the file system driver running in the kernel is risky in many
	ways:  inopportune unplugging of the media or a corrupted file
	system may have adverse effects such as system crashes or
	worse.  By using the rump_msdos command instead of
	mount_msdos, the file system service runs in userspace and is
	accessed via puffs.  This isolates the main kernel from any
	resulting problems such as buffer overflows.

	The usage of mount_msdos and rump_msdos are equivalent...

If USB is a transport in air-gapped environments, I personally have a
concern with that. A good thing airgaps aren't used for anything in RL,
right? ;-)
