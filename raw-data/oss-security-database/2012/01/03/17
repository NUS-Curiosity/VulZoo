Subject: CVE-request: WordPress SQL injection and arbitrary code injection
 (2003)

These two WordPress security vulnerabilities from 2003 are still without CVE-identifiers. I am requesting CVE-identifiers as these issues have highly critical impact.

1) SQL injection
http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/4610

2) Arbitrary code injection
http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/4611
