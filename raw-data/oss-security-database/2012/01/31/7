If a security feature is less strong than advertised (or less strong than 
its user may reasonably assume), then this is enough to qualify for CVE.

Since there are plausible scenarios in which the feature could be misused, 
this also seems to qualify for a CVE.

CVE doesn't cover just the most serious vulnerabilities out there. While 
the circumstances might be rare, and it's not as serious as other 
problems, it's still "bad enough" that some consumers would care about it.
