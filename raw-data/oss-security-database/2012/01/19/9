Hi Kurt,

This is still a bit of a problem, as our internal svn is still not correctly set up to sync to SF's SVN. What I can do however is ask our developers to create a diff of the files which were changed to fix this and post them online?

B.t.w. if someone knows a way to sync two SVN repositories to with each other, please contact me off list.

With kind regards,

Ronald
