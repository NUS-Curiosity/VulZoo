Well, that went easier than I thought. In https://sourceforge.net/projects/batavi/files/upgrade/ you can find two files (database.1.2-1.2.1.sql and core.1.2-1.2.1.patch) which both contains fixes for the Blind SQL injection. You can find them on lines 12833 till 12860. Also a new DB method was introduced on lines 13289 till 13300. Both are in core.1.2-1.2.1.patch. I hope that this clarifies it enough?
