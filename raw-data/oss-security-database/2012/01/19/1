Subject: Screen locking programs on Xorg 1.11

Hi,
I recently found out that it is possible to kill a screensaver/screen
locker program on the latest version of Xorg (1.11 shipped with
archlinux, debian wheezy..) using the Ctrl+Alt+Multiply key binding.

This behavior seems to have been introduced in a recent commit[1] and i
couldn't find a way to disable it.

All screen locking programs i tested (gnome-screensaver, kscreenlocker,
slock, slimlock...), are basically rendered useless.

Not sure if this is a bug or a feature... :)
