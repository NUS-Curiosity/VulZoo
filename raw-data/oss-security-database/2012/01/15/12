I agree in principle, however in practice this is a lot of work (as you
well know =). I guess my question/concern would be is who does the
research to verify all this, and what if it varies by version (i.e. it
is 6 separate issues in an older version but the newer version combined
some code into a common library for example so it's only a single issue,
but with multiple avenues of attack/etc.). In other words a lot of
potential work.
