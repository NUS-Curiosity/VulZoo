It wouldn't do the trick.  10 business days from a Wednesday gives us
another Wednesday, which is good, but 10 business days from a Friday
gives us another Friday (unless there are holidays).

That's tricky.  For example, in Russia the New Year holidays may last
for 11 or 12 days (such as Dec 30 to Jan 10).  If we attempt to account
for that along with the Christmas break, then 10 business days may turn
into a month.

So I don't mind adding an informal note "to be kind with respect to
holidays", but its exact meaning will vary and it should not affect the
maximum embargo period of 14 to 19 days.

Feel free to add and maintain such a tools list on the wiki page.
I only know that Mutt works fine.

Thanks for your comments!
