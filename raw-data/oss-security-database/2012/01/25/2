This is why I don't like Joomla. They jumped from 1.7 to 2.5.0 and support for 1.7.x is following:

"Please note that version 1.7 will reach end of life on 24 February 2012."

EOL for 1.7.x means also 1.6.x, which both are still heavily uesd.

Joomla is part of oCERT "The oCERT team is a volunteer-based force of well-known security professionals from major Open Source projects, vendors and the security community."

Basicly the end of support for 1.7.x and 1.6.x means that if you go to support-forum and ask something you will be asked for your software version number and if it isn't 2.5.0 they will tell you to upgrade, before you will get more help.
