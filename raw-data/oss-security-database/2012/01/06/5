Subject: CVE request: redmine issues

Hi,
please assign three CVE IDs for the following issues in Redmine:

These need to be CVE-2011-* IDs:

The announcement can be found here: http://www.redmine.org/news/49

--------
This release also fixes 3 security issues reported by joernchen of
Phenoelit:

* logged in users may be able to access private data (affected
versions: 1.0.x)

* persistent XSS vulnerability in textile formatter (affected
versions: all previous releases)

This was already fixed in a Debian security update some time ago,
