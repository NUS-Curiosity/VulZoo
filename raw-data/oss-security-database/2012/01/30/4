Ok I'm not clear on what is going on here, is there a link to the bug
entry regarding this issue, or can someone clarify it?

1) are there default accounts shipped with the product that get
activated automatically during install? (it sounds like yes?)

2) can someone remotely/locally access these accounts? what are the
credentials for these accounts ("invalid keys"?), can an attacker access
them?

3) what is the privilege level of the accounts?
