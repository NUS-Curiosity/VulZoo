Hi,
there is no bug entry yet.

Yes. The database is populated with an example/test account which is  
activated during install.

If someone programs or uses a software emulation for the yubikey can  
have access to whatever the user of the application uses it for ( the  
yubiserver). For example if someone uses Pam yubico module with the su  
or sshd server to provide a two factor authentication scheme he should  
suffer from this security issue if he hasn't deleted or deactivated  
the test account. If someone by mistake installs yubiserver and  
doesn't use him to validate his otp or hmac otp, he won't suffer from  
this security issue. Someone can only suffer if he uses the server and  
hasn't deleted or deactivated the test account which is shipped with  
the server.

> 3) what is the privilege level of the accounts?

That depends on how someone wants to use the server and the privilege  
level that he wants to give to it's users through the validation of  
the otp or hmac otp.
