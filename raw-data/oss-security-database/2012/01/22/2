Keep this one for CVE-2012-0791 as Kurt assigned.

While normally one might MERGE this XSS with the others, in this case we 
(the CVE team) happened to notice that this XSS is actually associated 
with a different version / product, fixed in Webmail 4.0.6:

   http://secunia.com/advisories/47592
   http://www.horde.org/apps/webmail/docs/CHANGES

Since this specific XSS is not listed in the IMP changelog, we should 
treat it as a different product/version, and SPLIT.

So, use CVE-2012-0909 for this new one.


Summary:


   CVE-2012-0791 - XSS in compose page, (traditional view), the contacts
   popup window, and with certain IMAP mailbox names.  Fixed in
   Horde IMP v5.0.18, and apparently Webmail 4.0.6.

   CVE-2012-0909 (new) - XSS in email validation, related to the Form
   library, only affecting Webmail 4.0.6.
