Anyone got a pointer to Jüri's report?  I suppose it was somewhere on
LKML, but I haven't found it yet.

I see how the checks against current->self_exec_id were insufficient for
security, yet maybe the report contained something else as well?

I see it in the revised code, but I don't get it.  What does "the old
VM" mean after an execve()?  The code stores the mm pointer in
file->private_data, but is this stored pointer even valid after an
execve()?  (The code blindly assumes so, only checking for non-NULL.)

Was this discussed (on LKML or elsewhere)?
