For popa3d, the default limits currently are 50 per-source, 500 total.
Sessions are considered active for at least 10 seconds after start.

This is considering users behind NAT who have mail checked every few
minutes.

For OpenSSH, we can use similar settings or something more flexible
(more than just two limits).
