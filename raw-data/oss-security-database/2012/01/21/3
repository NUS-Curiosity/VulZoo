Subject: CVE Request -- Horde IMP -- Multiple XSS flaws fixed in v5.0.18

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   Multiple XSS flaws were adressed in the v5.0.18 version of Horde IMP (from [1]):

"[mms] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities on the compose page (traditional
view), the contacts popup window, and with certain IMAP mailbox names."

Upstream patches:
[5] https://github.com/horde/horde/commit/41136ea893b3d5a84c6228a552f8e211c90f58de
     (multiple XSS flaws)

[6] https://github.com/horde/horde/commit/208eae43c95136a67104f760027a8892a22b6e25
     (XSS in email validation)

Could you allocate CVE ids for these? (two should be enough, one for the multiple
XSS flaws patch and one for XSS in email validation patch)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
