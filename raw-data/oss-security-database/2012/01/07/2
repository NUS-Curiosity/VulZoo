Subject: CVE request for OpenTTD

Hi folks,

we, the OpenTTD developers, have identified a security vulnerability in
OpenTTD (an open source game with multiplayer). Would you be so kind as 
to allocate a CVE id for this issue?

The issue concerns a denial of service vulnerability in the form of a 
slow read attack preventing anyone to join the server, and preventing 
the continuation of a game when 'pause on join' is enabled. This attack 
requires the attacker to be authorized, but most servers do not 
implement authorization. The first vulnerable version is 0.3.5, the 
upcoming 1.1.5 release will have the issue fixed.

Once a CVE id is allocated, the issue and fix will be documented at
http://security.openttd.org/CVE-2012-xxxx

Thanks in advance,
Remko 'Rubidium' Bijker
