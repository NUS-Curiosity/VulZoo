Subject: Malicious devices & vulnerabilties

Hi,

In general driver code trusts hardware devices and often doesn't
validate the data they respond with.  But how about USB devices
that an attacker could plug into a victim's computer?  For example,
an attacker may craft a USB device with a long product name to cause
a buffer overflow (CVE-2011-0712).

Here is another possible bug in the USB audio format parser I tried
to report upstream.

I am wondering where to draw the line.  Should such device drivers
be considered vulnerable or not?  Thanks.
