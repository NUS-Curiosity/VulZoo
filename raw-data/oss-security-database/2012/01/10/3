No, this hasn't already been assigned a CVE.  The upstream CEDET 1.0 is
largely the same codebase as the CEDET distributed in Emacs.  The
version in Emacs omits some CEDET components, and added some plumbing to
integrate CEDET into the Emacs build system.  But the main part of the
Emacs Lisp code, including the part affected by this flaw, is the same.

David, could you write up a version of the fix that applies to the CEDET
1.0 tarball?  I think distributors who package CEDET will want it.
