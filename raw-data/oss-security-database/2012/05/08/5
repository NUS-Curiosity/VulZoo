Subject: CVE request: Piwik before 1.7

Hi,

http://piwik.org/blog/2012/02/7775/

Information is very rare:
"We would like to thank the following security researchers for their
responsible disclosure of XSS & click-jacking issues: Piotr Duszynski,
Sergey Markov, Mauro Gentile."

I'd suggest assigning 3 CVEs with subjects like

"Unknown XSS or clickjacking issue identified by Piotr Duszynski"
"Unknown XSS or clickjacking issue identified by Sergey Markov"
"Unknown XSS or clickjacking issue identified by Mauro Gentile"
