Yes, the publicly available source repo is out of date right now, but
that won't always be the case.  Debian had a change in secretary, so
workflows have changed, and ideally a more public mode of operation
should be gotten back to.

Yes, it is indeed an issue in the software implementation itself.  See
original report for exact code lines that are flawed.

I can neither confirm nor not confirm that devotee is used outside of
debian, but it does seem like an obvious choice for online election
management.  It is however planned to be package for debian [0], and
ubuntu automatically syncs debian, so eventually they will also get
the package.  it is important that an id be assigned so that they are
aware that they will need to check the package when they do that sync.
