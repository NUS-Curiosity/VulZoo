Subject: PHP-CGI query string parameter vulnerability (CVE-2012-1823 / CVE-2012-2311, CERT VU#520827)

Hi,

I guess most of you have heard of this one already, yet it should be in
here as well.  The original issue was tracked as CERT VU#520827,
CVE-2012-1823.  PHP 5.4.2 and 5.3.12 were released with an incomplete
fix, and apparently CVE-2012-2311 refers to that incomplete fix issue.
