Just to confirm, you have meant four issues:
1) Conman doesn't check for the origin of netlink messages
    (from https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=715172#c4)

    with patches:
    [1a]

2) Check hostname validity prior setting the hostname in loopback
    plug-in:
    (from https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=715172#c4)

    with patches:
    [2a] 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=network/connman/connman.git;a=commit;h=26ace5c59f790bce0f1988b88874c6f2c480fd5a

3) DHCPv6 option parsing vulnerable to DoS (endless loop):
    (from https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=715172#c9)

    with patches:
    There doesn't seem to be upstream patches for this yet.

4) Check vpnc options for validity prior saving them:
    (from https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=715172#c10):

    with patches:
    [4a]

So yet another patch is needed to correct this except [4a]? Or is
[4a] unrelated to this?

For now could you confirm count of the issues and links to
patches, where appropriate? (this will be needed anyway for
purpose of CVE request)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
