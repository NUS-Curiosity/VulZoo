Subject: CVE Request -- Tornado (python-tornado): Tornado v2.2.1 tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_header()
 fix to prevent header injection

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

Package:
--------
Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web server
and tools that power FriendFeed:

URL: http://www.tornadoweb.org/
----

Issue:
------
A possibility of header injection / response splitting flaw was found in the
way web request handler of Tornado, a scalable, non-blocking web server and
tools, performed sanitization of input arguments, provided to routine setting
the HTTP response header name and value. If an application using the Tornado
web framework accepted untrusted user input and based on that input updated the
HTTP headers content (to redirect the user etc.), by providing a
specially-crafted input a remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
cross-site scripting attacks, cross-user defacement, web cache poisoning etc.

Upstream v2.2.1 release changelog:

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (should be CVE-2012-* one)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
