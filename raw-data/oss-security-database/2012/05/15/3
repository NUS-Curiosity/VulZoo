Thanks.

If you want to see the libtiff work, it's here:
https://github.com/benlaurie/libtiff

So far, I've wrapped enough (transparently!) to make a couple of
trivial applications work. These are slightly cut-down versions of a
couple of apps provided with libtiff. They're cut down because they
add custom tags, which means registering callbacks, and I haven't
designed how to wrap that yet :-)

Before I do, I want to move onto a more "real" application. Not sure
what I should choose, though, so suggestions are welcome...

All new code is the wrapped/ subdirectory - so far I have not had to
make any changes to libtiff, which is nice, but I do not rule it out.

This one includes a rudimentary RPC compiler.
