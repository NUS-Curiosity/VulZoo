Subject: CVE-request: WordPress wp-facethumb plugin reflected XSS

Hello,

WordPress plugin wp-facethumb version 0.1 is affected to reflected XSS vulnerability. This issue is fixed in version 0.2. Could I get 2012 CVE-identifier for this issue, thanks.

Changelog: http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-facethumb/trunk/readme.txt
Original advisory: http://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2012050106
My report to developer: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-facethumb-reflected-xss-vulnerability-cwe-79
Plugin URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-facethumb/ (will show up very soon. WP admins disabled this until fix is done)
