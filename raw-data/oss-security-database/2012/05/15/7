You never know. I'd even say that the cat gets the most untrusted input
ever. Everything and the world has been piped
through cat since epoch. And similar surprises will happen to all the
non threatening programs that are not seen as risk like file, ls, ps etc.
until one realizes that some procmail/cups or whatever filter is using it.
