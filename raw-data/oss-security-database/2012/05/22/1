Subject: CVE request: Serendipity before 1.6.2 SQL Injection

Upstream:
http://blog.s9y.org/archives/241-Serendipity-1.6.2-released.html
Advisory:
https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23092

Upstream description of the issue:
"The error here is that input is not properly validated and can be used
(when magic_quotes_gpc is off) to inject SQL code to a SQL query; since
our DB layer does not execute multiple statements, and the involved SQL
query is not used to produce output code, we regard the impact as low.
Nevertheless, please upgrade your installation."

Please assign CVE.
