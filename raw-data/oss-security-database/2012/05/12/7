Thank you for looking into this issue.  I also briefly looked into it
yesterday.  My guess is that the issue might have been triggered by the
rather unusual MIME section boundary strings ("=-=-=").  Maybe these are
specific to Notmuch.  We had other signed messages in here, which got
through to the list just fine.  For just one affected message in 7658
(total on this list so far), I think I am not going to bother to
investigate this further and patch it.
