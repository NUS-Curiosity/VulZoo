We have previously checked this with John W.Linville (Cc-ed on this post too)
with reply from him being as inlined below:

Jan,

I think you understand it all correctly.

Thanks,

John W. Linville            The water won't run clean until you get

Thus basically from the above, we wouldn't look at this one as a
security flaw, because this is more question of proper configuration,
rather than a real security flaw (the administrator needs in any
case edit /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf it to suite their needs / their
local wireless configuration before being able to use the hostapd
service. And in that moment [when entering sensitive WPA information
there], they should also change the permissions of the hostapd
configuration it to be more secure / not readable by all local users).

Thus maybe something to be explicitly mentioned in the documentation
(change permissions of the config file post update), but not a security
flaw.

 From http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0863 and
mainly from:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mumble/+bug/783405/comments/0

the passwords in this case were stored in plaintext in the database,
which is something slightly different.

Hope this helps.

Regards, Jan.
