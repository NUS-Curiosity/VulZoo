Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: huge pages: memory leak on mmap failure

Description of problem:
When called for anonymous (non-shared) mappings, hugetlb_reserve_pages()
does a resv_map_alloc(). It depends on code in hugetlbfs's
vm_ops->close() to release that allocation.

However, in the mmap() failure path, we do a plain unmap_region()
without the remove_vma() which actually calls vm_ops->close(). 

An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
