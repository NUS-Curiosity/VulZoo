Christian Persch, CC'ed, has already produced two patches to address these issues:

  * Limit all parsed integers in escape sequences to 65535.  This is in line
with the mosh change,

  * In the specific sequences mentioned in the original report, limit to
screen metrics (columns, rows, etc) the same way that xterm does this.

The patches have not been committed yet from what I can see.  If there's a
coordinated embargo release date being set for this, we can respect that I
believe.
