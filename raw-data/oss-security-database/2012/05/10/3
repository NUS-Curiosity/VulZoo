Subject: CVE-request: phpMyFAQ default password 1.3.2

This is very old issue from 2003 without CVE-identifier.

Description:

By default, phpMyFAQ installs with a default password. An unspecified account has an unspecified password which is publicly known and documented. This allows attackers to trivially access the program or system and gain privileged access.

Is there a general CVE-identifier for issues like default password, which I think would be OK in case like this? If user upgraded installation from old version to new this was not fixed in the process.
