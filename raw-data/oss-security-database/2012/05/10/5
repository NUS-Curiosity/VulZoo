Subject: CVE-request: galette sql injection

Hello,

Versions 0.63x of galette (out-of-date but mostly used versions for now)
have an sql injection vulnerability.

Could a CVE be assigned for this vulnerability?

This issue has been reported on project's tracker:
http://redmine.ulysses.fr/issues/250

The issue has been fixed
(http://redmine.ulysses.fr/projects/galette/repository/revisions/8c13ec159ba),
a new release and an official announcment from the project will come
very soon.

Thank you!
