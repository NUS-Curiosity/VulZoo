That's what initgroups(3) is for.  If a program that is supposed to drop
privs calls neither setgroups() nor initgroups(), or if it fails to
check the return value from these and refuse to proceed on failure, then
it is vulnerable.

Definitely.

Having supplementary groups of the new (pseudo-)user, possibly yes.
Having supplementary groups of the old switched-from user, no.
