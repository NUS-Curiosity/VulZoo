Ahh I realize something I forgot to cover in my email is the
distinction between vulnerability and vector, e.g. if program "foo"
(for the sake of argument let's say it is a text editor) doesn't drop
supplementary groups correctly than exploitation of it would be easy,
so in this case I'd agree it was a security vuln. But when a program
with much more limited operations doesn't drop privileges, unless it
directly leads to some sort of exploit/elevated access/etc. than I'm
inclined to say while it's not good, it's not a vulnerability per se.
