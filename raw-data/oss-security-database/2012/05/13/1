I requested more details from security@ and got following reply from Matthieu Aubry:

"""
Hi Henri,

I agree it sounds like a good idea to describe exactly what went
wrong, in a spirit of openness and learning from mistakes.

however,  Piwik data is very sensitive. Many Piwik users don't upgrade
and use  older vulnerable version, sometimes data leaking are
possible. If we give the details, first of all it takes time and
energy which is already 100% booked, and secondly it would help black
hat write bots to scrape and do bad.

This is not a good investment of our time sorry...
but I appreciate your work :)
Matt

I do not think this is good way to improve security. In my opinion these issues still need CVE-identifiers, but details will limit to "unknown XSS" etc. Does these get three or one CVE-identifier?
