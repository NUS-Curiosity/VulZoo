Subject: CVE request -- vdsm: certificate generation upon node creation

When new node image is being created, vdsm.rpm is added to the node
image and self-signed key (and certificate) is created. This key/cert
allows vdsm to start and serve requests from anyone who has a matching
key/cert which could be anybody holding the node image.
