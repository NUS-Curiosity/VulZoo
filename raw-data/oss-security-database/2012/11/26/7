Subject: tor DoS via SENDME cells

I've not seen a CVE for this yet, could one get assigned?

It was reported that Tor suffered from a denial of service
vulnerability due to an error when handling SENDME cells.  This could be
exploited to cause excessive consumption of memory resources within an
entry node.

This is fixed in upstream version 0.2.3.25.
