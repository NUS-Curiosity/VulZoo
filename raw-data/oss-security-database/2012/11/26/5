Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Symfony upstream has released 1.4.20 version:

correcting one security flaw:
"An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Symfony,
an open-source PHP web framework, sanitized certain HTTP POST
request values. A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain
(unauthorized) read access to arbitrary system files, readable
with the privileges of the web server process."
