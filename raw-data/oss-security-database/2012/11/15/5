Subject: CVE request -- vCalendar plugin for Claws Mail: credentials exposed
 on interface

  Hi,

  This has been reported on our bugzilla:
  http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2782

  There's still not fix available. Could a CVE id be allocated for this if
appropriate?

  thanks in advance,

P.S.: I'm not subscribed to the list.
