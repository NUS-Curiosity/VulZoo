We're using PBKDF2 now for some time. The number of rounds can be
configured and currently defaults to 10000. Note that we encode the used
hashing function in the password field in the database. This allows us
to upgrade existing passwords on user login to the new scheme. This also
means existing installations can have a mixture of password hashing
schemes in the DB.

The old default scheme was SHA-1 with no salt, see
http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550688

This was changed to PBKDF2 in Release 1.4.17 and there was still the bug
[A] remaining in the anydbm backend which was fixed in 1.4.20. This also
shows how many people are using that backend (it's mainly used for demo)
