Subject: rssh: incorrect filtering of command line options

Hi people,

I've just released DSA 2578-1 which affects rssh after coordination on
the distro list and I'm now posting to oss-sec per policy.

Package        : rssh
Vulnerability  : incorrect filtering of command line options
Problem type   : remote
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2251 CVE-2012-2252 

James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp/sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was
	for example possible to pass dangerous options after a "--" switch. The rsync
	protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific
	patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of the "--rsh" option: the filter preventing usage of the
	"--rsh=" option would not prevent passing "--rsh". This vulnerability affects
	upstream code.

Regards,
