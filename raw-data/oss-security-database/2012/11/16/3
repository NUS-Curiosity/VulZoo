>Ok please use CVE-2012-5475 for this issue.

Here's an explanation of why MITRE didn't use CVE-2012-5475.

In 2010, YUI announced these three issues (see the
http://web.archive.org/web/20101028125444/http://yuilibrary.com/support/2.8.2/
URL):

  charts.swf XSS affecting 2.4.0 through 2.8.1
  uploader.swf XSS affecting 2.5.0 through 2.8.1
  swfstore.swf XSS affecting 2.8.0 through 2.8.1

These were assigned 3 CVEs to reflect the different affected versions:
CVE-2010-4207
CVE-2010-4208
CVE-2010-4209

The recent 2012 announcement at
http://yuilibrary.com/support/20121030-vulnerability/ had an
essentially identical pattern of affected versions. Because of this,
we published 3 CVEs for consistency with the 2010 outcome:

  CVE-2012-5881 charts.swf XSS affecting 2.4.0 through 2.9.0
  CVE-2012-5882 uploader.swf XSS affecting 2.5.0 through 2.9.0
  CVE-2012-5883 swfstore.swf XSS affecting 2.8.0 through 2.9.0

CVE-2012-5475 needed to be rejected in the process:

  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5475

We don't know why the original URL for the 2010 disclosure isn't
available with its original content. (Currently /support/2.8.2/ is a
301 redirect to the new
http://yuilibrary.com/support/20121030-vulnerability/ web page.) In
any case, the web.archive.org URL above has the 2010 data that
supports the 2010 abstraction choice.

We'll most likely update CVE-2010-4207, CVE-2010-4208, and
CVE-2010-4209 to delete the old

  CONFIRM:http://yuilibrary.com/support/2.8.2/

reference, and add the new

  CONFIRM:http://web.archive.org/web/20101028125444/http://yuilibrary.com/support/2.8.2/

reference. We think this is a good idea when a discloser's original
URL for one vulnerability is suddenly changed to only cover another
vulnerability. (We're much less certain that it's a good idea to
change to a web.archive.org URL, if one exists, in all of the many 404
and 403 error cases for other references in other CVEs.)
