We didn't think this was about information disclosure. Our
interpretation is that CVE-2012-5522 (aka bug 14496) is about which
users are allowed to change the status of a bug:

  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-5522

http://www.mantisbt.org/manual/manual.configuration.status.settings.php
says:

  $g_update_bug_status_threshold
  $g_set_status_threshold

  These settings control the access level required to promote a bug
  to a new status once the bug is opened. $g_set_status_threshold
  is an array indexed by the status value that allows a distinct
  setting for each status. It defaults to blank. If the appropriate
  status is not defined above, $g_update_bug_status_threshold is
  used instead. The default is DEVELOPER.

In other words, "all access levels as 'viewer'" doesn't mean that
there's a confidentiality impact resulting from incorrect assignment
of the VIEWER access level to additional persons. Instead, it means
that there's an integrity impact because VIEWER access is sufficient
to change a bug to any different status (Acknowledged, Confirmed,
Assigned, Resolved, or Closed). The intended behavior was for VIEWER
access to be insufficient, and DEVELOPER access to be sufficient. In a
typical MantisBT installation, changing a bug to Closed would often be
the worst scenario.

We agree that it's reasonable to have different CVE names for 14496
and 14704, even though both are closely related to the concept of
incorrect privilege management.
