Signed as GPG/PGP signed.  When you were subscribed to the list, you
had provided your GPG key (id).  If you sign your reply with that key,
list administrator can verify that it is really form current list
member, vouching for another person representing the same distro or
organization.

A good example of similar past communication is this thread:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/6835

As you can see there, a request may come from a person that is involved
with a distribution, but is not expected to be a list member as a
security representative of the distribution.

It's really this kind of feedback that can help list administrator
here, and signing makes it verifiable.
