I'm not sure if there are cases where this is really required. I added
it to support setups like [root-shell] -> su -> [bad-binary].

The shell with foreground process will no process the input. When
suspending the parent, shell will process input, last line of input is
"fg" to get normal su running again.

I would think of using it that way: [bad-binary] is started by admin
via su on error or other user process performs attach-exec-transform
(like with vserver example). [bad-binary] then backdoors root account
(modify sudoers, add ssh keys, make libc world writable), clears the
screen, writes out some large banner or error message, so that admin
does not see the injected commands and then launches the [good-binary].

Therefore it might be useful to temporarily suspend the process
executed from shell.

Not to a standard user account. But some daemons come with own account
and that might be hot candidates. For example the postgresql default
configuration allows psql maintenance connections only from user
"postgres" on localhost (via shared mem if I remember correctly).
Therefore su to "postgres" for database in- or exports might be used
quite frequently, perhaps someone could confirm that or bring even
other examples.
