Subject: gegl: Integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow by
 parsing PPM image headers

Hi All,

An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in 
the way portable pixmap format (PPM) image file format handler of GEGL, 
a graph based image processing framework, processed certain input PPM 
image file headers. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted 
PPM image that when opened in gegl executable would lead to crash, or, 
potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user 
running the binary.

This issue was found by Murray McAllister, Red Hat Security Response Team.

We have assigned CVE-2012-4433 to this issue.
