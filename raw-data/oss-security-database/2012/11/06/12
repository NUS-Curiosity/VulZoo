I am not surprised that our list is behind. I did mention there would
be a 3 month delay in new postings back when I was trying to get
MontaVista back on the closed list which seemed acceptable at the
time. This delay seems excessive. I will ping my management again.

If you feel that MV should be dropped from the list-distros list, then
so be it.

I do realize this list is maintained by volunteers and today's rules
are based on previous emails (kinda hard me to follow).

I do hope the requirements listed at

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros

will be update with "How to maintain membership" and "How to ack/nack
additional team members memberships".

Kind regards,
Armin
