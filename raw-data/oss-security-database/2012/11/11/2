On Red Hat Enterprise 6 and Fedora 16 the file is owned by root:sys,
and the cupsd.conf defaults to:

<Location /admin/conf>
  AuthType Default
  Require user @SYSTEM
  Order allow,deny
</Location>

so that should be like "root", "bin" and "adm" so yeah it would appear
to be vendor specific.

I think as a rule cupsd runs as root, to touch the various files/dirs/etc.

Tricky, /dev/*, log dirs, etc. Probably better to just use a print
specific user/group and make all the standard locations owned by it,
and require the admin to setup anything like say
/non-standard/log/printers/ and so on.

Please use CVE-2012-5519 for this issue. Also if other vendors could
check the permissions/configs/etc. and reply if they are vulnerable
that would be good.
