As far as I can tell, @SYSTEM is defined using SystemGroup and defaults
to lpadmin.

Well, in Debian (and upstream) case it's lpadmin -> root but in your
case it'd be bin -> root and adm -> root. Maybe adm is intended to be
root anyway but I guess that's not the case for bin?

The whole point is that people with access to the admin web interface
can force cupsd to read or write files with the user running cupsd
(root).
