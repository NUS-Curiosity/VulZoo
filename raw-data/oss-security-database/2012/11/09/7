Hi all,

I agree. It's our opinion that these are distinct flaws, and we would 
prefer to keep them tracked independently.

Indeed, we do like to keep similar flaws with very different causes 
separate, though. In the particular case of 1/5 and 14/15 we don't see 
any similarities, but in general we've tried hard here to request CVEs 
in a way that accurately reflects discrete vulnerabilities in the stack.

The CWE dictionary is huge, I would very much appreciate any feedback 
anyone can give me on the appropriateness of my choices here. I have 
been working on a Plone specific CWE dictionary but it's slow going.

We will bow to your advice here. If you tell us that our merge 
recommendations are poor we will make sure that we don't issue multiple 
guidance documents in future. For now, our list reflects our best 
understanding of the CVE guidance documents.

Indeed, I did consider CWE-407 here, but 749 is one of our go-to choices 
as it's a common error in Zope. I think, if I had to come down one side 
or another, then 15 is complexity whereas 14 is allowing users to 
circumvent caching on an expensive function. They are both similar 
outcomes, in that they're expensive pages, but for very different reasons.

Indeed. Also, 05 is a AC:H Au:S whereas 01 is AC:L Au:N. 05 allows an 
escalation of privileges in the sandbox whereas 01 allows unauthorised 
authoring of code which happens to only ever be run in a higher 
privilege set. 01 is a write-once persistent single statement whereas 05 
is an editable file with multiple statements available. The privilege 
set that 01 escalates to is the un-escalated set for 05.
