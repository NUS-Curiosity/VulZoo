Subject: lighttpd 1.4.32 released, fixing CVE-2012-5533

Hi,

we just released lighttpd 1.4.32, fixing a DoS reported by Jesse
Sipprell from McClatchy Interactive, Inc.

Sending "Connection: TE,,Keep-Alive" as header will trigger an endless
loop; as lighttpd is single threaded all request handling will stop
immediately.

Only lighttpd 1.4.31 is affected by this.

For more details and other changes see:

* http://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa_2012_01.txt

Regards,
Stefan
