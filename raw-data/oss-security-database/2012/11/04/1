Subject: YUI 2.x security issue regarding embedded SWF files -- or, How Not
 To Handle A Security Disclosure

I haven't seen this posted at all, but it seems there's some (major?)
security issue regarding the SWF files embedded in YUI 2. The YUI team
has published a blog post regarding this problem asking users to e-mail
them for details.

The comments are a great read. Ryan Grove (former Yahoo! and YUI core
team guy) hits the point on the head regarding disclosure handling of
the issue. Apparently, some people/companies have already been notified
directly weeks ago, and this is how the YUI team is continuing the
disclosure process by just asking projects to e-mail them instead of
just releasing the fix to the public at this stage. :/

Might want to go ahead and get a CVE assigned to whatever this issue
is, and hope more details come out of this soon so YUI 2 users can
actually get patched instead of having to request access to the fix...
