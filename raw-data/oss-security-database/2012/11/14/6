Subject: CVE Request -- firebird: DoS (NULL pointer dereference) while
 preparing an empty query with trace enabled

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  a denial of service flaw was found in the way the TraceManager of Firebird,
a SQL relational database management system, performed preparation of an empty
dynamic SQL query. When the trace mode was enabled, a remote, authenticated
database user could use this flaw to cause the Firebird server to crash with
a NULL pointer dereference.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
