Subject: CVE Request -- mcrypt: stack-based buffer overflow by encryption /
 decryption of overly long file names

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Attila Bogar reported a stack-based buffer overflow
in the way MCrypt, a crypt() package and crypt(1) command
replacement, used to encrypt / decrypt files with overly
long names (longer than 128 bytes). A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted file that, when processed
by the mcrypt too, would lead to mcrypt executable crash [*].

A different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4409:
[1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4409

Note: Using Red Hat bugzilla record for CVE-2012-4409 since
particular Mitre record is not described yet.

References:
[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=867790

Patch proposed by Attila:
[3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=867790#c0

Reproducer:
To reproduce let mcrypt encrypt / decrypt file with name
longer ~128 bytes.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

[*] FORTIFY_SOURCE protection mechanism would mitigate this
deficiency to result into crash only. But on systems, without
FORTIFY_SOURCE protection being applied, the impact might be
higher.

P.S.: I am not sure about relation of this issue to the issue
      Raphael Geissert reported previously:
      [4] http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/10/02/1

      so CC-in him too, he to clarify if [2] == [4], or if
      they are yet different issues. Raphael, please clarify.
      Thanks, Jan.
