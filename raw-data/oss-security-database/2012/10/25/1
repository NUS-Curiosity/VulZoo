Subject: CVE-2012-4508 -- kernel: ext4: AIO vs fallocate stale data exposure

A race condition flaw has been found in the way asynchronous I/O and
fallocate interacted which can lead to exposure of stale data -- that
is, an extent which should have had the "uninitialized" bit set
indicating that its blocks have not yet been written and thus contain
data from a deleted file. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw
to cause an information leak.
