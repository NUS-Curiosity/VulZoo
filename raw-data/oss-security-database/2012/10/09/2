I hadn't thought of putting my slides under a specific license before,
but I'm happy to permit reuse given proper attribution.  Perhaps one of
the Creative Commons licenses would be it, please feel free to suggest
one if you like.

Also, reuse of individual slides may fall under fair use, like I am
reusing a slide on multi-factor authentication from Duo Security's
presentation (I had informed Dug Song of my intent to reuse the slide,
though):
