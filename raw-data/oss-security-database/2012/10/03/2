I assumed this was being handled like CVE-2009-3555 (aka "el diablo"),
in other words everything gets shoved under:

CVE-2012-4930 	The SPDY protocol 3 and earlier, as used in Mozilla
Firefox, Google Chrome, and other products, can perform TLS encryption
of compressed data without properly obfuscating the length of the
unencrypted data, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain
plaintext HTTP headers by observing length differences during a series
of guesses in which a string in an HTTP request potentially matches an
unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a "CRIME" attack.

or

CVE-2012-4929 	The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, as used in Mozilla
Firefox, Google Chrome, and other products, can encrypt compressed
data without properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP
headers by observing length differences during a series of guesses in
which a string in an HTTP request potentially matches an unknown
string in an HTTP header, aka a "CRIME" attack.

Steve, can you comment?
