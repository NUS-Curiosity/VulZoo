I never said anything about giving out exploits.

I simply pointed out that trying to hide details of an issue is only
going to annoy legitimate users/vendors and does not to actually
protect against attackers who also know how to use diff. Transparency
in the security process is important, it helps build trust, and it
helps users/vendors deal with the issues more quickly and efficiently.
