Subject: CVE request: libsocialweb untrusted connection to flickr

A similar request was made last year for libsocialweb connecting to
Twitter, and it seems to be doing the same to Flickr now (probably has
been all this time).

Same situation: opens an HTTP (non-SSL) connection to Flickr when no
Flickr account is configured, and without the user's permission or
knowledge.

Could a CVE be assigned to this (or has one been assigned already)?

Request for the Twitter issue is here (for reference):

and the Red Hat bug:

Thanks.
