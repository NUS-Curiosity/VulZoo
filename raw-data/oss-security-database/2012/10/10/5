Probably. I have been requesting these once I notice CVE is missing. It would help a lot if Joomla would put CVEs to advisories once assigned. This list also contains lots of issues, which needs verification and coordination: http://docs.joomla.org/Vulnerable_Extensions_List

Usually Joomla does not reply to emails sent to address security@j<snip>.org (other than autoreply).
