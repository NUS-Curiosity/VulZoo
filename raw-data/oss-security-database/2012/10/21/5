I'm sure I will be corrected if I'm wrong in stating this.  But oss-security 
is for the discussion of previously disclosed issues that affect F/OSS.  There 
are doubtless some edge cases but I don't believe that the discussion of an 
issue relating to BIG-IP F5s (a commerical, closed source product) has any 
relevance to the oss-security list.   Please try and ensure you only email 
this list when you require action from F/OSS developers and/or distributions.
