Thank you for pointing this out!  I was under impression that YGN
Ethical Hacker Group knew what this list was for, after they had made
multiple on topic postings in the past.  Some [smaller] router firmware
is in fact Open Source.

I'm sorry that, as a list moderator, I let YEHG's original posting and a
follow-up through.  We'll reject further postings to this thread, unless
there are any on list policies and such rather than on the off-topic
vulnerability.
