Subject: CVE Request: Python keyring

Hello,

Python keyring before 0.9.1 was using the user-supplied password insecurely.

>From the 0.9.1 changelog:

CryptedFileKeyring now uses PBKDF2 to derive the key from the user's
password and a random hash. The IV is chosen randomly as well. All the
stored passwords are encrypted at once. Any keyrings using the old
format will be automatically converted to the new format (but will no
longer be compatible with 0.9 and earlier). The user's password is no
longer limited to 32 characters. PyCrypto 2.5 or greater is now required
for this keyring.

See:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring#id2
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-keyring/+bug/1004845

Thanks,

Marc.
