We know and understand how diff work, remember that we are building a major
open source software? So yes we are fully aware how easy it is to find XSS
by doing a diff...

We disagree that giving out exploits and more info about the hacks, will
help security and our users : it will NOT.
Supporting researchers to find security bugs in open source projects,
however has helped us a lot: http://piwik.org/security/
