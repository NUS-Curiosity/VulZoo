Subject: CVE Request: Django

Hello Kurt, Steve, all,

Django recently released updates 1.3.4 and 1.4.2 to address a Host:
header poisoning problem and incorrect HttpOnly cookie documentation
(only wrong in 1.4.x).

I believe only the header poisoning problem requires a CVE (the other
problem is documentation; Django application authors may make a mistake
in their code if they go by the faulty documentation), but I thought I
should mention both in this CVE request email as the Django announcement
mentioned both:
