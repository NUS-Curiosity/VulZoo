Ok according to the video:

This vulnerability affects the yaSSL authentication portion (so SSL
certificate based authentication of clients).

This attack is "reliable", usually works on the first try, but if it
fails it will DoS MySQL and MySQL will require a restart.

So it sounds like this might actually be a yaSSL vulnerability and not
specific to MySQL. CC'ing support@...sl.com so they are aware of this
potential issue.

Please use CVE-2012-0882 for this issue.
