Subject: Re: Attack on badly configured Netfilter-based firewalls

Hi,

I know that the 127.0.0.1 trick worked in past, but for loopback
addresses this isnt working anymore since quite a while.
You will get a 'martian destination', regardless of routing
or rp_filter's set. If we talk about a Linux kernel:

ip_route_input_slow()
{
[...]
        if (ipv4_is_lbcast(daddr) || ipv4_is_zeronet(daddr) ||
            ipv4_is_loopback(daddr))
                goto martian_destination;
[...]
}

Or I am doing something seriously wrong. No idea what Solaris
or BSD's are doing.
For 'real' NIC's this trick is however still working, even if
the machine is a host (not a router). This leaves some room for
accessing internal admin interfaces from outside. :)
However, playing with source addresses to defeat firewalls should be
difficult, since most dists enable rp_filter.

my 2ct's
Sebastian
