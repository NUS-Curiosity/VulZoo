Subject: CVE request: Hash DoS vulnerability (ocert-2011-003)

So going through various things looks like Ocaml is vulnerable and has
not had a CVE # assigned for this issue yet.

Discussion of the issue takes place on the mailing list, here is a link
for the originating thread:

There doesn't appear to be a fix yet.
