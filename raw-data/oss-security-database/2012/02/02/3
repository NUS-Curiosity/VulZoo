We don't really have a choice as to the details becoming public - we
only have (limited) choice as to when.

OK, thanks for sharing your opinion.

Below in this same message you wrote that "most Linux vendors are now
responding to 500-1000 security issues per year", which means that you
almost always have multiple issues being worked on in parallel.  Thus,
there should be _no_ increase in workload because if you have to work
on each issue twice faster, you have twice fewer issues to work on at
the same time.  So the workload should stay roughly the same.

On the other hand, the "500-1000 security issues per year" figure might
not be relevant - I'll comment on that below.

Some people would prefer no rules/guidelines at all - but in that case
use of a public list right away is likely better. ;-)

More to the point, I am not proposing completely removing the
flexibility.  With a maximum of 7-11 days, the preference may be even
lower than that - like 4 days.  Not surprisingly, you don't seem to like
this - but I think I should have asked anyway.

How many of these are embargoed?  I think maybe 50 or so?  This still
leaves one embargoed issue handled every week, on average, which may be
enough not to significantly increase the workload with a shorter embargo
(one issue handled per week or two issues handled per two weeks -
almost the same thing).

In general, yes.  However, the "find" step is usually mostly done by the
time the issue gets to the list, and the QA team might work more closely
with the security team (maybe, or maybe not).  I can see that
speculatively testing non-final fixes from the security team may
increase the total workload, though (in case the security team chooses
to revise the fix for its own reasons).  This might add cost to the
vendor, but there's also a benefit: quicker fixes to the users, other
vendors not having to wait.  There might even be a business/commercial
justification to this change.

This argument, assuming that it's true, also means that there's little
to lose by posting to a public list right away or by not having fixes
ready by a CRD in some case.

...or do you feel that a leak to certain unintended parties who may
exploit the issue to a limited scale (and choose not to make the issue
public) is less of a problem than publication of the issue (which may
result in widespread exploitation)?  This is non-obvious.  While in the
former case fewer systems may be compromised, in the latter case
experienced people and companies with experienced IT security staff
(capable of more than just installing vendors' patches) are given a
better chance to defend their systems.
