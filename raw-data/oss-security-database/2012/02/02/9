Subject: CVE request: phpldapadmin "base" Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

According to secunia advisory:
https://secunia.com/advisories/47852/

Input passed via the "base" parameter to cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to 
"query_engine") is not properly sanitised in lib/QueryRender.php before being 
returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and 
script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.2.2. Other versions may also be 
affected.
