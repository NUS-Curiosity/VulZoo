As far as I'm aware, no - it's all the same concerns and reasoning that
we had e.g. 10 years ago.

Unfortunately, yes.  Well, I can add that it's just a person's negative
opinion on what we're doing with these closed lists, with reasoning -
and nothing more.

I fully agree.  However, when someone e-mails potentially helpful
comments to me yet does not permit me to post them to the list, what
options do I have?  Stop the discussion right there - either we discuss
this in public or not at all?  I guess for some topics I would do just
that, but I felt that this one did not cross that line.

That's my opinion too.

Yet I needed to bring the topic up.  I was not 100% sure that some
vendors currently on the list would find 7-11 days unacceptable.  Being
90% sure was not enough.

I've noticed a decrease in embargo periods over time - I think for
vendor-sec the average might have been 14 days if not more, whereas now
it might be down to 10-12 days or so (excluding the hash DoS thing).
So we turned the old average into the new maximum.  I thought that maybe
we were ready for the "next level" - but it seems not.  Maybe later?
