I'm seeing a LOT of guaranteed downsides to this shorter embargo period
(vendor-sec-1-week-embargo@, vendor-sec-2-week-embargo@, increased
workloads, decreased testing/QA time, decreased trust in the community,
decreased discussion of patches/fixes/workarounds/root causes, etc.)
against the _potential_ risk of an issue being revealed prior to the
embargo date, which has the _potential_ to have an impact (so a
potential risk for an outcome that may potentially be bad, in other
words pretty low). And even if we make this change (shorter embargo
periods) that risk of early disclosure is still present! I'm just not
sure we're gaining anything worthwhile.

This doesn't appear to have been a significant problem in the past or
present. Is something changing to significantly increase this risk that
we (the community) are unaware of? You allude to:

"Why I am making this proposal now: this is triggered by a certain
off-list discussion I just had; unfortunately, the other party does not
permit me to post more about it."

Which is awfully vague. I think it's important for there to be openness,
transparency and honesty in this process or else it won't work. Like you
pointed out earlier vendors may choose to stop playing together, which
would REALLY not be good for the vendors or the Open Source community
long term.
