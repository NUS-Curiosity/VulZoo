Subject: CVE request: mumble local information disclosure

It was discovered that mumble created its database file
(~/.local/share/data/Mumble/.mumble.sqlite) with insecure world-readable
permissions.  If the user had (non-default) permissions on their home
directory, another local user could obtain password and configuration
settings from the database file.

This has been corrected in upstream git and is reported as affecting
1.2.3 and earlier.

Could a CVE be assigned to this flaw?
