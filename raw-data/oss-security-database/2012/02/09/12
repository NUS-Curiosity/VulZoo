Why this one?

The table at the bottom of:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2012-366304.html

lists 27 MySQL vulnerabilities, all with CVE IDs and CVSS scoring - but
little other info.  CVE-2012-0492 is one of them, but it does not stand
out.  (And I have no idea what it actually is, just like I have no idea
about the remaining 26.)

"This Critical Patch Update contains 27 new security fixes for Oracle
MySQL.  1 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without
authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need
for a username and password."

That one is CVE-2011-2262, but per CVSS scoring it's just a DoS.

I wish we had more info.
