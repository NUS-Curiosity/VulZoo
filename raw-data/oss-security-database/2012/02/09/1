Please use CVE-2012-0840 for this issue.

They posted a first attempt at a fix:
http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40apr.apache.org/msg24473.html

Actual commit:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/apr-commits/201201.mbox/%3C20120115003715.071D423888FD@eris.apache.org%3E

Reply about this commit:
r1231605 and r1231858 cause massive regressions and test case failures
in httpd.

so probably not the final fix.

If someone could reply to this with the final fix that'd be helpful.
