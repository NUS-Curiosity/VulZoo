Here's a more direct link:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2012-366304.html#AppendixMSQL

(e.g. for referring to in distro advisories).

News story summarizing the problem (in Russian, sorry):

http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml?num=33051

It also mentions that Oracle Linux merely reuses RHEL's updates to
MySQL without any reference to Oracle's own MySQL vulnerability/fix
info.  So it is not even clear whether Oracle Linux has these 27 bugs in
MySQL fixed or not, despite of MySQL being an Oracle product.
