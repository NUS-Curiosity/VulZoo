Subject: CVE Request -- python-paste-script: Supplementary groups not dropped
 when started an application with "paster serve" as root

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way Paster, a pluggable command-line frontend,
when started as root (for example to have access to privileged port) to serve a
web based application, performed privileges dropping upon startup
(supplementary groups were not dropped properly regardless of the UID, GID
specified in the .ini configuration file or in the --user and --group CL
arguments). A remote attacker could use this flaw for example to read / write
root GID accessible files, if the particular web application provided remote
means for local file manipulation.
