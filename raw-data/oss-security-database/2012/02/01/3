You mean with full-disclosure/Bugtraq (not Bugzilla)?

I think there will be quite little overlap.  Neither of these lists has
anything resembling the full set of security issues even in popular Open
Source projects posted to it - they receive small and arbitrary subsets
instead (plus lots of other stuff that would be offtopic here).  With
mostly CVE requests in here, we also have an arbitrary subset (albeit I
think a larger one).  If we expand that to have good coverage of at
least popular projects that many of us use, that would actually make
this list more unique.
