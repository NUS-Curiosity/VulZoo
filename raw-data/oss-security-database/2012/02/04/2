Thank you for sharing your opinion.

Yet the delay itself matters too.  There are different opinions as to
whether it is "the important aspect" or not.

I don't mind.  Like I said, I need a tool - a program to mass-decrypt a
PGP/MIME mbox, producing another mbox.  I think such a program might be

different mechanism for the archive - not treat it as a regular
subscriber like I intended to.
