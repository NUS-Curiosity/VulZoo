There was not exactly a "concern" - I just said that I was not aware of
a tool to do the job, and I still am not.  What you're proposing is to
write an own tool (script).

Thank you for the suggestion to use munpack, this is something I had not
considered.  I was thinking of options that would produce (almost) the
exact same mbox that we'd get if mail to subscribers were not encrypted.
With the munpack approach, I think it might be trickier to arrive "back"
at that (same original MIME types for each section, etc.)  I understand
that initially this kind of correctness might not matter - you just want
to see that the list is not being misused and that's all.

This can definitely be done.  I just have other tasks to work on...
