Given that there is only one public signed Linux boot loader, saying
"most" is a bit odd here :)

UEFI Secure Boot really doesn't care about the kernel or the OS at all,
all it is there for is to protect the bootloader and the BIOS.  The fact
that some operating systems take that chain-of-trust and extend it
beyond the BIOS is up to them, and the fact that some UEFI signing
authorities might impose more restrictions on the binaries that they
sign is also up to them, and not part of the UEFI specification or
requirements.

Having a signed USB image boot properly if it is installed seems to be
the correct thing to me, but, in my testing, has not been the default on
the hardware that I have access to.  It would be great to find out what
hardware you are seeing this on as I am helping to get Linux working
properly on UEFI machines these days.
