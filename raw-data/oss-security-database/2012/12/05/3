Subject: CVE request: Mysql/Mariadb insecure salt-usage

Hi,

Noticed another post by kingcope on full-disclosure, which basically
boils down to re-use of a salt-value when transmitting passwords
over a network.

If you could MITM/capture network packets, you could use this
weakness to determine the passwords.

Should this a CVE be assigned to this issue?
