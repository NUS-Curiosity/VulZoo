Well, an attacker that is allowed to send RA's could do all kinds of
ugly things, just like a rogue DHCP server could. Since that kind of
address configuration provides no means to verify authenticity, hosts
have no way to tell whether an RA is correct or malicious. Security
basically relies on the switches blocking unintended address
configuration.
