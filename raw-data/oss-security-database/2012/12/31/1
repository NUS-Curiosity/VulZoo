Maybe iDefense or iSIGHT would be willing to share (I know the data
exists, I helped collect it for 9.5 years =). One thing I'm really
noticing as a good rule of thumb:

1) if a project has security@ or similar email and responds timely,
this is good.
2) if a project has security@ or similar email and never responds then
they tend to fix things but not overly quickly/consistently
3) if a project has no security@ or similar email chances are they
don't handle security issues very gracefully (big surprise hey).

Basically if the first result in Google for "report security issue to
X" isn't useful chances are it's not going to end well. The best part
is not all vendors provide a secure means to submit vulnerabilities
(e.g. please provide a PGP encryption key for email, and if you use a
web form please use HTTPS!).
