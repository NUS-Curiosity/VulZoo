Subject: Robust XML validation

I'm working on guidelines for robust XML parsing and I noticed that 
there are some denial-of-service issues related to validation which do 
not seem widely documented (but were apparently known when SGML was 
specified).

I wonder if we should care about this in the sense that we should 
prepare fixes, or if it is sufficient to recommend to validate against 
trusted schemas/DTDs only.  (I've found an implementation which gets 
right the things I tested so far, so efficient implementations aren't 
impossible.)
