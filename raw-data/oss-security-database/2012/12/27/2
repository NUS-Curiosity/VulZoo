Subject: CVE request: Jenkins

Hi,
these Jenkins security issues don't seem to have CVEs assigned so far:
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2012-11-20 

I can't provide links to upstream fixes, but three CVE IDs seem 
needed (HTTP response splitting, open redirect and XSS)

Cheers,
        Moritz
