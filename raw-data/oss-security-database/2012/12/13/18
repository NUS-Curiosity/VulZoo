Chicken Scheme (www.call-cc.org) has multi-argument versions of the
process family of procedures which map to the exec() family.
http://wiki.call-cc.org/manual/Unit%20posix#processes
These are a bit tricky, since the one-argument versions fall back to
system()-like functionality.  I consider this dangerous.

There's also the scsh-process egg, which is much more fool-proof:
http://wiki.call-cc.org/egg/scsh-process
It's modeled after SCSH, the Scheme Shell.  A few other Scheme
implementations (at least Guile and Scheme48 iirc) also have a version
of this safe notation.

Cheers,
