At a minimum it can violate confidentiality (e.g. using to track
opening of a file), at worst it can be used a vector for attack code.

I just did some googling for LibreOffice and going through the config
UI in LibreOffice and can't find the option to disable or have it
prompt me when loading external data references. If anyone knows how
to block external data in LibreOffice by default I'd love to know how.

I'm kind of leaning towards classifying this as a security issue since
I expected there is some way to disable it or at least tell it to
prompt me when a document tries to go get an external data source
(e.g. "this document contains external data, the URLs/file paths it is
trying to  reference are: [list of locations]") but apparently there
is no way to disable/have this prompt (at least that I can find in
LibreOffice)?
