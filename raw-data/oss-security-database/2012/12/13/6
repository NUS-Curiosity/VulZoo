Hold on here. The report is for geany, so for geany's filename
escaping to actually be at fault, you would still have to load the
offending file into the editor. Otherwise, just running 'make' from
the command line would trigger the exact same effect, except that
make is (as has been pointed out) designed to run arbitrary shell
commands already and therefore won't be doing anything wrong.

Except that people wouldn't manually compile thousands of files
one by one. That's where build systems come in.

For the original report to be valid, the file would still have to
be loaded into geany, or the report should have been about some
other program. This is not a security issue that concerns geany.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
