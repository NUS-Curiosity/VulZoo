W3 generates .htaccess files and sets up the directory structure and
accesses. Nowhere is it documented that sysadmins should additionally
modify the .htaccess files to protect the cache, and W3's own htaccess
generation fails to protect it.

Sure:

        query_md5=md5("SELECT * FROM ${db_prefix}users WHERE ID =
'${user_id}'")
        key=md5("w3tc_${host}_${site_id}_sql_${query_md5}")
        url="
http://siteblabla/wp-content/w3tc/${key:0:1}/${key:1:1}/${key:2:1}/${key}"

"db_prefix" is by default "wp_", per wordpress config, and few people go in
and change that. "user_id" is an integer. IDs start at 1 and increase for
each added user. "site_id" is an integer that also starts at 1 and
increases for each site used in multi-site wordpress. "host" is the
hostname of the site. All of these values are known or guessable.

They _must_ be protected. They _must not_ be exposed or downloadable. The
hash values are raw SQL query responses, so they contain things like
password hashes. The cache is used only internally by the web application,
and client browsers should never have any direct contact with this cache.
