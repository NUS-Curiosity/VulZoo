Subject: Inkscape reads .eps files from /tmp instead of the current
 directory

Hi

Going trough some bugreports in Debian I noticed [1], [2] I haven't
found a CVE for "Inkscape reads .eps files from /tmp instead of the
current directory".

If one has file foo.eps in current directory, and /tmp/foo.eps is
present

 $ inkscape foo.eps

opens the copy in /tmp/foo.eps

Does this warrants a CVE? If so could you assign one?

Regards,
Salvatore
