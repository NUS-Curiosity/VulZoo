 Yes, had it fixes for both parts listed from the start, there would
be no problem. The problem is the confusion over where CVE-2012-5645
is really fixed. Based on the original description here some
distributions claim CVE-2012-5645 fixed now that they have applied one
patch only. If you just add second fix to CVE-2012-5645, there will be
no way of telling if particular logmsg about "CVE-2012-5645 fixed"
means it's fixed completely, or only half of it.
