One random thought, might it be worth adding structured data to CVE
that basically says when the issue was made public/reported to the
upstream and when upstream 1) acknowledged it (if ever) and then they
patched it (if ever) and when they shipped a fixed version (if ever).
Obviously then you could simply parse for the time between date
reported and date acknowledged/patched/fixed and see how
healthy/responsive the upstream is.
