TYPO3-CORE-SA-2012-005: Several Vulnerabilities in TYPO3 Core
https://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-core/typo3-core-sa-2012-005/

I'm a little confused because multiple issues are listed together with
a single CVSS2 score/etc.

Can the Typo3 security team please confirm the following:

> Component Type: TYPO3 Core Affected Versions: 4.5.0 up to 4.5.20,
> 4.6.0 up to 4.6.13, 4.7.0 up
to 4.7.5 and development releases of the 6.0 branch.
> Vulnerability Types: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting,
Information Disclosure

so no CVE's needed for this, this is simply a summary of the below issues?

> Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend History Module Vulnerability
> Type: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting Solution: Update to the
> TYPO3 version 4.5.21, 4.6.14 or 4.7.6 that
fix the problem described!
> Credits: Credits go to Thomas Worm who discovered and reported the
issue.

Did he discover both the SQL Injection and the Cross-Site Scripting
issues? Can you provide a link to the specific code fixes?

so 2 cve's needed correct?

> Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend History Module Vulnerability
> Type: Information Disclosure
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.21, 4.6.14 or 4.7.6 that fix
the problem described!
> Credits: Credits go to Core Team Member Oliver Hader who
> discovered
and fixed the issue.

so one cve needed here? Can you provide a link to the specific code fixes?

> Vulnerable subcomponent: TYPO3 Backend API Vulnerability Type:
> Cross-Site Scripting Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.21,
> 4.6.14 or 4.7.6 that
fix the problem described!
> Credits: Credits go to Johannes Feustel who discovered and
> reported
the issue.

so one cve needed here? Can you provide a link to the specific code fixes?

> Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting Solution: Update to the
> TYPO3 version 4.5.21, 4.6.14 or 4.7.6 that
fix the problem described!
> Credits: Credits go to Richard Brain who discovered and reported
> the
issue.

so one cve needed here? Can you provide a link to the specific code fixes?

Thanks for confirming this.
