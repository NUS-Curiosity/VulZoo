We don't know what vendors are basing their UEFI bios implementation on
the open source version, I know there is at least one UEFI bios that is
not based on the open source version, or so it is reported (the BSD
license of Tianocore means that we will never really know.)

Determining what machine is running what bios from what company that was
based on what version of the open source UEFI implementation is going to
be a huge problem in the long run and something that I sure don't want
to have to track.

There have been reported bugs in the Tianocore in the past, I don't
think they were "security" issues in and of themselves, should we be
reporting them here to get CVE numbers if they are?
