Subject: CVE request: perl-modules

Debian recently fixed the following security bug:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=695224

"Locale::Maketext is a core l10n library that expands templates found in
strings.

Two problems were found, reported, and patched-for by Brian Carlson of
cPanel, and these fixes are now in blead and on the CPAN.

The commit in question is
http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/1735f6f53ca19f99c6e9e39496c486af323ba6a8

The flaws are:

* in a [method,x,y,z] template, the method could be a fully-qualified name
* template expansion did not properly quote metacharacters, allowing
  code injection through a malicious template

Please upgrade your Locale::Maketext, especially if you allow user-provided
templates."
