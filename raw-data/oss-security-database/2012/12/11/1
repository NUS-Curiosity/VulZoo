Subject: CVE request: opus codec before 1.0.2

http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/opus/2012-December/001846.html

sounds like a low-severity security issue:

"Opus 1.0.2 fixes an out-of-bounds read that could be triggered by a
malicious Opus packet by causing an integer wrap-around in the padding
code. Considering that the packet would have to be at least 16 MB in
size and that no out-of-bounds write is possible, the severity is very
low."

Fixed in opus 1.0.2.
