Subject: Xen Security Advisory 32 (CVE-2012-5525) - several hypercalls do
 not validate input GFNs

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-5525 / XSA-32
			      version 4

	     several hypercalls do not validate input GFNs

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The function get_page_from_gfn does not validate its input GFN. An
invalid GFN passed to a hypercall which uses this function will cause
the hypervisor to read off the end of the frame table and potentially
crash.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator of a PV guest can cause Xen to crash.
If the out of bounds access does not lead to a crash, a carefully
crafted privilege escalation cannot be excluded, even though the guest
doesn't itself control the values written.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only Xen 4.2 and Xen unstable are vulnerable. Xen 4.1 and earlier are
not vulnerable.

The vulnerability is exposed only to PV guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only trusted PV guest kernels will avoid this vulnerability.

Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
