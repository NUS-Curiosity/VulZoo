Subject: Xen Security Advisory 29 (CVE-2012-5513) - XENMEM_exchange may
 overwrite hypervisor memory

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-5513 / XSA-29
                             version 3

           XENMEM_exchange may overwrite hypervisor memory

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The handler for XENMEM_exchange accesses guest memory without range checking
the guest provided addresses, thus allowing these accesses to include the
hypervisor reserved range.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash.  If the out of address
space bounds access does not lead to a crash, a carefully crafted privilege
escalation cannot be excluded, even though the guest doesn't itself control
the values written.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions are vulnerable.

The vulnerability is only exposed to PV guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM guests, or ensuring that PV guests only use trusted kernels,
will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
