Subject: CVE request: Xorg input device format string flaw

Hello,

Adding an input device with a malicious name can trigger a format
string flaw in Xorg's logging subsystem. For builds of Xorg lacking
-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 (or 32-bit systems lacking the fix to fortify[1])
this can lead to arbitrary code execution as the Xorg user, usually
root. When built with fortify, this is a denial of service, since Xorg
will abort.

Proposed solution patch series can be found here:
    1/4 http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/10000/
    2/4 http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/9998/
    3/4 http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/9999/
    4/4 http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/10001/
