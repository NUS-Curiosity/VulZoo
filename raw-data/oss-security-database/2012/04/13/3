Yes, doesn't look so one got assigned for this one yet, since:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=openjpeg

provides just recent CVE-2012-1499. To the:

http://code.google.com/p/openjpeg/issues/detail?id=5

issue itself:

1) It should get a CVE-2009-* identifier (upstream
ticket is public from 2009-Jul-31).

2) From the issue reasons investigation, it seems to
be combination of heap-based buffer invalid reads and
writes by processing certain Gray16 TIFF images, leading
to invalid free (when such corrupted memory allocated
for tile encoder / decoder handle (TCD) is attempted
to be freed).

More official description in Red Hat bug:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812317

Kurt, could you allocate a 2009 CVE id?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
