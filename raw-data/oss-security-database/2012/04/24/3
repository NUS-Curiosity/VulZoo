Subject: CVE Request: libsoup 2.32.2 sets ssl trusted flag despite no verification

Hi,

libsoup 2.32.2 does not verify certificates at all if an application does
not explicitly specify a file with trusted root CA's. Since that libsoup
version relies on the verification failure to clear the trust flag it
always considers ssl connections as trusted in that case.
