Subject: CVE Request -- net-snmp: Array index error, leading to out-of heap-based
 buffer read (snmpd crash)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   an array index error, leading to out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found
in the way net-snmp agent performed entries lookup in the extension table. When
certain MIB subtree was handled by the extend directive, a remote attacker
having read privilege to the subtree could use this flaw to cause a denial of
service (snmpd crash) via SNMP GET request involving a non-existent extension
table entry.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
