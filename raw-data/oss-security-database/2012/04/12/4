As a project there is an automated testing framework integrated into the
code hosted on drupal.org and a network of servers to run tests pretty
quickly, but very few of the contributed modules take advantage of it
(there are 16,000 of them after all). I don't think we've gone beyond
anecdotes for why people don't upgrade rapidly but it's definitely
something we're constantly working to improve the speed of the upgrade
cycle.
