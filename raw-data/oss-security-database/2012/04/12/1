I am not sure about this one.
For out of memory write in dip.c, my guess is yes, it is basically possible to
write past an allocated buffer. Even though I can't tell you what data would
reside in that area.
For the xbm decoder, the problem has basically been that xbm_decode() did not
indicate an error when decoding xbm images and thus the callers would continue
to operate on the parsed structures even though the image is faulty.

Cheers
Nico
