I was under the impression that if the backend was off the plugin
wouldn't work/expose the vuln, I could of course be wrong, if so I'll
assign a CVE.

Well the CVE inclusion decisions:

Pro assignment:
Does exploitation of the issue provide the attacker with extra
privileges or information, or cause a denial of service, that the
attacker would not already have before they attempt to exploit the issue?

Anti-assignment:
Is the issue site-specific? Is it only in an online service
(software-as-a-service), on a specific web site, or only offered
through hosting solutions that are under the full control of the vendor?
Does the issue only affect a version that was never made generally
available to the vendor's customers?

Direct links to the code commits fixing them would be nice =)
