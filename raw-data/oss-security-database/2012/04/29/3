Subject: Page disclosure/cve updated in wiki

Hello list,

I have updated page disclosure/cve[1] as per request[2]. Changes can be seen in diff[3]. Please review and give comments if needed. In my opinion that page should be reference also for example vendors who (yet) doesn't request CVE-identifiers for their advisories.
