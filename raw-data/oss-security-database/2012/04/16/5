Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- Two Munin graphing framework flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   the following three problems has been recently reported against Munin:
   [1] Insecure temp file use in the qmailscan plug-in:

       https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812889
       http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668778

   [2] Possibility to inject escape sequences into Munin's log file:

       https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812885
       http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668666

   [3] Remote users can fill /tmp filesystem:
       Red Hat would not consider this to be a security flaw =>
       no RH BTS entry.

       Original report:
       http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668667

For the first two -- though both of them having minor security impact,
under suitable circumstances they could lead to trust boundary crossing =>
under our opinion they should get a (CVE-2012-*) identifiers.

For the third issue -- we wouldn't consider it to be a security
flaw. Just as something, which on improperly configured machine
could allow to fill in /tmp filesystem (just another way how to
do it, when the particular service isn't properly configured).

Could you allocate CVE ids for the first two issues?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
