Subject: OpenSSL ASN1 BIO vulnerability (CVE-2012-2110)

Hi,

This should have been posted in here yesterday (and by someone more
familiar with the topic), but better a bit late than never.

Tavis Ormandy of Google Security Team found a vulnerability in OpenSSL:

incorrect integer conversions in OpenSSL can result in memory corruption.
http://lists.openwall.net/full-disclosure/2012/04/19/4

Advisory from OpenSSL:
http://openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt

Fortunately, the SSL/TLS code of OpenSSL is not affected - but some
other uses of OpenSSL are.

There are updates for 1.0.1, 1.0.0, and 0.9.8.

Alexander
