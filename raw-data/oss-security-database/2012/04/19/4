The packaging of munin node determines whether it will install
symlinks for enabling plugins. The packaging of munin master
determines whether a configuration for your httpd is installed and
activated.

On Debian, symlinks to enable plugins are installed by default, and an
apache2 configuration is automatically activated. So, on Debian, if
your httpd is publicly-accessible, the munin pages and CGI will be
publicly-accessible.
