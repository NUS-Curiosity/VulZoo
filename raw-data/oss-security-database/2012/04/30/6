Are you sure it's just this specific version of libsoup?  Looking at the
code of earlier versions (such as 2.2.98), the patch noted in your bug
would apply (unless there is some other context around it that would
make this a non-issue?).  Did you look at other versions at all?

Thanks for any info.
