Nope. My SQL-injection guru-powers are not enough for this. I think something bad could be done via those unescaped inputs, but at the moment I can't make a proper PoC for the list so my vote goes for "no CVE" until someone gives working PoC for this.

I also created this item (no response yet) http://www.wikidforum.com/forum/forum-software_29/wikidforum-support_31/sschadv2012-005-unfixed-xss-and-sql-injection-security-vulnerabilities_188.html
