Hi,

I would like disclosure SQL injection vulnerability if Buddypress plugin affecting last versions. This issue was 
reported to developers and resolved in 1.5.5 version. So, I suggest all having this plugin in their blogs update to 
last version, if you haven't done it yet. Example of POST message with sql injection is below.
