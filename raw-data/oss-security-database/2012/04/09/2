According to the page you quote it's not in any Mozilla browsers by
default (or any major web browser that I can see), it's not in Fedora
or Red Hat Enterprise Linux or any derivatives of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, or Ubuntu or SuSE Linux to name a few (not to mention Mac OS X
or Windows).

I don't understand why people choose a widely unsupported CA when
there are widely supported CAs like StartCom that offer free
certificates. Please, use supported CAs.
