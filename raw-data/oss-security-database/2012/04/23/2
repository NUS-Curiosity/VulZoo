Subject: Security vulnerabilities fixed in WordPress 3.3.2

Page http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3.2 says:

"""
Three external libraries included in WordPress received security updates:

- Plupload (version 1.5.4), which WordPress uses for uploading media.
- SWFUpload, which WordPress previously used for uploading media, and may still be in use by plugins.
- SWFObject, which WordPress previously used to embed Flash content, and may still be in use by plugins and themes.

WordPress 3.3.2 also addresses:

- Limited privilege escalation where a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins when running a WordPress network under particular circumstances.
- Cross-site scripting vulnerability when making URLs clickable.
- Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in redirects after posting comments in older browsers, and when filtering URLs.

A full log of the changes made for 3.3.2 can be found at http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?new=20554%40branches%2F3.3&old=20087%40branches%2F3.3
"""

I asked from WordPress if these vulnerabilities already have CVE-identifiers and reported these to OSVDB, Secunia and Debian http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=670124
