Proposing the date isn't the issue. If you want to continue with your 14
day embargo, that's trivial. The problem is chasing that. Who is
responsible for ensuring everything is progressing as expected?

The biggest problem vendor-sec had was low priority issues would just sit
and rot. Many probably never should have had an embargo to begin with. This
is where a relatively short default embargo date is useful. If nobody
cares, let it go public. At the same time, if something is very important,
they can ask for an extension.

The issue of course becomes how does something become public then if nobody
cares?

My above reasoning is why I say this.

This is where things get tricky using just a list. Ideally, things get a
default embargo date, then they open up at that time (sadly with a list,
this isn't automatic). If someone needs additional time, they request it,
again though, who will track this?

This is where things start to get tricky. I think about this problem a lot.
I think the fundamental issue is that we lack an open source security
community.  We have a bunch of tribes, but no actual community. Until we
start to foster such a group, nothing is going to change. Embargoes are
really just a symptom of a much larger issue.

The only way 100% is possible if there is automation. Humans can't do 100%.

I think the solution is to start creating an open source community. Of
course this is far easier said than done. No doubt we all have some ideas.

I think a good first step would be getting a bunch of folks in the
#oss-security channel on Freenode. We can start talking and figure out
where to go from there. There are some tools available to us now that were
not a few years back (some social media type things). So far I think the
wiki and mailing lists are a start, but we could make all this so much
more. We have an immense amount of talent out there, if we start
collaborating, I expect great things to happen.
