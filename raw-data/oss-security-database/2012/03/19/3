Which is why it's handy to be able to use an ID when discussing the fix
as well. Googling for the discussion becomes all but impossible otherwise,
since you're reduced to, in your own words, "that openssl thing".

Yes, but that question becomes very hard to answer when it's not
written down what CVE it was that was fixed, which is why I think it's
crucial to be able to get one before the fix is available. Many small
projects don't use changelogs or track issues all that carefully after
they're fixed, but rely entirely on commit messages to keep (and give)
such information to its users.

Then again, I'm speaking from a developer standpoint and I generally
need (well, want, but for the sake of issue history I should say
"strongly prefer to have") the id long before most users even know
there's a problem.

By this thread I'm fairly assured that won't be a problem though, so
I'll refrain from commenting further.

Thanks to all who clarified.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
