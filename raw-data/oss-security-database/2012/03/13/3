Thanks for the clarifications, but this still leaves many questions open for me.

Does this person contact upstream(s)?
If not, who does?
Does this person contact downstreams?
Or are they assumed to read distros@?
What if an up- or downstream claims to need longer (confer a recent issue)?
When CRD happens, who publishes what where?
Or is it just a free-for-all afterwards?

Just off the top of my head :)
