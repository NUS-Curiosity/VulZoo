Subject: CVE-request: Joomla core information disclosure 1.7.1

Hello,

It seems that this issue does not yet have CVE-identifier.

http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/371-20111002-core-information-disclosure.html

I can't never be sure with Joomla so maybe someone wants to verify this before assigment.
