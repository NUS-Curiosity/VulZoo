Subject: CVE Request: lightdm

Could we please get a CVE assigned to the following issue:

lightdm leaks file descriptors to child processes. A local attacker can use this to bypass
intended permissions and write to the log file, cause a denial of service, or possibly
have another unknown impact.

Bug:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/927060
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=658678

Thanks,

Marc.
