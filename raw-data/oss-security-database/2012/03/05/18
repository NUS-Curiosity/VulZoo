Subject: Re: TORCS 1.3.2 xml buffer overflow - CVE-2012-1189

Speed Dreams (http://www.speed-dreams.org/) is also vulnerable due It is a
TORCS's fork, and they both share most of the code.
Should I ask for a new CVE number? or can I use CVE-2012-1189 for this
issue?

By the way, how can I get disclosed  CVE-2012-1189 details in mitre web
page, since TORCS and Speed Dreams people have already fixed the bugs?.

Regards.
