This task strikes me as a timesink that results in minimal value. It's in
the best interest of all list members to fix issues in a timely manner. The
historic vendor-sec never had a serious problem with CRD. They were often
outside of the current proposed 14 day span, but that's just a reality of
how things go. We all have more work to do than time, so some things are
bound to suffer.

Trying to get a couple people to do this is going to be a losing battle. We
need to think about how to best let the list police itself. It certainly
won't be 100% perfect, but I think even an 80% reasonable CRD agreement
goal is acceptable (perfect is the enemy of the good comes to mind).

I would suggest some reasonable guidelines (that are not enforced
strictly), then see how things go for a while. If it's deemed unacceptable,
a better solution can be worked on.

Thanks.
