Josh Bressers (Josh, correct me if I'm using your name in vain) used to be 
quite happy to assign CVEs for undisclosed (embargoed) F/OSS issues providing 
details were forthcoming with the request.   If Josh is no longer able to 
fulfil that role due to a change of circumstance at Redhat it would be nice if 
someone stepped into the breach -  be that Redhat, Debian or one of the other 
CNAs.  There is definately a place for "disclosed to project, being/been fixed, 
not public - can I have a CVE?" without deferring to the distros list or MITRE 
- most of the time projects can respond in a timely fashion, so a minimum 
effort approach is ideal.

As an aside, the public address for MITRE on the web site is wrong AFAIK.  
Quoting Steve Christey:

"Apologies for the delay.  In the future, please use cve-assign@...re.org 
for requests related to CVE reservation."

From last time I went to MITRE (for a closed source product).
