Subject: Drupal CORE and Drupal Contrib

I was going to ask this next week but now seems topical: looking at
http://drupal.org/security/contrib

I see drupal core (at least one thing there needs a CVE), and no CVE's
listed on that page. Would it be possible to get Drupal to list CVE's
assigned for the issue on that page? It would make life easier for all
concerned.

Ditto for the contrib page, 41 issues so far this year, I think a bunch
have CVE's assigned but am not sure. Would it be possible to get Drupal
to list CVE's assigned for the issue on that page? It would make life
easier for all concerned.

I was planning to do a missing CVE assignment for Drupal this weekend
(I'm guessing 40?).
