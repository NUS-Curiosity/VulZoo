Subject: openssl security issue or not? (CVE Request?)

Hi folks, Ivan,

This patch:
http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22161
fixes a decrypt error return values and according to the changelog
"detects symmetric crypto errors" 

I am not sure if this counts as security issue in the end, but "not
detecting a failed decrypt" seems to me like it is a security issue.

Any comments?

Ciao, Marcus
