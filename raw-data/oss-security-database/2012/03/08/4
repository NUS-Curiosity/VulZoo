Subject: CVE request for PHP 5.3.x Corrupted $_FILES indices lead to security
 concern

Just looking through http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.0

Fixed bug #55500 (Corrupted $_FILES indices lead to security concern).

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=55500
(still locked)

But the blog posting:

https://nealpoole.com/blog/2011/10/directory-traversal-via-php-multi-file-uploads/

has details and it appears to be a security issue. I have emailed
security@....net twice, no response in a week so I'm sending the request
to OSS-sec.
