Subject: CVE request: pyfribidi buffer overflow flaw

Could a CVE be assigned for this issue please?  I don't think it's come
through here yet.

A buffer overflow flaw was reported in pyfribidi's
fribidi_utf8_to_unicode() function, due to it handling at most 3 bytes
for a single unicode character.  If a 4-byte utf-8 sequence was
supplied, it would generate 2 unicode characters which would overflow
the logical buffer.  This has been fixed in pyfribidi 0.11.
