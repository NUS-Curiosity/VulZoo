Can we also maintain a public database of upstream contacts? I seem to
remember a few different efforts to do this but can't find anything
current. This would save a ton of time. It would of course have to be
maintained (maybe a scheme like emailing the people listed every few
months and offering a "click here to confirm you're still the security
contact" and a "click here to be removed as the contact" to help keep it
up to date). Also things like PGP keys/etc would be nice to have in
this. It strikes me that this would actually be a valuable project for
Mitre, similar to CPE, maybe the "SCE" ("Security Contact Enumeration")?

As anyone trying to notify multiple upstreams knows, it can be a
horribly painful process.
