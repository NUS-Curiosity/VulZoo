Subject: Re: CVE request -- kernel: execshield: predictable
 ascii armour base address

Can someone explain to me why this is worthy of a CVE? I can see this as a
bug of course.  But a "vulnerability"?

This bug, by itself, does not cause a vulnerability. It just makes
vulnerabilities easier to exploit. I'm not sure this is worthy of a CVE
unless we're willing to assign CVEs to all fixed address allocations.
