Subject: CVE Request: ldm (LTSP display manager)

Could we please get a CVE assigned to the following issue?:

Starting with ldm 2.2.x, upstream switched to using wwm as a minimal window manager.
It was discovered that wwm ships with keybindings that allow spawning an xterm.

As the ldm greeter runs as root, this allows for a passwordless root shell.

Bug:

Commit:

Thanks,

Marc.
