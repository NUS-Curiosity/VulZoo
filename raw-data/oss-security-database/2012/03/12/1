Subject: Re: CVE Request -- LDAP Account Manager Pro / PhpLDAPadmin -- Multiple XSS flaws

Thank you for your reply and the ids, Kurt.

Since you didn't explicitly mention CVE identifiers
for phpLDAPAdmin, checking with you yet.

Can we consider the CVE-2012-1114, CVE-2012-1115
identifiers below to be valid also for phpLDAPAdmin code?

According to Roland's reply:
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/06/1

contains a reduced copy of phpLDAPAdmin's code.

Though we issue only one CVE identifier for the original
source code and can use that one also for projects, embedding
that source, not sure the current situation wrt to these
two is the correct one.

Roland, could you clarify, if phpLDAPAdmin code would be vulnerable
to all issues listed for LDAP Account Manager too or if phpLDAPAdmin
would be vulnerable only for XSS issues when processing:
i)   'export', 
ii)  'add_value_form'
iii)  and 'dn' variables?

And LDAP Account Manager would be vulnerable yet to additional
XSS flaws, due improper sanitization of 'filteruid', 'type',
and 'cmd' variables? (and these would be LDAP Account Manager
specific)

Because, if the latter is the case, I would propose the
CVE-2012-1114, CVE-2012-1115 identifiers to be used for phpLDAPAdmin
issues, and that we would assign new one for LDAP Account Manager
ones.

Any clarification here, which source code base is affected by
which issue exactly is appreciated.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Please use CVE-2012-1114 for these two issues (XSS, same reporter)

Please use CVE-2012-1115 for this vu;n (XSS, but different reporter)
