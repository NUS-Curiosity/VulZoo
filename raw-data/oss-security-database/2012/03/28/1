Subject: CVE Request: PolicyKit change allows users in "wheel" group to become
 root without a password

Hi.

Please assign a CVE to this issue.

An intended change in PolicyKit [1] version 0.103 [2] allows users of
the "wheel" group to become root without providing the root password.
While this was intentional, we believe it presents a security concern
for our users [3].
