Subject: dracut creates non-world readable initramfs images

Hi All,

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way dracut, an
initramfs root filesystem images generator, created initramfs images.

When the root filesystem contained sensitive information (password
based authentication for iSCSI systems or encrypted root filesystem
crypttab password information), an attacker could use this flaw to
obtain this information.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2012-4453

Reference:
