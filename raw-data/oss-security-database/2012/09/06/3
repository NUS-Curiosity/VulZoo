Subject: CVE-2010 Request -- blender: Insecure temporary file use by
 creating file string in undo save quit Blender kernel routine
 (re-occurrence of CVE-2008-1103)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

solution, performed management of 'quit.blend' temporary file,
used for session recovery purposes. A local attacker could use
this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, leading to ability
to overwrite arbitrary system file, accessible with the privileges
of the user running the blender executable.
