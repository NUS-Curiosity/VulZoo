Subject: CVE request - mcrypt buffer overflow flaw

I don't believe a CVE has been assigned to this, could one be?

A buffer overflow was reported [1],[2] in mcrypt version 2.6.8 and
earlier due to a boundary error in the processing of an encrypted file
(via the check_file_head() function in src/extra.c).  If a user were
tricked into attempting to decrypt a specially-crafted .nc encrypted
flie, this flaw would cause a stack-based buffer overflow that could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
