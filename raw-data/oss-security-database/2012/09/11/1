Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- JVM: heap memory disclosure (possibly
 various JDKs)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  an information disclosure flaw was found in the way certain
Java Virtual Machines (JVM) used to initialize integer arrays
(they have had nonzero elements right after the allocation in
certain circumstances). An attacker could use this flaw to
obtain potentially sensitive information.

References (including the reproducer, workaround and further details):
[1] http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7196857
[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=856124

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
