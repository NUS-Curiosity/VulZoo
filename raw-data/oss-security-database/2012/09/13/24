Subject: CVE request: DoS in OpenSLP

Quoting Secunia's report:

Georgi Geshev has discovered a vulnerability in OpenSLP, which can be
exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).

The vulnerability is caused due to an out-of-bounds read error within
the "SLPIntersectStringList()" function (common/slp_compare.c) when
processing service requests and can be exploited to cause a crash via a
specially crafted request.

The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.2.1. Other versions may also
be affected.

Could a CVE be assigned to this?  There is no upstream bug report or
patch that I can see.
