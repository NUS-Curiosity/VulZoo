They are of course welcome to ask for CVE's on distros@, just be aware
of the two week limitation (so ask as you get closer to a release).

http://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html

How to make a semi-private request:

If you have a semi-private issue (you want to notify vendors, but not
the entire world, giving time for it to be fixed) the easiest way to
do this is to email the distros@...openwall.org list
(http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros).

Please note that one of the list requirements is that issues be
embargoed (kept private) for 2 weeks at most (e.g. 14 to 16 days
depending on when during the week the email was sent). DO NOT SEND A
REQUEST TO THIS LIST IF YOU NEED MORE THAN 2 WEEKS TO ADDRESS AND
RELEASE THE ISSUE. The distros@ list is a private list consisting of
security teams for Linux and BSD distributions. No archives of this
list exist publicly at this time, although a time delayed archive may
be created at some point (delayed at least 14-16 days so embargoed
issues don't appear in the archives). The advantage of this list is it
allows you to easily co-ordinate a public release with the projects
most likely to ship your software (e.g. Linux and BSD vendors).

Time line: I generally respond to these within one business day, this
means you'll either get a CVE or a request for more information if the
request is not properly formatted or is unclear/missing details/etc.
