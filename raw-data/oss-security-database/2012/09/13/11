Subject: CVE Request -- libvirt: null function pointer invocation in
 virNetServerProgramDispatchCall()

It has been found that sending RPC message with an event as the RPC
number, or RPC number that falls into gap in the RPC dispatch table, can
lead to libvirtd accessing memory at page zero. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to crash libvirtd (DoS).

Proposed upstream fix:
