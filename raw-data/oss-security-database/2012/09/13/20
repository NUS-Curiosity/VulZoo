It's alway pretty annoying to try to fix CVEs in wordpress releases,
since they are usually allocated just on some release announcement, and
thus identifying specific commits is pretty hard. It'd be nice if
Wordpress security team could be in the loop since the beginning, it
might help a bit later (so adding them to CC: now)
