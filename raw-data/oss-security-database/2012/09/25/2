See Steve Christy's snowball post.  Again, I'm considering the
totality of the system.  Setting 644 as a default for gpg is I suppose
a step, but gpg is not the only application handling sensitive data.
If that is the case, then there are a whole lot of other applications
also not doing the right thing with your sensitive data including
those that pipe and redirect stdin/stdout.  Again, I don't know how to
make it any clearer, but I'm considering the broader implications, not
just gpg.  I still don't understand again why gpg is so special?

Best wishes,
Mike
