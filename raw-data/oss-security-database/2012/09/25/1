It's already a requirement, it's not complex.

I don't know what "propagate" means, it's supposed to put the permissions it
wants in the parameters to open, yes. I think you're re-inventing capability
systems, and are convinced that's what I want (I don't).

I would not argue any such thing, such capability systems are the domain of
academics ;-).

What I am saying is that if you want to create a file with 0644, you put
0644 in the arguments to open, not set it to 0666 and say "fix your umask".

I think you've confused my post with someone elses.
