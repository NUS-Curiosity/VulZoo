Subject: CVE Request - phpMyAdmin: PMASA-2012-5 incident

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  based on:
  [1] http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2012-5.php
  [2] http://secunia.com/advisories/50703/

looks (more from [1]): "One server from the SourceForge.net mirror
system was distributing a phpMyAdmin kit containing a backdoor,
allowing remotely to execute arbitrary PHP code."

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (I think it's appropriate)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
