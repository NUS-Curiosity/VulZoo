I suppose the permissions respect the user's umask so I do not think
this is a real security issue in the gpg itself. Although using the
permissions of the original file when creating the decrypted/encrypted
one (still modified with the user's umask) would be more appropriate. So
in my opinion this does not warrant a CVE but improvement in the
upstream gnupg code would be appreciated I think.
