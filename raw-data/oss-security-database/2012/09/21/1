Jenkins Security Advisory 2012-09-17

This advisory announces security vulnerabilities that were found in
Jenkins core and several plugins.

The first vulnerability in Jenkins core allows unprivileged users to
insert data into Jenkins master, which can lead to remote code
execution. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the attacker must
have an HTTP access to a Jenkins master, and he must have a read
access to Jenkins.

The second vulnerability in Jenkins core is a cross-site scripting
vulnerability. This allows an attacker to craft a URL that points to
Jenkins, and if a legitimate user clicks this link, the attacker will
be able to hijack the user session.

The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the
Violations plugin.

The fourth vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
the CI game plugin.

Several of these vulnerabilies were discovered by Avram Marius Gabriel.
Severity:

CloudBees rates the first vulnerability in the core as critical, as it
allows malicious users to execute arbitrary code on the server. The
othe three XSS vulnerabilities are rated as high, as they allow
malicious users to escalate privileges.
Fix:
The following versions incorporate fixes to the vulnerabilities found
in the Jenkins core.

    Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.482
    LTS users should upgrade to 1.466.2
    Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.466.x should upgrade to
1.466.2.1
    Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.447.x should upgrade to
1.447.3.1
    Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.424.x and earlier
should upgrade to 1.424.6.11
    The fix has already been deployed to DEV@...ud

Users of the CloudBees Custom Update Center plugin needs to update to
3.4 or later in order to work with these newer versions of Jenkins.

To patch vulnerabilities in the plugins, upgrade to the following
versions. These plugins should be available in your Jenkins' plugin
update center UI in up to a day.

    Users of the Violations plugin should upgrade to 0.7.11 or later
    Users of the CI game plugin should upgrade to 1.19 or later
