Subject: CVE-request: monkey CGI scripts executed without dropping
 RUID/RGID root

Hello,

Please assign 2012 CVE-identifier for following monkey vulnerability:

The Monkey webserver retains RUID/RGID root so that it can regain root as
needed to perform privileged operations. Unfortunately, monkey does not drop
RUID/RGID root before executing CGI scripts. This allows any user with write
access to a cgi-bin directory to gain local root. It would also allow a remote
attacker to do the same in combination with a CGI/PHP script that has any
remote code execution bug.

Reported by John Lightsey in http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=688008
Affected Debian-version is 0.9.3-1 (haven't tested upstream package)
