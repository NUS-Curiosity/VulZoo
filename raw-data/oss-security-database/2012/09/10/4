Subject: Re: CVE Request -- glibc: strcoll() integer overflow
 leading to buffer overflow + another alloca() stack overflow issue
 (upstream #14547 && #14552)

Hi Florian,

  thank you for the clarification.

Should the alloca() issue get CVE identifier, then I would rather use two
CVE identifiers. Though those issues might affect same glibc versions,
one is integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow, while
the alloca() one would be stack-based buffer overflow.

So to clearly identify, it would be better if the second one would be allocated
too (if Steve won't mind).

Kurt, could you allocate yet one then?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
