What complexity?

I'm not sure what you're talking about, when you invoke open() with O_CREAT,
you need to put the correct value in the third parameter. I don't know what
that has to do with propogation.

I cannot parse this argument, but "piping" is a very high level concept, and
of little relevance. We're talking about the third parameter to open when
O_CREAT is specified.

I think you mean 0666, which is what gpg is requesting. I'm pretty sure they
did not really intend for that, and so it should be updated to request what
they actually want.

I think you've misunderstood the problem, and it's trivial to solve.
