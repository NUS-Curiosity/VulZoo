Subject: Re: CVE Request -- urllib3: Does not check for SSL
 certificates by default

Steve,

  in relation to this one the following question has been
raised internally - it's OK to assign CVE identifier for
end user applications, proclaiming to perform SSL certificates
verification, but not doing that.

  But what about the libraries? Obviously urllib3 when instructed
to do so, performs the verification. The question is should it
get a CVE identifier or not? Could you clarify Mitre's opinion /
view on this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
