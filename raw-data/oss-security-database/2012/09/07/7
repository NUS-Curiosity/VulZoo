Subject: CVE Request -- urllib3: Does not check for SSL certificates by
 default

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  it was reported that urllib3, a Python HTTP library
with thread-safe connection pooling and file post support,
did not perform SSL certificates verification by default.
A rogue HTTP server could use this flaw to conduct
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

[3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=855320
    (the bug actually has python-requests in the summary,
     but only due the fact it contains embedded urllib3)

Patch applied by the Ubuntu Linux distribution:

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
