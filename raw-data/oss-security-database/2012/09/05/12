Subject: CVE Request: pidgin lack of SSL checks

Hi,

Beautiful rant... needs CVE I guess.
http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15308

Missing SSL checks in libpurples NSS SSL plugin allows MitM attacks.

(funny side note here is that gnutls 3.x is GPLv3 and effectively
 could taint any library/binary linking with it to be GPLv3 or newer.)

Ciao, Marcus
