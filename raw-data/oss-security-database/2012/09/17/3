I'm skeptical they will. I've been doing a lot of work for the past year on
various proactive security efforts. I keep coming back to two basic things.

1) Most people don't understand security (if they can learn is another
topic).
2) We suck at explaining security concepts.

Item 1 is solvable to a certain degree with training, but this particular
issue I bet is #2.

WE see why this is a problem and have trouble understanding why the PHP
guys don't. Has anyone tried to talk to them about this further to see if
the issue is they don't understand, or are they being stubborn?

I'm quite interested in this problem (the general communication issue, not
specially this PHP problem).

Thanks.
