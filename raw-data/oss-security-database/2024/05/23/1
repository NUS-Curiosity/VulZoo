Subject: Intel CPU Hardware Features and Behaviors Related to Speculative
 Execution

Intel has published a new summary of the various hardware features and
behaviors related to speculative execution in their processors, to reduce
the number of documents that OS makers and other software developers need
to read in order to make their software more secure when running on Intel CPUs.

You can find it at:
