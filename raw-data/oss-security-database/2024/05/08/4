                              version 3

    Linux/xen-netfront: Memory leak due to missing cleanup function

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In netfront, xennet_alloc_one_rx_buffer() failed to call the
appropriate clean-up function, resulting in a memory leak.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest userspace process can exhaust memory resources
within the guest kernel, potentially leading to a guest crash (Denial
of Service). It is not known whether it can be triggered remotely.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems with guests running Linux 5.9 and later with Xen PV network
devices are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

For HVM guests, using emulated network devices will avoid this issue.

RESOLUTION
==========
