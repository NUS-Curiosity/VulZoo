Subject: Re: Microsoft Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) in Linux efivars directory

Hi,

Corey's message is confused and there's no indication in it whether the
system was compromised, so that part doesn't need further discussion,
but as a moderator I don't mind someone explaining Linux's (and other
systems') exposure of the EFI variables and DFCI and what it means for
security as well as what it does not.

That's normal.

No reason to think so.

That's probably because they were in use.  That's normal.
