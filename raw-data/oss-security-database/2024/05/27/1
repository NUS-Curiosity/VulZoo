 out-of-bound writes when writing escape sequence

Hello all,

Although very late, here is a follow up explaining the impact of the 
vulnerability.

Provided that you can force an application to convert a partially 
controlled buffer to ISO-2022-CN-EXT, you get an
overflow of 1 to 3 bytes whose value you don't control.

This can be triggered in at least two ways in PHP:

- Through direct calls to iconv()
- Through the use of PHP filters (i.e. using a "file read" vulnerability)

Due to the way PHP's heap is built, you can use such a memory corruption 
to alter part of a free list pointer,
which can in turn give you an arbitrary write primitive in the program's 
memory.

With this bug, any person that has a file read vulnerability with a 
controlled prefix on a PHP application has RCE.
Any person that can force PHP into calling iconv() with controlled 
parameters has RCE.

We have provided more explanations on a blogpost of ours (I do not think 
that I can post it here, it shouldn't be too
hard to find if you're interested).

Best regards,
Charles
