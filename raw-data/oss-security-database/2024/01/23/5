it seems there is some inconsistency in the affected / fixed versions 
mentioned here, in [1] as well as in the following part of the CVE entry 
[2]:

 > affected from 0 through 3.0.3

While [3] doesn't list this CVE yet it seems 3.0.3 is the actual fixed 
version as [4] mentions a relevant entry around an XSS in a "Dashboard":

 > #21822 fix(dashboard): Prevent XSS attack vector (@agl-developer)

which links to [5] as the relevant PR.
