I always find it lacking when CAP_NET_ADMIN is mentioned but without specifying
if it is the capability in the initial user namespace or any user namespace.

That is relevant for Ubuntu since it allows unprivileged creation of user
namespaces by default making it a PR:L instead of a PR:H attack, using CVSS
parlance.

I suppose it is relevant for other distros and systems as well, so worth noting
that this is important information.
