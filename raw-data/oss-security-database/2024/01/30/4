Hi,

Since the issues are not specific to one downstream distro, yes, it is
appropriate and desirable to have this information in here.  Thank you!

However, two things can be done better on further occasions: actual
vulnerability information should be included in the message body (not
only links) and the Subject line should explicitly say Linux when
referring to the Linux kernel (since this list isn't only about Linux).

This says:

"NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in openEuler kernel on Linux
(network modules) allows Pointer Manipulation. This vulnerability is
associated with program files net/sched/sch_cbs.C. This issue affects
openEuler kernel: from 4.19.90 before 4.19.90-2401.3."

This mainline commit is from 2019, "net/sched: cbs: Fix not adding cbs
instance to list".

This says:

"Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability in openEuler kernel on
Linux (filesystem modules) allows Forced Integer Overflow.This issue
affects openEuler kernel: from 4.19.90 before 4.19.90-2401.3, from
5.10.0-60.18.0 before 5.10.0-183.0.0."

2022, "ext4: fix kernel BUG in 'ext4_write_inline_data_end()'"

So the concern is that upstream longterm 4.19.y and 5.10.y (and perhaps
some others) may still be affected.

The above links don't say anything about attack vectors and required
access - I guess CAP_NET_ADMIN and raw block device write (e.g., to a
USB flash drive on another computer), respectively, are the
prerequisites?  The CVSS scores look exaggerated, especially NVD's score
of 7.8 for CVE-2021-33631.
