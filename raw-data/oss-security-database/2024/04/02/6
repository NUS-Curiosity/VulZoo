Subject: CVE-2024-1597: PostgreSQL pgjdbc: SQL injection in non-default
 configuration

###
##	Summary
###
On the 21st of February 2024 a security advisory for the JDBC driver of 
PosgreSQL was published [1].
Which states: "SQL injection is possible when using the non-default 
connection property preferQueryMode=simple in combination with 
application code that has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value."
Corresponding fixes were published at the 19th of February 2024.

###
##	Severity
###
The severity is critical with a CVSS score of 10 but several conditions 
must be met for successful exploitation.

Quote from [1]:
To exploit this behavior the following additional conditions must be met:

     A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a 
minus (i.e. -)
     There must be a second placeholder for a string value after the 
first placeholder on the same line.
     Both parameters must be user controlled.

###
##	Example from [1]
###
PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT -?, ?");
stmt.setInt(1, -1);
stmt.setString(2, "\nWHERE false --");
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();

The resulting SQL when operating in simple query mode would be:

SELECT --1,'
WHERE false --'

and the result after the fix applied:

SELECT -('-1'::int4), ('
WHERE false --')
