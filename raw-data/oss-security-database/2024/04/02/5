Along similar lines, I've been analyzing other packages to see if I can
find similar fragments to those used in the stage0, stage1, stage2
loaders from the xz-utils backdoor:

https://github.com/hlein/distro-backdoor-scanner

tl;dr: did some scans, more to come, nothing found yet; help add patterns.

I'll quote my own README here:

###

The toolkit used for the xz-utils backdoor is far too sophisticated to
be a first draft. Were there earlier iterations of this, that shared
some things in common but were slightly simpler, injected into other
projects? Can we detect the style/"fist" of the author elsewhere? Moreso
the delivery mechanics than the contents of the extracted+injected
malicious .so.

These scripts unpack the source packages for all of a distro repo's
current packages, then scan them for content similar to the malware that
was added to xz-utils.

Running over the unpacked source trees of ~19k Gentoo packages and ~40k
Debian packages gives a manageable amount of results (~hundreds of
hits), digestable by a human. So far the only confirmed malicious
results are... from the backdoored xz-utils versions.

There need to be more search patterns, among other things; see TODO.

###

Working on some submitted patches and adding Rocky Linux support ~today.

Thanks,
