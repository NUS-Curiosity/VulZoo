Subject: CVE-2024-31309: Apache Traffic Server: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames
 can be utilized for DoS attack 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Traffic Server 8.0.0 through 8.1.9
- Apache Traffic Server 9.0.0 through 9.2.3

Description:

HTTP/2 CONTINUATION DoS attack can cause Apache Traffic Server to consume more resources on the server.  Version from 8.0.0 through 8.1.9, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.3 are affected.

Users can set a new setting (proxy.config.http2.max_continuation_frames_per_minute) to limit the number of CONTINUATION frames per minute.  ATS does have a fixed amount of memory a request can use and ATS adheres to these limits in previous releases.
Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 8.1.10 or 9.2.4 which fixes the issue.
