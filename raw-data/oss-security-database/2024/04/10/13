 for, reading xz.git

I do not think that oss-security is a good location for an identity witch hunt, 
this feels like the wrong place.

Anyway, none of those timestamps are validated, they just come from git. Any 
even slightly competent security agency is going to have obscured them, so 
analysis of them likely just directly plays into their hands.

Slightly more difficult (although of course not impossible) to obscure is the 
actual time of work based on time of receipt by other parties, but I certainly 
wouldn't do analysis on unverified timezones.
