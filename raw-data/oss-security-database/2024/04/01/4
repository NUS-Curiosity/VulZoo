Subject: Re: From xz to ibus: more questionable tarballs

I don't understand what are your issues.
However I recommend to use the my uploaded files likes
https://github.com/ibus/ibus/releases/download/$VERSION/ibus-${VERSION}.tar.gz
instead of GitHub generated tar.gz and zip files from the git tag.
The target translatable strings per release are included in
https://github.com/ibus/ibus/blob/main/po/ibus10.pot
