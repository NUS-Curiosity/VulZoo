Hi Michael,

I believe there may be a duplicate report for freeimage that you should be
aware of. You can find it at the following link:

https://github.com/Ruanxingzhi/vul-report/tree/master/freeimage-r1909

The linked report includes CVE-2024-28562, CVE-2024-28563, CVE-2024-28564,
CVE-2024-28565, and more up to CVE-2024-28584.

Best regards,
Tianyu Chen
