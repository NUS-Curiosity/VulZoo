Subject: Buildroot: incorrect permissons on /dev/shm

Buildroot is a Linux distribution and system builder for embedded
systems.  Starting in Buildroot 2011.08, its default /etc/fstab
included an entry for /dev/shm with incorrect permissons (sticky bit
not set). (CWE-276)

Buildroot 2017.08 removed this entry for systems using systemd, and it
has never been included for systems using OpenRC.  So this only
affects Buildroot-built systems that use sysvinit, and some older
systems that use systemd.

Ben.
