As I can find, these just started arriving in July 2021.  And that was
appreciated.  Now I merely suggested how to do it a bit better.

That's not the outcome I wanted, especially not knowing who would setup
and maintain said automation.  We do have an outstanding task to create
some tools for this sort of automation, but no one approached it yet and
it's meant to help prepare drafts for manual posting, so there would be
some per-message work anyway.

So please continue these postings as-is for now, and we'll hopefully be
adding follow-ups with the actual content like I did.  You could also
want to start including the Markdown files in nodejs-sec postings, so
simply forwarding them in here would do what's desired, but that's your
call indeed.

BTW, the previous update (for February) somehow wasn't sent in here.
Per my off-list suggestion, an oss-security contributor later sent a
detailed report:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1

but we're not sure we'll do it each time.

Thanks,

Alexander
