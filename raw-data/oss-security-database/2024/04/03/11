Your message was borderline off-topic for the oss-security list, where
we have explicit guidelines against posting conference CFPs and survey
questionnaires.  A common pattern with those was that someone external
(not normally participating on oss-security) tried to post them and then
did not intend to post anything actually helpful - which could be e.g.
relevant excerpts from the conference papers such as those disclosing
new security issues in specific Open Source projects.  Now such
attempted postings became rare, perhaps in part due to the published
guidelines and past rejects.

Invites to other kinds of studies are not explicitly discouraged, and
yours sounds like it can potentially benefit Seccomp usability, so (as a
list moderator) I let it through.

Now it's on you to also bring the results of this study to oss-security
and in a way most beneficial to the community.  This may be e.g. a list
of identified issues, how/where they were reported upstream, how you (or
your team) contributed to addressing them, how they (or any of them)
were actually addressed, and what remains to be done.

I am posting this reply publicly to let list members know where we
currently draw the line and that relevant excerpts from conference
proceedings/slides and relevant study results are desirable to post.

Thanks,

Alexander
