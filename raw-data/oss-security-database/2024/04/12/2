Notice that my previous analysis on YuriiCrimson's exploits is their
ExploitGSM_6_5 version.
I cannot make the ExploitGSM_5_15_to_6_1 version work in the latest
kernel in my test environment. However, this does not rule out the
possibility that it still works.

And the splash of the ExploitGSM_6_5 exploit is attached to the email.

Thanks,
Kyle Zeng
