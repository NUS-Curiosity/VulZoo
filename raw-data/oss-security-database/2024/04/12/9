It's confusing because there are two layers of eval involved. You 
actually end up running:

   sed rn ...

The "r" command means "read from file"; but there's no file named "n", 
so this is no-op.

The sed command is not completely equivalent to cat though: it appends a 
newline, because the original file didn't end with one. This trailing 
garbage slightly upsets xz(1):

     xz: (stdin): Unexpected end of input

(You normally wouldn't see this warning, thanks to generous use of 
"2>/dev/null" in build-to-host.m4.)
