Hey.

There's even an allegedly "wontfix" bug of mine where I requested that
Debian switches back to a secure default and disables user namesapce which
have a long history of being exploitable:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1012547

Don't think the current hole one will have been the last one.

Unfortunately it seems a feature that only a group of people will need is
valued more important than keeping users secure. :-(

Regards,
Philippe
