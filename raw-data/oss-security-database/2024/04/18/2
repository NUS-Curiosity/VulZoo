Subject: libreswan: IKEv1 default AH/ESP responder can crash and restart

Hello,

I noticed I missed a few CVEs on libreswan recently as the project is
not posting them here, I subscribed to their announce mailing-list to
monitor that for work, and thought I could try to follow and post them
here when there are new things. That being said, here is the latest one:

Vulnerability information
=========================
The function compute_proto_keymat() did not handle unexpected proposals
for which the keymat size is 0, such as AES-GMAC which can be used only
with NULL encryption.  The function ends up calling an assertion failure
routine. No Remote Code Execution is possible.
