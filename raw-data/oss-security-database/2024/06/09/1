Subject: vte 0.76.3 released with fix for CVE-2024-37535

https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37535 states:

> GNOME VTE before 0.76.3 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service 
> (memory consumption) via a window resize escape sequence, a related issue
> to CVE-2000-0476.

https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2786 explains further:

> The ANSI escape sequence "e[4;;t" can be used to resize the terminal
> window, where "" is the height and ""is the width. By providing a
> large number such as 65535 for both values will lead to a local denial
> of service, where the whole machine can be frozen.
> 
> This same vulnerability found was in XTerm back in 2000. The CVE for
> the vulnerability in XTerm is CVE-2000-0476
> 
> Steps to reproduce:
> 
>     Open gnome-terminal
>     Execute printf "e[4;65535;65535t" in the terminal
