Subject: Linux non-security almost non-issue: stack-out-of-bounds Read in profile_pc

Hi,

On Friday, we got a report CC'ed to s@k.o and linux-distros (which is a
misuse of linux-distros per the currently published instructions, don't
do that) of what turned out to be not a security issue and already
public.  I am posting about it in here not to make an exception that
we'd need to explain anyway.  Just for consistency and transparency.

The corresponding public report from March is:

As Vegard Nossum pointed out:

and then it's just a harmless out of bounds read that is only detected
in KASan builds.

Nevertheless, Linus promptly fixed the issue by dropping this code in:

   093d9603b600 ("x86: stop playing stack games in profile_pc()")
