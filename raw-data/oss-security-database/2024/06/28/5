https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/b0a2f8a5365f2eec3e27d78907de9f9d2c80505a
give this info for the issues assigned CVEs:

> In gss_krb5int_unseal_token_v3() and gss_krb5int_unseal_v3_iov(),
> verify the Extra Count field of CFX wrap tokens against the encrypted
> header.  Reported by Jacob Champion.
> 
> In gss_krb5int_unseal_token_v3(), check for a decrypted plaintext
> length too short to contain the encrypted header and extra count
> bytes.  Reported by Jacob Champion.
> 
> In kg_unseal_iov_token(), separately track the header IOV length and
> complete token length when parsing the token's ASN.1 wrapper.  This
> fix contains modified versions of functions from k5-der.h and
> util_token.c; this duplication will be cleaned up in a future commit.
> 
> CVE-2024-37370:
> 
> In MIT krb5 release 1.3 and later, an attacker can modify the
> plaintext Extra Count field of a confidential GSS krb5 wrap token,
> causing the unwrapped token to appear truncated to the application.
> 
> CVE-2024-37371:
> 
> In MIT krb5 release 1.3 and later, an attacker can cause invalid
> memory reads by sending message tokens with invalid length fields.
