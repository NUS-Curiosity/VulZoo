Closed Github Issues / Pull Request Activity
Reputation Farming Using Closed Github Issues / PRsCVE ID (if applicable):

none
Description:

Maintainers have reported in discussions on OpenSSF's Slack suspicious
activity in OSS repositories especially in Github against closed issues and
Pull Requests.  This includes commenting or approving on these closed
items.  This can lead to the accounts at question being able to pad their
Github account reputation by seeming to have contributed to those projects.

Reputation farming may seem benign, but in the wake of a number of recent
incidents, OSS maintainers are recommended to have increased awareness of
anyone attempting to gain trust illegitimately.

TTPs/IoCs (if applicable)

    -

    Long-closed and approved Pull-Requests and issues being approved again
    or commented on by users who are not members or contributors to projects
    -

    Non-contributors with no real involvement in projects show seemingly
    significant involvement in OSS projects

Recommended Actions:

    -

    Monitor repository activity and report users who take part in this
    behavior
    -

    Lock old issues / pull requests / discussions
    -

       -


       https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#prevent-comments-by-locking-the-discussion
       -

       Github actions exist to do this automatically after a set period of
       inactivity

Known to be actively exploited?

Yes for reputation farming, further use of this for attacks unknown
