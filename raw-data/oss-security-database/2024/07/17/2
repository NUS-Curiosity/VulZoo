Subject: CVE-2024-29737: Apache StreamPark (incubating): maven build params
 could trigger remote command execution 

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache StreamPark (incubating) 2.0.0 before 2.1.4

Description:

In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4

Background info:

Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the "Build Argument". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character "`". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.

In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.
