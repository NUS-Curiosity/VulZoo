So it turns out this was because the patch addressing CVE-2024-26621
(4ef9ad19e17676b9ef071309bc62020e2373705d) did so using CONFIG_32BIT which is
(perhaps surprisingly) *not* defined on IA-32.

d9592025000b3cf26c742f3505da7b83aedc26d5 was recently merged to Linus tree
switching to !IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_64BIT) which should work on all architectures.
So ASLRn't *should* be fixed on IA-32 kernels with 6.11.
