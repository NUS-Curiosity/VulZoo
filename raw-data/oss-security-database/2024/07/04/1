Hi Yves-Alexis, all,

An interesting idea!

We also agree: the glibc's snprintf() only calls malloc functions if the
format string specifies positional parameters or floating points, which
is not the case in sshd's SIGALRM handler.

We double-checked this on Debian 12.5.0 and confirmed that the SIGALRM
handler does not call any malloc function anymore if "-e" is used.

Perhaps surprisingly (given the above) we advise against this mitigation
in the general case: unlike the "LoginGraceTime 0" mitigation, this "-e"
mitigation still calls the SIGALRM handler, which has a long and complex
history in sshd, so there is no guarantee that this mitigation is also
safe for other distributions or versions of sshd.

Thank you very much for your kind words! With best regards,
