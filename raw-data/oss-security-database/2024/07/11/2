All three of us are Fedora developers - but AIUI, we will not and can not use
membership here to contribute Fedora patches - until the embargo is
over.

For Hyperscale itself we plan to use the head start to have local builds
ready to go, and commit and do a public build as soon as the embargo is
over; if it needs collaboration we can use private Git repos and E2EE
private chats to discuss the fix among ourselves.

This is, to the best of my knowledge, similar to how AlmaLinux handles
embargoed security issues - the fix is ready to go but is only made
available once the embargo is lifted.

Now - wearing our Fedora hats, we certainly would try and help get this
fixed in Fedora once the embargo is over (as we've done before) - and
knowing a CVE is going to be made public would certainly help (e.g.
trying to make sure one of us is around) - but we won't be participating
in the list wearing our Fedora hat, or discuss embargoed issues with
people not on the list.

So... if this works for Hyperscale, we could potentially discuss with
other Fedora developers about having Fedora itself be represented in
linux-distros. Something to bring up at Flock! There's already some
discussion of this in the Fedora Security Matrix room w.r.t. last week's
OpenSSH CVE.
