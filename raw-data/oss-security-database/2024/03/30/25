Also if there's anything the community can do for Lasse personally, please
pass that along.  Anyone can be the victim of social engineering.  The
critical moments always look obvious in retrospect, but it's impossible
for humans to be sufficiently paranoid to catch the signs 100% of the time
and still function in society.

I suspect many of us here have had nightmares about being in Lasse's
position, and probably will have more of them in the future.
