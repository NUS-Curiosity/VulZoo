I am currently checking out the RISC-V test files. They were updated around the same time as the others.

You can just use 'sed r\n filename' and it should work. I think it just reads the file and appends a newline.

Extracting it can be simplified to:
sed r\n $(grep -aErls "#{4}[[:alnum:]]{5}#{4}$" .) | tr "\t \-_" " \t_\-" | xz -d 2>/dev/null

Where the grep finds bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz

As for the extra code in 5.6.1, I think because the greps are for some specific bytes they are meant for 1 or 2 specific test files that don't actually exist yet, but might've been uploaded later. Using grep, the right offsets are found, and this is then read, translated, decompressed and executed. The translation is the same for both.

There is already some discussion on #tukaani on Libera.

I also joined your channel.

My mail client had format=flowed enabled so my list of test files by Jia was malformed, but here they are again (without the summaries).

Which means there's transformations I'm missing and those could as well mutate some of the test files or resulting payloads. So it could either change the grep itself, or create files that match the grep.
