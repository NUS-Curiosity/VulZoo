Yeah, but your acceptable compromise *must* include Canonical having
advance knowledge of backdoors, correct?

There are a lot of other users and organizations out there, and I think
most of them also like having some agency, I know I do. If our roles
were reversed -- my organization was on distros and yours was not -- do
you think you would still be arguing for embargoes on backdoors?
