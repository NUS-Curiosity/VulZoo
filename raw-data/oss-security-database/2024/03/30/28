Okay, you could unsubscribe from distros to help make the embargo stronger? :)

Yes! If you have knowledge of *any* software that is backdoored or
compromised or is being actively exploited with a 0day, I'm advocating
-- please -- for you to make that public.

This applies to literally *any* software, hardware or other product.

Yes, I think it's wrong.

I think maybe you're saying that if I was on the list, then I would like
embargoes too!

It's definitely better for the organizations on the list, no question.
As you know, I was a distros and vendor-sec member for years, so I do
know how they work :)
