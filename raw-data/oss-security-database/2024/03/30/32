Note that this is not a mirror of the adversary controlled git repo on
Github but a mirror of https://git.tukaani.org/xz.git which is
controlled by the original maintainer according to
https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/. (And that repo is still there, too,
even if it gives a 403 Forbidden when accessed with a web browser. You
can still "git clone" from it.)

BTW, both repos miss that most recent commit on Github by the adversary
with the now infamous "simplification of SECURITY.md".

		Kind regards, Axel
