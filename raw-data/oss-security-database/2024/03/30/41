Wait, do you really mean SSH keys verified by certificates issued by a
(usually internal, SSH-specific) certificate authority (CA) for a key?

See e.g.
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Certificate-based_Authentication
what certificate-based authentication in SSH actually means.

From my experience certificate-based SSH authentication (i.e. those
algorithms with *-cert-* in their names) is rather rare, while simple
public key authentication (where you just put your according pubkey
into .ssh/authorized_keys) is very common.

Can you clarify if you really meant that solely certificate based
authentication (with certificates issued by a CA) triggers that code
path or if you actually meant all sorts of public key based
authentication in general?

		Kind regards, Axel
