imho: For such things and "random" relevant findings it might make
sense to have some simple feed of affected program/thing, short
description and url(s), maybe as simple table and rss feed? adding new
lines from the cli with a post request is all I need I guess. So the
info doesn't get lost, but it also doesn't make a chaos on the list.
