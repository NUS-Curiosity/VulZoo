Subject: Re: GnuTLS 3.8.4 released, fixes CVE-2024-28834 & CVE-2024-28835

One thing that may be of interest to this group: Will found
CVE-2024-28835 by running the x509-limbo test suite against gnutls.
x509-limbo is a set of test cases that can be used to test x.509 path
building implementations against a variety of edge cases (inspired by
wycheproof). The tests are at https://github.com/C2SP/x509-limbo

Cheers,
Alex
