Subject: help wanted - bring more issues in here

Hi,

We have this contributing back task not requiring (linux-)distros
membership:

https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back

Administrative tasks mostly unrelated to (linux-)distros lists (but
relevant to the wider community)
[...]
3. Monitor for Open Source security issues/topics published elsewhere,
identify which of these would fit, and bring them to oss-security -
primary: Oracle Solaris, backup: vacant

Alan Coopersmith of Oracle Solaris does a good job at this task.  Thank
you, Alan!  However, this task needs more than one person's involvement.
I'd appreciate it if others volunteer for it as well - both a second
distro (as you can see, that spot is now vacant) and anyone else who's
capable and willing to help.

I'd also appreciate volunteers for just the third sub-task.  I happen to
notice many "Open Source security issues/topics published elsewhere" and
"identify which of these would fit", but I rarely have time to write
them up for posting to oss-security.  So if some of you volunteer for
producing proper self-contained oss-security posting out of references
to issues published elsewhere, I could simply be forwarding the links
and raw material to you, for you to process and post.  In some cases,
this can be as simple as extracting a posting from another mailing
list's archive, with proper attribution and including a link too.  In
other cases, it's trickier.  I'll provide initial guidance.  Anyone?

I guess many others in here also often come across more issues suitable
for oss-security, and also don't have time.  So assuming that enough
people volunteer for the third "process and post" sub-task, please feel
free to also volunteer for the first two sub-tasks.

Thanks,

Alexander
