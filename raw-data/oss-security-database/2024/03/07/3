Unresolved Vulnerability in OpenStack Murano

### Summary ###
A severe security vulnerability in all versions of the Murano
service will be disclosed at a later date. Murano is an inactive
project[*], so no fix is currently under development for this
vulnerability. It is strongly recommended that any OpenStack
deployments disable or fully remove Murano, if installed, at the
earliest opportunity. This security note will be amended at the time
of public disclosure to include further details and context, but
action should be taken as soon as possible in order to minimize the
risk it poses.
