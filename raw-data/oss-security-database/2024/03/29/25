Thanks, a compromise is better than nothing :) I think I would have
argued for immediately discussing this in the open.

There are lots of actions possible without any official guidance from
vendors, and sometimes hours can make a difference. I don't think it's
fair to characterize that as panic.

This is true with any vulnerability, there is always the possibility an
attacker is already aware of it. They could respond to a patch being
released by trying to extract as much value from their exploit before
it's worthless.

I'm not convinced that's a good argument to delay making the patch available?

The trade-off here is we're delaying everybody elses ability to react.
I worry they might want a delay to patch the systems they care about
first.

Perhaps if a representative had said the feds request a few hours
because they're deploying a helicopter full of agents to make an arrest,
well okay, that's more convincing :)

Sure, but this could have been done in the open on oss-security, right?
