I think we should have a policy that if issues are suspected to be actively exploited, that the issue goes public immediately.  If even there is no patch or mitigation, there's not a lot of benefit to keeping it private.

I think everyone was acting in good faith here and did great work, but there wasn't a clear policy for handling this type of issue.

I very much agree that there's very little benefit to limiting the number of folks that know what's going on when someone is actively taking advantage of an issue.
