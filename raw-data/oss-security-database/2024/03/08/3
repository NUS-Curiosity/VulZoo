Hi,

So far, I only heard from Katherine Mcmillan (and suggested a first task
to her off-list).  Any other volunteers, please?

BTW, for quoting web page content, I use ELinks in a terminal window set
to width 80 (and arbitrary height), and use "Save formatted document"
from there.  Then in the resulting text file, review the list of links
at the end and remove duplicate and irrelevant ones.  (Some of this can
later be automated, if we do it a lot.)  The text file can then be
either included in the message body (but you need to clearly distinguish
it from your own writing) or attached (as text/plain, please).

I think we don't need a different coverage aka lower threshold (but yes,
speaking up can change that).  I think there are still many issues and
news above the current threshold that are not getting reported in here.

As to lower overall severity issues, such as those in some project's
obscure third-party plugins, I think it'd be good to have regular
digests on those, like it's already being done for Jenkins plugins, not
per-issue messages.  So if anyone keeps track of e.g. WordPress plugin
or npm module issues (Alan's examples above) and is willing to produce
digests, please feel free.

Thanks,

Alexander
