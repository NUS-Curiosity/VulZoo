Related to this, I've submitted an RFC patch for a document (aimed at
distributions) describing how to assess kernel patches for security
impact and indirectly proposing a way to reduce the workload:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240311150054.2945210-2-vegard.nossum@oracle.com/

I wanted to share the link here as 1) some distributions may not have
seen the original posting, and 2) it may be of some general interest to
others on here.

If you have feedback, please reply to the linked thread.

Thanks,


Vegard
