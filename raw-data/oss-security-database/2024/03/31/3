In particular, people shouldn't be able to push blobs to projects without some form of checking of the blobs.

I hope this spurs efforts to create better tools and follow software
practices that might make it easier to spot this kind of thing. I wouldn't
be surprised if there are other commonly-used tools that already are
compromised but don't have performance issues that have yet led someone
down the "that's funny" path that leads to easy discovery.
