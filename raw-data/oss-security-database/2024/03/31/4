Closer look at "Jia Tan" commits show that he/they disabled the Linux
landlock sandbox. Lasse Collin is doing
good work to audit the commits and I wish Github would reinstate his
github account.

commit f9cf4c05edd14dedfe63833f8ccbe41b55823b00 (HEAD -> master,
origin/master, origin/HEAD)

    CMake: Fix sabotaged Landlock sandbox check.

    It never enabled it.

After using git blame:
328c52da8 (Jia Tan       2024-02-26 23:02:06 +0800 1004) .

Pulling out git show:

commit 328c52da8a2bbb81307644efdb58db2c422d9ba7
Author: Jia Tan <jiat0218@...il.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 26 23:02:06 2024 +0800

    Build: Fix Linux Landlock feature test in Autotools and CMake builds.

    The previous Linux Landlock feature test assumed that having the
    linux/landlock.h header file was enough. The new feature tests also
    requires that prctl() and the required Landlock system calls are
    supported.


The code to weaken the sandbox was shipped in the 5.6.1 version.
