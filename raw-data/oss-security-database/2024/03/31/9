I just learned that this approach is favored by systemd upstream:

The libselinux concern is important.  I've just checked a few systems
where libsystemd does pull liblzma, and on those libselinux does not.
However, I guess such systems do exist too?  PAM modules would have been
too late for the current backdoor, but the backdoor could be different
if that were the vector it needed to target.

"libsystemd git dropped the dep on liblzma" is this pull request:

"Dynamically load compression libraries #31550"

Merged on March 5 (with a follow-up build fix on March 6).

Maybe this prompted the bad actors to act quicker.
