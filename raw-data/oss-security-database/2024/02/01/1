Subject: Re: runc: CVE-2024-21626: high severity container breakout attack

Hello Aleksa,

Thank you and others you credit for doing much more than fixing the
immediate issue, and for disclosing this in so much detail.

What's setcwd(2)?  Perhaps you meant something else?

For reference, here are the threads you started on CVE-2019-5736 and its
exploit back in 2019:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/11/2

In one of the messages:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/13/1

you mentioned having sent your "AT_THIS_ROOT patchset to LKML -- which
allows userspace processes to block resolution of magic links."  What's
the current status of this effort, and does/would it help against this
new issue?

Alexander
