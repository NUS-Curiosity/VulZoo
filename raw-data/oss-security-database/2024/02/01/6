Relaying *MTAs* do not usually verify the certificate of the server
they connect to. When they do, it creates problems because MTA
certificates are very often self-signed. IIRC Yahoo relays in
particular used to have this problem (or still do?)

It is true that MTAs are not usually written in Python :-) So maybe
the proposal is OK. But there's a general point to note here, namely
not all protocols are the same wrt TLS.
