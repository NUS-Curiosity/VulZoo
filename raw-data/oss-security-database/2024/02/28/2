Subject: CVE-2024-22857: Heap Based Buffer overflow in zlog library

Hi,

We have found a vulnerability in zlog that is essentially a heap-based buffer overflow leading to denial of service and arbitrary code execution.

We have been trying to contact the maintainer of this project for almost three months and haven't received any response. Additionally, we have reserved a CVE number with MITRE (CVE-2024-22857) and now we intend to publish it.

We have a working PoC that provides code execution, along with a detailed blog regarding this vulnerability (which, of course, remains unpublished).


Regards,
Ali Raza
