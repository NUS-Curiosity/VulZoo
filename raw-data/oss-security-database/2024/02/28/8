Thank you for bringing this to oss-security.  Normally, we expect
postings to include actual vulnerability detail right away, but I
understand the circumstances here are different.

I found that you also brought this up in:

https://github.com/HardySimpson/zlog/issues/250

and I've just posted some comments to there.  It appears that zlog
author Hardy Simpson is currently mostly inactive on GitHub and with the
project - only one contribution in a year (on December 4).  However,
another person was merging pull requests recently, so maybe they can
help, as I am asking in a comment I posted.

Please remember to add the full vulnerability detail in a reply to this
oss-security thread on the same day that the same information is made
public elsewhere (e.g., in a GitHub pull request).

Please also do this soon (e.g., in a couple of weeks from now) even in
case communication with project maintainers doesn't start or fails, so
that distros and users have a chance to know the risk and patch the
issue on their own.

Thanks,

Alexander
