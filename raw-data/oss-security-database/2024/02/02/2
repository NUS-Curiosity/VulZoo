The API is the key issue for me.  Cabal CAs can forge certs anytime
they want anyway.  Ideally, the API would support PKCS#11, but more
importantly, IMO, there should be a simplified API where it defaults
to "trust the CABAL", but there is a callback to "veto" certs. E.g.
"only trust CA-X for these domains" would be something easy to
understand and implement in a callback.
