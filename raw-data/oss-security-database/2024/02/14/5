Hi Mate,

I'm not sure if I understand everything correctly, but if UEFI Secure
Boot is enabled, shouldn't the shell.efi binary need to be explicitely
signed in order for it to be correctly loaded? It doesnt look like a
good idea to sign shell.efi on a production platform, but for test
purposes it might be relevant.
