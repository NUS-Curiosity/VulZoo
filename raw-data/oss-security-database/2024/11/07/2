Shouldn't that behavior be treated as an xargs implementation bug or at
least shortcoming, and fixed as such?  I hope POSIX doesn't require it?

In other words, if the input stream to "xargs -0" doesn't end in a NUL,
xargs must not process the last maybe-partial string.  I've just checked
GNU findutils xargs (not the latest version, though) and it does have
this problem - something we'd want to fix?

This reminds me, a specific example given was:

The "-l" option would make grep print relative pathnames.  Presumably,
that would then be processed by some other program.  However, we have
the problem with potential linefeed characters embedded in filenames.
For this, GNU grep also has the "-Z" option, to output a NUL-delimited
stream, and the other program should expect that (e.g. via "xargs -0",
or directly support that kind of input).

So a command like that could be rewritten e.g. as:

grep -lZirF test . | xargs -r0 otherprogram --
