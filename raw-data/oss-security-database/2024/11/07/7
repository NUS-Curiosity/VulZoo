As I'm sure you know, standards workgroups tend to operate in accordance 
with a charter that bounds their work.  These vary widely depending on 
circumstances and the chartering organization(s), but it's not uncommon 
for projects - POSIX being one of those -to be set up to standardize 
existing practice to provide incentive for various implementations not 
to end up diverging from such practice without good reason. It's a 
little harsh to characterize operating in accordance with one's charter 
as "pretty unfortunate".
