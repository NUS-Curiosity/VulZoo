I think the source for the CISA-ADP data is at [1]. For this specific CVE, the relevant file would be [2]. Their readme has a section at the bottom, where they encourage feedback:

Iâ€™m aware of at last one prior case where a similar case of (IMHO) overblown CVSS scores was discussed in an issue on this particular GitHub project [3].

Somebody seems to already have opened a ticket for this CVE, too: [4]
