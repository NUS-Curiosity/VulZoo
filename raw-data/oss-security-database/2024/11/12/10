Is this unconditional (perhaps because the relevant data gets zeroed out
by the shim), or does it only apply when the PV guest can't extract data
from the shim's memory?  For instance, 32-bit PV guests aren't security
supported anymore, but the PV shim isn't supposed to rely on the
security of the shim itself, only of the rest of the system.
