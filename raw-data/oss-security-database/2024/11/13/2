SECURITY-3447 / CVE-2024-52549
Script Security Plugin 1367.vdf2fc45f229c and earlier, except
1365.1367.va_3b_b_89f8a_95b_ and 1362.1364.v4cf2dc5d8776, does not perform
a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the
existence of files on the controller file system.


SECURITY-3362 / CVE-2024-52550
Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 3990.vd281dd77a_388 and earlier, except
3975.3977.v478dd9e956c3, does not check whether the main (Jenkinsfile)
script for a rebuilt build is approved.

This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to rebuild a previous
build whose (Jenkinsfile) script is no longer approved.

NOTE: This does not apply to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script was never
approved, but only to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script got its approval
revoked.


SECURITY-3361 / CVE-2024-52551
Pipeline: Declarative Plugin 2.2214.vb_b_34b_2ea_9b_83 and earlier does not
check whether the main (Jenkinsfile) script used to restart a build from a
specific stage is approved.

This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to restart a previous
build whose (Jenkinsfile) script is no longer approved.

NOTE: This does not apply to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script was never
approved, but only to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script got its approval
revoked.


SECURITY-3010 / CVE-2024-52552
Authorize Project Plugin 1.7.2 and earlier evaluates a string containing
the job name with JavaScript on the Authorization view.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.


SECURITY-3473 / CVE-2024-52553
OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 4.418.vccc7061f5b_6d and earlier does
not invalidate the existing session on login.

This allows attackers to use social engineering techniques to gain
administrator access to Jenkins.


SECURITY-2954 / CVE-2022-46751
IvyTrigger Plugin 1.01 and earlier bundles versions of Apache Ivy
vulnerable to CVE-2022-46751.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for the "IvyTrigger -
Poll with an Ivy script" build trigger to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML
document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the
Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.


SECURITY-3466 / CVE-2024-52554
Shared Library Version Override Plugin 17.v786074c9fce7 and earlier
declares folder-scoped library overrides as trusted, so that they're not
executed in the Script Security sandbox.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission on a folder to
configure a folder-scoped library override that runs without sandbox
protection.
