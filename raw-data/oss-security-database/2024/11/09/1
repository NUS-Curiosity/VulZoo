This is known since even earlier by the article/disclosure „unix wildcards
gone wild”:
https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/136

The original article link seems to not work but it can be seen e.g. here:
https://github.com/Gandosha/gandosha.github.io/blob/master/DefenseCode_Unix_WildCards_Gone_Wild.txt

It shows that in some cases this can lead to code execution, e.g. with „tar
*”
