However, many programs do *not* use getopt or getopt_long to process arguments.
Many programs support "--", but "not* all do,so using "--" as the sole countermeasure
requires careful review of every command's documentation.

I urge always using "./" to prefix wildcards if the first character is a wildcard,
e.g., "./*.pdf", because this ALWAYS works.

The "-print0" and "-0" options have been widely implemented, but
POSIX 2024 finally formally adds them. So I urge using them where they
make sense, as they counter embedded linefeed characters in filenames.

I think something like this is a good idea, hopefully it'd be an option that could eventually
be standardized. I think "./" should be prefixed if the first character is a wildcard,
so that the resulting filenames will be consistent.

A simpler approach would be to simply forbid creating filenames that
include control characters or begin with "-". If you're doing that, also consider
an option requiring UTF-8 for new filenames. The current
situation makes it unnecessarily hard to write secure programs.
I wouldn't call supporting such filenames a "security vulnerability" exactly,
but they make developing secure software harder, and nothing *requires*
that we (as an industry) support them. POSIX never guaranteed such
filenames were allowed, and even has an error code for bad filenames.

Long ago I wrong a really long essay about POSIX filename issues.
