Well, to be fair the shell already does exactly this if you do

grep text ./*

No current shells are permitted to do it at all, if they are POSIX sh
compatible -- POSIX mandates a specific outcome:

https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_13_03

* cannot match the directory separator, it is not an option that
implementations are allowed to be flexible on, unless the shell
implements an opt-in mode such as bash's "globstar" that explicitly asks
for non-POSIX behavior. The issue then would become that no one would
remember or bother to set it, even if they wanted it. :)
