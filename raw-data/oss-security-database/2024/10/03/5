I reported this as https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-rq86-c7g6-r2h8 last week, and in the edits at the top (by upstream, above the Summary heading) it looks like they did not want (or did not consider) to request a separate CVE for this. Please do coordinate with them if you decide to go ahead with this request.

(I did notice, and can see value in, Will Dormann's suggestion in the other thread that it might make sense to have more fine-grained CVEs for this collection of problems.)
