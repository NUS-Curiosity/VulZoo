Subject: CVE-2024-46911: Apache Roller: Weakness in CSRF protection allows
 privilege escalation 

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Roller 1.0.0 before 6.1.4

Description:

Cross-site Resource Forgery (CSRF), Privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache Roller. On multi-blog/user Roller websites, by default weblog owners are trusted to publish arbitrary weblog content and this combined with a deficiency in Roller's CSRF protections allowed an escalation of privileges attack. This issue affects Apache Roller before 6.1.4.

Roller users who run multi-blog/user Roller websites are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.4, which fixes the issue.
