Subject: CVE-2024-45693: Apache CloudStack: Request origin validation
 bypass makes account takeover possible 

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache CloudStack 4.15.1.0 through 4.18.2.3
- Apache CloudStack 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1

Description:

Users logged into the Apache CloudStack's web interface can be tricked to submit malicious CSRF requests due to missing validation of the origin of the requests. This can allow an attacker to gain privileges and access to resources of the authenticated users and may lead to account takeover, disruption, exposure of sensitive data and compromise integrity of the resources owned by the user account that are managed by the platform.

This issue affects Apache CloudStack from 4.15.1.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1



Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue.
