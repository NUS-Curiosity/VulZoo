Legacy is a long tail and there is a big difference between 
communications on the open Internet and support for archaic protocol 
versions to talk to older devices on a LAN.  Disabling support by 
default is one thing; removing it entirely is another and much more serious.

A user may have an older browser around, the page may also be available 
via plain HTTP (very likely if the server is that old), or the search 
engine might offer a cached copy.  For a specific crawler that could 
have use for this scenario, consider the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.

Presumably that "older version of OpenSSL" would be unmaintained, which 
means that it is likely to accumulate known exploits over time.  This 
could be *very* bad for an asset enumeration tool or security scanner 
that could encounter a malicious server that insists on an old protocol 
version in order to exploit that older library and crack the scanner host!
