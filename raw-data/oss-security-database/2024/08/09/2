It's not just hard, for TLS it's pretty much impossible.  The collision
attacks against SHA-1 have been chosen-prefix and very much offline which you
can't do with TLS.  Even then, it's only the handshake which uses SHA-1, the
rest uses HMAC-SHA1 which, even for MD5, is still secure.  Finally, TLS < 1.2
uses MD5+SHA1 in combination, which no-one has found an actual attack on yet.
So in this case TLS 1.2 is actually weaker than TLS 1.1.

There's also the issue I cover in:

http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/bollocks.pdf

which is really about quantum cryptanalysis but also covers other attack
types.
