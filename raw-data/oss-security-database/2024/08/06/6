Subject: CVE-2024-42222: Apache CloudStack: Unauthorised Network List
 Access 

Severity: critical

Affected versions:

- Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0

Description:

In Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0, a regression in the network listing API allows unauthorised list access of network details for domain admin and normal user accounts. This vulnerability compromises tenant isolation, potentially leading to unauthorised access to network details, configurations and data.

Affected users are advised to upgrade to version 4.19.1.1 to address this issue. Users on older versions of CloudStack considering to upgrade, can skip 4.19.1.0 and upgrade directly to 4.19.1.1.
