Subject: feedback requested regarding deprecation of TLS 1.0/1.1

OpenSSL is currently considering the deprecation of the TLS 1.0/1.1
protocols.  Currently TLS1.1 and TLS 1.0 are disabled at run time, and
requires enablement by reducing the ssl security level value.

The current proposal under consideration is to explicitly disable TLS
1.0/1.1 at build time, in our 4.0 release (tentatively scheduled to release
in the next 12-18 months), with an eye to completely remove the impacted
code in a future major release.  The default configuration could be
overridden to re-enable TLS 1.0/1.1 at build time.

Questions to the community are:

1) Are distributions/users comfortable with this approach in the time frame
proposed?

2) Would builders of OpenSSL consider using the default configuration (with
TLS1.0/1.1 disabled in 4.0), or would they ship with these protocols
re-enabled in their builds?

3) If the deprecated protocols are re-enabled, what would constitute a
reasonable warning mechanism to inform users that these protocols are going
away at some point in the future to pressure users to update to a newer,
more secure protocol?

Input on these questions is requested and appreciated
