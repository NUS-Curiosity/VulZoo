Subject: Re: Tracking down a lost CVE request (MITRE)

MITRE is not required to assign CVEs.

It is always best to work with upstream (if possible). MITRE is more
likely to respond if upstream replies to your email ticket ACKing the
CVE request. Otherwise, you may want to ask Red Hat's CNA to assign a
CVE [0].

Upstream has already agreed that this is a vulnerability in their fix
commit message [1], so assignment should be easy to justify to either
group if you provide the commit link as a reference.

Note that upstream's publication of a fix is now considered Public
Disclosure according to the CVE Program [2].

[0] https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program
[1] https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/ndoutils/commit/18ef12037f4a68772d6840cbaa08aa2da07d2891
[2] https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary#glossaryPubliclyDisclosed

p.s., This does not apply here, but if MITRE *had* assigned a CVE and
ignores a request, a dispute could be brought to the CVE Program's
Secretariat (who works for MITRE).
