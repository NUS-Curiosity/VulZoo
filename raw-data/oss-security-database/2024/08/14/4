I'd appreciate it if the nginx project starts posting these in here, but
meanwhile I'm forwarding.

Subject: [nginx-announce] nginx security advisory (CVE-2024-7347)
From: F5SIRT via nginx-announce <nginx-announce@...nx.org>


A security issue was identified in the ngx_http_mp4_module, which might allow an attacker to cause a worker process crash by using a specially crafted mp4 file (CVE-2024-7347). The issue only affects nginx if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module (the module is not built by default) and the “mp4” directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the attack is only possible if an attacker is able to trigger processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.
 
The issue affects nginx 1.5.13+.
The issue is fixed in 1.27.1, 1.26.2.
 
Patch for the issue can be found here: https://nginx.org/download/patch.2024.mp4.txt
 
Thanks to Nils Bars for the initial report.
