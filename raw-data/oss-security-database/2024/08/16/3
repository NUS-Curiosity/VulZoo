Subject: Heads-up: there are two versions of Intel microcode update IPU 2024.3

(I mistakingly wrote 2023.4 instead of 2024.3 in my previous e-mail, 
hopefully filtered by moderation)

Intel initially published the IPU 2024.3 microcode release on August 13th.

But since, after it was reported that one of the blobs which should have 
been updated hadn't [1], they force-pushed the master branch and re-did 
the release without creating a minor release [2].

So if you packaged the initial release, you probably want to get 
yesterday's update now, despite the version hasn't changed.
