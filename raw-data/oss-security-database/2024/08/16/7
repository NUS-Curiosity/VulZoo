Subject: AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) semi-final results from DEF CON 32 (2024)

All, FYI:

DARPA and ARPA-H are running a research competition called the "AI Cyber Challenge" (AIxCC).
Its goal is to create automated tools that find and *fix* vulnerabilities in software.
General information is here: <https://aicyberchallenge.com/>

The AIxCC semifinal competition was last week at DEF CON 32 (2024).
All competitors were given an identical set of Challenge Projects, which were
real-world OSS projects seeded with synthetic vulnerabilities.
The projects were Jenkins, Linux kernel, Nginx, SQLite3, and Apache Tika.
There were 7 winners; each winner received $2 million US as a reward, and those
teams will be allowed to compete in the finals at next year's DEF CON.

An official summary is here: <https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2024-08-11>.

One of the competing teams, Team Atlanta, even found a real-world bug in SQLite3.
This was reported to SQLite through their usual process; it's fixed in trunk. More info
about that specifically is here:

- <https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/81670d1056>

The tools must be released by next year as open source software, with an OSI-approved license,
as a condition for accepting prize money or competing in the final competition. Exact text is in the
"Open-Source Requirement" section in its rules <https://aicyberchallenge.com/rules/>.
The challenge problems were all based on real-world OSS, and the
hope is that in the long term such tools can automatically find & fix vulnerabilities in all
software including OSS.

Full disclosure: I work for the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and I
have been working with DARPA & ARPA-H supporting this. That said, I thought others in this mailing
list would want to know about it. No research is *guaranteed* to produce something
leading to useful results, but I think this is a promising approach. We definitely could *use*
tools that automatically find & fix vulnerabilities, if they're good enough!!
