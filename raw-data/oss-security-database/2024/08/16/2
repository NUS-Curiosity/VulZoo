That actually raises another question:  what is actually to be gained 
from deprecating TLS1.0/1.1?  Did the protocol significantly change or 
is the only major difference new cipher suites?

In other words, what non-trivial code paths would dropping TLS1.0/1.1 
entirely allow removing?  (Concatenating SHA1+MD5 is trivial.)

While DSA is definitely obsolete (advances in conventional computing 
have begun to approach the ability to plausibly solve 1024-bit keys, and 
DSA keys *MUST* be 1024-bit, supposedly to facilitate smartcard 
implementations), OpenSSL is also a general cryptographic library and 
applications can use its primitives for other purposes.  In particular, 
this means that dropping TLS1.0/1.1 cipher suites does *not* mean you 
can drop the ciphers that were used in those suites.
