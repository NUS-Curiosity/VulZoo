There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.

The email module didnâ€™t properly quote newlines for email headers when serializing an email message allowing for header injection when an email is serialized.

Please see the linked CVE for the latest information on affected versions:

* https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6923
* https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/122233

The original bug report stated:

> If a parsed email header contains a correctly quoted newline, setting an
> email header to that value will include a newline.
> 
> from email import message_from_string
> from email.policy import default
> 
> email_in = """\
> To: incoming+tag@...example.com
> From: External Sender <sender@...m.example.com>
> Subject: Here's an =?UTF-8?Q?embedded_newline=0A?=
> Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
> Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
> MIME-Version: 1.0
> 
> <html>
> <head><title>An embeded newline</title></head>
> <body>
>   <p>I sent you an embedded newline in the subject. How do you like that?!</p>
> </body>
> </html>
> """
> 
> msg = message_from_string(email_in, policy=default)
> msg = message_from_string(email_in, policy=default)
> for header, value in msg.items():
>     del msg[header]
>     msg[header] = value
> email_out = str(msg)
> print(email_out)
> 
> Output is:
> 
> To: incoming+tag@...example.com
> From: External Sender <sender@...m.example.com>
> Subject: Here's an embedded newline
> 
> Content-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"
> Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
> MIME-Version: 1.0
> 
> <html>
> <head><title>An embeded newline</title></head>
> <body>
>   <p>I sent you an embedded newline in the subject. How do you like that?!</p>
> </body>
> </html>
> 
> An email parser will interpret the newline as the start of the message.
> In this case, the Content-Type and other MIME headers will not be
> processed, and the email treated as plain text. In other cases,
> required headers like To may not be processed and the email will not
> be delivered.

A later update noted:

> On further investigation, a plain string with a trailing newline has this issue:
> 
> email["Subject"] = "string with newlines\n"
> 
> So the "re-use parsed header" is not part of the issue.
