Hallo.  (I presume.)

Ok, here you got me.  I would have to (actually a little bit of
re-) read the entire TLS specification 1.1 (2246) in order to give
some useful answer.  Ie, whether the non-HMAC usage of MD5/SHA-1
in TLSv1.1 is used in a way that is truly problematic, or whether
they exist in data blocks that are protected by other means,
protected by the stream cipher or signed by a key that anyway has
to be verified via private/public key cryptography.
I never read 5246, just downloaded it an hour ago to read the
referenced appendix.  (Not a network expert etc.)
