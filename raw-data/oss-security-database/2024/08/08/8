 |There is a TLS record version, and a TLS protocol version. The record

 |1.2, and TLS 1.2/TLS 1.3.

 |TLS record version and TLS protocol version are _not_ a range of
 |min/max. They are discrete versions of the protocol for the underlying

Ok -- i was talking about the actual OpenSSL interface in
question, like SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(3), and -- much much
more so! -- the wonderful SSL_CONF_CTX that i as an application /
library programmer can "pass through" to users, via the much
beloved SSL_CONF_CMD(3ssl), so that they can interact with the
*SSL library directly, via strings.  (And there is "MinProtocol".)
