Subject: 	[Security-announce][CVE-2024-8088] Infinite loop when iterating over 
zip archive entry names

There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile" module.

When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods of 
"zipfile.ZipFile" like "namelist()", "iterdir()", "extractall()", etc) the 
process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted zip archive. 
This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting the contents of the 
zip archive. Programs that are not handling user-controlled zip archives are not 
affected.
