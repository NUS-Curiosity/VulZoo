Subject: gh:facebook/rocksdb v9.5.2 - SupplyChainAttackPoC for Meta BB

Around 2024-08-21, the following tag appeared:
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/releases/tag/v9.5.2

The GitHub release is titled "v9.5.2 - SupplyChainAttackPoC for Meta
BB". This might be an an extremely unlucky choice of a release label, a
joke, or what it sais it is. The two previous tags claimed in the
release notes were not pushed.

 From the archive pages I see the short commit for this tag changed from
d1826fb to a7e70f9.

Similarly the cached preview images, and possibly the github internal
title, seem to changed in the 14 minutes timestamp diff between two
social media posts:

The diff points to a fat-fingered release that missed some changes and
was quickly corrected.

Violates at least the principle to never reuse release numbers or make
changes to public tags. Let's not do that. The only other thing I saw
that the project stopped using the meta git bot not so recently. That's
all I know.
