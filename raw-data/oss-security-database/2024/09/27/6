This seems like a plausible and precise description for a vulnerability.

Yet the actual CVE entry is "cups-browsed bugs and other bugs can 
combine, leading to info leak and remote code execution"
<https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/blob/07723f33d3792d747b650a873346400ca5dc2034/cves/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47176.json#L15>
and several unrelated CWEs are listed.

Isn't using a single CVE to capture what can happen when multiple 
vulnerabilities are chained together... frowned upon?
