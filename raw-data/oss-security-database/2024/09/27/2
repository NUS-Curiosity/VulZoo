I don't believe this is how distro security teams saw it. Once a
vulnerability is leaked embargo no longer exists. In this case, the
original disclosure report was fully leaked online. Since the embargo
was broken and PoCs were posted, certainly nobody would want the
originally agreed to coordinated release date (CRD) of October 6th to be
kept. The intention of holding to a same day CRD (20:00 UTC) was to
stage the available patches for release and limit impact.
