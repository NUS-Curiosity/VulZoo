Subject: Webmin UDP/10000 discovery service Loop DoS (COK-2024-05-05)

Webmin is a web-based system administration tool for Unix-like servers, and
services with about 1,000,000 yearly installations worldwide.

Webmin/Virtualmin use a UDP service discovery, usually running on port
UDP/10000. This service responds to any UDP request with the IP address and
port on which the control panel is available.

This behavior can be used to implement a Loop DoS attack (CVE-2024-2169
etc) by sending udp packets with spoofed source ip:port using other Webmin
instance IP-andreess that can lead to endless traffic exchange between
hosts, Denial of Service (DOS) and/or abuse of resources.

Fix:
Users are recommended to upgrade to version Webmin 2.202, Virtualmin 7.20.2
which fixes the issue.

Workaround:
Block UDP/10000 the service for access from the Internet.
