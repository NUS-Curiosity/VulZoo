 user email addresses

Hi Alexander,

First of all, thank you very much for your feedback.

Because *Gravatar recommends using sha-256*, we believe there must be a
reason for its modification. Since the official recommendation is to change
the encryption method, why not implement it according to the official
requirements? You must admit that sha-256 is more difficult than md5, even
if only slightly. Although this may not completely solve the problem, I
believe following the official recommendation would be marginally better,
wouldn't it? So I think this fix itself is acceptable.

Best regards,
LinkinStar
