Subject: CVE-2024-42154: Linux kernel: tcp_metrics: validate source addr length

Hello security team!

I'm working on a medical product actually and have trouble about the CVE-2024-42154. It is regarding NETLINK socket which can be used only locally, but it is classified with "NETWORK" flag. NETWORK flag is annoying because it means more difficult to justify the CVE.

I already ask the NIST why the NETWOKR flag was set for this CVE, they answer me that it's linked to socket and without more public reference they are just setting the NETWORK flag, in case of.

Can I ask you your opinion about this CVE and the pertinence of the NETWORK flag here?

Thanks for any feedback,
Regard
Joel
