Subject: CVE-2024-46544: Apache Tomcat Connectors: mod_jk: local users can
 view and modify configuration

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:
- Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.9-beta through 1.2.49

Description:

Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability in Apache Tomcat Connectors 
allows local users to view and modify shared memory containing mod_jk 
configuration which may lead to information disclosure and/or denial of 
service.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors: from 1.2.9-beta through 
1.2.49. Only mod_jk on Unix like systems is affected. Neither the ISAPI 
redirector nor mod_jk on Windows is affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.50, which fixes the issue.
