Subject: CVE-2020-8608 QEMU: Slirp: potential OOB access due to unsafe
 snprintf() usages

   Hello,

A out-of-bounds heap buffer access issue was found in the SLiRP networking 
implementation of the QEMU emulator. It occurs in tcp_emu() routine while 
emulating IRC and other protocols due to unsafe usage of snprintf(3) function.

A user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the host 
resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the 
QEMU process on the host.
