There's always the "Full Disclosure" list (URL forgotten, but 
http://lists.grok.org.uk rings a bell).

Their policy is simple: provide ample warning, then disclose the bug; the 
problem is that Big Corporations brush off a bug report with "We're 
working on it" and actually do nothing, because fixing bugs takes time 
and money.  Funny how quickly a bug is fixed when it's published...
