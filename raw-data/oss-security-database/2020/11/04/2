Subject: sddm: CVE-2020-28049: local privilege escalation due to race
 condition in creation of the Xauthority file

Hello list,

a local privilege escalation has been discovered in the sddm display
manager [1].

sddm passes the -auth and -displayfd command line arguments when
starting the Xserver. It then waits for the display number to be
received from the Xserver via the `displayfd`, before the Xauthority
file specified via the `-auth` parameter is actually written. This
results in a race condition, creating a time window in which no valid
Xauthority file is existing while the Xserver is already running.

The X.Org server, when encountering a non-existing, empty or
corrupt/incomplete Xauthority file, will grant any connecting client
access to the Xorg display [2]. A local unprivileged attacker can thus
create an unauthorized connection to the Xserver and grab e.g. keyboard
input events from other legitimate users accessing the Xserver.

A simple reproducer works like this:

```
# run this from an unpriliged account before sddm is started to exploit
# the race condition and kill the X server
inotifywait /tmp/.X11-unix; while ! xkill; do :; done
```

The security issue was discovered by our SUSE sddm package maintainer
Fabian Vogt. The issue is included in sddm since version 0.12.0 and
was recently fixed in a new upstream release 0.19.0. The upstream commit
fixing this issue is found in [3]. The SUSE bugzilla bug tracking this
issue is found in [4].
