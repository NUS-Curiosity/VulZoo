I share the same problems.

We’ve taken to a mix in Gentoo:

1) Automated import of RSS feeds (but this isn’t that fit for human consumption, especially with the large dumps of various corporate appliance CVEs every so often);

2) I maintain a list of announcement mailing lists to read: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Sam/Security/Release_announcements. I skim announcements for security-related notes. But this doesn’t help if upstream is inactive;

3) I subscribe to *other* distros’ security announcement mailing lists to help reduce the chance of missing anything;

4) I check the Twitter @CVENew feed ~regularly;

5) Repology (https://repology.org/) has the ability to say if it thinks a package is vulnerable. It’s not 100% accurate (it can’t be), but it helps;

6) Of course, subscribe to this list (and linux-distros);

7) Subscribe to other security-related mailing lists like fulldisclosure.

There’s probably some other ways that I’m not thinking of right now. I’m still relatively new to the game so any tips are really welcome too.
