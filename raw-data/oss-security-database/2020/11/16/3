My guess is that there was an assumption that if an email with a
vulnerability was sent to this list, someone would do the CVE filing for
them. Looking through my archives, there are times where someone posts a
vulnerability and miraculously someone says shortly "Please use
CVE-2XXX-YYYY for all future announcements." If you aren't on the lists all
the time or know that various groups do this full time, there is no clue
that there was some sort of extra work done to get that number... it just
looks like it was done as a service. When a person posts a vulnerability
and then gets no extra emails.. then it looks like a secret society. "Oh
you forgot to shake Smooge's hand with your middle finger hooked and your
pinky out... can't give you a CVE"
