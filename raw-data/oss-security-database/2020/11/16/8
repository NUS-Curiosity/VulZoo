We (Ubuntu security team) have weekly role rotations among the team. The
person on CVE triage duty will use our tooling to download

https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems.xml.gz
https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-recent.json.gz
https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2020.json.gz
https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2019.json.gz
etc

We also pull from Debian's security team:
https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker.git

We collect CVEs from this list using local mboxes.

We collect CVEs from Red Hat's security announce list:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhsa-announce/
and oval feeds:
https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2/RHEL8/

Having a variety of inputs gives us some resiliency when one or another
service is offline for whatever reason,

I hope this helps.

Thanks
