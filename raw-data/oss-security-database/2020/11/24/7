I'd like to note that the issue affects pam_unix module only,
those who use other authentication modules instead of pam_unix
are not effected.

Nevertheless, Linux-PAM 1.5.1 is going to be released shortly
to address this issue.

Just for the record, the bug was introduced by commit
https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/commit/af0faf666c5008e54dfe43684f210e3581ff1bca
and fixed by commit
https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/commit/30fdfb90d9864bcc254a62760aaa149d373fd4eb
