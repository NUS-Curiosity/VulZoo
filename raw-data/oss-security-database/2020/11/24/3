Subject: Heads up: PAM 1.5.0 has a auth bypass under some conditions

Hi,

(via IRC, spotted by Foxboron)

PAM 1.5.0 had a potential auth bypass, if a user did not exist and the root password was
empty (but root locked down).

The reporters usecase was spammers pretending to be unknown users with a PAM enabled dovecot.

This issue affected only pam 1.5.0.
