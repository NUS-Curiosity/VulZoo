SUSE has an internal ticket system like tool that fetches from various
sources:

- NVD
- SUSE Bugzilla
- Oracle CPU CVRF feeds
- Redhat, Canonical trackers

And presents this as ticketstyle input.

We have assigned engineers going through all incoming ones, reviewing,
associating packages, codestreams and products, and CVSS v3.1 ratings in this
tool and opening Bugreports in our Bugzilla for our packagers.

Without some ticketing system like tooling you will not be able to keep up
these days.

Ciao, Marcus
