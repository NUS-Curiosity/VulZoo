Subject: CVE-2020-29129 CVE-2020-29130 QEMU: slirp: out-of-bounds access
 while processing ARP/NCSI packets

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the SLiRP user networking 
implementation of QEMU. It could occur while processing ARP/NCSI packets, if 
the packet length was shorter than required to accommodate respective protocol 
headers and payload. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to potentially 
leak host information bytes.

Upstream patch:
