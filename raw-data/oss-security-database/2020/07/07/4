 cache write-back under VT-d

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-15565 / XSA-321
                               version 3

                 insufficient cache write-back under VT-d

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them
require flushing of both TLBs.  Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent,
and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs CPU cached also needs writing
back to memory after changes were made.  Such writing back of cached
data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into
smaller granularity ones.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to
frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another
purpose.  Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege
escalation cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected.

Only x86 Intel systems are affected.  x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are
not affected.

Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), having a
passed through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing
enabled can leverage the vulnerability.  Note that page table
sharing will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and
CPU large page size support compatible.

MITIGATION
==========

Suppressing the use of page table sharing will avoid the vulnerability
(command line option "iommu=no-sharept").  Note however that as of Xen
version 4.13 there's also a respective per-guest control ("passthrough="
libxl guest config file option).  If any guests have been created with
an explicit setting here, this setting may conflict with the addition of
the "iommu=no-sharept" Xen command line option.

Suppressing the use of large HAP pages will avoid the vulnerability
(command line options "hap_2mb=no hap_1gb=no").

Not passing through PCI devices to HVM guests will avoid the
vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Roger Pau Monn√© of Citrix.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that unlike implied by the numbering, the patches here are intended
to go on top of XSA-328's.

Note also that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
