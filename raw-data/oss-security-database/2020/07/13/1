Thank you, we will make it.

Actually, we are glad to make it for some customers are also pay
attention on these official web pages. We suppose it will be easy to
make it through the "notify a vulnerability publication
<https://cveform.mitre.org/>". But after I submitted the request I just
get a reply as "This CVE ID has been reserved by the CNA Hackerone and
we are currently waiting on them to submit the details." Seems only "the
CNA Hackerone" can make it. I have no idea on how to notify the "the CNA
Hackerone " to push it. :-(  Anyway, if possible we are glad to make it.


Thanks

Xiao
