Most of the above is once again too specific to the given CVE ID,
whereas we need a general understanding of whether the task Xiao
proposes and volunteers for is worthwhile or not.  I'd appreciate a
direct answer to that.

Do I interpret this paragraph correctly as implying the answer is no? -

In other words, CNAs receive their reminders from MITRE weekly, so
there's no need for anyone else reminding them, correct?  However, can
it happen that MITRE wouldn't recognize a CVE ID as "Reserved But
Public", continuing to treat it as merely reserved, in which case there
would be no reminder to correct that?  Could Xiao help with this?
