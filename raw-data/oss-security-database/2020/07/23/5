Quite some overlap with (linux-)distros in the approach you use to
pre-public-disclosure handling of security issues, indeed.  One notable
difference is you don't appear to have a maximum embargo time.

Oh, as I understand from your e-mail signature, Alban is one of your
company's directors.  If so, I do find it convincing for Flatcar Linux's
membership that one of your directors has personally contributed to
security vulnerability discovery and handling.

Such contributions are relevant, too.

Great.  Ubuntu already signed up as primary for this task, so Flatcar
can be backup.

This one already has both a primary and a backup.  So unless you choose
another second task for you (that doesn't already have two distros
signed up for it), you'll initially be just a backup for "Check if
related issues exist in ... other software", which is fine.

I don't understand this comment and its relevance, but nevermind.

OK.  It looks like we'll add Flatcar as soon as an existing member
vouches for you.
