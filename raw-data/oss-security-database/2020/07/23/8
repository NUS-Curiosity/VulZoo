So I'm no longer affiliated with Vincent since he's left Red Hat and I'm not
affiliated with flatcar at all.  We loosely worked together at Red Hat and I'll
certainly vouch for Vincent.

I'm not sure how long I've been on oss-security, but I was the primary designer
and implementor of the stack-clash mitigations for GCC and consultant for the
LLVM stack-clash mitigations, as well as Red Hat's lead on the compiler side of
spectre mitigations.

Hope that helps,
Jeff
