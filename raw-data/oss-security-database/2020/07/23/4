For sure.
While I personally have been near the core of a couple of distributions, I
never was involved in the contributing-side with oss-security or vendor-sec.
2 months ago I joined the Kinvolk team, and now squarely involved in this
aspect.
As for security disclosure overlap, there will now be a decent overlap with
an operating system component being containers. As I facilitate and lead
the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) security list, which hosts code like
runc, specifications and API definitions for container registries.

Alban Crequy (CC'ed) who is on the team has had interactions (which
pre-date flatcar):
https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/722
https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/4

Otherwise, the majority of contributions are involved in the respective
upstreams of the projects.

Yeah, no worries! We can begin immediately with:
* Check if related issues exist in implementations of similar functionality
in other software
* Promptly review new issue reports for meeting the list's requirements and
confirm receipt of the report and, when necessary, inform the reporter of
any issues with their report

The number of packages in distro is drastically reduced, and we'll be on
this.

Pat operates at his time. :-)
I was not heavily involved on this team at RH, but am asking there and a
few others as well.
