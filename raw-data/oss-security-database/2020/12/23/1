I tried to get a CVE for OVE-20201118-0001 by using the
"new" form at https://cveform.mitre.org/ on 2020-11-18 but
was told by MITRE that "the reported vulnerabilities would
fall in the scope of Red Hat for assignment" and that their
mail should be forwarded to secalert@...hat.com.

I did that on 2020-11-18 using the OpenPGP key recommended at:
https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact

On 2020-11-23 I received a response from Red Hat claiming
that my e-mail had "no body".

The same day I replied with an unencrypted mail explaining
that the previous mail was OpenPGP-encrypted and asked whether
that was still supported.

As a result I was informed that "INC1525130" "has been resolved".

As of today I still haven't received a CVE and thus did
not bother to request CVEs for the other issues fixed in
Privoxy 3.0.29 ...
