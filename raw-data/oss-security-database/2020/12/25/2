Subject: More CVE request experience (Fwd: Automatic reply: [EXT] Need a CVE for Crypto++)

The form at https://cveform.mitre.org/ is broken. Emailing
cve@...re.org for a CVE assignment after the failed web submission
results in this.

I hope people do not see the drop in CVE submissions as an improvement
in software quality.
