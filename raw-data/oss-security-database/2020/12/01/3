Multiple input validation failures in X server XKB extension
============================================================

These issues can lead to privileges elevations for authorized clients
on systems where the X server is running privileged.

* CVE-2020-14360 / ZDI CAN 11572 XkbSetMap Out-Of-Bounds Access

Insufficient checks on the lengths of the XkbSetMap request can lead to
out of bounds memory accesses in the X server.

* CVE-2020-25712 / ZDI-CAN-11839 XkbSetDeviceInfo Heap-based Buffer Overflow

Insufficient checks on input of the XkbSetDeviceInfo request can lead
to a buffer overflow on the head in the X server.

Patches

Patches for these issues have been committed to the xorg server git
repository. xorg-server 1.20.10 will be released shortly and will
include these patches.
