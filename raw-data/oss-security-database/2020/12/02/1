Subject: Some mitigation for openssh CVE-2020-14145

Hi,

We reviewed the openssh CVE-2020-14145 and the openssh team commited
a partial mitigation of this issue which is included in openssh 8.4.

https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=b3855ff053f5078ec3d3c653cdaedefaa5fc362d

I filed a CVE update request to include above.

That said, "key/certificate pinning on first connect" is still tricky.

Ciao, Marcus
