Subject: CVE-2020-17533: Apache Accumulo Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions

Description:

Apache Accumulo versions 1.5.0 through 1.10.0 and version 2.0.0 do not
properly check the return value of some policy enforcement functions
before permitting an authenticated user to perform certain administrative
operations. Specifically, the return values of the 'canFlush' and
'canPerformSystemActions' security functions are not checked in some
instances, therefore allowing an authenticated user with insufficient
permissions to perform the following actions: flushing a table, shutting
down Accumulo or an individual tablet server, and setting or removing
system-wide Accumulo configuration properties.

This issue is being tracked as https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1828

Mitigation:

Upgrade to Apache Accumulo version 1.10.1, 2.0.1, or later.
