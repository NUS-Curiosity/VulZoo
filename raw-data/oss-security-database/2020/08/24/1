Subject: CVE-2019-20794 kernel: task processes not being
 properly ended could lead to resource exhaustion

Hello Team,

Red Hat has identified a vulnerability with the following details.

A flaw was found when a user with PID namespace mounting a FUSE filesystem,
If the userspace component is terminated (pid 1), this results into a
denial of service (DoS) problem. This internally makes the fuse requests go
into Uninterruptible state until the system is rebooted.


'CVE-2019-20794' was assigned via MITRE.
