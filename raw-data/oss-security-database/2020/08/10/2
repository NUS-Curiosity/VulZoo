Hmm. Is it really worth the effort to treat these things as security
issues? There are so many ways to crash a machine (be it virtual or
hardware), there are definitely countless ways to crash things from
within privileged code.. what's the security impact of a hardware
issue when, say, a driver code in the OS does a stupid thing and
the hardware locks up?

Thanks,
