Subject: Bluez <5.53 DoS/privilege escalation

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00352.html
describes a vulnerability in versions below 5.53 of the Bluez
Bluetooth stack. Intel do not appear to have disclosed this issue to
distributions in advance, and have not yet made a release that
includes the fixes. https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11428317/ and
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11428319/ should apply to older
versions.
