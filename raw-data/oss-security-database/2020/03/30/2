Subject: [CVE-2019-17561] "Apache NetBeans" autoupdate system does not fully
 validate code signatures.

CVE-ID
------
CVE-2019-17561

Summary
-------
The "Apache NetBeans" autoupdate system does not fully validate
code signatures.

Versions Affected: 
------------------
- All Apache NetBeans versions up to and including 11.2

The "Apache NetBeans" autoupdate system does not fully validate
code signatures. An attacker could modify the downloaded nbm and
include additional code.

Mitigation:
-----------
- Disable autoupdates
- Install only plugins from trusted sources and validate the
  downloads by checking signatures and/or comparing checksums
  from trusted sources
- Update to NetBeans 11.3 by downloading the release, verifying the
  signature and manually installing it
