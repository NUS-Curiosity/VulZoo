Subject: CVE-2020-1954: Apache CXF JMX Integration is vulnerable to a MITM attack

CVE-2020-1954: Apache CXF JMX Integration is vulnerable to a MITM attack

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.3.6 and
3.2.13.

Description:

Apache CXF has the ability to integrate with JMX by registering an
InstrumentationManager extension with the CXF bus. If the
"createMBServerConnectorFactory" property of the default
InstrumentationManagerImpl is not disabled, then it is vulnerable to a
man-in-the-middle (MITM) style attack.

An attacker on the same host can connect to the registry and rebind the
entry
to another server, thus acting as a proxy to the original. They are then
able
to gain access to all of the information that is sent and received over JMX.

Mitigation:

Users of Apache CXF that use the InstrumentationManagerImpl should update to
either 3.3.6 or 3.2.13. Alternatively, set the
createMBServerConnectorFactory
property to false and use the default JVM JMX remote capabilities instead.
From
CXF 3.4.0, the createMBServerConnectorFactory property will be removed
altogether.
