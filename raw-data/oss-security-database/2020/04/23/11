This is not really job of postfix to block.  It is trivial to block
internationalized local mail in a milter (note: I maintain pymilter) -
or just refuse to create non-ascii mailboxes.  

You don't even need utf-
8 for this attack - the infamous Arial font makes homoglyphs like lBM
(which looks exactly like IBM in Arial) possible, and email localpart
is case sensitive.  So I also recommend forcing all local mailboxes to
be all lower case.  (Some businesses force to all upper case instead.) 


If anything, this is a security bug in the *font* (which the term
homoglyph implies), and the CVE should specify the problematic font or
fonts.
