There is only one place on Postfix that says "Sender address
rejected: not logged in". See code at end; it has not changed
in a decade.

Yoour Postfix SMTP server has been configured to require that an
SMTP client can send mail with envelope sender john.doe@...ver.com
ONLY if the client is logged in as the 'owner' of that address.

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    smtpd_sender_login_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_login

/etc/postfix/sender_login:
    # sender address    authorized logins
    john.doe@...ver.com sasluser1, sasluser2, ...

Sending email with a different envelope sender address, not in the
above table, would not be blocked by the smtpd_sender_login_maps
feature (but might still be blocked for other reasons).

So your concern has nothing to do with whether the addess
john.doe@...ver.com is a valid email address. Instead you're
probing the smtpd_sender_login_maps table.

Additionally, Postfix will reply with 5.1.1 User unknown if a local
recipient address is known to not exist. This is because the
alternative would be to accept all such email and silently discard
it, which violates RFCs, violates legislation in some countries
where rejecting email is allowed but accept+discard is not, and
which would saturate everyone's network with a continuous flood of
bogus email.
