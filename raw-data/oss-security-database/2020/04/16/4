SECURITY-1556 / CVE-2020-2177
Copr Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files as part of its configuration. These credentials can be
viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file
system.


SECURITY-1753 / CVE-2020-2178
Parasoft Findings Plugin 10.4.3 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user
able to control the input files for the Parasoft Findings parser to have
Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.


SECURITY-1825 / CVE-2020-2179
Yaml Axis Plugin 0.2.0 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to
prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a
multi-configuration (Matrix) job, or control the contents of a previously
configured job's SCM repository.


SECURITY-1736 / CVE-2020-2180
AWS SAM Plugin 1.2.2 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to
prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a job
or control the contents of a previously configured "AWS SAM deploy
application" build step's YAML SAM template file (`template.yaml` or
equivalent) file.
