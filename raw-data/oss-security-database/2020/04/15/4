Subject: CVE-2020-10942 Kernel: vhost-net: stack overflow in get_raw_socket
 while checking sk_family field

   Hello,

A stack buffer overflow issue was found in the get_raw_socket() routine of the 
Host kernel accelerator for virtio net (vhost-net) driver. It could occur 
while doing an ioctl(VHOST_NET_SET_BACKEND) call and retrieving socket name in 
a kernel stack variable via get_raw_socket(). A user able to perform ioctl(2) 
calls on the '/dev/vhost-net' device may use this flaw to crash the kernel 
resulting in DoS issue.

Upstream patch:
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/42d84c8490f9f0931786f1623191fcab397c3d64

Thank you.
