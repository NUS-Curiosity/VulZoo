CVE-2020-11980: A remote client could create MBeans from arbitrary URLs

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: all versions of Apache Karaf prior to 4.2.9

Description:

In Karaf, JMX authentication takes place using JAAS and authorization takes
place using ACL files. By default, only an "admin" can actually invoke on
an MBean. However there is a vulnerability there for someone who is not an
admin, but has a "viewer" role. In the 'etc/jmx.acl.cfg', such as role can
call get*. This leaves it partially vulnerable to this attack:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html

"A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use
it to create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no
security manager. In other words, a rogue remote client could make your
Java application execute arbitrary code."

It's possible to authenticate as a viewer role + invokes on the MLet
getMBeansFromURL method, which goes off to a remote server to fetch the
desired MBean, which is then registered in Karaf. At this point the attack
fails as "viewer" doesn't have the permission to invoke on the MBean.
Still, it could act as a SSRF style attack and also it essentially allows a
"viewer" role to pollute the MBean registry, which is a kind of privilege
escalation.


The vulnerability is low as it's possible to add a ACL to limit access.

This has been fixed in revision:

https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;a=commit;h=2ccfba48bdfac6c2cd09c8f058641da0011e4c7e

Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to 4.2.9
or later as soon as possible, or a new JMX ACL in etc configuration.
