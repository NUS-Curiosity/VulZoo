Indeed, I'm more or less of the same mind: lockdown is kind of a
best-effort thing at the moment, and it'd be crazy to rely on it,
considering various bypasses and differing attitudes on the security
model from different subsystems. This acpi bypass is a bug, maybe, but
it doesn't feel like a "real" security bug, because I'm not sure why
this would be a feature somebody would want to lean on at this point
in time. I wrote a PoC for this one rather than others because it
seemed fun and technically interesting to poke around with acpi in
this way, not because it's particularly rare or something.
