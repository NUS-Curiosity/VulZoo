Note that the Linux kernel community maintains LTS (Long Term Support) kernels
which already have most bug fixes backported -- including hundreds of bug fixes
that, like this one, were not assigned CVEs.  This bug was already fixed in the
Linux LTS kernels 17 months ago:

Linux v4.4.172: 2019-01-26 (https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20190126092938.GA23417@kroah.com/)
Linux v4.9.152: 2019-01-23 (https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20190123140846.GA27512@kroah.com/)
Linux v4.14.95: 2019-01-23 (https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20190123140915.GA27656@kroah.com/)
Linux v4.19.17: 2019-01-23 (https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20190123140935.GA27716@kroah.com/)

Linux distributors can significantly reduce their vulnerability to known bugs by
periodically merging in the appropriate LTS kernel branch.

Also, a regression test for this bug was added to LTP (Linux Test Project)
14 months ago: https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/commit/5d30802778fe3a21
Based on what I've seen when adding regression tests to LTP before, it's likely
that this bug was finally found and fixed in this particular downstream kernel
only because the LTP test was failing.  However, note that most Linux kernel
bugs are fixed without a regression test being added to LTP, which means that
cherry-picking kernel patches to fix LTP failures is much less effective than
merging in all LTS kernel fixes.
