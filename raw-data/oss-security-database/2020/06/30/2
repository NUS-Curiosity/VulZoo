Subject: libvncserver: old websocket decoding patch

Hi,

Upstream libvncserver fixed a websocket decoding issue >3years ago in
https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/commit/aac95a9dcf4bbba87b76c72706c3221a842ca433

AFAICT, this never got a CVE and wasn't backported by some
distributions.

Thanks and kind regards,

[I sent a heads-up about this to distros last Friday, 'embargo' ran out
on Monday 20:00 UTC]
