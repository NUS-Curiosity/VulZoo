Subject: Requesting a CVE id for Trojit치, an e-mail client: Improper Certificate Validation

Hi folks, I would appreciate a Cc on responses as I'm not subscribed to 
this list. I would like to request a CVE for the following vulnerability:

Summary
-------

Damian Poddebniak discovered a TLS verification failure (CWE-295) in 
Trojit치 [1], a fast Qt IMAP e-mail client. When sending e-mails over SMTP, 
all TLS errors were ignored.

Background
----------

Trojita first gained support for SMTP submission in patch 0083eea5ed [2]. 
Since that commit (May 2009), there's been a FIXME comment in the code that 
SSL errors should be handled properly. Unfortunately, this issue kept 
falling through the cracks and we never re-enabled TLS validation as the 
SMTP backend matured. As a result, outgoing SMTP connections were 
suspectible to a MITM attack, with authentication details including 
passwords and the message content potentially available to attackers.

IMAP connections are not suspectible to this bug.

Affected versions
-----------------

All versions of Trojita up to and including v0.7 are affected. The fix [3] 
will be included in version v0.8 which will be released once the CVE gets 
assigned.

Acknowledgement
---------------

Thanks to Damian Poddebniak for reporting [4] this bug.
