Subject: Debian FEATURE: /home/loser is with permissions 755, default umask 0022

/home/loser is with permissions 755, default umask 0022

on multiuser machines this sucks much.

on a multiuser debian mirror we found a lot of data,
including the wordpress password of the admin.

Then in the thread someone with @debian.org email explains
to me it is a feature, not a bug.

In a addition, they suggest to tell them the mirror, lol.

Are debian detached from reality?
