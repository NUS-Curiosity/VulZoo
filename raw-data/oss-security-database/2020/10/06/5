Subject: Re: major changes if gnu/linux dominates the desktop
 and/or mobile market?

I have to admit that as a unix/linux admin I have wondered how browsers are
able to skate by without their own unique no-login user, for security
purposes. It would make everything about them easier to control and secure.
