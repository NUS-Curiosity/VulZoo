That link looks like a once of issue that Debian had with the
distribution of Chromium. Which was probably fixed years ago.

More generally, in a typical Android install, there is closed source
software - drivers, firmware, Google APIs, Google Play. Before you even
get to installing closed source apps from Google Play.

These are a concern from a security point of view because you have to
trust the device manufacturer / Google with the security aspects of such
code, and there is no possibility of somebody else auditing the code
because the source code is not available.

Android devices typically require a forked version of the Linux kernel.
I believe they are slowly moving to reduce the changes required by
merging them mainline, but not sure how that is progressing right now.
Otherwise, I imagine this might have security concerns too.
