AFAIK unpriv user ns are enabled by default on vast majority of distros nowadays with debian (rhel?) being an exception (although this is going to change at some point[1]). I think what makes ubuntu different is unpriv overlayfs which doesn't exist upstream thus in most other distros.

This will only work with out-of-tree patch included in distro kernel.
