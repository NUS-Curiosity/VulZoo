Maybe it's time to take a more defensive posture and guide a user
through the setup if they wish. Nowadays you've got those
systemd-triggered first-time logon GUI wizards that could include a
step to setup file sharing, like making /home/loser/www available to
other users.

The defensive posture should keep security conscious folks happy, and
the setup wizard will keep promiscuous users happy.
