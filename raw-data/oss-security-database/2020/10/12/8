This is just kicking the can down the road.  X years ago people
complained about oppressive defaults.  X years from now these defaults
will also be insufficient.   We could save a lot of treadmill labor
dollars by just admitting that global filesystem namespaces are a
mistake, but the sunk cost fallacy is preventing this.  It's the same
story as SETUID all over again.
