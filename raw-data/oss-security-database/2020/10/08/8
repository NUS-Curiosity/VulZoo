Aha, thanks for indulging my curiosity and tracking this down. Ubuntu
doesn't carry any changes to this package compared to the Debian
package (any differences would be in a 'login' directory in
https://patches.ubuntu.com/l/ ).

"USERGROUPS_ENAB yes" may have been a Debian default setting since 1999 or
so; archaelogy on packages this old is a little difficult, but the tarball
on:

https://sources.debian.org/src/shadow/19990827-20/

has several login.defs* files:

$ ls -l etc/login.defs*
-rw-r--r-- 1 sarnold sarnold  5426 May  1  1997 etc/login.defs
-rw-r--r-- 1 sarnold sarnold  4272 Aug 27  1999 etc/login.defs.hurd
-rw-r--r-- 1 sarnold sarnold 10165 Aug 27  1999 etc/login.defs.linux
$ grep USERGROUPS etc/login.*
etc/login.defs.hurd:USERGROUPS_ENAB yes
etc/login.defs.linux:USERGROUPS_ENAB yes

By 2005 or so, the archaelogy gets easier:

https://sources.debian.org/src/shadow/1:4.0.18.1-7+etch1/etc/login.defs/
https://sources.debian.org/src/shadow/1:4.0.18.1-7+etch1/debian/changelog/

I believe "USERGROUPS_ENAB yes" has been a Debian default since 1998 or 1999.

Thanks
