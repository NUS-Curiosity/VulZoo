"All" is clearly false; I know many organizations that patch
all their hardware fast, and a few that do it essentially within
hours (unless CI tests for the patched infra fail). I don't have good
statistics, but the existence of some organizations of significant
size capable of patching everything leads me to believe the obstacle
isn't whether it's possible.
