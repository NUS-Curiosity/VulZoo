Subject: CVE-2020-15166: zeromq/libzmq: Denial-of-Service on
 CURVE/ZAP-protected servers by  unauthenticated clients

Hello,

A security vulnerability has been found in libzmq/zeromq.

CVE-2020-15166: Denial-of-Service on CURVE/ZAP-protected servers by
unauthenticated clients.
If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that is fully
configured with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to exchange
any message. Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are delivered to
the library, but the server application never receives them.
For more information see the security advisory:
