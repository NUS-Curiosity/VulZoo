Hi all,

Sorry for adding to an old thread (over-quoted below my signature).

I primarily want to publicly acknowledge and thank Seth Arnold of
Ubuntu, Anthony Liguori of Amazon Linux, and Srivatsa S. Bhat of VMware
Photon OS for handling two of these tasks well lately.  Thank you!

In particular, I am seeing good contributions on tasks 3 and 4 below:

3. Review and/or test the proposed patches and point out potential
issues with them (such as incomplete fixes for the originally reported
issues, additional issues you might notice, and newly introduced bugs),
and inform the list of the work done even if no issues were encountered
- primary: Ubuntu, backup: Amazon

4. Check if related issues exist in the same piece of software (e.g., same
bug class common across the software, or other kinds of bugs exist in
its problematic component), and inform the list either way
- primary: Ubuntu, backup: VMware Photon OS

I am not yet seeing contributions on task 5.  It's more open-ended - the
contributor would need to identify "implementations of similar
functionality in other software" first, and depending on how you define
"similar" and what "other software" is in scope these might or might not
exist.  That task's description is:

5. Check if related issues exist in implementations of similar
functionality in other software (e.g., forked code including the same
bug, or the same error made independently), and inform the list either
way - primary: Ubuntu, backup: Flatcar Container Linux

Notice that it does say "and inform the list either way".  For clarity,
can we please have that include cases where no "implementations of
similar functionality in other software" were identified?  In those
cases, just state so and how you were looking for those implementations
and why you think there might not be any or they would be too difficult
to identify.  In other words, some statement on work done or not done
and why, but not silence.  I hope that this requirement will encourage
actual work on this task, not just statements on work not done, but I
recognize that sometimes the latter will be the case, and that's fine.

So from this point on, I'd actually expect Ubuntu or/and Flatcar
Container Linux to state something on task 5 for each issue reported.

Thanks again,

Alexander
