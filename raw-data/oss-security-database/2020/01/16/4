Subject: [CVE-2019-17573] Apache CXF Reflected XSS in the services listing page

CVE-2019-17573: Apache CXF Reflected XSS in the services listing page

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.3.5 and
3.2.12.

Description:

By default, Apache CXF creates a /services page containing a listing of the
available endpoint names and addresses. This webpage is vulnerable to a
reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, which allows a malicious actor
to
inject javascript into the web page.

Please note that the attack exploits a feature which is not typically not
present in modern browsers, who remove dot segments before sending the
request. However, Mobile applications may be vulnerable.

Mitigation:

Users of Apache CXF should update to either 3.3.5 or 3.2.12. Alternatively,
it is possible to disable the service listing altogether by setting the
"hide-service-list-page" servlet parameter to "true".

We would like to thank the GE cyber security team for reporting this issue.
