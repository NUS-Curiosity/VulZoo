Given the above, I'd be happy to subscribe Jorge for Chrome OS.  I just
need Jorge's PGP key.  I also suggest using an e-mail address not on
Google's MX'es, because those reject messages sent from domains with
strict DMARC policy (most notably, when another Googler posts).

Normally such subscription changes for an already subscribed distro are
handled off-list.  However, what you bring up below deserves being
discussed on oss-security:

I think it'd be most consistent with our criteria so far if (at least)
one of those distros' security teams does state that you'd represent
them.  Without that, you staying on linux-distros would be weird and
inconsistent with requirements we set for others.

It'd be up to you to choose an e-mail address that's convenient for
you.  Messages are encrypted anyway, so this choice sort of does not
matter for security.  In practice, though, it does matter a little bit:
if you choose an e-mail address in a specific distro's domain name, then
if you ever leave their team and they disable that e-mail account you
wouldn't be getting the messages anymore (and they wouldn't be able to
read messages intended for you as well, due to the encryption to your
key), even if they forget to promptly ask for your address to be removed
from the list.  Despite of this minor security advantage, I don't insist
on use of such e-mail addresses so far, as I realize it's often far more
convenient to use an external e-mail address.

As to kernel.org, it isn't particularly relevant here since the Linux
kernel is not a Linux distro.  It's just an address you can use, just
like any other address.
