Subject: CVE-2020-1700 ceph: connection leak in the RGW Beast front-end
 permits a DoS against the RGW server

Hello,

A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW Beast front-end handles unexpected
disconnects.
An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect
attempts resulting
in a permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead
to a denial of service
condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the
exhaustion of available
resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting to the system.

This flaw affects Nautilus based versions. If Beast front end is in use,
switch to CivetWeb to mitigate
the issue. Red Hat has assigned CVE-2020-1700 and rated as Moderate impact
flaw.
