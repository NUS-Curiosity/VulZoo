OSSA-2020-004: Keystone credential endpoints allow owner modification and
are not protected from a scoped context
=================================================================================================================

:Date: May 06, 2020
:CVE: Pending


Affects
~~~~~~~
- - Keystone: <15.0.1, ==16.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
kay reported two vulnerabilities in keystone's EC2 credentials API.
Any authenticated user could create an EC2 credential for themselves
for a project that they have a specified role on, then perform an
update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade
as another user. (CVE #1 PENDING) Any authenticated user within a
limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2
credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while
the user is on a limited viewer role. (CVE #2 PENDING) Both of these
vulnerabilities potentially allow a malicious user to act as admin on
a project that another user has the admin role on, which can
effectively grant the malicious user global admin privileges.
