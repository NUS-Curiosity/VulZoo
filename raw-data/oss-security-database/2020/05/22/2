I think that's an extremely charitable way of looking at it; it's
perfectly OK to develop software where the security properties of the
code hinge on some non-standard constraints, but then it's
affirmatively on the developer to confirm at runtime that these
constraints are in place. I.e., setrlimit() or test and abort...

Otherwise, you really don't get to blame others, whether there is a
cautionary footnote on page 15 of the README or not.
