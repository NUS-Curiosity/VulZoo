At least the process to get CVE is faster nowadays, but you should think if CVE
consumers (persons patching systems, software users etc) find those CVEs
useful. In many cases they won't if there is no released package and if people
are not commonly using the latest version from Git.

One method is to have a page where you list people and details. Something like:
https://www.mongodb.com/security and some vendors send small payments
(sometimes using bug bounty platforms) or cheap items.
