Subject: Re: mmap vulnerability in motion eye video4linux driver for Sony Vaio PictureBook

yes, i found the pl and  sent to the maintainer mchehab@...nel.org and linux-media mail list  linux-media@...r.kernel.org last week, the last one  boudanced me with something like 'Your address is not liked source for email' blah...
i don't have Sony Vaio PictureBook, so i just check the souces and docs again. 

/usr/src/packages/BUILD/kernel-default-4.4.21/linux-4.4/Documentation/video4linux/v4l2-framework.txt:
'The v4l2_file_operations struct is a subset of file_operations. The main
difference is that the inode argument is omitted since it is never used.'
# ls /dev/video0crw-rw---- 1 root video 81, 0 Jul 11 08:14 /dev/video0
commit be83bbf80682 file_mmap_size_max check conditions:1. S_ISREG(inode->i_mode) 2. S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode)3. file->f_mode & FMODE_UNSIGNED_OFFSET
I doubt which one will be true.

Always use the scripts/get_maintainer.pl tool to find who to send stuff
like this to.  It will include a public mailing list or two.

I think you are wrong, but it would be great if you could test to verify
it or not.
thanks,
