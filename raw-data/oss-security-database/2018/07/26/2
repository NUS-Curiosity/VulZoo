Subject: Squirrelmail XSS security fix

Hi,

I recently posted info about several XSS vulns in squirrelmail [1] to
this list.

Given its upstream state I considered forking squirrelmail, though I
reached out to the maintainer and he claims he's still actively working
on it. I sent him a couple of patches, but they're not applied yet.

For now I'm sharing the patches I use on my own installations:
https://github.com/hannob/squirrelpatches

This contains a security fix for the known XSS issues and hopefully a
few more (though I make no claims that this is safe from XSS now, I'd
appreciate if others could check). It also contains patches for PHP
warnings and issues with PHP 7.2.
