Hello all,

cabextract 1.7 has been released.

It fixes a few bugs, an introduces a new "--encoding" option, which is 
made available if the iconv() function and/or libiconv library are 
available on your system. It also now tries calling setlocale() (if 
present) with several possible locales that have a UTF-8 ctype, to
allow towlower() (if present) to lowercase non-ASCII characters.

libmspack 0.7alpha has also been released. It fixes several bugs:

* bad KWAJ file header extensions could cause a one or two byte
  overwrite
* The character U+0100 in a CHM filename could cause a one-byte overread
* libmspack now rejects blank CHM filenames.
* Fixed off-by-one error in CHM PMGI/PMGL chunk number validity checks, 
which could cause a crash by dereferencing uninitialised data beyond
  the end of the fast_find() chunk cache.
