Subject: coverity scan of qmail -- 53 potential defects (with false positives)

 From my blog:
https://j.ludost.net/blog/archives/2018/07/01/coverity_scan_of_qmail_--_53_potential_defects_with_false_positives/index.html

https://scan.coverity.com/projects/qmail


coverity gave only 53 defects. Quick scan suggests that the non-false
positives are logically dead code or file race conditions (might be
wrong about this).
