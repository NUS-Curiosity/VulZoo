            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-8897 / XSA-260
                              version 2

                 x86: mishandling of debug exceptions

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

Updated .meta file

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When switching stacks, it is critical to have a matching stack segment
and stack pointer.  To allow an atomic update from what would otherwise
be two adjacent instructions, an update which changes the stack segment
(either a mov or pop instruction with %ss encoded as the destination
register) sets the movss shadow for one instruction.

The exact behaviour of the movss shadow is poorly understood.

In practice, a movss shadow delays some debug exceptions (e.g. from a
hardware breakpoint) until the subsequent instruction has completed.  If
the subsequent instruction normally transitions to supervisor mode
(e.g. a system call), then the debug exception will be taken after the
transition to ring0 is completed.

For most transitions to supervisor mode, this only confuses Xen into
printing a lot of debugging information.  For the syscall instruction
however, the exception gets taken before the syscall handler can move
off the guest stack.

IMPACT
======

A malicious PV guest can escalate their privilege to that of the
hypervisor.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH
guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.

An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to
exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available
to unprivileged users.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability.

Note however that a compromised device model (running in dom0 or a
stub domain) can carry out this attack, so users with HVM domains are
also advised to patch their systems.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andy Lutomirski, and Nick Peterson of Everdox
Tech LLC.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
