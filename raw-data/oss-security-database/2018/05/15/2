Thanks for the links (I had already included the information in my summary
though).

That was my understanding as well, thus the mitigations.

Yes indeed.

Maybe the fixing the standard will help, but indeed the client can already
sanitize the various chunks of message and not render them as part of one HTML
document. As far as I can tell only Thunderbird was vulnerable to this (in
open-source software), but I can't find a CVE number or a public bug for this.
