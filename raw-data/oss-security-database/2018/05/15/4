Just to add in about Thunderbird with Enigmail after 2.0.0:

https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2018-May/060325.html
https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2018-May/060327.html
https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2018-May/060329.html

So it looks like data encrypted with CAST5 (and possibly 3DES?) may be
at risk even with Enigmail 2.0.0, with what I guess is latest GnuPG
(don't know whether it is with 1.4, 2.2 or both, though), likely due to
a GnuPG bug.
