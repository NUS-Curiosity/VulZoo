Have a look at some official statements on this:

* https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2018-May/060334.html
* https://protonmail.com/blog/pgp-vulnerability-efail/

For the case of PGP it sounds like the only problems occur when mail
clients ignore the GPG hints.

For S/MIME, it does sound like the standard is broken and needs fixing.

If I understand this correctly, the "Direct Exfiltration" is an attack
that doesn't require modifying the encrypted data - so presumably the
MDC in PGP won't help. To me this sounds like a email client problem
(allowing mixing encrypted and encrypted data in the one HTML document
seems like a very bad idea), but the https://efail.de/ page says the
standards need to be updated to fix this.
