One reason I asked because for some people knee-jerk reaction upon 
learning about this issue is to insist that the browser should only copy 
what the user sees. Cleverly, they never elaborate what that means 
exactly.

Is a "font-size: 3pt" text visible? Should the browser consult the 
user's eye exam results before deciding what to copy?

Does it mean Ctrl+A Ctrl+C would copy only text within the viewport? I 
guess so, but that's not what browser users expect.

And in the PDF world: the user is often shown a scan, and there's a 
hidden copyable text layer. Should the PDF browser somehow refuse to 
copy text with recognition errors?

As it was noted elsewhere in this thread, tabs and newlines are control 
characters, too. People paste them all the time. But I don't think 
anyone is seriously proposing to filter out these two.
