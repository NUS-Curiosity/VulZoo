SECURITY-754
The Jenkins CLI sent different error responses for commands with view and
agent arguments depending on the existence of the specified views or agents
to unauthorized users. This allowed attackers to determine whether views or
agents with specified names exist.


SECURITY-759
Some JavaScript confirmation dialogs included the item name in an unsafe
manner, resulting in a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability
exploitable by users with permission to create or configure items.
