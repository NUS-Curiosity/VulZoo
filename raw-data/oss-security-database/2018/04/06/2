lulz. There is indeed a double free of console_device,
if a SIGINT is caught right before main() returns.
(Looking at git dbf0b4). Besides the easter egg, the patch
is still wrong. optarg may be reused via console_device, so the strdup()
is OK, but the ressource-free and signal handling isnt.

Shouts to the beep trolls. I strongly challenge the oppinion that security
is better done without it ...
