I hope you're not proposing that, to protect users of terminal emulators,
general-purpose web browsers should not allow copying more than a
paragraph at a time? That seems like a change that is unlikely to be
accepted.

Similarly, if filtering of pastes is done at the destination side (the
terminal emulator), it would seem bad to be unable to paste more than
a line at a time into a text editor that happens to be running in a
terminal emulator (for instance the one in which I'm writing this email).

Russ's more loose definition of "control character" (in particular,
preventing copying and/or pasting ESC and the 0x80-0x9F range) would be
enough to protect users of a terminal/shell combination that supports
bracketed paste, as far as I'm aware?
