Hello Kurt,

I've just added the corresponding CWE IDs to the vulnerability classes showed on
the map: https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/linux-kernel-defence-map

It think there is only one vuln class that misses a CWE ID -- Stack Depth
Overflow. We currently have CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), but it doesn't
cover the Stack Clash case, which also refers to Stack Depth Overflow.

Best regards,
Alexander
