The thread subject is not as informative as it could be. The original 
post was about pasting control characters. While the problem is not 
new[0], I don't recall it being ever discussed on oss-security before.

OTOH, this is about terminal escape injection, an entirely different 
problem, and a frequent topic on oss-security.
