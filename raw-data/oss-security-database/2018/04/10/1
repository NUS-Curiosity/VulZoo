I'm just gonna go out on a limb here, and say this is an unfounded 
assertion.

Perhaps the correct solution would be to prevent the browser from 
copying invisible characters.

If you're going to break some basic mechanic of human computer 
interaction, at least don't break my damn terminal (not that I use VTE, 
it doesn't support OSC 52, among others), but the principle stands... 
Instead of worrying about sanitizing what is pasted, why not worry 
about sanitizing what is copied instead?

Thanks.
