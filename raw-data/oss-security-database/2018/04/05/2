Hello Kees,

Thanks a lot for your reply!

Yes, self-protection.rst is a really nice reading. There is a link to it in the
References section below the map. Moved it before the map.

Ok. Added a "by default in grsecurity" node connected with
SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED. That will show the origin of the idea.

At the same time SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED contains my "fasttop" check against
double-free. So I've put SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED and that origin node at the same
level.

Good idea. Added "Side Channels" and RETPOLINE.

Info Exposure is a vulnerability (red node). STACKLEAK, PAGE_POISONING, etc
mitigate this kind of bugs.

Finding Kernel Objects is an exploitation technique (orange node). KASLR,
RANDSTRUCT are statistical defences which make it harder for an adversary.

Kees, Kurt, does it sound reasonable?

Yes, I've extracted this term from the patch discussion )

Thanks, added.

Didn't manage to find config for them. Are they always enabled?

Yes, agree. That's what I did exploiting CVE-2017-2636: allocating struct
skb_shared_info in the userspace memory with the destructor callback pointing to
native_write_cr4() to disable SMEP. Is it what you mean?

I've added "ret2usr + type confusion". Do you like it?

Kurt, that is CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type
Confusion').

Thanks, fixed.

Ok. I've added them pointing to SMAP/PAN with dotted line (since they emulate
PAN in some manner).

Kees, thanks again for such a cool feedback. The map is updated.

Best regards,
Alexander
