CVE-2018-1315: 'COPY FROM FTP' statement in HPL/SQL can write to
arbitrary location if the FTP server is compromised

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Hive 2.1.0 to 2.3.2

Description: When 'COPY FROM FTP' statement is run using HPL/SQL extension to
Hive, a compromised/malicious FTP server can cause the file to be
written to an arbitrary location on the cluster where the command is
run from. This is because FTP client code in HPL/SQL does not verify
the destination
location of the downloaded file. This does not affect hive
cli user and hiveserver2 user as hplsql is a separate command line
script and needs to be invoked differently.

Mitigation: User who use HPL/SQL with Hive 2.1.0 through 2.3.2 should upgrade to
2.3.3 which removes support for "COPY FROM FTP". Alternatively, the
usage of HPL/SQL can be disabled through
other means.
