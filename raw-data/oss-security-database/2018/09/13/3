Subject: CVE-2018-1330: Libprocess might crash when decoding malformed HTTP
 requests or malformed JSON payload.

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Mesos 1.4.0 to 1.5.0
The unsupported Apache Mesos pre-1.4.0 releases may be also affected.

Description:
When parsing a malformed JSON payload, libprocess might crash due to
an uncaught exception. Parsing chunked HTTP requests with trailers
can lead to a libprocess crash too because of the mistakenly planted
assertion. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service
of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.

Mitigation:
pre-1.4.x users should upgrade to at least 1.4.2
1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.4.2
1.5.0 users should upgrade to 1.5.1
1.6.0-dev users should obtain Mesos 1.6.0 or later
