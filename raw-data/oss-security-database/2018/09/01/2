Ah, fair enough. Thanks for clarifying this, you're making good points.
The robustness issue is indeed something I completely disregarded.

Luckily, we've already arrived at a point where keys can be as short as
hash values. Ed25519 keys are 32 bytes, i.e., the same length as a
SHA256 hash. So there's that :-)

All the best,
