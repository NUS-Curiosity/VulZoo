OK.  You already did that, and people are free to share their experience
(if on-topic for this list).  You also shared your experience (which
happens to be only partially on-topic for this list).  As a moderator, I
think that's enough contribution from you to this thread.

While I also regret that there's no longer an unmoderated
full-disclosure list, I understand why there is not.  Besides needing to
filter out all the automated spam (which already makes the list
technically moderated), all sorts of semi-on-topic crap ends up being
posted to truly unmoderated lists like that - personal attacks, doxing
(and when you ask for removal of that content from archives later, you
sort of engage in moderation too), conspiracy theories and dubious facts
(and good luck figuring out what's real and what's not), etc.  That
said, you may host a new list like that, and I'd be happy to be able to
redirect discussions that are unsuitable in here to there.
