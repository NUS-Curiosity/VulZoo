I know it's a general purpose language, but if you ifdef out *all* the
IO (except to the page) and all system calls and the like from the
implementation, there's limits to what it can do. As it stands the
implementation has all those capabilities in the code, but does
anything anyone cares about actually need any of them under any
normal circumstances? If not, they can just be removed, which is a
lot easier to audit than a sandbox.
