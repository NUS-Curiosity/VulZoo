Currently, evince, okular and gv don't. The same goes for zathura with its
poppler backend (haven't checked this, but pretty sure). But then there is also
Artifex Mupdf which, AFAIR, supports JS in pdf files (by extension, so does
zathura when viewing a pdf file using the mupdf plugin). I don't know how
complete that support is. Most importantly, many Android pdf/ebook readers
probably include JS support.
