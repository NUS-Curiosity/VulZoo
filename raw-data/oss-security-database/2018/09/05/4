I haven't been following the bugs in depth (just noticing the
continuous stream of them arriving), but is the issue security flaws
in just -dSAFER or is it overall security bugs? If it's the former,
given how few things actually need any of the features past what
-dSAFER offers, perhaps compiling the code by default without any such
capabilities would work well? You can't run what isn't there.
