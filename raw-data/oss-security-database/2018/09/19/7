Subject: CVE-2018-12642: Incorrect Access Control of tickets in Froxlor <=
 0.9.39.5

Hi,

I've discovered security issues in Froxlor <= 0.9.39.5
(https://www.froxlor.org)

An authenticated customer can read all messages of all support tickets
of every user by simply changing the "id".

It is also possible to add a new message, change the priority, close and
reopen a support ticket as another customer than the owner of the
support ticket.


Until now there is no corrected version of Froxlor available, because
the main developer has no spare time to release a new version nor to
inform users about the fixes for three months. It's also not foreseeable
when a corrected version will be released.

But Froxlor users can manually patch these issues by replacing
customer_tickets.php and lib/classes/ticket/class.ticket.php with the
corrected ones from
https://github.com/Froxlor/Froxlor/blob/436d141bd1c6f06a66b6d6e593d359afc3c2a80e/customer_tickets.php
and
https://github.com/Froxlor/Froxlor/blob/436d141bd1c6f06a66b6d6e593d359afc3c2a80e/lib/classes/ticket/class.ticket.php


I've decided to post about these security issues, because I think it is
better that Froxlor users know that fixes for security issues are
available, even if there is no corrected version released yet.


Fixes:
