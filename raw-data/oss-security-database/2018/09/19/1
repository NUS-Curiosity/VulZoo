 escalation bug in vmacache code

Hello, Davidlohr,

Thank you for reporting this. Was CVE-ID assigned or requested
for this flaw? If not, the Red Hat (as a CNA) could allocate one
and handle adding it to the MITRE's database.

Best regards,
Vladis Dronov | Red Hat, Inc. | Product Security Engineer
