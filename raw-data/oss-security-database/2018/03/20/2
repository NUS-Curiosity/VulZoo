Subject: Re: CVE request: maliciously crafted notebook files in
 Jupyter

Obviously, running a python notebook from an untrusted party is a bad 
idea, since notebooks are litearlly code executors...

Sure, there is something to be said about *javascript* execution... but 
there are a plethora of addons for Python notebooks that generate 
Javascript on-demand. Especially for visualizations, etc...

Why is this a "vulnerability" necessarily?

Just curious...
