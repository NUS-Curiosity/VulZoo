As a moderator for oss-security, I'd like open source relevance to be
clear from the postings, like Idler did here for another Samsung issue:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/01/19/3

Also see the followups to that posting, via "thread-next" links.

Please reply (to the list) with this sort of detail for these issues.

Thanks,

Alexander
