Subject: [ANN] A crafted XML request can be used to perform a DoS attack when
 using the Struts REST plugin

The Apache Security Struts Team recommends to immediately upgrade your
Struts 2 based projects to use the latest released version of the
Apache Struts. This is necessary to prevent your publicly accessible
web site, which is using the Struts REST plugin and performing XML
serialisation, from being exposed to possible DoS attack.

You can find more details in a Security Bulletin S2-056 -
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-056

All developers are strongly advised to perform this action.


Kind regards
