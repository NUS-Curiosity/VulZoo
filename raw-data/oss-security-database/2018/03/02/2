I think in general ALL network applications that support UDP need to think
about hardening their default configurations due to the potential for
amplification attacks.

While it is not yet CVE worthy I can see the bar moving (much like it has
for default passwords, and crypto) in the near future as this is clearly
becoming a problem. Please note that this problem is already covered by
CWE-406 (to some degree) which makes the case for CVE assignment stronger.
