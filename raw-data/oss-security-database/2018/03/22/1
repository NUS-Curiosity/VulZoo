Interesting -- could you confirm that the effect of this bug is a
miscalculation? Or is it breaking the constant-time assertion?

Do you have a pointer as to where this was discussed? Do you consider it
a security vulnerability? Can you give advice to developers of how to
mitigate this kind of issue?

Is it regarded a WONTFIX by OpenSSL or is it going to be fixed (just not
treated as security-criticial)? If so, do you know the fix version?

Cheers and best regards,
Johannes
