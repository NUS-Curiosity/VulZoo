Subject: CVE-2018-7290: Stored XSS vulnerability in Tiki <= 18

Hi,

I've discovered a security issue in Tiki <= 18 (https://tiki.org)


A stored XSS vulnerability allows an authenticated user injecting
JavaScript to gain administrator privileges if an administrator opens a
wiki page and moves the mouse pointer over a modified external link,
related to lib/parser/parserlib.php.


The issue is fixed in Tiki 18.1 and was backported to 12.13, 15.6 and 17.2.

Fix:
https://sourceforge.net/p/tikiwiki/code/65537


Timeline:
2018-02-16: Issue discovered and reported
2018-02-19: Issue confirmed and fixed
2018-03-08: New Tiki version released
