Subject: CVE-2018-7550 Qemu: i386: multiboot OOB access while loading kernel
 image

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with the PC System Emulator with multiboot feature 
support is vulnerable to an OOB r/w memory access issue. It could occur while 
loading a kernel image during a guest boot if multiboot head addresses 
mh_load_end_addr was greater than mh_bss_end_addr.

A user/process could use this flaw to potentially achieve arbitrary code 
execution on a host.
