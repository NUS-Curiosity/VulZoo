Thanks for the headsup.

This reply is mainly for this other purpose: It looks you wanted to
have a CVE assigned trough this reply to the list. CVE's cannot
anymore be requested via the oss-security list. If you want to request
one please have a look at https://cveform.mitre.org/

Once you have the CVE assigned, can you please loop back the
assignement in this thread?

Regards,
Salvatore
