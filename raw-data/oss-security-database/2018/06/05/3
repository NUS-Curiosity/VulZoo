Subject: [CVE-2014-0114]: Apache Ignite is vulnerable to existing CVE-2014-0114

[CVE-2014-0114]: Apache Ignite is vulnerable to existing CVE-2014-0114

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache Ignite 2.4 or earlier

Impact:
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on Ignite nodes in the case when Ignite classpath contains arbitrary vulnerable classes.

Description:
Apache Ignite used commons-beanutils-1.8.3.jar library which did not suppress the class property, which allowed remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via the class parameter, as demonstrated by the passing of this parameter to the getClass method of the ActionForm object in Struts 1.

Mitigation:
•    All Ignite versions: make sure there are no vulnerable classes among your custom code used in Apache Ignite.
•    Upgrade to Apache Ignite 2.5 or later version

Credit:
Harendra Rai of NCR Corporation discovered the impact of the existing vulnerability on Apache Ignite.
