I honestly appreciate your security research and have been reading all of your
advisories. Could you please tone it down in public mailing list read by
hundreds of specialists who like lists SNR. Please directly contact author of
the software with proof of concept or detailed explanation of the issue.
Personal comments about skills etc are not helping anyone. If you need help
coordinating this case feel free to contact me and I can reproduce the issue
and report it to the developers. Maybe saving your time and possible
frustration.
