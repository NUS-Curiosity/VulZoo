Subject: Intel hyper-threading security issues

Hi all,

OpenBSD has gone ahead and disabled Intel Hyper threading with a
fairly detailed comment about the reasons behind:

https://www.mail-archive.com/source-changes@openbsd.org/msg99141.html

As far as I can tell:
-cache timing attacks are possible, and spectre-like problems are an
issue again.
-OSes will need to modify their schedulers to avoid scheduling domains
in a dangerous way.

When will the details be published so that OpenBSD users who buy Intel
hardware can get more fined grained solutions against specific attack
vectors ? Is it also scheduled for the 27th ?


Kind regards,
