            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-12892 / XSA-266
                               version 3

      libxl fails to honour readonly flag on HVM emulated SCSI disks

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

libxl fails to pass the readonly flag to qemu when setting up a SCSI
disk, due to what was probably an erroneous merge conflict resolution.

IMPACT
======

Malicious guest administrators or (in some situations) users may be
able to write to supposedly read-only disk images.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only emulated SCSI disks (specified as "sd" in the libxl disk
configuration, or an equivalent) are affected.  IDE disks ("hd") are
not affected (because attempts to make them readonly are rejected).

Additionally, CDROM devices (that is, devices specified to be
presented to the guest as CDROMs, regardless of the nature of the
backing storage on the host) are not affected; they are always
readonly.

Only systems using qemu-xen (rather than qemu-xen-traditional) as the
device model version are vulnerable.

Only systems using libxl or libxl-based toolstacks are vulnerable.
(This includes xl, and libvirt with the libxl driver.)

The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 4.7 and later.
(In earlier versions, provided that the patch for XSA-142 has been
applied, attempts to create readonly disks are rejected.)

If the host and guest together usually support PVHVM, the issue is
exploitable only if the malicious guest administrator has control of
the guest kernel or guest kernel command line.

MITIGATION
==========

Switching to qemu-xen-traditional will avoid this vulnerability.
This can be done with
   device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional"
in the xl configuration file.

Using stub domain device models (which necessarily involves switching
to qemu-xen-traditional) will also avoid this vulnerability.
This can be done with
   device_model_stubdomain_override=true
in the xl configuration file.

All of these mitigations are liable to have other guest-visible
effects or even regressions.

It may be possible, depending on the configuration, to make the
underlying storage object readonly, or to make it reject writes.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andrew Reimers of OrionVM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of patches or mitigations is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because all of the patches and mitigations make significant
guest-visible changes.  In particular, applying the patch will cause
the emulated SCSI disk object to be reported to the guest as readonly,
when previously it was reported as writeable.

Deployment is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
