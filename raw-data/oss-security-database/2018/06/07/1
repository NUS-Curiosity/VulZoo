Subject: CVE-2018-11806 Qemu: slirp: heap buffer overflow while reassembling
 fragmented datagrams

   Hello,

A heap buffer overflow issue was found in the way Slirp networking back-end in 
QEMU processes fragmented packets. It could occur while reassembling the 
fragmented datagrams of an incoming packet.

A privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu 
process resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code 
on the host with privileges of the Qemu process.

Upstream patch:

   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-06/msg01012.html

This issue was reported by Jskz - Zero Day Initiative (trendmicro.com).
