 leakage from lazy FPU context switching

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-3665 / XSA-267
                              version 3

     Speculative register leakage from lazy FPU context switching

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

x86 has a hardware mechanism for lazy FPU context switching.  On a task
switch, %cr0.ts (Task Switched) gets set, and the next instruction to
touch floating point state raises an #NM (No Math, later known as Device
Not Available) exception.

Traditionally, FPU state has been large in comparison to available
bandwidth (and therefore slow to switch) and not used as frequently as
cpu tasks tend to switch.  This mechanism allows the OS to only switch
FPU when necessary, which in turn increases performance.

Some CPUs however speculate past an #NM exception, allowing register
content to be leaked by a side-channel.

For more details, see:
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00145.html

IMPACT
======

An attacker can read x87/MMX/SSE/AVX/AVX-512 register state belonging to
another vCPU previously scheduled on the same processor.  This can be
state belonging a different guest, or state belonging to a different
thread inside the same guest.

Furthermore, similar changes are expected for OS kernels.  Consult your
operating system provider for more information.


VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 processors are vulnerable.  ARM processors are not known to be
affected.

Only Intel Core based processors (from at least Nehalem onwards) are
potentially affected.  Other processor designs (Intel Atom/Knights
range), and other manufacturers (AMD) are not known to be affected.

MITIGATION
==========

Depending on the availability of host resources, leakage can be
prevented between VMs by using cpupools or cpu pinning to isolate the
vCPUs from different VMs to separate pCPUs.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julian Stecklina (jsteckli@...zon.de) from
Amazon and Thomas Prescher (thomas.prescher@...erus-technology.de) from
Cyberus Technology.

It was also independenty discovered by Zdenek Sojka from SYSGO
(http://sysgo.com) and by Colin Percival.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
