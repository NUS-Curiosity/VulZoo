XMSS (RFC8391) seems like a fine thing to me, but two
notes:

1. There's another hash based scheme [1] that may or may
not have more traction, depending whom you ask.

2. IIUC these schemes have a finite number of signatures
per private key, and when you've used them all you reveal
the private key value, so different APIs are needed, and
applications need to care about that. So I'm not sure that
general adoption of these for gnu-pg would be simple. In
this context though (s/w signing), applications could make
use of 'em, if done carefully.

The best list for discussing algorithm details is probably
the CFRG list. (cfrg@...f.org)

Cheers,
S.
