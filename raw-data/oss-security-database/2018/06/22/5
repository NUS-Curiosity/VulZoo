Note that this gives misleading results on multi-socket systems:

0: 0, 8, 16, 24
1: 1, 9, 17, 25
2: 2, 10, 18, 26
3: 3, 11, 19, 27
4: 4, 12, 20, 28
5: 5, 13, 21, 29
6: 6, 14, 22, 30
7: 7, 15, 23, 31

This system has two sockets, eight cores per socket, two threads per core.

$ ./cpuinfo
Found 32 logical processors across 16 physical cores
