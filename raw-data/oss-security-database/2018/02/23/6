In these GitHub repos, which I thought were official:

https://github.com/proxmox/vncterm
https://github.com/proxmox/spiceterm

Shortly after I sent the message, I realized I should have included
these links in it.  Ditto for other projects, so here they are:

XenServer vncterm:

https://github.com/xenserver/vncterm

Might be also out of date, since last commit is 2 years ago?  But could
also be latest.  These things don't have to be updated frequently.

For QEMU, I did:

git clone git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git

Sounds great.  (I haven't looked yet.)

Sorry for the false alarm, then.  (I imagine some users would like to
know of these issues having existed and having been fixed, though.)

Thanks,

Alexander
