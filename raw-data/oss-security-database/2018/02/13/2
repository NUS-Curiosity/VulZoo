Subject: qpdf: multiple vulnerabilities before 7.0.0

Hi,

This is a bit older, but I'll share it anyway. A while ago I tested
qpdf with libfuzzer, all those issues have been fixed in 7.0.0 (latest
is 7.1.1).

Stack overflow due to endless recursion in
QPDFTokenizer::resolveLiteral()
https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/51

Another stack overflow / endless recursion in
QPDFWriter::enqueueObject()
https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/143

Stack out of bounds read in iterate_rc4()
https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/147

heap out of bounds read (large) in Pl_Buffer::write
https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/150


Hang due to a pdf xref loop:
https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/149
Background:

A quick check with the latst 7.1.1 with libfuzzer and asan revealed no
further bugs.
