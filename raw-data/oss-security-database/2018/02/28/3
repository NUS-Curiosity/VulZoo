This only partly answers your question, but the oss-fuzz issues are
handled in a public bug tracker (public as in "they become public once
they're fixed or a deadline has passed" I believe):
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list

You'll find issues in sqlite, file and libarchive there, but of course
that doesn't give you a mapping to the CVEs assigned.
