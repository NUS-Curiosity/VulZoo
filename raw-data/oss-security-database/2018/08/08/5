CVE 2018-5390 is a remotely exploitable denial of service against Linux
systems. It was patched in the public kernel tree on the 2018-07-23 and
publicly disclosed on 2018-08-06. A public tweet linking to the commit was
made on 2018-07-23, so awareness of the issue may have been high before
official disclosure. All Linux distributions should now have released
patches for the affected releases.
