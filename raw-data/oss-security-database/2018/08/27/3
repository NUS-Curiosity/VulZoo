Subject: Another "user enumeration" in Dropbear

Hi

Due the high interests in CVE-2018-15473 ("user enumeration" in
OpenSSH), people may also notice CVE-2018-15599 [1] in Dropbear (popular
on IoT/initramfs).
The issue seems to be very similar. A patch [2] is already available,
but no new releases so far.

Best regards
