Subject: Linux kernel: CVE-2018-14619 kernel: crash (possible privesc) in
 kernel crypto subsystem.

Gday,

Syzkaller/syzbot found a use-after-free bug in the cryptographic
subsystem of the Linux kernel [1], that can be used to panic the
system and possibly escalate privileges.

The bug was introduced in commit 72548b093ee3, and has been addressed
in b32a7dc8aef1882fbf983eb354837488cc9d54dc, a reproducer is available
on the tail end of  syzbots email to kernel list (
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/27/866 ).  Most RHEL kernels are not
affected as they do not have the feature, but it does affect the
kernel-alt package (the 4.11 based kernel for 64-bit ARM , IBM POWER9
(little endian ) and IBM z Systems ).

Upstream fix:

Thanks.
