You are correct, I will also send them an email.

Thank you for the reference to the new CVE, I only had what was in the
package changelog to go with and none of the trackers I know about
reference CVE-2018-3690 as a duplicate/old name of CVE-2018-3693, so it
was confusing.
This is actually pretty reassuring that the rule is then appropriately
respected.

That being said, if CVE-2018-3693 is public there really is no reason to
say what they said in the discussions I have had with the RDMA folks, so
I will work to clear that up.


Thanks,
