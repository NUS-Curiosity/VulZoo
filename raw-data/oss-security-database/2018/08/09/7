Note that because of the way Debian and Ubuntu kernels are packaged, this
is an "ABI version" describing a class of kernels with compatible module
ABIs, not a specific version number. The version number for Ubuntu kernels
looks like 4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1 or similar. If you are illustrating
how to reproduce an exploit against a specific binary kernel, you'll
probably want to quote both the package name and the version number: for
example https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic
currently lists "linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic (4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)".
