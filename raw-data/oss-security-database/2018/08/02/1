Subject: Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Tiki <= 18.1

Hi,

I've discovered four security issues in Tiki <= 18.1 (https://tiki.org)


Four stored XSS vulnerabilities allow an authenticated user injecting
JavaScript to gain administrator privileges if an administrator opens a
wiki page and moves the mouse pointer over a modified link or thumb image.


The issues are fixed in Tiki 18.2 and the fixes are backported to 12.14
and 15.7.

Fixes:
https://sourceforge.net/p/tikiwiki/code/66809
https://sourceforge.net/p/tikiwiki/code/66990


Timeline:
2018-06-15: Issues discovered and reported
2018-06-25: 3 of 4 issues fixed
2018-07-12: All 4 issues confirmed
2018-07-20: 4 of 4 issues fixed
2018-07-31: Tiki 18.2, 15.7 and 12.14 released


I've requested a CVE ID (MITRE).
