 tables may cause crash on ARM

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-15469 / XSA-268
                              version 3

             Use of v2 grant tables may cause crash on ARM

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

ARM never properly implemented grant table v2, either in the
hypervisor or in Linux.

Unfortunately, an ARM guest can still request v2 grant tables; they
will simply not be properly set up, resulting in subsequent
grant-related hypercalls hitting BUG() checks.

IMPACT
======

An unprivileged guest can cause a BUG() check in the hypervisor,
resulting in a denial-of-service.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only ARM systems are vulnerable.  All supported versions of Xen are
vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

None.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by 王磊 of Samsung.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue by
preventing a guest from switching to grant v2.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
