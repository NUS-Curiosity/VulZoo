 MSR_DEBUGCTL handling lets guests enable BTS

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-15468 / XSA-269
                              version 3

      x86: Incorrect MSR_DEBUGCTL handling lets guests enable BTS

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The DEBUGCTL MSR contains several debugging features, some of which virtualise
cleanly, but some do not.  In particular, Branch Trace Store is not
virtualised by the processor, and software has to be careful to configure it
suitably not to lock up the core.  As a result, it must only be available to
fully trusted guests.

Unfortunately, in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking was
skipped, allowing the guest to chose any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy guest administrator can lock up the entire host, causing
a Denial of Service.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.6 and later are vulnerable.

Only systems using Intel CPUs are affected. ARM and AMD systems are
unaffected.

Only x86 HVM or PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 PV guests
cannot exploit the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only x86 PV guests avoids the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of Citrix.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
