Note that this may or may not work, depending on whether the MIME type 
detection is identical between the selection of the evince and the 
selection of the Ghostscript backend in evince itself.

I remember a case from several years ago where an ImageMagick bug was 
still exploitable via mail user agents even though the problematic image 
format was not listed in /etc/mailcap.  ImageMagick did its own format 
detection back then, so all you had to do was to change the file extension.

Thanks,
Florian
