This is likely due to header magic detection (e.g. "%!PS-Adobe").  It 
is possible that a different path will be taken if the common 
Postscript header is not detected.  The file extension may then be 
used as a hint.  Also, there are a wide varieties of ImageMagick 
versions in use, with a wide variety of behaviors.

The version of ImageMagick provided by the Ubuntu Linux I am using at 
this moment dates from 2012!
