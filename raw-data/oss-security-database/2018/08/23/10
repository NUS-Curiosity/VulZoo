It seems to be possible to disable GhostScript in ImageMagick completely by
the policy rule below. It's not possible to miss any format with it.

<policy domain="delegate" rights="none" pattern="gs" />

I also found out that Amit's exploit works with lesspipe that ships with
less by default -- it uses gs via ps2ascii wrapper

Best,
Mateusz
