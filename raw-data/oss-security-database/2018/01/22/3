Advisory ID:        SQUID-2018:1
Date:               Jan 19, 2018
Summary:            Denial of Service issue
                    in ESI Response processing.
Affected versions:  Squid 3.x -> 3.5.27

Problem Description:

 Due to incorrect pointer handling Squid is vulnerable to denial
 of service attack when processing ESI responses.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

 This problem allows a remote server delivering certain ESI
 response syntax to trigger a denial of service for all clients
 accessing the Squid service.

 This problem is limited to the Squid custom ESI parser.
 Squid built to use libxml2 or libexpat XML parsers do not have
 this problem.

__________________________________________________________________

Updated Packages:

 This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.0.23.

 In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
 releases can be found in our patch archives:

Squid 3.5:
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID-2018_1.patch>

Squid 4:
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/SQUID-2018_1.patch>

 If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
 to the package vendor for availability information on updated
 packages.

__________________________________________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

 All Squid-2.x are not vulnerable.

 All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.

 All Squid configured with "esi_parser expat" are not vulnerable.

 All Squid configured with "esi_parser libxml2" are not
 vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.0 versions built without --enable-esi are not
 vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.0 versions built with --enable-esi and using
 custom ESI parser for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.1 and later versions up to and including
 Squid-3.5.27 being used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.1 and later versions up to and including
 Squid-3.5.27 being used for TLS / HTTPS interception are
 vulnerable.

 All unpatched Squid-4 up to and including Squid-4.0.22 being
 used as reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All unpatched Squid-4 up to and including Squid-4.0.22 being
 used as TLS/HTTPS intercept proxy are vulnerable.

__________________________________________________________________

Workarounds:

Either;

 Build Squid with --disable-esi

Or,

 Build Squid with "--enable-esi --with-libxml2" and in squid.conf
 configure "esi_parser libxml2"

Or,

 Build Squid with "--enable-esi --with-expat" and in squid.conf
 configure "esi_parser expat"
