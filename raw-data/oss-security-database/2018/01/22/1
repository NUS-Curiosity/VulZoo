Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around 
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. The following 
plugin releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Ant plugin 1.8
* Checkstyle plugin 3.50
* DRY plugin 2.50
* FindBugs plugin 4.72
* Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin 2.18
* PMD plugin 3.50
* Release plugin 2.10
* Translation Assistance plugin 1.16
* Warnings plugin 4.65

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:

SECURITY-655 (PMD)
SECURITY-656 (Checkstyle)
SECURITY-657 (DRY)
SECURITY-658 (FindBugs)
SECURITY-695 (Warnings)
Multiple plugins based on the Static Analysis Utilities plugin are affected by 
an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability. This allows attacker to 
configure build processes so that one of these plugins parses a maliciously 
crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the 
Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.


SECURITY-607
Release plugin did not require form submissions to be submitted via POST, 
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to trigger release builds.


SECURITY-507
Translation Assistance did not require form submissions to be submitted via 
POST, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to override 
localized strings displayed to all users on the current Jenkins instance if 
the victim is a Jenkins administrator.


SECURITY-675
On instances with Authorize Project plugin, the authentication associated with 
a build may lack the Computer/Build permission on some agents. This did not 
prevent the execution of Pipeline `node` blocks on those agents due to 
incorrect permissions checks in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin.


SECURITY-624 and SECURITY-694
Ant plugin failed to escape tool names it shows on job configuration 
screens, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that is 
exploitable only by Jenkins administrators.

This is the same vulnerability that was announced without a fix on 2017-12-05.
