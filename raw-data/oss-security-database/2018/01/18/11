That's precisely what I wrote above, and I think it's not as bad as the
original situation Florian described.  The project gets less time, but
does it need more time when it can't release a fix anyway?  The reduced
exposure - even if to people and infrastructure of the project itself -
reduces risk of leaks.

Terms like this will also serve as a reminder to the reporter that
they're indeed being selfish and would have wanted an unreasonably long
embargo.  Some, but not all, will change their mind.

I think "semi-public" is the worst state an issue can be in, making the
above suggestion the worst of those mentioned in this thread so far.
