Subject: Re: DBD::mysql and SSL/TLS

Thanks for pointing this out. We had applied these patches before but had
to revert because of breakage created by other changes in the code.

The difficulty is also that mariadb and MySQL use a different approach to
handling TLS in the client libs.

I'll make sure we'll apply this PR again and create a release ASAP.
