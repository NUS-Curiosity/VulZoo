Oh, so-called "intellectual property".  I'm not thinking in such terms.

What I meant is that projects expecting to receive vulnerability reports
are not to be obliged by some industry standard to impose any specific
rules on the reporters.  This does mean that, among other things, those
projects do not have to insist on a maximum embargo time (even though I
advocate that they do), and as a side-effect this might assist someone
probably selfish with monetization of so-called "intellectual property".

Basically, you saw what you wanted to see.  Yes, it's kind of there, but
it wasn't in focus.
