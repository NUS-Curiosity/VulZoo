I'd agree with you there. Whenever we report security issues to upstream
developers, we have no control over the process they use to resolve the
issue.

In this case, the upstream author committed a partial fix to a public
repo soon after we reported the problem. In my view, whenever an
upstream author does this, you just consider the issue to be public
whether or not official releases or announcements have been made.

I'll pass your feedback along to the upstream author though.
