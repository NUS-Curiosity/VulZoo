Meltdown was not semi-public, it was private and siloed and a whole
bunch of other horrible things.  If it were semi-public, we would have
had it fixed sooner :)

And yes, a number of us involved are probably going to be writing up a
post-mortum of that whole horrid affair, feel free to let me know if
anyone wants to help out with it.  I think it's a great example of what
not to ever do in the future...
