Subject: CVE-2017-18043 Qemu: integer overflow in ROUND_UP macro could result
 in DoS

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with a macro ROUND_UP(n, d), used to promote number 
'n' to the nearest multiple of 'd', is vulnerable to an integer overflow 
issue. It could occur if 'd' is unsigned and smaller in type from 'n'.

A user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS.
