Subject: CVE-2018-18438 Qemu: Integer overflow in ccid_card_vscard_read()
 allows memory corruption

   Hello,

An integer overflow issue was found in the CCID Passthru card device 
emulation, while reading card data in ccid_card_vscard_read() function. The 
ccid_card_vscard_read() function accepts a signed integer 'size' argument, 
which is subsequently used as unsigned size_t value in memcpy(), copying large 
amounts of memory.

A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in 
DoS.
