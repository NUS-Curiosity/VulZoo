In my experience the MITRE form is significantly more reliable and faster
mechanism than the DWF form.

I realize this is perhaps a chicken-and-egg problem, where DWF might not
be fast until they get enough traffic that they have to be fast, but MITRE
is fast *today*, so any individual CVE requestor is probably better suited
to use MITRE.
