I've now been given an exploit, in a PDF (I was not subscribed here
until Friday, missed some of the earleir stuff).  That -2 patch fixes
it.

Tested with evince (which now loops trying to rended an empty page,
same as with the .ps exploit), so I've committed it in BLFS.  Will
take down the 'provisional' copy in a few days.

If upstream are like anywhere else, some changes get backed out or
modified so they might not be there when 9.26 is released.  OTOH,
one of the changes I ignored might stop evince looping on a
'damaged' PDF.  Swings and roundabouts.
