Subject: PowerDNS Security Advisories for dnsdist 2018-08

Hi all,

We just released dnsdist 1.3.3, fixing a security issue that was
reported to us, allowing a remote attacker to craft a DNS query with
trailing data such that the addition of a record by dnsdist, for example
an OPT record when adding EDNS Client Subnet, might result in the
trailing data being smuggled to the backend as a valid record while not
seen by dnsdist.

This is an issue when dnsdist is deployed as a DNS Firewall and used to
filter some records that should not be received by the backend.
This issue occurs only when either the 'useClientSubnet' or the
experimental 'addXPF' parameters are used when declaring a new backend.

The full security advisory is provided below, and can also be
found at
https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2018-08.html

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any question.

Best regards,
