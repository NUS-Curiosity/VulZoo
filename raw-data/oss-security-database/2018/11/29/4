I think that's not what Marcus meant.

These packages on debian likely call bc via the commandline.

The idea here is that "mild" memory safety violations (invalid reads,
nullptr) don't get security treatment if they're in a standalone tool,
yet they do if they're in a library, which may have larger implications
in more complex apps.
I can somewhat understand that. (And decided for myself not to care
too much about CVEs anyway. Relevant for me is primarily that I shared
the info, so others can decide how they act on it.)
