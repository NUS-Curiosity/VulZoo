Author: Larry W. Cashdollar, @_larry0
Date: 2018-11-15
CVE-ID:[CVE-2018-9209]
CWE: CWE-434 Arbitrary File Upload
Download Site: N/A
Vendor: FineUploader
Vendor Notified: 2018-11-15, software discontinued. 

Advisory: http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=208

Description: PHP-based server-side example for handling traditional endpoint requests from Fine Uploader

Vulnerability:
The code in endpoint.php allows file uploads and doesn't check if the users authenticated or the file type.  This allows for executable files to be uploaded and therefore remote code execution. 

Lines 37-38 from endpoint.php:

37: // Specify the list of valid extensions, ex. array("jpeg", "xml", "bmp")
38: $uploader->allowedExtensions = array(); // all files types allowed by default
