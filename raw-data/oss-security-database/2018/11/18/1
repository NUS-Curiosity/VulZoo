Subject: CVE-2018-17190: Unsecured Apache Spark standalone executes user code

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
All versions of Apache Spark

Description:
Spark's standalone resource manager accepts code to execute on a 'master' host,
that then runs that code on 'worker' hosts. The master itself does not, by
design, execute user code. A specially-crafted request to the master can,
however, cause the master to execute code too. Note that this does not affect
standalone clusters with authentication enabled. While the master host
typically has less outbound access to other resources than a worker, the
execution of code on the master is nevertheless unexpected.

Mitigation:
Enable authentication on any Spark standalone cluster that is not otherwise
secured from unwanted access, for example by network-level restrictions. Use
spark.authenticate and related security properties described at
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html
