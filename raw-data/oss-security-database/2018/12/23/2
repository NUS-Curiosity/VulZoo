Subject: Use after free in monit / _handleEvent

Hi,

There's a use after free in monit that shows up if you run it for a
while on an active system with address sanitizer enabled.

I reported this in august:
https://bitbucket.org/tildeslash/monit/issues/764/use-after-free-in-function-_handleevent

Fix is here:
https://bitbucket.org/tildeslash/monit/commits/5827927c4623

The fix is unreleased, the current version (5.25.2) is still affected.
