Subject: CVE-2018-20191 QEMU: pvrdma: uar_read leads to NULL dereference

   Hello,

A Null pointer dereference issue was found in QEMU's implementation of 
VMWare's paravirtual RDMA device. It could occur while performing UAR read 
operation, as it did not define a routine to handle it.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash QEMU process on host, 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:

   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg03066.html

This issue was reported by Li Qiang.

Thank you.
