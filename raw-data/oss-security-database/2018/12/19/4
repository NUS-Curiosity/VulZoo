Subject: CVE-2018-20126 QEMU: pvrdma: memory leakage when creating cq/qp

   Hello,

A memory leakage issue was found in QEMU's implementation of VMWare's 
paravirtual RDMA device. It could occur while creating CQ/QP ring objects in 
create_cq/qp() routines, as it did not free ring objects' memory in case of an 
error.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg02824.html

This issue was reported by Li Qiang.

Thank you.
