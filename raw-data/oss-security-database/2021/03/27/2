While I am neither Wind River nor OpenSSL, I did notice on the linked
page that the upper right hand corner says:
Released: Apr 22, 2020     Updated: Mar 22, 2021

Without knowing much else, it feels like someone accidentally put a
"released" date as last year and the content management system went
ahead and made the article public. Hard to say without confirmation,
but I could definitely see that being the chain of events.
