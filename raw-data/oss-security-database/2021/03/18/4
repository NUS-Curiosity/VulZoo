`git describe` should be used instead for stuff like this:
	$ git describe --contains 3d63b7e4ae0dc
	v4.18-rc3~4^2~4

But none of that takes into account for the backporting of commits into
the stable tree, you need a different tool for that, which many of us
have our own.  If you use that you will see that the above commit really
is in lots of fixed kernel trees:

$ id_found_in 3d63b7e4ae0dc5e02d28ddd2fa1f945defc68d81
3.16.61 3.18.115 4.4.140 4.9.112 4.14.54 4.17.5 4.18

So this means that your RHEL 7 kernel, which is based on 3.10, somehow
missed picking this up when it was backported to the "newer" stable
kernel trees almost 3 years ago.

Is that a mistake in your kernel development process that should be
resolved?

But then you announce that CVE to the community with no context or
information which only causes us to have to do lots of extra work.

If it's Red Hat's goal to get some people in the Linux kernel community
mad at them, it's working well.  If it's Red Hat's goal to somehow help
the community out with this type of announcement, it's not working at
all.  You failed to site the fix, when it was, who did the fix, who
found the fix, and where it was actually fixed in, all things that
people here actually would like to know.

So, what really is your goal here?
