I understand and apologize for the confusion.


This issue was reported for rhel7 to us (which was not seen in rhel8
or later versions),  but it also  applies to  kernel before this
('3d63b7e4ae0dc') patch or kernel without this patch.


$ git tag --contains  3d63b7e4ae0dc
v4.18
v4.18-rc3
v4.18-rc4
v4.18-rc5
v4.18-rc6
v4.18-rc7
v4.18-rc8

..


Since this issue was reported to us,  identified as a security flaw,
and was fixed in the upstream, we decided to assign a CVE.


We appreciate and value your feedback and co-operation.
