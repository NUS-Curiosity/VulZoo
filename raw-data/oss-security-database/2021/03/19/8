Hi Sasha,

I'm sorry, but I can't let this email demonstrating a complete lack of
self-awareness go without comment.

I'm seriously baffled that you could type those words out with a straight
face.  As we know happens often, including with the recent iSCSI
vulnerabilities, upstream has intentionally omitted CVE information
from kernel commit messages -- in other words:
"they already have the information, and instead of making a bunch of
other people do the same job they could just share the information to
begin with."

Do none of you understand at all that the problems that exist are entirely
of your own creation?  Neither you nor Greg ever come to this list with
announcements of your own.  That you have to endure a tiny fraction of what
the rest of the world is inflicted with from your intentional actions --
sorry, you are not the victims here, and it's completely ridiculous to
paint yourselves as one.

Greg started his tirade yesterday with a false assumption that the stable
kernels had already fixed the one issue August of last year.  That was not
true (stable kernels < 5.7 were all missing the fix).  Then he claimed SuSE
didn't bother to backport the fix.  That was not true:
https://github.com/SUSE/kernel/commit/b93bddd7ae24aa8ebe48d13dcff4011a34861482

If you guys want to complain about bad information, leaving it out of useless
snarky replies would be a good start.

You're assuming too much -- it's quite clearly someone new at RH doing these
recent advisories.

Thanks,
-Brad
