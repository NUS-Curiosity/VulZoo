Please include what kernel version things like this were "found in" and
when it was fixed, otherwise you force everyone to go scramble just to
find that this was reported in July of 2020 and fixed then in the 5.9
kernel release and has already been backported to all relevant stable
kernel releases in August of last year.

In other words, no one running an updated kernel version from kernel.org
is vulnerable today, right?  Are you saying that specific distro kernels
are vulnerable to this?  If so, which ones?

Are you sure that SUSE didn't already assign one to this?

And if not, why not and why do this now?  Who is this report for?
