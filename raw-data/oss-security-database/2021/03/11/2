Subject: CVE-2021-20269: kexec-tools: incorrect permissions on
 vmcore-dmesg.txt file

Gday,

A flaw was found in the kexec-tools where it made the incorrect permissions
on the vmcore-dmesg.txt extracted from the vmcore of a previous kernel
panic.  It is possible that this could be used to leak kernel internal
information from a previous execution if it was output to the ring buffer
or part of the panic backtrace.   An unprivileged user with a local account
can use this to extract kernel internal information resulting in an
information leak.

TLDR: The vmcore-dmesg.txt is created world readable and should not be.
