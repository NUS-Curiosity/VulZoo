Yes, thanks. It would have been more accurate to draw the comparison
between ebtables and ebtables-nft, which is where the underlying
problem arises. I was trying not to get too into the weeds with
technical detail for the general user audience, who may not be
particularly aware of the names for layer 2 filtering mechanisms,
but I agree this wording is also mildly misleading as a result.

Should I have said "Netfilter-based platforms (the successor to
legacy IPTables)" instead, to differentiate it from Netfilter-based
IPTables?
