MITRE did assign CVE-2021-38165. MITRE raised the question: Does
2.9.0dev.9 (mentioned on the
https://lynx.invisible-island.net/current/CHANGES.html page) fix the
entire problem?
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/07/7 claims that
credentials appear in the HTTP Host header to an http:// (i.e.,
non-SSL) website.
