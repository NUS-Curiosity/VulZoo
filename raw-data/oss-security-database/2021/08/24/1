Subject: CVE-2021-33191: Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++: MiNiFi CPP arbitrary
 script execution is possible on the agent's host machine through the c2
 protocol 

Description:

>From Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ version 0.5.0 the c2 protocol implements an "agent-update" command which was designed to patch the application binary. 
This "patching" command defaults to calling a trusted binary, but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a "c2-update"
command. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as the application binary.  This was addressed in version 0.10.0
