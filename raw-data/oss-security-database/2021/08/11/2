XMPP has some additional protections against this in its design. It is
required, after TLS negotiation, for both parties to discard the pre-TLS
XML stream and negotiate a new one after TLS has been established[1].
Combined with TLS being considered mandatory by practically all modern
implementations and deployments[2], I'd hope that the attacks described
here do not translate well to the XMPP ecosystem.

However we all know standards are not always reflective of the real world.
We (the XMPP Standards Foundation and community) are always open to
researchers interested in this kind of thing, and have collaborated in the
past for coordinating disclosure of cross-implementation vulnerabilities.
