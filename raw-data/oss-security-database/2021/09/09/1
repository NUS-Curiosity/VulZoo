Subject: CVE-2021-38540: Apache Airflow: Variable Import endpoint missed
 authentication check 

Description:

The variable import endpoint was not protected by authentication in Airflow >=2.0.0, <2.1.3. This allowed unauthenticated users to hit that endpoint to add/modify Airflow variables used in DAGs, potentially
resulting in a denial of service, information disclosure or remote code execution.

This issue affects Apache Airflow >=2.0.0, <2.1.3.
