Looks OK to me.  I think @chromium.org would also work.

We've recently listed Oracle Solaris as primary for this one, so COS can
be the backup.

Both of these already have a primary and a backup, and I see no
immediate need to reassign them.  We can note your willingness to help
with them in case they do need to be reassigned later, or/and please
feel free to volunteer for a task that isn't currently fully taken.

I have no objections to you being merely a backup for "Help ensure that
each message posted to oss-security contains the most essential
information", though.

I think we've reached this point - please e-mail me off-list with what
address(es) and with what key(s) to subscribe.

Thanks,
