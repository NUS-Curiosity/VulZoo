Subject: [CVE-2021-22885] Possible Information Disclosure / Unintended Method
 Execution in Action Pack

There is a possible information disclosure / unintended method execution
vulnerability in Action Pack which has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2021-22885.

Versions Affected:  >= 2.0.0.
Not affected:       < 2.0.0.
Fixed Versions:     6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6, 5.2.6

Impact
------
There is a possible information disclosure / unintended method execution
vulnerability in Action Pack when using the `redirect_to` or
`polymorphic_url`
helper with untrusted user input.

Vulnerable code will look like this:

```
redirect_to(params[:some_param])
```

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
the
workarounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
To work around this problem, it is recommended to use an allow list for
valid
parameters passed from the user.  For example:

```
private def check(param)
  case param
  when "valid"
    param
  else
    "/"
  end
end

def index
  redirect_to(check(params[:some_param]))
end
```

Or force the user input to be cast to a string like this:

```
def index
  redirect_to(params[:some_param].to_s)
end
```

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 5-2-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 5.2 series
* 6-0-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 6.0 series
* 6-1-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 6.1 series

Please note that only the 5.2, 6.0, and 6.1 series are supported at
present. Users
of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible
as we
cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for
unsupported
releases.
