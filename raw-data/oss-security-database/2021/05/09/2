Subject: Code execution through Thunar

When called with a regular file as command line argument, Thunar
would delegate to some other program without user confirmation
based on the file type. This could be exploited to trigger code
execution in a chain of vulnerabilities.

This is fixed in 4.16.7 and 4.17.2. When called with a regular
file, Thunar now opens the containing directory and selects the
file.

A CVE ID has been requested.

Note: the fix introduced a regression which is fixed in 4.16.8 and 4.17.3.
