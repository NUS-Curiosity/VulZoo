Subject: Re: Open Source WAF testing tools

Hi Martin,

We made GoTestWAF with no any vendor-specific things. It's mainly cover
OWASP Top-10 and API data encodings such as REST/JSON, SOAP/XML, GraphQL,
and WebSockets since the latest versions. You can add your payloads as easy
as making Yaml files.

At the end of the last year, it was significantly improved by community
detects
https://github.com/wallarm/gotestwaf/pull/29 , thanks Vulners team and
a https://github.com/waf-bypass-maker/waf-community-bypasses project.

We are actively working on the project and any advice or suggestions in a
form of GitHub issue or pull-requests will be highly appreciated.

Have a great weekend everyone!
