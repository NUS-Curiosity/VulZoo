Subject: Open Source WAF testing tools

Hi, list,

Does anybody know an open-source tool for testing Web Application Firewalls?

In an ideal case, with an out-of-the-box-ready CLI/UI, PDF reports, and a
configurable set of payloads to test. I need it to check if my WAF
deployment and rules work well.

I found at least 5 projects, all made by WAF vendors.

1. https://github.com/wallarm/gotestwaf byWallarm
2. https://github.com/signalsciences/waf-testing-framework by Signal
Sciences
3. https://github.com/fastly/ftw by Fastly
4. https://microsoft.github.io/WAFBench/ by Microsoft Azure WAF team
5. https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-waf-tester by F5

The GoTestWAF project looks more active and supported by the community.
Does anybody recommend some other GitHub repositories, preferably made by
3rd party folks?

Thanks
Martin.
