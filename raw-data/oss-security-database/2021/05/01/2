Subject: CVE-2021-28359: Apache Airflow Reflected XSS via Origin Query
 Argument in URL

Versions Affected: <1.10.15, 2.0.0, 2.0.1

Description:
The "origin" parameter passed to some of the endpoints like '/trigger' was
vulnerable to XSS exploit. This issue affects Apache Airflow versions
<1.10.15 in 1.x series and affects 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 and 2.x series. Update
to Airflow 1.10.15 or 2.0.2.

This is the same as CVE-2020-13944 & CVE-2020-17515 but the implemented fix
did not account for certain cases.

Please also update your Python version to the latest available PATCH
releases of the installed MINOR versions, for example, update to Python
3.6.13 if you are on Python 3.6.10. (Those contain the fix
for CVE-2021-23336 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23336).
