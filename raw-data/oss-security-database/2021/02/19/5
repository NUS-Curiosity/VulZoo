Subject: Re: BIND Operational Notification: Enabling the new
 BIND option "stale-answer-client-timeout" can result in unexpected server
 termination

Hi Hanno,

by the time Michael was writing the message, we were still reviewing
the fix for the issue.

The fix has been made public now:
https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/-/merge_requests/4714

FTR we are not treating this as a security issue as this is a newly
introduced option and disabled by default. Same reason why not
make a new release in a haste. There’s a whole QA machinery
around the release which means that we would be able to speed
up the release only by a week or so, and that doesn’t make much
sense.

Cheers,
Ondrej
