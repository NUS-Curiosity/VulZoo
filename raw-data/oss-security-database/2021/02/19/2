I am confused by your actions here.

You warn people about a messed up release (can happen, no problem), you
say you have a preliminary patch, but you make it extra complicated to
get that patch? Why not just post the patch?

Also I read into your words that you don't plan to publish a quick
followup release, which would be the right thing to do ("we expect to
have a patch ready well before the next maintenance release" - I read
that as you don't plan to make a new maintenance release as soon as
the patch is ready, which would be the right thing to do).
