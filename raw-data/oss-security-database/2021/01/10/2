We had some discussions on the above with Gentoo folks off-list.  The
outcome is that Gentoo is unable to continue handling the statistics
task from the beginning of 2021 and on.  Yury has left Gentoo's security
team (and thus is now unsubscribed from linux-distros), but is
nevertheless willing to update the statistics until the end of 2020 as
he had kindly offered, in his personal capacity.  Thank you, Yury!

As to the missing period when Yury was off list, I am suggesting he uses
the headers-only archive I've just posted publicly to try and map issues
to oss-security postings.  Where headers are not enough, Yury will need
to ping me or someone from Gentoo who was on the list at the time to
help match things.
