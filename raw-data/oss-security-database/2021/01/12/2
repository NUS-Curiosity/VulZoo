I still do not understand why you report issues that are fixed over a
year ago (October 2019) and assign them a CVE like this.  Who does this
help out?  And what about the thousands of other issues that are fixed
in the kernel and not assigned a CVE like this, are they somehow not as
important to your group?

What determines what you want to give a CVE to and what you do not?
