Subject: CVE-2021-20196 QEMU: block: fdc: null pointer dereference may lead
 to guest crash

   Hello,

A NULL pointer dereference issue was found in the Floopy disk emulator of 
QEMU. It could occur while processing read/write ioport commands, if the 
selected Floopy drive is not initialised with a block device. A privileged 
guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting 
in DoS scenario.
