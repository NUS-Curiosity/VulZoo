If you believe them, the researchers never intended to allow the bad
commits into the kernel:

On the one hand, they're wasting everyone's time to report a
vulnerability that everyone knows exists already and finding
conclusions that are all obvious and/or useless. But on the other hand,
they don't sound quite as daft as the headlines make them seem. Overly
naive for sure.
