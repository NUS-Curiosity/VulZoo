Solaris also has secure_getenv since the 11.3.10 release.  It uses the
issetugid() call that's been available since Solaris 9 (2002) and which
is also available in FreeBSD & OpenBSD:

https://man.openbsd.org/issetugid.2
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=issetugid&sektion=2
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E88353_01/html/E37841/issetugid-2.html

Though Nico Williams warns not all implementations work the same way:
