Subject: CVE-2020-17517: Apache Ozone: Ozone S3 Gateway allows bucket and key
 access to non authenticated users

Description:

The S3 buckets and keys in a secure Apache Ozone Cluster must be
inaccessible to anonymous access by default. The current security
vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command
or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access
to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or
users.  This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.

Mitigation:

Upgrade to the latest Apache Ozone 1.1.0 release.

Apache Ozone would like to thank Kota Uenishi for reporting this issue.


Thanks,

Apache Ozone Team.
