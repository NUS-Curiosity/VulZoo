Subject: [kubernetes] CVE-2021-25735: Validating Admission Webhook does not
 observe some previous fields

A security issue was discovered in kube-apiserver that could allow node
updates to bypass a Validating Admission Webhook. You are only affected by
this vulnerability if you run a Validating Admission Webhook for Nodes that
denies admission based at least partially on the old state of the Node
object.

This issue has been rated Medium (
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H>),
and assigned CVE-2021-25735.

Note: This only impacts validating admission plugins that rely on old
values in certain fields, and does not impact calls from kubelets that go
through the built-in NodeRestriction admission plugin.
