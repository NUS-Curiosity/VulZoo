If you alert the crowd that something is about to happen, you can no 
longer observe how the crowd acts in an unalerted state, dooming the 
research effort.

Not to encourage UMN's conduct, but I'd find that the prank shows on TV 
(let alone Youtube) are a much more severe intrusion, but somehow those 
shows still run.


What's more, with the pitchfork way this incident is being responded to, 
future researchers may choose to operate more stealthily; no more 
mailings from an edu mail address, more elaborate internet avatars (did 
we ever prove who George Spelvin was?), up to the point that the 
identities become indistinguishable from a foreign malignent elite 
hacker group.
