Subject: CVE-2021-44143: heap overflow in isync/mbsync

description:

A flaw was found in mbsync versions 1.4.0 through 1.4.3. Due to an
unchecked condition, a malicious or compromised IMAP server could use
a crafted mail message that lacks headers (i.e., one that
starts with an empty line) to provoke a heap overflow, which could
conceivably be exploited for remote code execution.

mitigation:

upgrade to the freshly released v1.4.4 available from 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/isync/files/isync/ , or apply the 
attached patch.
