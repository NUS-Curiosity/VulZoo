Subject: CVE-2021-44832: Apache Log4j2 vulnerable to RCE via JDBC Appender
 when attacker controls configuration 

Severity: moderate

Description:

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.

This issue is being tracked as LOG4J2-3293,
