SECURITY-2330 / CVE-2021-21669
Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin 1.72 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with the ability to call webhooks configured to
extract parameters using XPath to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML request
body that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins
controller or server-side request forgery.
