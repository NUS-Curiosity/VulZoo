Subject: CVE-2021-34693: Infoleak in CAN BCM protocol in Linux kernel

Hello,

this is an announcement for recently reported infoleaks in the CAN BCM
networking protocol in the Linux kernel.

The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-34693 and was found in kernels
ranging from 2.6.25-rc1 to 5.12.10.

The infoleak can be found in struct bcm_msg_head, which is a structure used to
describe CAN BCM messages. Due to an automatically introduced padding,
the structure contains a 4-byte hole which is never initialized. The 4-byte hole
will contain data from the kernel stack as the structure is allocated on the
stack. Depending on the architecture, the leak happens at different places
within the structure.

On 64-bit systems,
the 4-byte hole can be found between struct members count and ival1.
In this case, kernel addresses can be partially revealed.

On 32-bit systems,
the 4-byte hole can be found between struct members nframes and frames[0].
In this case, kernel addresses can be fully revealed, resulting in a feasible
KASLR bypass.

The leak can be reached by an unprivileged user by
reproducing the following steps:

- open and connect a CAN BCM socket
- sendmsg() with RX_SETUP on socket to setup CAN BCM message receiver
- message will be received by the message receiver, packed with struct
  bcm_msg_head and queued for reception
- recvmsg() to receive the message, finally leaking the uninitialized bytes to
  userspace
