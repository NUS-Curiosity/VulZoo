Subject: New Open-Source Forensic Tool for SQLite Data Recovery

Hi All,

As an editorial assistant in the International Journal of Cyber
Forensics and Advanced Threat Investigations (ISSN: 2753-9997), I
would like to advertise a new open-source tool presented recently in
the journal.

(FQLite) is a tool to find and restore deleted records in SQLite
databases. It, therefore, examines the database for entries marked as
deleted. Those entries can be recovered and displayed. It is written
with the Java programming language. The program can operate in two
different modes. It can be started from the command line (CLI mode). A
simple graphical user interface is also supported (GUI mode).

The program is able to search an SQLite database file for regular as
well as deleted records.

Official Project Webpage
---------------------------------
Check out the latest binary version (as a runnable jar-Archive) from
the official project homepage:

Technical Background
------------------------------------
On overview article highlighting the technical background of FQLite
can be retrieved from

Pawlaszczyk, D., & Hummert, C. (2021). Making the Invisible Visible
â€“Techniques for Recovering Deleted SQLite Data Records. International
Journal of Cyber Forensics and Advanced Threat Investigations, 1(1-3),
27-41. DOI: https://doi.org/10.46386/ijcfati.v1i1-3.17

Prerequisites
------------------
To run the tool you need at least a Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or higher.

Example Usage
----------------------
To run the FQLite in GUI mode the executable jar can normally be
started with a double-click on the jar-archive file. If this does not
work, since javaw is not linked correctly to .jar files, you can use
the command line as well:

$>java -jar fqlite.jar

To run the FQLite from the command line you can use the following command:

$>java -cp fqlite.jar fqlite.base.MAIN <database.db>
