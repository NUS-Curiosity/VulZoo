SECURITY-2370 / CVE-2021-21661
Kubernetes CLI Plugin 1.10.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks
in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.


SECURITY-1981 / CVE-2021-21662
XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission
check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.


SECURITY-1982 / CVE-2021-21663 (missing permission check) & CVE-2021-21664 (incorrect permission check) & CVE-2021-21665 (CSRF)
XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.1 and earlier does not (correctly) perform
a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing Username/password credentials stored in
Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-2367 / CVE-2021-21666
Kiuwan Plugin 1.6.0 and earlier does not escape output that can indirectly
be controlled through query parameters in an error message for a form
validation endpoint.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

NOTE: Only older releases of Jenkins are affected by this vulnerability.
Jenkins 2.275 and newer, LTS 2.263.2 and newer include a protection
preventing this from being exploitable.
