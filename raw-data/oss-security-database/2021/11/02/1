Along the same lines, there were a myriad of attacks using bash-style
sequences to obscure parts of patches inside of git show/git log/less/
other pagers not too long ago (circa 2017, maybe?). We even discussed
similar possibilities on this paper[1] (sec 4.3) when mentioning git
commit signing of content displayed on collaborative coding platforms.

Overall there's a plethora of work around "punycode meets tool X" that
I'm surprised this is called novel.

Cheers!
