SECURITY-2219 / CVE-2021-21699
Active Choices Plugin 2.5.6 and earlier does not escape the parameter name
of reactive parameters and dynamic reference parameters.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.


SECURITY-2406 / CVE-2021-21700
Scriptler Plugin 3.3 and earlier does not escape the name of scripts on the
UI when asking to confirm their deletion.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to create Scriptler scripts.


SECURITY-2394 / CVE-2021-21701
Performance Plugin 3.20 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control workspace contents to have Jenkins
parse a crafted XML report file that uses external entities for extraction
of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2415 / CVE-2021-43576
pom2config Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read and Item/Read permissions to have
Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction
of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2488 / CVE-2021-43577
OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin 5.1.1 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control workspace contents to have Jenkins
parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2525 / CVE-2021-43578
Squash TM Publisher (Squash4Jenkins) Plugin 1.0.0 and earlier implements an
agent-to-controller message that does not implement any validation of its
input.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to replace arbitrary
files on the Jenkins controller file system with an attacker-controlled
JSON string.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
