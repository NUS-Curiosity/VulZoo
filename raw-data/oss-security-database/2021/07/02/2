Subject: Django: CVE-2021-35042: Potential SQL injection via unsanitized
 QuerySet.order_by() input

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2021/jul/01/security-releases/

In accordance with `our security release policy
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/>`_, the 
Django team
is issuing
`Django 3.2.5 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2.5/>`_ and
`Django 3.1.13 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.1.13/>`_.
These releases address the security issue with severity "high" detailed 
below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

CVE-2021-35042: Potential SQL injection via unsanitized 
``QuerySet.order_by()`` input
=====================================================================================

Unsanitized user input passed to ``QuerySet.order_by()`` could bypass 
intended
column reference validation in path marked for deprecation resulting in a
potential SQL injection even if a deprecation warning is emitted.

As a mitigation the strict column reference validation was restored for the
duration of the deprecation period. This regression appeared in 3.1 as a 
side
effect of fixing `#31426 <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31426>`_.

The issue is not present in the main branch as the deprecated path has been
removed.

Thanks to Joel Saunders for the report.
