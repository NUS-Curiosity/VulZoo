The "sys" module is compiled into the Python interpreter itself. 
Importing it never involves traversing sys.path.

The "os" module is another story. This module is imported during the 
interpreter initialization, apparently before cwd is added to sys.path, 
so subsequent "import os" is no-op. But if you tried reloading it, the 
code from cwd would be executed:

   $ echo 'print("moo")' > os.py
   $ python3 -c 'import os; print(os)'
   <module 'os' from '/usr/lib/python3.9/os.py'>
   $ python3 -c 'import os, importlib; importlib.reload(os)'
   moo
