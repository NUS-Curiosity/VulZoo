I think it'd be most convincing for us all to see specific examples of
you having "applied security patches soon after they are made public",
with dates public vs. fixed in Pop!_OS.

Please choose a specific task (or several).

I suggest the statistics task:

"13. Keep track of per-report and per-issue handling and disclosure
timelines (at least times of notification of the private list and of
actual public disclosure), at regular intervals produce and share
statistics (most notably, the average embargo duration) as well as the
raw data (except on issues that are still under embargo) by posting to
oss-security - primary: Amazon, backup: Gentoo"

As you can see, it is currently assigned to Amazon and Gentoo, but as
far as I can see neither is actually handling it now, so I'd like to
formally unassign it from them and have another distro handle it.

It can also be "someone else who has been active on oss-security for
years but is not affiliated".  Anyone?

Thanks,
