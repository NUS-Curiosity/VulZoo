Subject: [OSSA-2021-001] Neutron: Anti-spoofing bypass for Open vSwitch
 networks (CVE-2021-20267)

=============================================================
OSSA-2021-001: Anti-spoofing bypass for Open vSwitch networks
=============================================================

:Date: July 12, 2021
:CVE: CVE-2021-20267


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Neutron: <16.3.3, >=17.0.0 <17.1.3, =18.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
David Sinquin with Gandi.net reported a vulnerability in Neutron's
default Open vSwitch firewall rules. By sending carefully crafted
packets, anyone in control of a server instance connected to the
virtual switch can impersonate the IPv6 addresses of other systems
on the network, resulting in denial of service or in some cases
possibly interception of traffic intended for other destinations.
Only deployments using the Open vSwitch driver are affected.
