I recognize Jeremy's name and IRC nick (jackpot51) from a few
discussions that we've had in the Ubuntu bug tracker and Ubuntu related
IRC channels. Our interactions don't go very deep but they were security
related. This was right around the time Pop!_OS would have been in
initial development (2017, according to Wikipedia).

I typically only "vouch" for people on linux-distros when I personally
know and have worked closely with them. That's not the case with Jeremy
but I do believe that he's in the correct line of work for membership
purposes.
