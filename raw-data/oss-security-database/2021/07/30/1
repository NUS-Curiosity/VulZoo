Updates are now available for v16.x, v14.x, and v12.x Node.js release lines.

We normally like to give advance notice and provide releases in which the 
only  changes are security fixes, but since this vulnerability was already 
public we felt it was more important to get this fix out fast in releases 
that were  already planned.
