Subject: CVE website transition from cve.mitre.org to cve.org

FYI for those who aren't subscribed to the CVE newsletter or blog and
don't follow https://twitter.com/CVEannounce/ - they've sent out this
announcement in this month's newsletter:

 > Introducing the all-new CVE Program website at its new “CVE.ORG” web address:
 > WWW.CVE.ORG. The new website includes many new features and is optimized for
 > users.
 >
 > This is the first step in transitioning from the old CVE.MITRE.ORG website.
 > The phased quarterly transition process began today and will last for up to
 > one year. During the quarterly transition, new releases of this website will
 > occur every quarter, and the new CVE.ORG website will operate concurrently
 > with the CVE.MITRE.ORG website. Upon completion of the phased transition,
 > the CVE.MITRE.ORG website will be archived and retired.
 >
 > Items moved to this new site will no longer be maintained on the old the
 > website; for example, news, blogs, podcasts, and the list of CVE Numbering
 > Authorities (CNAs). Examples of major items that will temporarily remain on
 > the old CVE.MITRE.ORG site until later in the transition include the CVE List
 > keyword search and the individual CVE List download files. CVE Records will be
 > published on both sites during the transition.

Most important for members of this mailing list are:

https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/ReportRequest
  - documentation of the process to request assignment or updating of a CVE id

https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners
  - list of CNAs to request a CVE assignment or update from.

https://cveform.mitre.org/ appears to still be the form to request those from
Mitre if another CNA is not more appropriate.
