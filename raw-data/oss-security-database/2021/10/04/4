Subject: Re: 3 new CVE's in vim

Those incentives for reporting bugs as security vulnerabilities
haven't changed.  But previously maintainers had more incentive
to push back on claiming a bug was a security vulnerability - its
often more work for them to put out an advisory/new release than
just checking in a non-security fix.  Certainly I know as one of
the X.Org security team we'd not list things as security bugs if
they didn't let an attacker do something outside the bounds of
expected operation - for example, the X11 protocol already lets
a client terminate the connection of another client, so a bug
letting you do that is just a bug, not a vulnerability.
