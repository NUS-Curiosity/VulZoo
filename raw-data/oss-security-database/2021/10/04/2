I do note all three of these were submitted via huntr.dev, which offers
bounties for both reporting & fixing security bugs.  As a maintainer of
an upstream open source project which is struggling with finding people
to fix reported security bugs [1], I do appreciate the additional
incentive to provide fixes here.  But as a maintainer of a distro, I see
a mismatch with the incentives here, as you get bounties for accepting
everything as a security bug and not pushing back, and flooding the
distros with CVE's - even if your distro policy isn't to handle every
CVE that applies, security auditors will often make your users query
about every CVE that they think applies, costing your time to respond.
