Thanks.  Looks like the same fix you already shared on September 1.

I also found this was (first?) made public on Linux kernel mailing lists
(linux-nfc, netdev, linux-kernel) on October 7 by someone from Canonical
(and Lin was CC'ed):

https://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2021/10/07/239

Canonical didn't break the embargo there because it was supposed to be
already over by then, however I think it was their opportunity to remind
about the need to make the oss-security posting, or to make the posting
themselves.  Speaking of which, I think SUSE (as they first reminded) or
Gentoo or Amazon (as they're tasked with this) could and should have
brought this to oss-security shortly after Lin didn't reply to the
September 17 reminder.  To send a reminder and forget for another month
isn't a reliable approach.
