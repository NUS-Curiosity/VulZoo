Subject: CVE Request -- Pidgin v2.7.6 <= x <= v2.7.8 -- MSN DirectConnect
 DoS (crash due NULL ptr dereference) after receiving a short P2P message

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   Pidgin upstream has released the latest v2.7.9 version:
   [1] http://pidgin.im/pipermail/support/2010-December/009251.html

   addressing one security flaw in the MSN protocol:
   [2] http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=49

   Upstream changeset:
   [3] http://developer.pidgin.im/viewmtn/revision/info/aaa07bde3c51d3684391ae6ed86b6dbaeab5d031

   References:
   [4] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=665421

   Further issue details from Stu Tomlinson (issue discoverer):
   <begin quote>
   I should clarify that because this is in the direct connection code it
   is not dependent on what the servers send us but rather what other
   clients send, so is susceptible to attack by malicious clients.

   I think only libpurple 2.7.6-2.7.8 are vulnerable because it was
   introduced by the MSN code remodelling that was merged in 2.7.6, not due
   to what the servers send.

   Regards,
   Stu.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this issue?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
