Subject: CVE Request: local privilege escalation via /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/custom_method

Hi,

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;h=ed3aada1bf34c5a9e98af167f125f8a740fc726a

changes /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/custom_method from -w--w--w- to -w-------.

This custom_method file allows to inject custom ACPI methods into the
ACPI interpreter tables.

This control file was introduced with world writeable permissions
in Linux Kernel 2.6.33.

Fix is in 2.6.37rc and the 2.6.36.2 stable release so far.

I would say that privilege escalation is possible.

Ciao, Marcus
