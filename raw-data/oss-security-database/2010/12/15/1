Subject: Breaking the links: Exploiting the linker

In the interests of a thorough peer review I'd be curious what people think of 
the following paper I've been working on Linux and POSIX linkers:

http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/downloads.php?id=77

A previous revision has already been reviewed but constructive criticism is 
always useful.  There are some sections that I have removed whilst I wait on  
vendors but I'm particularly interested in feedback on pertinent references or 
threats that I may have missed.  As per the abstract, the aim of the paper 
wasn't to claim everything as my own but rather to document as much about the 
current state of art as possible.
