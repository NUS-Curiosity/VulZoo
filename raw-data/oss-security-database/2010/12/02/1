Subject: CVE Request -- Wordpress v3.0.2 SQL injection flaw + two minor XSS
 issues

Hello Steve, vendors,

   Wordpress upstream has released latest v3.0.2 version, addressing one SQL injection
flaw:

   1), SQL injection flaw by processing trackbacks

   An improper input sanitization flaw was found in the way Wordpress
performed trackbacks (a way to notify a website when an entry that
references it is published) maintainance. A remote attacker,
with Author-level privilege could use this flaw to conduct
SQL injection attacks (gain further access to the site, which
should be otherwise prohibited).

   [3] http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/16625
   [4] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=659265

The two XSS issues below are minor, as they need Wordpress administrator to perform
the attack, but according to CVE philosophy, the CVE ids should be assigned for
them too. But these two opened / left for further discussion:

   2), XSS in requesting user credentials in order to connect to the filesystem

   3), XSS when deleting a plugin

   [12] http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/16373

Note: The other issues mentioned in:
       http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0.2

       should be only bugfixes.

Steve, could you allocate CVE identifiers for this / these issue / issues?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
