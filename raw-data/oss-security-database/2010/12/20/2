------------

Please note that there has been one attempt to request CVE for this
issue already [1]. The problem is that vendors (Red Hat more or less
included) used the assigned CVE for the potential heap overflow issue
[2, 3] whereas reporter used it for information leak [4].

  [1] http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2010/q4/107
  [2] http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2010-12/msg00026.html
  [3] http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2126
  [4] http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/drosenbe/research.html

I'd suggest to keep the CVE-2010-3874 id for the heap overflow which
has some (although very limited) security potential and assign a new id
for the information leak.

Thanks,
