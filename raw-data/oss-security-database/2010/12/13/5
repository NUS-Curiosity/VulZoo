Ok.

Well, CVEs are, by definition, for security issues.  When your release
notes indicate "fixed foo" under the heading "Security Enhancements and
Fixes", one assumes they are security-relevant, and if they're
security-relevant, generally they get CVE names.

I can't tell because I can't find any information, however if you don't
believe this is security-relevant, I won't pursue it.  However, I would
question whether or not it is worth listing under "security enhancements
and fixes" instead of just "key bug fixes"?

I wasn't sure if I had missed some discussion about this or not, so
instead of burdening the security team directly, I brought it up here
(also under the assumption that others would read the release page notes
and see those items listed under security fixes and may have the same
questions).

Thanks for the info.
