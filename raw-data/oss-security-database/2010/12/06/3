Subject: CVE request: kernel: igb panics when receiving tag vlan packet

If igb's SR-IOV and promiscuous mode are enabled and the interface 
receives a tag VLAN packet, this will result in a null pointer 
dereference. To fix this, we will backport upstream commit 31b24b95 to 
ensure that vlan_gro_receive is only used if vlans have been registered 
to the adapter structure.
