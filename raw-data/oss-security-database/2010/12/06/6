Subject: CVE request (PHP 5.3.x getSymbol() DoS; CERT VU#479900)

I haven't seen a CVE request for this already, and can't find a CVE name
if one has been assigned.

CERT has a bulletin up regarding a DoS in the getSymbol() function
(integer overflow vulnerability):

http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/479900
http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=305571
http://php.net/manual/en/numberformatter.getsymbol.php

Only affects PHP 5.3.x and probably PECL intl >= 1.0.0 as those are the
only versions with that function.

Does anyone know if a CVE has been assigned to this?  If not, could one
be assigned?
