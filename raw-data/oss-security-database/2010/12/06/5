Subject: Re: CVE request: openx unknown vulnerability before 2.8.7

The previously reported Open-Flash-Chart2 ofc_upload_image.php file
(vulnerable to arbitrary file upload) included in OpenX's video
plugin.

This is the commit (truncating it to an empty file):

https://developer.openx.org/fisheye/changelog/openx/trunk?cs=61683

FYI ofc_upload_image.php was found in a number of projects, including
Piwik (CVE-2009-4140), Open Web Analytics, and the Woopra plugin for
WordPress.

Regards,

Anthon
