Subject: CVE request: kernel: NULL pointer dereference in AF_ECONET

The Linux implementation of ACORN networking over UDP does not
properly look up the device an incoming packet was received on,
potentially resulting in a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference).

This is remotely triggerable if the econet module is loaded, but
realistically the only reason is likely to have it loaded is because
they're trying to run an exploit.
