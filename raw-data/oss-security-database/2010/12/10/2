 install_special_mapping skips security_file_mmap check

"The install_special_mapping routine (used, for example, to setup the vdso)
skips the security check before insert_vm_struct, allowing a local attacker to
bypass the mmap_min_addr security restriction by limiting the available pages
for special mappings."
