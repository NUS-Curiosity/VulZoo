This is a great request, thanks. It's quite large but you gave me enough
info that it's not killed me to figure it out.

Steve, I have a request for MITRE to handle at the bottom.

Thanks.

MITRE weighed in on this. Python *should* get the ID, but each fixed app
also gets one.
CVE-2010-4340



Steve, can MITRE take the one below. It's quite large and I don't have time
to do it right now. Thanks.
