Subject: CVE Request: CrawlTrack < 3.2.7 - remote php code execution

Versions of CrawlTrack prior to 3.2.7 are, according to the vendor,
vulnerable to a remote PHP code execution attack if the stats pages
are public

Vendor changelog:  http://www.crawltrack.net/changelog.php

The attack vector isn't disclosed but a diff between 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
show the vendor's fix was to escape special characters (using
http://php.net/htmlspecialchars ) in values supplied through POST
variables.
