Subject: Re: CVE Request -- MHonArc: Improper escaping of certain HTML
 sequences (XSS)

Earl,

http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/faq/security.html#htmlexchow

One of my hats is the Debian package maintainer for mhonarc. I'm tempted to
disable HTML mail support by default rather than try to improve it. What do
you think about the idea? What do you think about implementation? The
package does not have control over the resource file, so it would probably
have to be a code patch.
