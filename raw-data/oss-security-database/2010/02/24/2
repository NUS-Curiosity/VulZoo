Subject: kernel: RTO (Retransmission Timeouts) Remote DoS

"Make sure, that TCP has a nonzero RTT estimation after three-way 
handshake. Currently, a listening TCP has a value of 0 for srtt, rttvar 
and rto right after the three-way handshake is completed with TCP 
timestamps disabled. This will lead to corrupt RTO recalculation and 
retransmission flood when RTO is recalculated on backoff reversion as 
introduced in "Revert RTO on ICMP destination unreachable"
(f1ecd5d9e7366609d640ff4040304ea197fbc618). This behaviour can be 
provoked by connecting to a server which "responds first" (like SMTP) 
and rejecting every packet after the handshake with dest-unreachable, 
which will lead to softirq load on the server (up to 30% per socket in 
some tests).

Thanks to Ilpo Jarvinen for providing debug patches and to Denys 
Fedoryshchenko for reporting and testing.

Just a heads-up. Red Hat is not requesting a CVE name for this as it did 
not affect any of our supported kernels.
