       wide links (S)

           This parameter controls whether or not links in the UNIX file
           system may be followed by the server. Links that point to areas
           within the directory tree exported by the server are always
           allowed; this parameter controls access only to areas that are
           outside the directory tree being exported.

           Note that setting this parameter can have a negative effect
on your
           server performance due to the extra system calls that Samba
has to
           do in order to perform the link checks.

           Default: wide links = yes


This is samba 2:3.4.5~dfsg-1. Note the name is wide links, not wide_links.
