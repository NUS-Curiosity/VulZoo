Subject: CVE requests - kernel network vulns

1) gre: fix netns vs proto registration ordering
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/45553/

"GRE protocol receive hook can be called right after protocol addition 
is done. If netns stuff is not yet initialized, we're going to oops in
net_generic().

This is remotely oopsable if ip_gre is compiled as module and packet
comes at unfortunate moment of module loading."

2) tunnels: fix netns vs proto registration ordering
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/45554/

"Same stuff as in ip_gre patch: receive hook can be called before netns
setup is done, oopsing in net_generic()."

Thanks, Eugene
