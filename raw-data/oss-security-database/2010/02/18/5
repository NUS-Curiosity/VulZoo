Hmm.

Or you exploit the desktop user and then wait until he plugs in such a device
(ok, kind of a theoretical scenario, lets ignore).


Are we considering "giving desktop local users unintended rights"
a security issue or not?

(Hmm, init=/bin/sh booting and pressing reset might come into
 play here too. Then we would not consider that.)
