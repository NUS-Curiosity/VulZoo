Here's my updated list of patches to backport for this vulnerability:
  - 221af7f87 ("Split 'flush_old_exec' into two functions")
  - 05d43ed8a ("x86: get rid of the insane TIF_ABI_PENDING bit")
  - 7ab02af42 ("Fix 'flush_old_exec()/setup_new_exec()' split")
  - 94f28da84 ("powerpc: TIF_ABI_PENDING bit removal")
  - 1252f238d ("x86: set_personality_ia32() misses force_personality32")

Thanks, Eugene
