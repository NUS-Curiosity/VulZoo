Subject: CVE Request: gnome-screensaver termination by pressing "Enter"

Hi,

Yesterday an article was published by Heise News (a german IT magazine)
that said that the Gnome Screensaver in openSUSE 11.2 is unlockable by
just pressing the "return" key for some time.

The issue as far as we know is the following:

The unlock dialog shakes if you enter the wrong password. On the last try,
this dialog is also hidden again (so screen is blanked).

There is race condition between these two actions which can lead to an X error
which aborts the screensaver (and so unlocks the screen).

It is fixed in gnome-screensaver 2.28.1 release.

The news article (in german):

The GNOME upstream bug:
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=598476

I think this does not have a CVE id yet, so please someone allocate one.

I am not sure when this shaking was introduced, but it might be pretty new.

Ciao, Marcus
