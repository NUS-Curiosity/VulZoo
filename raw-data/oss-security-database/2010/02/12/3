Subject: Re: CVE Request: KDE screensaver unlock issue similar to GNOME one

Sorry it's not in the same thread, as I wasn't subscribed to this list
at the time.

I can verify that only KDE SC 4.4.0 is affected. Released versions of
4.3 are *not* affected by this bug.

I have committed a patch to the KDE SVN server as revision 1089213. See
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217882#c16

Although this solved the problem for me locally, I'm in the process of
having other testers verify that they can no longer reproduce the
problem with this patch, and will report back once this is verified.

Thanks,
Jeff
