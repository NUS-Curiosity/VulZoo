Subject: Samba symlink 0day flaw

As many of you have probably seen, there was a supposed Samba 0day flaw
posted to full-disclosure and youtube.

Samba has a response to this:
http://marc.info/?l=samba-technical&m=126539387432412&w=2

I'm not sure if this should get a CVE id. It is documented behavior.
Somewhat unexpected though. I think changing the default is the right way
to go, but it may be more of a hardening measure than a security fix.

Thoughts Steve?

Thanks.
