I'm not comfortable assigning IDs without more details. Those bugs don't
affect Red Hat, so I'm not in a position to spend time on them.

If someone has a decent analysis of the flaws, I'd be happy to hand out
ids, but otherwise I shall defer to MITRE if they want to give out ids for
one line changelog entries.

Thanks.
