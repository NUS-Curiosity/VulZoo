Indeed, it also needs this change for x86:
 http://git.kernel.org/linus/05d43ed8a89c159ff641d472f970e3f1baa66318

And the corresponding changes for powerpc & sparc:
 http://git.kernel.org/linus/94f28da8409c6059135e89ac64a0839993124155
 http://git.kernel.org/linus/94673e968cbcce07fa78dac4b0ae05d24b5816e1

All are in queue-2.6.32 now, btw.
