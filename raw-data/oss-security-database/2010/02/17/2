Subject: additional memory leak in USB userspace handling

Hi,

a memory allocation leak (not information, just unfreed memory)
was spotted and fixed by Linus during debugging of previous problem.

On put_user() errors it would leak one "struct async" per REAPURB call.

Fix is in commit ddeee0b2eec2a51b0712b04de4b39e7bec892a53, also
attached.

Affected code is also going back throughout 2.6 history.

The issue is of less importance than the information leak fix, I am not
sure if it deserves a CVE or not.

Ciao, Marcus
