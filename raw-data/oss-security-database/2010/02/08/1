Subject: CVE request - kernel: ima: fix null pointer dereference

Was cc'ed this in a couple of kernel mailing lists.

This was introduced in 6c21a7fb4 (v2.6.33-rc1).

It was first reported here http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/12/29/13, and 
subsequently here http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/5/76 (backtraces).

This can be reproduced by running ltp test pipe07.
