Subject: CVE request: kernel: mm: mem allocated invisible to oom_kill() when
 not attached to any threads

This is the OOM dodging issue that can be triggered with Brad's 
reproducer at http://grsecurity.net/~spender/64bit_dos.c. Written
in the comments: "The second bug here is that the memory usage explodes 
within the kernel from a single 128k allocation in userland The 
explosion of memory isn't accounted for by any task so it won't be 
terminated by the OOM killer."

I don't recall seeing a CVE name assigned to this, so please assign one. 
Upstream is still attempting to fix this.
