This appears to be these things:

* MSA-10-0017 XSS vulnerability in YUI 2.4.0 through YUI 2.8.1
    Use CVE-2010-3866 for this.

* MSA-10-0016 Multiple phpCAS library vulnerabilities
    This seems to have CVE ids

* MSA-10-0015 Customised HTML Purifier upgraded to 4.2.0 
* MSA-10-0014 Customised phpMyAdmin upgraded to 2.11.11 

These two have no real information I can see. They just say to upgrade the
upstream version. Does anyone have more information (I can't follow the
link to the tracker).

Thanks.
