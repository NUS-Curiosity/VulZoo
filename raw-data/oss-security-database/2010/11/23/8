I think calling it "blackmail" is a bit hyperbolic. Rather, it's simply
the next step in the vulnerability disclosure process: (1) research
reports vulnerability to vendor; (2) vendor refuses to fix
vulnerability; (3) research discloses vulnerability and requests CVE.

Am I correct in assuming that it is acceptable procedure to assign CVEs
to unpatched vulnerabilities?
