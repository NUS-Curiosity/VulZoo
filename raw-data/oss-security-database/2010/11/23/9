I think that the only way to support your goal is to make the case that
the CVE definition does cover such exposures.  In my opinion it
certainly does; although at the lowest possible severity.

The best course of action is to ask for the assignments, and perhaps
Steve Christey will clarify.  That's not "blackmail" or anything
nefarious, that's simply the proper procedure for disclosing a
security-relevant issue.

For those that are against increased CVE assignments due to the
inevitable sensational "high bug count journalism", get over it.
Realize that the people that do this simply do not recognize the hidden
factors at play and the fact that quantity does not equal quality.
They're a lost cause.

Oh, and Dan, don't get discouraged so easily.  You're tackling a hard
problem (well, a technically straightforward problem, but a hard
social problem). You're bound to run into barriers simply due to human
nature. If it were easy it would already be done.

Best wishes,
Mike
