Subject: CVE Request: gif2png: command-line buffer overflow problem

This is from 2009 but doesn't appear to have a CVE (no "gif2png" in
the CVE database).

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=547515
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=550978
http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2009-December/072009.html

Description:
A buffer overflow in gif2png 2.5.3 and earlier allows an attacker to
execute arbitrary code via a long command line argument passed to the
gif2png binary.

It was first claimed that it was fixed in 2.5.2 but it is reported
that it isn't fixed, I tested 2.5.3 and it still seg faults the same
way as 2.5.2 so it would appear it was never fixed, as the software
was last updated in 2005 I guess this one never gets fixed.
