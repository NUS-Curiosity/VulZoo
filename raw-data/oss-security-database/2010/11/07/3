Subject: Linux kernel proactive security hardening

Hi,

A push has started to try to get as much as possible upstream into the
Linux kernel from the various hardening patches that exist in PaX,
grsecurity, OpenWall, etc. I've got some details here:

And there's a sign-up list here, for people interested in helping out:

We could use the help. :)
