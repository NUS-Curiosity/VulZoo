In the past, Charles Cazabon's getmail would have had to be added to the
list, but he didn't care and pointed fingers at the Python library
developers, and I'm not sure what the current shape of getmail 4 is, and
don't care sufficiently to look it up.

Getmail used to happily connect to sites that have expired certs, for
instance.
