Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: L2TP send buffer allocation
 size overflows

There are not overflows in every send/recv call.  The fix that
addresses these issues in l2tp also addresses any other possible
examples of this problem in other protocols, including CVE-2010-3859
(heap overflow in TIPC).
