This is a big can of worms CVE-wise, since there can be multiple ways to 
fix a single issue.  As a result, I've come to believe that you shouldn't 
try to define a vulnerability exclusively in terms of its fix.  In 
practice within CVE, if a single fix addresses an already-public CVE-xyz 
and a whole bunch of other things, then we (generally) keep the 
already-public CVE as is, and assign a new CVE(s) to the "bunch of other 
things" that are simultaneously addressed.

For example - in package XYZ, you might have both XSS and SQL injection, 
where the XSS is fixed by input validation (say, by ensuring that a 
numeric input is actually converted to a number).  This fix will 
inadvertently address SQL injection, but a different XSS fix - say, proper 
encoding - would not.

This is one of those areas where we can't be completely consistent in CVE, 
and the amount of available information directly affects how many CVEs get 
assigned.
