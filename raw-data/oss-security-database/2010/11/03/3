Subject: CVE request: kernel: CAN information leak

The CAN protocol uses the address of a kernel heap object as a proc
filename, revealing information that could be useful during
exploitation.

The below post also mentions a heap overflow.  While there is a
semantic overflow (17 bytes being copied into a 9-byte buffer), in
reality, the object whose member is being overflowed resides in a
kernel heap slab cache that includes enough padding that there is no
possible corruption.  So, it's a bug but not a vulnerability.
