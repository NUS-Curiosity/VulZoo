I've just added a few hardening changes to consider (and edited/moved a
few others):

Sorry I did not sign up for any yet, although if I happen to work on any
I'll let you know.

I'd appreciate it if you keep the page updated with current status on
and links to work-in-progress and proposed patches.

Thanks again,

Alexander
