There are requests for openSUSE too.

Exactly. A community submission of an fscaps enabled iputils package
brought the issue to our attention. We were astonished that the
prime example ping doesn't drop it's capabilities. So it actually
shows why blindly applying fscaps doesn't help security at all.
So we are going to treat fscaps just like setuid bits and require
code review by the security team.

The next step would be to get rid of those setgid programs too then.
A daemon controlled via unix domain sockets could do the job just as
well I suppose.

AFAICT there are no special capabilities needed.

Thanks for the reminder! I actually didn't know. Here's a link
explaining sendmail's problem:

Indeed I ran into the trap when trying to patch ping to drop
capabilities. If a program is capability aware but still installed
setuid it needs to setuid(getuid()) before dropping it's
capabilities. Doing it the wrong way around keeps the POSIX saved
uid and setuid(0) is still possible even though getuid() ==
geteuid() and no capabilities granted.
