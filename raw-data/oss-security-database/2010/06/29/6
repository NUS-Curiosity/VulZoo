I agree that it's a fine line between security and stability issues.
In these cases, since simply viewing a TIFF image will crash any
application linked against libtiff, and given a past record of DoS
issues in image libraries (and libtiff in particular) receiving CVEs,
I see no reason why these bugs should be treated any differently.  In
any case, I leave that decision to those who assign CVEs.

In that case, we've got three CVE-pending issues, each of which have
been described in more detail in previous posts:

1.  OOB read in TIFFExtractData() leading to crash.

2.  NULL pointer dereference due to invalid td_stripbytecount leading
to crash (distinct from CVE-2010-2443).

3.  OOB read in TIFFRGBAImageGet() leading to crash.
