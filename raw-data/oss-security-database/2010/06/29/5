Subject: CVE id request: syscp

Hi,
can I get a CVE id for the following issue:
"today I received a mail about a severe security problem in 
the handling of open_basedir paths.  Customers are able to 
add whatever path they want via the documentroot of a domain 
by appending a colon to it and setting the open basedir path 
to use that domain documentroot, not the customer root."

Cheers
