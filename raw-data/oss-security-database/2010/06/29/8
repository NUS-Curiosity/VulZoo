Subject: CVE request: XSS in python paste

Hi,

Quoting [1]:

> Paste 1.7.4 is released.  The only real change is to paste.httpexceptions, 
> which was using insecure quoting of some parameters and allowed an XSS 
> hole, 
> most specifically with its 404 messages.  The most notably WSGI 
> application 
> using this is paste.urlparse.StaticURLParser and PkgResourcesParser.  By 
> directing someone to an appropriately formed URL an attacker can execute 
> arbitrary Javascript on the victim's client.  paste.urlmap.URLMap is also 
> affected, but only if you have no application attached to /.  Other 
> applications using paste.httpexceptions may be effected (especially 
> HTTPNotFound).  WebOb/webob.exc.HTTPNotFound is not affected. 

The commit fixing this bug appears to be:

Homepage:
http://pythonpaste.org/

Could a CVE be assigned?

Thanks in advance.
