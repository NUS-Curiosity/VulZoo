Subject: CVE Request -- Python-Mako (prior v0.3.4): Improper escaping of single
 quotes in escape.cgi (XSS)

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Craig Younkins reported:
     [1] http://bugs.python.org/issue9061

   that Python Mako (of versions prior v0.3.4), a template library written in Python,
   improperly escaped single quotes in escape.cgi. An attacker could use this flaw to conduct
   cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

   References:
     [2] http://www.makotemplates.org/CHANGES

Sample public PoC (from [1]):

   Proof of concept:
   print """<body class='%s'></body>""" % cgi.escape("' onload='alert(1);'
bad='")

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
