Subject: CVE Request: w3m does not check null bytes CN/subjAltName

Hi,

Yet another occurrence of CVE-2009-2408, this time in w3m. I tried
contacting the w3m developers listed on sourceforge but got no
response. In the default configuration the missing null checks don't
make the situation worse though as w3m doesn't verify certificates
by default ('ssl_verify_server' is off by default). Attached two
patches turn on 'ssl_verify_server' and fix the null handling.
