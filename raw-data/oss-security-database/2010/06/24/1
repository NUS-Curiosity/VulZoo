Do you have any info on this?  I don't see anything obviously related

This is NULL deref.  Another Sauli's test case shows that similar

td_stripoffset case addressed in upstream patch.

IIRC, Sauli's file only demonstrates OOB read.  Upstream bug:
http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2216

CVE-2010-2233 was assigned to this issue.
