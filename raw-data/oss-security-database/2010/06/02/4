Subject: CVE Request -- Beanstalkd (prior v1.4.6) -- Improper sanitization
 of job body (job payload data)

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Graham Barr reported that beanstalkd v1.4.5 and earlier, improperly
sanitized job data, sent together with put command from client.
A remote attacker, providing a specially-crafted job data in request,
could use this flaw to bypass intended beanstalk client commands
dispatch mechanism, leading to unauthorized execution of beanstalk
client commands.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
