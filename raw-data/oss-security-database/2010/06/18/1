Subject: VLC 1.0 series End of Life

	Hello,

The official release of VLC media player and LibVLC version 1.1.0 is coming to a 
close. The badly stretched VLC development team is not currently able to 
maintain more than two development branches at a time. The team has been 
focusing on the VLC 1.2 future series and the VLC 1.1 stable series.

As a consequence, source code for VLC 1.0 is not officially unmaintained 
anymore. There will be no further security or major bug fixes. The last version 
was 1.0.6 and will be marked formally obsolete if/when a major issue is 
discovered. I would also like to remind you that:
- the LibVLC API is known to be broken in all 1.0.x releases,
- that the Mozilla plugin is broken on X11 platforms in release 1.0.6, and
- that binary packages (Windows, MacOS) have already been discontinued.

If you need any of these, please update to VLC 1.1.0-RC3 already, or 1.1.0 at 
the earliest.

N.B.: VLC 1.0.5, 0.9.10, 0.8.6i and older versions exhibit known published 
security issues. Update urgently if you have not already done so.

Best regards,

--
