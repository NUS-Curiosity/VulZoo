Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Cacti v0.8.7 -- three security
 fixes

The issue in question has been fixed in 0.8.7f release and will be also 
including in the 0.8.7g release.

The fix is not in the validation of the vertical label field in the UI 
or database, but when the text is used in execution of the rrdtool 
command line option for the vertical label.

Please keep all inquiries directed to me.

Thanks,

Tony Roman
