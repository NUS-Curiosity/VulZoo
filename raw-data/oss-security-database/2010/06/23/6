when I reported the bug I had no time to further investigate and I think I
did not report upstream because of lack of time at that point and later
forgot - which is sad.

The php webinterface is a third-party development for mlmmj but part of the
official release.

The last official release is 1.2.16 from 2009-Sep-05.

On http://mlmmj.mmj.dk/files/ there is a newer version that is not linked
to on the official download page. This new version differs only in another
template-class beeing used, so all flaws should still be there.

Reported Upstream today: http://mlmmj.org/node/84
