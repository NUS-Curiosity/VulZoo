Subject: CVE request: UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 source code contained a backdoor
 allowing for remote command execution

Hi.

Quoting http://www.unrealircd.com/txt/unrealsecadvisory.20100612.txt:

"We found out that the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz file on our mirrors has been
replaced quite a while ago with a version with a backdoor (trojan) in
it. This backdoor allows a person to execute ANY command with the
privileges of the user running the ircd. The backdoor can be executed
regardless of any user restrictions (so even if you have passworded
server or hub that doesn't allow any users in)."

Basically, a system() call was injected into the source code, disguised
as a debug/log macro.

Filed in Gentoo as https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=323691
I have a diff of the 'bad' version against the 'good' version. If
needed, please contact me.

Please assign a CVE.

Thanks,
Alex
