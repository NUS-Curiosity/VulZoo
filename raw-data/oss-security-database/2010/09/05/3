Solutions / patches information:
================================

* for issue (1) -- seems it wasn't fixed / isn't possible to
   fix without breaking backward compatibility. More from [B]:

   "The old IV setup is kept for backwards compatibility."

* for issue (2) -- EncFS upstream has released a fix for the issue:
   [F] http://code.google.com/p/encfs/source/detail?r=59

Valient, could you please confirm, the above referenced [F] patch,
is the correct one to address the watermarking attack issue?

* for issue (3) -- not sure about patch status (included in [F] too?)

Steve, could you allocate CVE ids for these flaws?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
