We did try some other openssl based apps but most had either no
wildcard support, no real CN validation, or wildcard support that
use the old-style shell-globs which is much worse anyway. Unlike NSS
openssl doesn't provide a function for performing CN validation
which means that apps have generally rolled their own (poor)
implementations.
