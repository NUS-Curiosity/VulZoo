Subject: CVE Request -- Bip -- Remote Dos (crash) by exchanging user credentials

Hello Steve, vendors,

   A denial of service flaw was found in the way Bip IRC Bouncer
exchanged user credentials by initiating the IRC protocol session.
A remote, unauthenticated user could send a specially crafted
connection request, leading to bip daemon crash (NULL pointer dereference)

Could you allocate CVE id for this one?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
