Subject: Re: CVE request: padding oracle attack: ruby on rails 2.3, owasp esapi


grep'ing the Rails code revealed that encrypt() isn't used
for the cookie by default. Upstream also reports that they
are not vulnerable.
Additionally even if encrypt() is used to encrypt data in a cookie
there is also the digest at the end of the cookie string that might
indicate tampering. ("might" b/c it depends on the implementation,
which I didn't look at).

I got no answer from the POET paper authors yet but it can be
that CVE-2010-3299 is invalid.

Cheers
Thomas
