I'm not sure what the criteria for a CVE is but there's nothing
exploitable here in the vast vast bulk of rails applications.

It's certainly true that an application using the low level
encrypt/decrypt API is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, but as
you mentioned those apis aren't actually used anywhere within rails
itself.

Given the 'shoot yourself in the foot' nature of those low level apis,
we'll probably deprecate them as public apis and advise people to use
encrypt_and_sign/decrypt_and_verify instead.
