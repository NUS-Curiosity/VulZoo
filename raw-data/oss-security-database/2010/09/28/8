Subject: Re: CVE requests: POE::Component::IRC, Alien Arena,
 Babiloo, Typo3, abcm2ps, ModSecurity, Linux kernel


Here are the CVEs for TYPO3:
http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-012/


This is a good microcosm of CVE's main content decisions in action (i.e. 
SPLIT on different versions or different bug types) along with reading 
between the lines.  You see a lot of vulns with the same type, but many of 
them are SPLIT because of different versions.  Some issues have the same 
label, but it's pretty clear that they're really talking about different 
vuln types that happen to have the same consequence, so they're SPLIT.

When all is said and done, only 2 XSS issues are MERGED in this case.
