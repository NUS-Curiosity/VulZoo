Subject: CVE Request -- Python -- accept() implementation in async core is
 broken => more subcases

Hello Steve, vendors,

   Giampaolo Rodola reported a deficiency in the implementation of Python's accept() routine:
   [1] http://bugs.python.org/issue6706

   The following seems to be all symptoms for the same issue:
   A, SMTP (smtpd.py):
      [2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=632200
      [3] http://bugs.python.org/issue9129

   B, pyftpdlib:
      [4] http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/issues/detail?id=104

   C, ZODB:
      [5] https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/135108

   D, more?

Not sure, how to proceed in this case:
i,  if assign only one CVE id for [1] or,
ii, assign also separate CVE ids for the child symptoms? ([2], [3], [4])

Cc-ed David Malcom on this post, to shed more light how to handle this case.

Once the way, how to further proceed with this, specified. Steve could you allocate CVE id (ids)?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
