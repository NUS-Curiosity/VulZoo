Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Python -- accept() implementation
 in async core is broken => more subcases

Steve,

I'm going to leave this one up to you. While it's really a python bug, I
suspect several affected projects will end up patching themselves (I'm not
sure how MITRE hadnles this situation).

Thanks.
