Jeff Mahoney correctly pointed out that the first case
(drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.c) is not a security issue because the copied
data is from a union, not a struct.  I've gone through these again to
confirm that the remaining three are actually security issues.

Therefore, CVE-2010-3295 should be marked as invalid.
