Hello Steve, vendors,

Upstream references CVE-2010-2958 as CVE id for this issue. But it was allocated for PMASA-2010-6:
[4] http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/09/01/3
[5] http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2010-6.php

So could you allocate a new one for PMASA-2010-7?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
