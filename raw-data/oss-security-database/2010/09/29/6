Subject: CVE request - phpCAS: prevent symlink attacks, directory traversal
 and XSS during a proxy callback

Reported by Raphael Geissert almost 2 years ago but never really made it 
into the upstream code:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=495542#82

In phpCAS proxy mode the parameters submitted during a callback to the 
callback() function are not properly sanatized. The parameters are used 
as file handles for filesystem access and parameters in urls.
This allows an attacker symlink attacks, directory traversal attacks and 
XSS attacks. The issue has been fixed and patches are available:

https://issues.jasig.org/browse/PHPCAS-80
https://developer.jasig.org/source/changelog/jasigsvn?cs=21538

A new 1.1.3 release which contains the patch and various other bugfixes 
will be released within the next few days.

Cheers,

Joachim
