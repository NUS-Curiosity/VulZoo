Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/3] setup_arg_pages: diagnose excessive argument size

Readability and obviousness are in the eye of the beholder.   
Linus has merged my patches, so this crash is now fixed.  
As I said before, you should by all means send further clean-up
patches if you think they are improvements.

I have no special interest in this area.  I gave my opinions and
advice because I was CC'd, and then submitted some patches myself
because I was asked to.  I can't really keep track of all the
formalities.  The CC list on my submissions represented the set
of people I knew to be involved in the discussion.  I'm sorry if
you felt slighted.  I just pay attention to the code, not the
personalities.  The most reliable way to make sure your name is
associated with a change is to submit patches yourself in a form
that Linus wants to merge.


Thanks,
Roland
