This would thoroughly defeat the purpose of adding the thing.  The
only reason to have a new thing is so that userland does not have to
mirror the kernel's policy (as it attempts to do now, with the 1/4
calculation).  If the new thing is not something that userland can
use consistently so as not to have to know what the kernel's actual
policy is, then I don't see the point of it at all.

The information that these give is about the conditions at startup.
That's what they mean to userland, and userland only uses them to know
the situation before it has made any calls.  The definition of AT_EUID
is "effective user ID at program startup", and that fact does not
change.  You proposed AT_ARGMAX for a purpose that requires knowing
the current information in the process at the time it might attempt an
execve call, not at startup.  It is not an equivalent case.


Thanks,
Roland
