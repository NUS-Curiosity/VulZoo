Subject: CVE request: mantis before 1.2.3 (XSS)

From release notes

"Issue #12312 covers an XSS vulnerability in the upstream NuSOAP library. 
The fix has been applied to the library included in MantisBT releases, 
and a patch has been submitted upstream for future releases of NuSOAP. 
See http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12312 for further details.

Also included with 1.2.3 are another round of XSS fixes to MantisBT, 
improved excel export, translation updates, and bug fixes to the SOAP 
API, installation, plugin system, and email notifications."


So although it's both xss, one is in mantis itself and one in the 
shipped/bundled nusoap, so we should have 2 CVEs.
