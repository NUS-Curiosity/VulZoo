Looking at what we have on our Distros I found three different kinds
of behavior:
1) epiphany 1.8.5 with mozilla engine raises a popup window if the
   certificate cant't be verified. The status bar displays a broken
   lock icon if one chooses to continue anyways.
2) epiphany 2.28 changes address bar color, displays a lock icon and
   connects just fine even if it can't verify certificates. The code
   simply uses a strcmp for 'https' as trigger.
3) epiphany 2.30 shows the broken lock icon as described in the
   debian bug report

While the modest security indicators of 3) are probably not the most
smartest way to tell the user about a potential problem the real
danger is 2). That version of epiphany really is broken. If a
program doesn't implement the necessary checks it should at the very
least not display common https security indicators either.
