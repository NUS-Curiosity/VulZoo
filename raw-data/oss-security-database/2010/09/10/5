Hmm...
Probably my poor english leaded to misunderstood. I didn't intent glibc
is very crazy. I only intended to "even if userland is crazy, I disagree
to break userland".

And yes, we obviously need to expose ARG_MAX limit to libc. a duplicated
heuristic code easily makes confusion and mistake. nobody want such 
fragile state. however, it's a bit offtopic. anyway.


Thanks.
