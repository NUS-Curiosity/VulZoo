I'm sorry you think it's "very crazy" to implement the required
functionality in the only way available.  POSIX requires that execve
fail with E2BIG when the ARG_MAX limit is exceeded.  sysconf has to
return the correct actual limit that execve will enforce so that a
conforming application knows how much it can safely attempt to use.
Since the kernel uses the hard-coded RLIMIT_STACK/4 heuristic and does
not expose the true manifest limit any other way, sysconf has to
parallel the kernel's calculation.


Thanks,
Roland
