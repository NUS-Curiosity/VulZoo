Subject: CVE request: lxr

Hi,

While working on an update for lxr the following commit by upstream that 
fixes an XSS vulnerability in the search page was found:

> Fix XSS exploit in title string
http://lxr.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lxr/lxr/lib/LXR/Common.pm?r1=1.63&r2=1.64

It does not seem to be covered by CVE-2009-4497.

Please assign an id. Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
