Sigh, yes.

So to sum it up:

1.  XSS in the ident parameter, as described in CVE-2009-4497.

2.  XSS that is reflected via the search results page after issuing
This one is now CVE-2010-1625

3. 3.  XSS that is reflected via the <title> tag on the search page, as
described in Raphael's original e-mail a few days ago, which Josh assigned
CVE-2010-1448

Thanks.
