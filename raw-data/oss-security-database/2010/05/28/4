Subject: CVE request: ghostscript and gv

Hi,

ghostscript executes initialization files relative to the current
directory. Unfortunately the -dSAFER option has no effect on those
files. So when viewing a file e.g. in /tmp a local attacker could
have the victim execute arbitrary postscript programs.
Upstream suggested to use -P- in addition to -dSAFER. That however
would mean every program using gs to render postscript has to be
checked. So fixing ghostscripts default behavior might be easier for
distributions.

In the Debian bug report Paul also mentiones that gv creates a
temporary file in an insecure way:
