For Gv there is also the issue with pdf2dsc.ps (and the Debian lenny
version with the temporary filei creation stuff), so it needs to be fixed
anyway.

Gs's -P- not working (at least for gs_init.ps), is definitly a bug that
needs to be fixed.

I personally would also suggest fixing gs to not look in the current
directory by default (looking for important stuff in the current
directory is really always a bad idea). I guess the problem is how to
fix it.

I think (though I am not really sure) a gs that has -P- activated by
default would for example break pdf viewing of gv versions 3.6.2 to
3.6.5.91, because (I think) -P- also causes files in the current
directory can no longer be opened from other postscript files with
-dSAFER and the gv versions above only use -dSAFER and not -dDELAYSAFER
as it would need for pdf2dsc.ps generated files. (I think -P- already
has that effect, even though it has no effect on gs_init.ps).
