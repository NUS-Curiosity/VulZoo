I don't know what it means either.  Another part of daily life in CVE. 
However, the announcement comes from the vendor so we will ultimately call 
it an unspecified vuln with unknown impact and attack vectors related to 
"forum id" and "global announcement" or some equally useless description.

So this could use a CVE, too.  At worst it's a signal to consumers that 
they need to patch, even if the developer isn't clearly explaining why.

Not much different than your typical Linux kernel bug, actually :-/
