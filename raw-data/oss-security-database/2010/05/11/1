Subject: Month of PHP Security 2010 Issues

Hello,

Several CVE IDs have been assigned to issues mentioned in Month of PHP
Security 2010 page [0] However, there are issues for which CVE IDs have not yet
been assiged. Is it possible to assign CVE IDs for these issues as well?
It should be noted that these issues I am referring to are PHP issues,
not PHP applications.

Additionally, is there anyone who has a contact with upstream about these issues? It
would be really helpful to know the state of these issues (whether fixed, wheter in php bugzilla, etc)

Here is a list that I also mailed to bugtraq and full-disclosure in
response to Stefan Esser.
