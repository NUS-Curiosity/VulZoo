Subject: CVE request: phpbb 3.0.7 and before 3.0.5

http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=2014195

Please assign cve. Cite:
"Otherwise, it is possible for users to bypass permission settings under the 
following circumstances:

    * Feeds are enabled
    * Any of the posts or topics feeds are enabled
    * The unauthorised user - or one of the groups they are a member of - have 
forum permissions set on a private forum
    * If you have excluded a forum from the list of forums that provide feeds, 
it is unaffected"


Also, I think this phpbb 3.0.5 still has no cve (I requested that before 
here):
