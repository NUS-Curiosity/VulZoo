Subject: Re: CVE Assignment (gnustep)

Note that there's a second bug in there - a potentially exploitable
integer overflow leading to heap overflow when reading a file (or
socket) with a very large number of lines, causing several malloc()
calls to underallocate space.  This should probably receive a second
CVE.
