This is a long standing bug I think, where mremap with MREMAP_MAYMOVE set
of an address that was offset into a file seems to then use a different
offset into the file.

I cannot think of a security issue with it right now.

This one is likely a security issue.
The code however was introduced in 2.6.32, the hugetlb implementation
was very different in previous kernels.
