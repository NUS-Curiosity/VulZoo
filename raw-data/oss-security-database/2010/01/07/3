Subject: CVE id request: GNU libc: NIS shadow password leakage

Hi oss-sec,

Christoph Pleger has reported through the Debian bug tracker [1] that
non-priviledged users can read NIS shadow password entries simply
using getpwnam() when nscd is in use.

The issue has already been reported upstream [2], and a proposed patch
is available on [3].

It seems that all GNU libc versions are affected, including derivatives
like EGLIBC.

Could we please get a CVE id for this issue?

Thanks,
Aurelien
