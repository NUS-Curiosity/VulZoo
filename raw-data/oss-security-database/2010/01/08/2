No, that's not true. I have no experience with Linux NIS servers, but when the 
NIS server runs on Solaris (Sun Microsystems is the inventor of NIS), the 
shadow password information, which is in the passwd.adjunct.byname map, on 
the NIS clients can only be seen by root. When other users call for 
example "ypcat passwd.adjunct.byname", they get an error message that the map 
does not exist. Also, on Solaris NIS clients, the shadow password cannot be 
seen with getpwnam.
