I may be missing something here, or perhaps I'm not remembering correctly,
but NIS basically doesn't have any security in this respect. This bug
implies that a user has some sort of access to the NIS client, but the NIS
server would happily hand out the same data if the malicious user asked for
it (not using glibc let's say). While this may be a glibc bug (I doubt it,
as it would just be a false sense of security), I this this is a non issue.

If someone who knows more about NIS could chime in I would appreciate it,
it's been a very long time since I've even thought about NIS honestly. I may
be very mistaken.
