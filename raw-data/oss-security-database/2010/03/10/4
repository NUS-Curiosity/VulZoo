Subject: CVE Request -- aMSN -- improper SSL certificate validation (MITM)

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Gabriel Menezes Nunes reported:
     [1] http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2009/Jun/239

   a deficiency in the way aMSN messenger validated SSL certificates when
   connecting to the MSN server. A remote attacker could conduct man-in-the-middle
   attacks and / or impersonate trusted servers.

   Affected version:
     Issue originally reported against aMSN v0.97.2, but further research showed [4]
     latest aMSN v0.98.3 still suffers from the flaw.

   Upstream (testing) patch:
     [6] http://amsn.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/amsn/trunk/?view=log&pathrev=11991

Not sure, if this already got a CVE id, but in case if not, could you allocate one?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
