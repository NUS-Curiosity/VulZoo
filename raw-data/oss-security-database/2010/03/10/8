Subject: CVE Request: ViewVC 1.1.4 / 1.0.10 -- XSS via user-provided query
 form input

Just received an announcement stating ViewVC 1.1.4 and 1.0.10 were
released today. Looks like they fix an XSS that needs a CVE assigned.

"security fix: escape user-provided query form input to avoid XSS
attack"

http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/viewvc/trunk/CHANGES?r1=2313&r2=2342&pathrev=HEAD

Here's the patch for the XSS:
http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/viewvc?view=rev&revision=2326

* lib/viewvc.py
  (view_queryform): Escape user-provided input before passing it
    directly off to the templates.  Can you say "XSS attack vector"?
