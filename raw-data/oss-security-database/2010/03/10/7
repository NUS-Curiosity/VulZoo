Subject: CVE Request: DeviceKit privilege escalation via pluggable storage
 device labels

This is quite old, but I don't think a CVE name has ever been assigned
to it.  The issue is with how DeviceKit handled labels for pluggable
storage devices.  A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to
elevate privileges.  It has been corrected upstream.
