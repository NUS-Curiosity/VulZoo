Subject: CVE Request -- Dovecot v1.2.11 -- DoS (excessive CPU use) by processing
 email with huge header

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Dovecot upstream has released latest v1.2.11 version of Dovecot IMAP server:
     [1] http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2010-March/000152.html

   addressing one denial of service issue (from upstream announcement):
   "mbox users really should upgrade, because by sending a message with
    a huge header you could basically cause a DoS (this problem exists only
    with v1.2.x, not with v1.0 or v1.1)."

   References:

Could you allocate a CVE id for it?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
