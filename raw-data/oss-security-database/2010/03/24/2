NULL pointer dereference.

If the non-root user kills the task while truncating the file, this 
could lead to the existence of unmapped pages that still have an 
attached nfs_page structure in page->private. nfs_wb_page_cancel() waits 
for I/O to complete, and when it completes, it will find itself with an 
unmapped page and oops.
