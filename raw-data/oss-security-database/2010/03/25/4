Which will then be disassembled into a series of mail-merged individual
invitations (aka. multi-posting, which was worse than cross-posting)?  If that
would happen, I'd object.  I also object to "badly cross-posted" invitations.

A "List member[...]" might be a lurker, might be an occasional contributor, or a
regular contributor.  As a pointed question: Would you allow spammers to dump
their UCE here if they only were subscribers for four weeks?

More seriously, what relevance has the duration of a subscription?  My answer
is: none whatsoever.  There simply isn't any merit in being subscribed alone.
I find that this criterion, while objective, says nothing about contributions of
the subscriber to the list, and is therefore not useful.

I acknowledge that finding objective criteria is hard, but #4 is IMO just a very
bad loophole.

FWIW, I'm getting spamvertisements for conferences directed at me personally,
and I find that offensive and it should be a reason to prohibit the conference
altogether, so as to have a real incentive not to spam.

At the very least, conference advertisements, if allowed in moderation, should
be tagged so that people can automatically filter them. Filter instructions
could then be on the list's accompanying homepage.
