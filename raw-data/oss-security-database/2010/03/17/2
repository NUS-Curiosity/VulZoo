Subject: CVE-2010-0008 kernel: sctp remote denial of service

Telesys Software reported a flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() 
function in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) 
implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP 
packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.
