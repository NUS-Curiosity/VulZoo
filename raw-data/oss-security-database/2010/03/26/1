Hello,

For what it worthes : I didn't expect to trigger such a debate on the
list. I merely posted here because:
1) I'd really like to see people from this list to the HES conference.
2) I saw a hibt post on this very list little time ago.

Sorry for the blatant inconvenience...

Best regards,

Jonathan-
