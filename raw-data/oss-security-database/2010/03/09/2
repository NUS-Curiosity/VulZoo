Subject: CVE Request: postgresql integer overflow in hash table size
 calculation

I've been looking and can't find a CVE name for this issue.  Could one
be assigned?

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way postgresql used to
calculate size for the hashtable for joined relations. An attacker could
formulate a specially-crafted sql query, which once processed would lead
to denial of service (postgresql daemon crash).
