Hmm. Yes, RFC 2818 could be interpretet that way. RFCs 2595 (IMAP),
4642 (NNTP) and 4513 (LDAP) restrict wildcards to the leftmost
component. The LDAP one doesn't allow wildcards in CN's though and
none of them explicitly disallows use of the CN if a subjAltname is
present. RFC 3207 (SMTP) doesn't tell how matching should be
performed. perl-IO-Socket therefore doesn't allow wildcards for
smtp. perl-IO-Socket has the most flexible implementation I've seen
so far but intentionally only supports one wildcard at the leftmost
side. What a mess.
