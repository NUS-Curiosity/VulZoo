Debian provides an out-of-tree drbd module (drbd8), and it appears to
be affected by this issue as well. I assume we need to allocate an
additional CVE ID for it?

Here's a link to the upstream fix:
http://git.drbd.org/?p=drbd-8.3.git;a=commitdiff;h=71915b0d267392c77fe0ae2309535333026cef66

The in-tree version that got merged for 2.6.33 looks fine.
