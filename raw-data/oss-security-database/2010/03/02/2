Gah!  Sorry, I missed this other bit because I was looking on the
website and CVE-2009-3297 still says "** RESERVED **", but:

Sorry for the extra noise, but I am still curious as to why the decision
was made to reject CVE-2009-3297 instead of just indicating it should
have been only used for samba and had the other 2 assigned individually?
