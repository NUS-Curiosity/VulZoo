Hi Steve,

There are six CVE requests still not assigned with a name yet.

1) kernel information leak via userspace USB interface
2) kernel: ALSA: hda-intel: Avoid divide by zero crash
3) kernel: NFS DoS related to "automount" symlinks
4) kernel: dvb-core: ULE decapsulation DoS
5) kernel: NFS: Fix an Oops when truncating a file
6) kernel: bluetooth: potential bad memory access with sysfs files

Can you please assign a name to them soon?

Thanks, Eugene
