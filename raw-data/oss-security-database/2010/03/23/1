Subject: CVE request: kernel: bluetooth: potential bad memory access with
 sysfs files

When creating a high number of Bluetooth sockets (L2CAP, SCO and RFCOMM) 
it is possible to scribble repeatedly on arbitrary pages of memory. 
Ensure that the content of these sysfs files is always less than one 
page. Even if this means truncating. The files in question are scheduled 
to be moved over to debugfs in the future anyway.

Upstream patch:

Thanks, Eugene
