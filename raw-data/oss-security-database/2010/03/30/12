Use CVE-2009-4763

Notes:

1) SourceForge has recently made it difficult/impossible to obtain 
changelogs for new releases, so I can't find any information on the 
December release of ClickHeat to get more details.

2) Consequently, it could be that phpMyVisites is fixing an old ClickHeat
    problem (CVE-2008-5793) but neither is it clear if that ClickHeat is
    even the same product.
