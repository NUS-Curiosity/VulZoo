Basically a CVE naming authority or CVE needs to be told somehow of the issue.

No one will just go to bugtrackers and add CVEs randomly.

So there are usually external references to the bugs.

There is no reason why the bugs could not get CVE entries, it however really
helps if you have a list of 1 or more URLs per-issue prepared, as the database
is filled out by humans ;)

288 is however a massive amount and probably going back the history is not
that useful either.

Ciao, Marcus
