Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

  or the WebServices Bug.create method would not restrict bugs to
  Mandatory or Default groups.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Access to Confidential Information
Affects:     3.7, 3.7.1
Fixed In:    3.7.2
Description: Bugzilla administrators can set certain groups as being
             "mandatory" for when a new bug is filed. (That is, bugs
             are always restricted to access by those groups.)
             Administrators can also set some groups as "Default",
             meaning that if the user makes no selection about groups,
             the new bug will be restricted to the groups set as
             Default. In the unreleased 3.7 code and 3.7.1 development
             snapshot, restricting a bug to mandatory or default groups
             would not happen when the bug was newly created using the
             inbound email interface (email_in.pl) or the "Bug.create"
             method in the WebServices interface. This means that these
             bugs could be publicly available, when they should have
             been restricted to being accessible only to certain
             groups.
