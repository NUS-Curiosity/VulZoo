Subject: CVE request for OpenTTD

Hi folks,

the OpenTTD developers have indentified a security vulnerability in the
OpenTTD program. Would you be so kind as to allocate a CVE id for this
issue?

The issue concerns a denial of service vulnerability, in the form of a
hard to trigger infinite loop. The issue is reported at
http://bugs.openttd.org/task/3909

The first vulnerable version is 1.0.1, the upcoming 1.0.3 release will
have the issue fixed.

Once a CVE id is allocated, the issue will be documented at
http://security.openttd.org/en/CVE-2010-xxxx

Thanks,

Matthijs
