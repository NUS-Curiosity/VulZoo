Subject: CVE request: git

A fix for an exploitable buffer overrun was committed to git in [1].
In particular, if an attacker were to create a crafted working copy
where the user runs any git command, the attacker could force
execution of arbitrary code.

This attack should be mitigated to a denial of service if git is
compiled with appropriate stack-protecting flags.

This buffer overrun was introduced in [2], which first appeared in
v1.5.6, and is fixed in v1.7.2.
