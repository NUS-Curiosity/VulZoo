Subject: CVE request: kernel: btrfs

Fixes for two issues in btrfs were committed upstream:

1.  The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE and BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctls allowed a
local user to overwrite append-only files.

2.  The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctl was subject to an integer overflow
in specifying offsets to copy from a file, which potentially allows a
local user to read sensitive filesystem data.
