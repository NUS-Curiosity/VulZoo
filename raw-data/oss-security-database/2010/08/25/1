I believe we should try to clarify what CVE-2010-2055 got actually
assigned to, as it seems to be used for more than one thing:

- ghostscript uses CWD to search for initialization files
- gv did not pass -P- to gs, leading to problems related to the default
  mentioned above
- some ghostscript versions search CWD even when started with -P-

As previously mentioned, upstream changed SEARCH_HERE_FIRST default to
address this.  I believe SuSE updates did the same change already too.
