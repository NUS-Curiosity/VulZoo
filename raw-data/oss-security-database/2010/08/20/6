Raphael posted commit links earlier in this thread.

I'm aware of that commit.  It does not change
php_stream_wrapper_log_error invocation from phar_stream_flush, as
mentioned in MOPS-2010-024:

http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/ext/phar/stream.c?view=markup&pathrev=298667#l471

Hence the question if there is some less obvious change that make that
particular cases non-issue too.

Are you aware of any good bugs.php.net reference that covers the issue
in greater detail?
