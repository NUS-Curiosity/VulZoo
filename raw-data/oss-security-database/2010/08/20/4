As far as I can tell and see, both the mysqlnd and session issues have
been fixed.

Phar: http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=298667

I don't have the revision at hand for mysqlnd but it is fixed too
(5.3.x and trunk).

About phar, Stefen plans to make yet another blog post about this
flaw, to explain it. We'll see if we managed to fix it... (did I
mention that I love the idea behind responsible disclosure? And I
really love this list too btw :-).

As far as I remember, the resources related issues are not fixed (-22
and -03), it is also not new and related to the same bug. I also don't
think that it will get fixed any time soon as it is not possible to
fix easily. I think there is already a CVE about this problem.

The phar flaw is fixed (see link).

Please let me know if you need more details, I can try to dig again
the archive to figure them out.

Cheers,
