MOPS-2010-056 - MOPS-2010-060 as subject indicates.  Those are mysqlnd
issues and session serializer issue allowing data injection.  Not any
from that set of interruption issues that exposed one or two problems in
different ways.

Has upstream managed to track MOPS-2010-022 down to a proper fix
already?  That one was not fixed in 5.3.3.  I'm also wondering whether
the case pointed out in MOPS-2010-024 was not addressed in phar commit
intentionally.
