Bah, just re-read the below thing and you're entirely right, and this
was what I meant (looking at our bug, we never used 2533, and left 2621
as it was).  My intention was to note the newly _assigned_ one as a dupe
and I was apparently concentrating on the larger number when I wrote the
response.

Sorry about that, that probably created a healthy dose of confusion.

No problem at all.  Thanks for the clarification here Steve.
