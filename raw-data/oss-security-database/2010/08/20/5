Subject: CVE Request: heap-based buffer overflow in libHX



http://libhx.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libhx/libhx;a=commitdiff;h=904a46f90dd3f046bfac0b64a5e813d7cd4fca59

string: fixed buffer overflow in HX_split when too few fields are present

Jan Engelhardt [Mon, 16 Aug 2010 17:08:51 +0000 (19:08 +0200)]



When HX_split is called with a maximum number of desired fields (4th

argument != 0), passing in a string that has less fields than that led

to a buffer overrun (write beyond end of malloc'd area).
