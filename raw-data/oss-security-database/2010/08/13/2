Subject: Re: RFC: squid: Fix free memory corruption and
 off-by-on error when comparing SNMP OIDs

It's just bugs in the snmp initialization code and not considered a
security issue. But the invalid free may result in free heap corruption
(subject to quality of malloc implementation) which may then cause
stability issues later on. Both issues were introduced in 3.1.4 and
found in an project internal code quality audit.
