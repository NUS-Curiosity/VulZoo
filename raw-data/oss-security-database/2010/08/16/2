Subject: Minor security flaw with pam_xauth

Here's another bug where privileged code isn't checking the return value from 
setuid():

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3028213&group_id=6663&atid=106663

I don't think this needs a CVE as I haven't found a useful way to exploit it 
but maybe someone on here will spot something I've missed.  Either way, I 
would have thought it should be fixed.

Tim

PS Is it just me or does "I fail to see how RLIMIT_NPROC should have any affect 
on setuid." in the comments a touch disconcerting given that it's from the PAM 
maintainer?
