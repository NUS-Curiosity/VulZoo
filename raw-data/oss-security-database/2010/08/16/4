If the attacker can execute an 'extra' process in violation of 
RLIMIT_NPROC, then that would be technically a violation of the *intended* 
security policy, so it would count for CVE inclusion by itself - even if 
you can't manipulate the issue for code execution.  (Though somehow 
manipulating the xauth authority file may be fruitful to mess around with 
the display as root.)

Thoughts?
