That's appropriate in this case.  I'll let Josh assign a CVE to avoid the 
possibility of dupes.

General practice (subject to modification on a case-by-case basis) is:

- issue was never fixed and never claimed to be fixed: use original CVE
   (probably triggers an update to description for affected versions)

- issue was claimed fixed but the fix was incomplete: use new CVE

- issue was never fixed but claimed to be fixed: ??? (it's happened a few
   times)
