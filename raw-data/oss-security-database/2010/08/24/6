Subject: CVE Request -- Squid v3.1.6 -- DoS (crash) while processing large
 DNS replies with no IPv6 resolver present

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Stephen Thorne reported a buffer overread flaw in the way Squid proxy caching server
processed large DNS replies in cases, when no IPv6 resolver was present.
A remote attacker could provide DNS reply with large amount of data,
leading to denial of service (squid server crash).

Upstream bug report:
   [1] http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3021

Relevant upstream changeset:
   [2] http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~squid/squid/3.1/revision/10072

References:
   [3] http://marc.info/?l=squid-users&m=128263555724981&w=2
   [4] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=626927
   [5] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=334263

Could you allocate CVE id for this issue?

Amos, Stephen please correct me, if some of [1] and [2] doesn't correspond to:

"One regression introduced with 3.1.6 when contacting IPv4-only DNS
resolvers opens a small but exploitable DoS vulnerability."

issue mentioned in [3].

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
