Subject: CVE Request: SLiM insecure PATH assignment


Hi all,

SLiM versions prior to 1.3.1 assigned logged on users a predefined PATH
which included './'. This allowed unintentional code execution (e.g.
planted binary) and has been fixed by the developers in version 1.3.2.

Can you allocate a CVE number for this one?

Thanks,
