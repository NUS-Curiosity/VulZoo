I agree with you on this. I gave it an ID, as I'm going to presume that the
cabextract application is likely used in things like virus and mail
scanners, where we don't want a crashing application.

One of the unfortunate aspects of assigning a large number of CVE ids, is
sometimes I have to assume things, as I lack the time to properly
understand what's going on for everything. I figure it's easier to dispute
an ID than end up in the situation where a scary exploit vector is found
later. You are welcome to, and should, dispute this if you think I'm
mistaken.

I would have likely turned down such a request for say an image viewer.

Thanks for the followup though, it's nice to know someone is watching us
watchers ;)
