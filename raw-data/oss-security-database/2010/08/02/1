Subject: CVE request: kernel: gfs2: rename cases kernel panic

The problem was in the way the gfs2 directory code was trying to re-use
sentinel directory entries. A local, unprivileged user on a gfs2 mounted 
directory can trigger this issue, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=620300

Introduced in upstream commit 71b86f56 (v2.6.19-rc1), and fixed in 
commit 728a756b.
