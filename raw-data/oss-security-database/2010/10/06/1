We have a whole bunch of similar patches in Mandriva, just fetch the cooker 
source rpm packages and do something like:

rpm -qlp *.src,rpm | grep format

It would be a major task to push that to the upstream projects.

Just checked the ones I fixed (in 2008/2009):

$ rpm -qlp /SRPMS/contrib/release/*.rpm /SRPMS/main/release/*.rpm | grep 
format_not_a_string_literal_and_no_format_arguments | wc -l
106

So, at least 106 new CVE assignments there.


Cheers.
