Subject: CVE request -- libguestfs: missing disk format specifier when
 adding a disk

Hello Steve, vendors.

Description:
Libguestfs doesn't currently allow the format of a disk to be specified explicitly.
Because of that malicious guest admin can exploit automatic image format detection
in qemu, when the libguestfs is used to administer the image, to read arbitrary
file on host via forging a image header with backing store.

Could you please allocate a CVE identifier for this issue?

Thanks you,
