Subject: CVE request (2009): vanilla forums before 1.1.8

http://gsasec.blogspot.com/2009/05/vanilla-v117-cross-site-scripting.html


Input passed to the 'RequestName' header parameter when posting to 
'/ajax/updatecheck.php' is not sanitized before it is returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's 
browser session in context of an affected site.

Please note this should be a CVE-2009 id
