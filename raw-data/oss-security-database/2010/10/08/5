Subject: CVE request: usebb before 1.0.11 unauthorized access to content

http://www.usebb.net/community/topic.php?id=2501


A security issue has been discovered in UseBB 1.0.10 with per forum and topic 
RSS feeds in combination with restricted forum access permissions, giving 
users access to post contents that should remain hidden. Anyone having a 
restricted "read" permission set but NOT an equal or more restricted "view" 
one is prone to this issue.
