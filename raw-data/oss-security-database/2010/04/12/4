Josh, I think we should assign another CVE anyway.  The upstream vendor 
has explicitly labeled this as a security issue, so even if it seems of 
limited severity, that's enough to trigger creation of a CVE.  The use of 
the "remote crash" term also reinforces the need for a CVE.

This might be juse a plain old crasher from the perspective of many 
downstream vendors, but it's still worthy of inclusion in CVE because 
there is a significant population that would treat it as a "security" 
problem even if it's low severity.

Should I assign one or should you?
