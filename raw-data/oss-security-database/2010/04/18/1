i see that hvc_console is disabled by default in the debian kernels,
and i assume it is the same for the redhat kernels.

are issues in features that are disabled by default generally treated
as unimportant? there are bound to be a (perhaps small) subset of users
turning these features on; exposing themselves to more risk if these
issues go unfixed. i suppose cve assignment depends on whether or not
there is an expectation to protect those users in addition to
defaults-using users.
