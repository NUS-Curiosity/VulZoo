Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Abcm2ps v5.9.12 -- multiple unspecified
 vulnerabilities

I found:
* A BSS overflow from an overlong command-line parameter (-O)
* BSS overflows in a collection of output macros (PUT0, PUT1, etc.)
exploitable using crafted input files
* A stack overflow in trim_title(), also exploitable using input files

This is assuming my understanding of the linux memory model is correct
and uninitialised global variables are stored in the BSS segment. They
were all the classic sort of overflow, with arbitrary-length strings
copied into fixed-sized buffers.

Anyway, "multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities" is probably a good
enough summary for most of you.

I haven't reviewed the patch.
