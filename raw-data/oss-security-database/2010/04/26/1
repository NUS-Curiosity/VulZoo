  Project: Joomla!
  SubProject: All
  Severity: Low
  Versions: 1.5.15 and all previous 1.5 releases
  Exploit type: Unauthorised Access
  Reported Date: 2010-Jan-07
  Fixed Date: 2010-Apr-23

Description

When a user requests a password reset, the reset tokens were stored in  
plain text in the database. While this is not a vulnerability in itself, it  
allows user accounts to be compromised if there is an extension on the site  
with an SQL injection vulnerability.
Affected Installs

All 1.5.x installs prior to and including 1.5.15 are affected.
Solution

Upgrade to the latest Joomla! version (1.5.16 or later)
