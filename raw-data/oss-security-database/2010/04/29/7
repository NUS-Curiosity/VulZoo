I'm sorry. This was a mistake on our part. We had intended to send the
information to vendor-sec and coordinate with other potentially affected
vendors. Then once a reasonable coordinated time had passed to send it to
security@...nel.org as well as oss-security and lkml.

Our standard procedure:

* contact vendor-sec and coordinate with other affected vendors
* send the information to the project specific security list
* once public send the information to:
    * oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
    * other appropriate public project list(s)
