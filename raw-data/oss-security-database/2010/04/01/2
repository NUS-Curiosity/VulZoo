Subject: CVE Request -- Zabbix v1.8.2 and v.1.6.9

Hi Steve, vendors,

   though April the First today, this doesn't seem to be a joke:

   a, Zabbix <= 1.8.1 SQL Injection

   [1] http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Apr/1
   [2] http://www.zabbix.com/rn1.8.2.php

   b, also on 25 March 2010, Zabbix v1.6.9 was
      released:

   [3] http://www.zabbix.com/rn1.6.9.php

      fixing one security issue -- remote commands execution in Zabbix Server.

   [4] https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-1030

Could you allocate CVE ids for these two issues?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
