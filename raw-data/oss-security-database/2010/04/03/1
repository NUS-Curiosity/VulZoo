Subject: CVE Request -- OpenDCHub v0.8.1 -- Stack overflow by handling a specially-crafted
 MyINFO message

Hi Steve, vendors

   (based on http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=576308)

   Pierre Nogues found a stack overflow flaw, in the way Open DC Hub
sanitized content of user's MyINFO message. Remote attacker,
with valid Open DC Hub account, could send a specially-crafted
MyINFO message to another user / all users connected to particular
Direct Connect network, leading into denial of service (opendchub
crash) or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution with the privileges
of the user running opendchub.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
