Subject: CVE request: kernel: cifs: cifs_create() NULL pointer dereference

Reported by Eugene Teo. While creating a file on a server which supports 
Unix extensions such as Samba, if a file being created does not supply 
nameidata (i.e. nd is NULL), cifs client can trigger a NULL pointer 
dereference when calling cifs_posix_open().
