Subject: CVE Request: JIRA Issues

Hello,

As you probably know, Apache.org services were taken down due to the XSS and 
privilege escalation flaws in JIRA. Atlassian patched the issues, and released 
an advisory.

Bug entires:

XSS Vulnerability: http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-20994
Privilege escalation: http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-20995

JIRA Advisory: 
http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Security+Advisory+2010-04-16

Could anyone assign CVE IDs for these issues?

Thanks,
--
