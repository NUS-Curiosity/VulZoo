Subject: wafp insecure temporary directory

Wafp creates a temporary directory to predictable path and name. This
allows a local attacker to create a denial of service condition and
discloses sensitive information to unprivileged users. This also reduces
usability of this software, because one can't run more than one wafp-
instances at the same time. This issue can also be leveraged to delete
arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.

I notified the project:
http://code.google.com/p/webapplicationfingerprinter/issues/detail?id=8

Can I get CVE-identifier for this issue?
