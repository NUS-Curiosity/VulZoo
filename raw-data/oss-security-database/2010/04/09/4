I guess many people who deploy e-mail service with linux use ClamAV to scan 
the attachments. Accordingly to ClamAV bug #1771 (CVE-2010-1311), it is 
possible to crash the daemon with crafted file, which is not the intended 
behavior.

I think these can be flagged as vulnerabilities. However, I am not sure if 
these are critical issues. Accordingly to secunia, these are highly-critical. 
Is there a standard way to classify the vulnerabilities? Do anyone know how 
Secunia classifies vulnerabilities?
