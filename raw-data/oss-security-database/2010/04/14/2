Subject: CVE request: aircrack-ng EAPOL buffer overflow

An exploit for a security vulnerability in aircrack-ng has been
published:

| The tools' code responsible for parsing IEEE802.11-packets assumes the
| self-proclaimed length of a EAPOL-packet to be correct and never to exceed
| a (arbitrary) maximum size of 256 bytes for packets that are part of the
| EAPOL-authentication. [...]

The fix seems to be fixed in r1676 and r1683:

  <http://trac.aircrack-ng.org/changeset/1676>
  <http://trac.aircrack-ng.org/changeset/1683>
