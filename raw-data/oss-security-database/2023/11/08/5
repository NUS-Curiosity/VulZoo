I am not a lawyer, but I'd assume you would run into some issues with
the naming of all this -- wasn't that the exact issue that somebody else
ran into when they tried to assign identifiers to bugs that MITRE
wouldn't acknowledge? Here's what they said back then:

<https://cve.mitre.org/news/archives/2021/news.html#April022021_Message_to_DWF_from_the_CVE_Board>

I somehow doubt the presence of the ! makes much of a difference.
