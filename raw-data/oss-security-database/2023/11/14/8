Per Tavis' writeup, this at least allows a VM guest to trigger machine
check exceptions and halt the host.  So it's at least a DoS.  My reading
is this can cause wrong control flow at least in SMT sibling threads, so
is a privilege escalation risk from VMs at least when SMT is enabled.
Without SMT, it's still at least a DoS.

I would like to know this, too.  I doubt it's been fully researched.
