Subject: CVE-2023-23583: Intel - Denial of Service - Privilege Escalation
 (Reptar)

Name of the issue: Redundant Prefix Issue


Description of the issue
Under certain microarchitectural conditions, Intel has identified cases
where execution of an instruction (REP MOVSB) encoded with a redundant
REX prefix may result in unpredictable system behavior resulting in a
system crash/hang, or, in some limited scenarios, may allow escalation
of privilege from CPL3 to CPL0.
This Redundant Prefix Issue is assigned CVE-2023-23583 with a CVSS Base
Score of 8.8 High CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
