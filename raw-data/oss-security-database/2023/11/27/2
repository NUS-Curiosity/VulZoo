Subject: CVE-2023-40610: Apache Superset: Privilege escalation with default
 examples database 

Affected versions:

- Apache Superset before 2.1.2

Description:

Improper authorization check and possible privilege escalation on Apache SupersetÂ up to but excluding 2.1.2. Using the default examples database connection that allows access to both the examples schema and Apache Superset's metadata database, an attacker using a specially crafted CTE SQL statement could change data on the metadata database. This weakness could result on tampering with the authentication/authorization data.
