There seems to be a misunderstanding here. It seems I phrased that not
properly. I did not mean to say that the issue is unfixed. As the
initial email from VMware states there is a patch and bugfix release
available.

What I wanted to express is that all versions of open-vm-tools ranging
from 10.3.0 up until before the bugfix release are likely affected by
the issue.

Cheers
