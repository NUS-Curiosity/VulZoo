Thank you Alexei and Hsin-Wei for the replies.

This very thread is already on oss-security since I brought it here on
Nov 5.  I'm confused as to what was (not) merged to where yet, but my
suggestion is that this be taken care of on the proper Linux lists and
then a summary brought to oss-security again (e.g., saying that the
issue is finally fully fixed, and where exactly).

Thanks again,

Alexander
