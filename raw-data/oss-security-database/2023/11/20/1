 fixed /tmp path usage in prnt/hpps/hppsfilter.c

Hi,

thank you both for your suggestions. I just reached out to
hp-security-alert@...com about this.

There are a couple of other hplip issues I know of that have also been
left unattended for a long time that I mentioned there as well.

Best Regards

Matthias
