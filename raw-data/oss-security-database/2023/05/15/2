Subject: CVE-2022-47937: Multiple parsing problems in the Apache Sling
 Commons JSON module 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- org.apache.sling.commons.json through 2.0.20

Description:

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** 





Improper input validation in the Apache Sling Commons JSON bundle allows an attacker to trigger unexpected errors by supplying specially-crafted input.




NOTE: This vulnerability 
only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer




The org.apache.sling.commons.json bundle has been deprecated as of March
 2017 and should not be used anymore. Consumers are encouraged to 
consider the Apache Sling Commons Johnzon OSGi bundle provided by the 
Apache Sling project, but may of course use other JSON libraries.
