In the JFS filesystem, right?

Any specific reason you didn't send this to the mailing list and
developers who can review and apply this potential fix to the kernel
tree?

syzbot-reported issues are not really a new or exciting thing, we get
loads of them every week (see the syzbot mailing list and summaries).
What is good is for fixes like this one to be sent to us so that we can
merge them for all to use.

That is if anyone is actually using the JFS filesystem anymore, it is
pretty obsolete.  Are you using it?

thanks,
