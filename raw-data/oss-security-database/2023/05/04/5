As a project maintainer, you should be able to ask the CNA to REJECT a
CVE, or at least have it marked DISPUTED, and that state should be
reflected in all reasonable CVE databases. You'll still have to figure
out how to document it as a non-issue inside your project for your
users to find, but once you've established a working solution, that
should not take months to resolve. I'd suspect that the issue in
HTTP::Tiny would end up DISPUTED, since not validating TLS names is
not the generally expected behavior, although it is documented (in
bold no less).
