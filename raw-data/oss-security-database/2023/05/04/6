I would also expect it to be at most disputed, not rejected.
As Jeffry Walton noted, failing to validate a certificate is considered
by many to be a vulnerability, there's even a specific CWE for this case:

Per the OP:

A default that potentially causes over 300 other vulnerabilities sounds like
a root cause vulnerability to me. Clearly many users do *not* treat this as expected behavior.
A change of the default would, for many, produce the expected behavior.
