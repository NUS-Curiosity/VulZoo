This is not true: reproducible builds are a reality for a number of
distros already and also upstream (for GNU Guix, we measure 85%
reproducibility on 22K packages; Debian might be even higher).

Bootstrapping has also gone a long way: Guix’s package graph is now
rooted in a 357-byte “binary”¹; everything else (with the exception of a
couple of bootstrap compilers such as GHC, for now) is built from
source, in isolated environments.  A similar bootstrap path is used by
freedesktop-sdk².

So I disagree that one has to resort to attestation and certification;
verifiability and auditability are evidently achievable and they provide
much stronger guarantees.
