Subject: CVE-2023-33234: Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes Provider:
 KubernetesPodOperator RCE via connection configuration 

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes Provider 5.0.0 through 6.1.0

Description:

Arbitrary code execution in Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes provider version 5.0.0 allows user to change xcom sidecar image and resources via Airflow connection.

In order to exploit this weakness, a user would already need elevated permissions (Op or Admin) to change the connection object in this manner.Â  Operators should upgrade to provider version 7.0.0 which has removed the vulnerability.
