There's a process for assigning CVEs. Anyone who wants to be able to assign CVEs - that is, to become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) - has to follow various processes. I'm sure it can be improved, like all things. I'm not directly involved in this. You might find more information here:

Identifying a vulnerability does not defame a project. If a library has the functionality to retrieve an https URLs, and fails to verify the server certificates by default, then I (and many others) would call that a vulnerability. After all, the default is what happens. If you request data from <https://google.com>, you wouldn't expect it to use the data from <https://godzilla.com>. There's a general expectation that https://FPP provides a secure connection to FOO (with confidentiality, integrity, and server authentication), unless you specially disable it.
