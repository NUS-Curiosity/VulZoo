while one may criticize that CVEs have been assigned both for the 
insecure default and (some of the) insecure usages, at least one of 
these is a legitimate case, in terms of CVEs likely the latter. And when 
it comes to defaming projects, at least in my book, choosing, keeping 
and defending bad defaults speaks to much more than a CVE being assigned.
