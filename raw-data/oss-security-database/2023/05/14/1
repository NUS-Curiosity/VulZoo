Hi,

Thank you Johannes for commenting on this.  I think there was plenty of
time for anyone else to comment as well if they wanted to, but no one
did, and that's fine.  So I went ahead and made an edit to the policy.

The paragraph now reads:

"Please note that in case a fix for an issue is already in a publicly
accessible source code repository, we generally consider the issue
public (and thus you should post to oss-security right away, not report
the issue to (linux-)distros as we'd merely redirect you to oss-security
anyway and insist that you make the required posting ASAP).  There can
be occasional exceptions to this, such as if the publicly accessible fix
doesn't look like it's for a security issue and not revealing this
publicly right away is somehow deemed desirable.  In particular, we
grant such exceptions for (1) Linux kernel issues concurrently or very
recently handled by the Linux kernel security team and (2) curl issues
ranked as low or medium severity by the curl project.  In all other
cases, you'd have to have very sound reasoning to claim an exception
like this and be prepared to lose your argument and if so to post to
oss-security ASAP anyway."

The addition is "(2) curl issues ranked as low or medium severity by the
curl project."

As you can see, I went for project-specific conditions now.  What you
suggest above didn't look better to me.  One reason why not is that if
we'd need "some form of vote on the list" anyway, we can as well do so
with threads like this one discussing the specific project's needs.
