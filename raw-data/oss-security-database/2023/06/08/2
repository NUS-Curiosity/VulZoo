Given your previous intent "not to publish the exp for ethical reasons",
it's a surprising decision you made to share with all linux-distros when
only some asked, but that's fine as long as you understand and are going
to follow the list policy and make the now-mandatory posting of at least
the same code to oss-security within 7 days - so no later than next
Thursday, please.  Ideally, you'd pre-announce the date when you intend
to post the code.

Thanks,

Alexander
