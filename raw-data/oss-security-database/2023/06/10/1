Hi all,

while conference talks aren't really the list focus, I guess there might be an
exception for this one.

Earlier this week, Solar Designer made the opening keynote of the SSTIC
conference in Rennes (France). A retrospective about the open-source security
community and coordination around vulnerabilities, attack surface etc.

For interested people, the video replay is available at
https://www.sstic.org/2023/presentation/ouverture_2023/

Many thanks to Solar Designer for the talk and all the years of managing oss-
security (and the distros list).

Regards,
