 at SSTIC conference

Hi Yves-Alexis,

Personally, I don’t mind the plug for this at all - wonderful job Solar Designer!

Speaking of which, has there ever been any consideration of having an “oss-security-advocacy” list? I like seeing/sharing relevant updates like this.

I also don’t want to use this list to plug oss-security related talks and conferences, but having said that, the *BSD community supports these efforts and I think I can speak for many when I say that we would love to have an oss-security talk at some point at EuroBSDCon. Keep it in mind, and consider submitting an abstract - open source security is a key topic at this conference too!

Sincerely,
Katie

Hi all,

while conference talks aren't really the list focus, I guess there might be an
exception for this one.

Earlier this week, Solar Designer made the opening keynote of the SSTIC
conference in Rennes (France). A retrospective about the open-source security
community and coordination around vulnerabilities, attack surface etc.

For interested people, the video replay is available at
https://www.sstic.org/2023/presentation/ouverture_2023/

Many thanks to Solar Designer for the talk and all the years of managing oss-
security (and the distros list).

Regards,
