The problem really is that these scanners are assuming something that
is not true. They assume that data from vulnerability databases is
reliable.

These debates are coming on a regular basis, usually either "should
this thing get a CVE?" and "is this a reasonable CVSS value /
criticality rating?"

It's actually quite simple: There are dozends (maybe hundreds?) of CVEs
issued every day. If you want them to be properly vetted, you'd need to
have a massive team of security professionals doing that vetting. No
such team exists, so the only plausible assumption is that CVE and CVSS
data is by default unreliable.

If your scanner sounds an alarm because someone added a high CVSS
rating to a CVE entry, you should assume that the people creating that
scanner don't know what they are doing.
