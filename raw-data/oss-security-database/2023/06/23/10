Of course, this wasn't actually embargoed anymore at that time - Zdenek
simply resent the exact same message he had sent to the distros list on
June 13, when the issue was in fact still embargoed.

Similarly, the previous CUPS vulnerability disclosure on June 1 was a
copy of the distros message from May 23:

Let's be updating these when posting them publicly going forward to
avoid confusion - like "was this published inadvertently when still
under embargo?" (luckily, no).
