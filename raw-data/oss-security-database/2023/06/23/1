I don’t think you are, I can’t see anything here either.

Even if you were doing all the wrong things and running a yasm-as-a-service continually building untrusted source right alongside other processes as the same user, that contain all sorts of things you don’t want exposed, I still don’t see how this would be anything but a 0.0.
