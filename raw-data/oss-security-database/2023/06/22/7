Subject: CVE-2023-31469: Apache StreamPipes: Privilege escalation through
 non-admin user 

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache StreamPipes 0.69.0 through 0.91.0

Description:

A REST interface in Apache StreamPipes (versions 0.69.0 to 0.91.0) was not properly restricted to admin-only access. This allowed a non-admin user with valid login credentials to elevate privileges beyond the initially assigned roles.
The issue is resolved by upgrading to StreamPipes 0.92.0.
