Yeah, I'm with you. It is sloppy programming from a bygone era.

I've had the discussion with Stallman and the Gnulib folks. They don't
realize the harm they are doing with that policy (or they don't care).
It makes security testing and evaluation orders of magnitude more
difficult because it's hard to impossible to differentiate the "good"
memory leaks from the "bad" memory leaks. Effectively, everyone with
higher standards must lower their standard to GNU's.
