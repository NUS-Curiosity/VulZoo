Change the incentives so that CPU vendors decide to produce CPUs that
don't have bugs, and therefore the lists aren't needed?

I'm not sure if this is practical, but if it is, it would solve the

Mandating Speculative Taint Tracking would get rid of the speculative
execution vulnerabilities, assuming that it is implemented correctly.
