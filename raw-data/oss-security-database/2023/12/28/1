As you are referring to my talk here, I figured I would point out that
later on in it I do talk explicitly about the private lists that we run
for these CPU issues and how much we hate them.  Companies who are
currently not on these lists are actively trying to circumvent them to
get access to the information on them, despite all of the lawyers and
governments involved agreeing that this is the best and only way we know
how to handle these types of issues at the moment.

In other words, I hate them, companies hate them, and governments hate
them, but no one involved has solid ideas of what to do instead.

"Luckily" I think that laws like the CRA are going to make them obsolete
in a few years time so maybe that will cause them to go away as I don't
see any end of CPU bugs happening before then.

Again, I still consider this a form of blackmail against open source
projects when you do this, but hey, you do you :)
