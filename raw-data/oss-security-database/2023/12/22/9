The integrity of the sender's identity, as a minimum, is compromised
here. Normally, when relaying mail, servers add a "Received:" header
that specifies where they received the connection from. This allows
tracking down the true origin of the message. The smuggled message
does not have such a header and thus misrepresents the vulnerable
relay as the ultimate sender. Additionally, if the relay has
destination-based deny lists that deny some but not all addresses on
the destination domain, they are sidestepped.
