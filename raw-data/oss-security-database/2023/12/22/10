[An on-line version of this announcement will be available at https://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.8.4.html]

Fixed with Postfix 3.8.4:

  * Security: this release adds support to defend
    against an email spoofing attack (SMTP smuggling) on
    recipients at a Postfix server. For background, see
    https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html.

    Sites concerned about SMTP smuggling attacks should enable this
    feature on Internet-facing Postfix servers. For compatibility
    with non-standard clients, Postfix by default excludes clients
    in mynetworks from this countermeasure.

    The recommended settings are:

	# Optionally disconnect remote SMTP clients that send bare newlines,
	# but allow local clients with non-standard SMTP implementations
	# such as netcat, fax machines, or load balancer health checks.
	#
	smtpd_forbid_bare_newline = yes
	smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_exclusions = $mynetworks

    The smtpd_forbid_bare_newline feature is disabled by default.

You can find the updated Postfix source code at the mirrors listed at
https://www.postfix.org/.
