Hi Alexander, Igor, and all -

What I meant is that it's the first time this was brought up as a
concern about a new member application.

I (or anyone) could check oss-security list archives to see if a similar
concern was possibly brought up before, but I think I'd have remembered
if this were the case.

As far as I'm aware, there are currently no US sanctions against them.

Also, as I pointed out, even the US sanctions against Huawei don't seem
to apply to what we're doing, per LF's public statement and per my own
reading (but I am not a lawyer).

However, that might not be enough to prevent people from being concerned
and discouraged from participating if openEuler joins.  This is why I
suggested that it's best if openEuler does not join now, and that people
who had commented before could want to say whether their concerns are
now sufficiently addressed or maybe not.

These are valid concerns.

Per my reading, the EU CRA (which isn't final yet and isn't in effect
yet) is going to require something related, but different.  The proposal
from 2022:

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52022PC0454

includes the below:

"The manufacturer shall, without undue delay and in any event within 24
hours of becoming aware of it, notify to ENISA any actively exploited
vulnerability contained in the product with digital elements."

"The manufacturer shall, without undue delay and in any event within 24
hours of becoming aware of it, notify to ENISA any incident having
impact on the security of the product with digital elements."

"Manufacturers shall, upon identifying a vulnerability in a component,
including in an open source component, which is integrated in the
product with digital elements, report the vulnerability to the person or
entity maintaining the component."

As you can see, this separates "actively exploited vulnerability" and
"incident" requiring timely reporting to a government agency vs. "a
vulnerability" requiring (not so timely) reporting to upstream.  When a
vulnerability is actively exploited, we'll generally want to publish it
within 24 hours anyway, and we generally want to notify upstream anyway,
so EU list members would probably be able to comply with these while
meeting our usual policy as well.

I'm not currently aware of related legislation elsewhere, but I would be
unsurprised if it exists.

Overall, I am concerned about this trend towards more government
oversight.  While we also have our policies, we do not have a monopoly,
so if folks disagree they can choose not to participate or set up
something different, whereas with laws opting-out is much harder.

We might not want to require that.  It may be sufficient that they
certify they don't violate the list policy, so that if they take a legal
risk it's on them and it's not increased by us having made that request.

Ouch.  This does look more problematic than the proposed EU CRA wording.
