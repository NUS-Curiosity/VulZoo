some more

Jsch (Java SSH): release 0.2.15 fixes it https://github.com/mwiede/jsch/releases/tag/jsch-0.2.15

Also apache-sshd and trilead-ssh2 as Java SSH implementations are
affected.

tinyssh affected, has a ticket open.

rubygem-net-ssh also affected.

The rust ecosystem has a ssh crate which fixates its used libssh version. "libssh2-sys", so
crates and binaries referencing will need updates.

python Twisted has an SSH stack too, but no chacha or etm macs so far. 

Ciao, Marcus
