Subject: CVE-2023-40661: Dynamic analyzers reports in pkcs15-init in OpenSC
 before 0.24.0

This advisory summarizes automatically reported issues that are
security relevant that were reported since the release of OpenSC
0.23.0 and that are relevant to the handling the card enrollment
process using pkcs15-init.

All of these require physical access to the computer at the time user
or administrator would be enrolling the cards (generating keys and
loading certificates, other card/token management) operations. The
attack requires crafted USB device or smart card that would present
the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs so they are
considered a high-complexity and low-severity. This issue is not
exploitable just by using a PKCS#11 module as done in most of the
end-user deployments.
