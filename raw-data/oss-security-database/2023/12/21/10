Subject: Re: AlmaLinux Distros List Application

Hi,

I think this application does meet the bar for linux-distros membership,
and everyone had enough opportunity to comment by now.  So I'll proceed
to subscribe Jonathan and Andrew, and list AlmaLinux OS Foundation as a
member.  I'll take this off-list for the PGP keys, etc.

Great.  It doesn't have to be the same folks who are on linux-distros.
So please take a look and choose specific task(s).

Thanks,
