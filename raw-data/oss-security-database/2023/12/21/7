Subject: Re: New SMTP smuggling attack

Just for completeness:
sendmail 8.18.0.2 has options to handle this too, e.g.,
	Accept only CR LF . CR LF as end of an SMTP message as
		required by the RFCs when the new srv_features
		option 'o' is used.

And for those who read the source code there's also an FFR:
	/* enable checking for "bare LF" in message */
	"_FFR_BARE_LF",
