This looks reasonable to me.

This isn't a lot yet.  I suppose linux-distros membership would enable
you to do ahead of Red Hat updates more often?

These tasks are already accepted by some distros.  We can indeed
re-assign, so that those older members handle more complex tasks
instead, or maybe you'd volunteer for some of the tasks from the
"Administrative tasks mostly unrelated to (linux-)distros lists (but
relevant to the wider community)" category?  This category is
essentially about expanding and improving the public oss-security
content and its visibility.

For others reading this - Darya has been on linux-distros for CloudLinux
for a long while, so this satisfies the requirement as written.
