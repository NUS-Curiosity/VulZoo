Note that on some systems, the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR directory is unavailable
after user UID switching (e.g., with sudo) because these systems follow
the specification to the letter and provide a XDG_RUNTIME_DIR setting
for the logged-in user instead of the current user.  So while it looks
like a good solution for most cases, it breaks a couple of use cases (or
still needs fallback even on systems that nominally have XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
support).

Thanks,
