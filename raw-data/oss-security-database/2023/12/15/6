in general I would also not recommend using it for temporary files. At
least in this concrete case of the budgie-extras applications the files
placed in there can be considered small enough for a desktop environment.

I recommended using XDG_RUNTIME_DIR as a quick fix for these issues, but
as I also tried to point out, I don't believe the way temporary files
are used here is a good design.

At least the immediate dangers for security should be addressed by these
quick fixes applied, so sacrificing a bit of the cleanliness of the
filesystem seems justified.

Cheers

Matthias
