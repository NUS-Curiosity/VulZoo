there was a recommendation to run firefox as a different user, e.g. 
firefox, some time ago:
https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/84

this firefox user doesn't have access to the primary and secondary 
selection buffer. Some details have changed, but basically I'm using 
this approach since then. It's a bit uncomfortable in daily use (like 
most security measures), because copy&paste out of firefox doesn't work 
anymore. But there is also this addon as a workaround, which lets me 
save text selected within firefox to a well-defined file, from where I 
can pick it up after careful inspection under my regular user:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-text-to-file/

But still, we are left with the problem that within firefox scripts can 
do all kind of bad things. NoScript addon can help here to some extend:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/

But unfortunately more and more web pages refuse to display anything if 
no scripts are allowed at all by default, which forces me to either 
admit tons of javascript on those pages or just leave them without 
reading... Ok, using separate browser profiles for different kinds of 
web pages is another approach (separate profiles for online banking, 
admin guis, regular browsing, another one for pages you trust less...)

best regards, Martin
