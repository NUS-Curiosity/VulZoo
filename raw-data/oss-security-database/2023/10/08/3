These people are not developers live & govern a part of earth ripe with
anti-communist/socialist sentiment.  If you were to explain to them that
their cellphones security is protected by things like 'community' &
'sharing', they'd likely blow a gasket.  It appears it's too late to bring
in the real industry experts into the committee meetings but not too late
to make a meaningful difference.  That said, the community at large needs
to prepare for a lull in rights & freedoms.  Perhaps if it got to a point
to where, like the cookie law, some vital repositories start geoip blocking
in protest, things might move along.  One thing for sure, things are about
to get weird.
