Two additional things we shared with the distros list pre-disclosure:

1) Test cases for 3 of the XPM bugs - instead of attaching them to the emails
    to test which of your mail readers are still vulnerable to these bugs,
    we've checked them in to the libXpm git repo - see the commits starting
    with "test" listed on:
    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxpm/-/commits/libXpm-3.5.17?ref_type=tags
    (The test case for CVE-2023-43788 was already in the repo from
     CVE-2022-46285 from earlier this year).

2) When Dr. Duck reported the libX11 issue included in this set as
    CVE-2023-43785 he also reported several other bugs as potential
    security issues.  We determined they did not meet our vulnerability
    criteria but fixed them as general bugs and improved hardening.
    If you are backporting individual patches instead of upgrading to
    the new releases, you may want to consider if they meet your criteria
    for backporting as well:

    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/merge_requests/233
    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxrandr/-/merge_requests/6
    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/xrandr/-/merge_requests/12

    Each merge request contains a comment with our reasoning.

    Of course, our releases also contain other bug fixes & hardening besides
    those listed here.
