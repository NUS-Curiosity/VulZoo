Yes, I appreciate all of this!

That's pretty good.  I've just made you primary for #3, and consequently
upgraded Container-Optimized OS to primary for #1 - although I expect
I'll also need to ping them off-list for things to actually be happening.

Container-Optimized OS folks, please let me know if you see this and
think you don't need further pings. ;-)

I'd also appreciate others helping with all of these tasks.  For #3,
there are simply too many relevant "Open Source security issues/topics
published elsewhere" for Alan to notice and handle them all alone.
