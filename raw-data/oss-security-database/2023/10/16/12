The people deciding if this group can be added to the closed list as
they are the ones responsible for it, AND then if the group is added,
the members of the list need to talk to their lawyers to see if their
country laws allow them to participate in a closed group with such
members.  Many countries might be fine, many might not be, it all
depends on the participants and what country laws they must abide by.

So in short, everyone involved in the list!  :(

good luck!
