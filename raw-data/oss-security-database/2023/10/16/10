The question is _who_ should consult their lawyers.  Many security
researchers are operating on their own time or work with small
companies.  These researchers may not have access to corporate lawyers
trained in the relevant areas of law, and expecting them to retain a
lawyer at their own expense before posting is not reasonable.
Therefore, if openEuler joining linux-distros would require them to do
this, the request should (unfortunately) be denied.
