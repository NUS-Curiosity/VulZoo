Subject: CVE-2023-45853: overflows in MiniZip in zlib through 1.3

CVE-2023-45853 was published last week for:

    MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based
    buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or
    extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib product.

where "long" means "longer than can be stored in the 16-bit length value used
for the length of these fields".

minizip is part of the contrib directory in zlib, which doesn't seem to be built
by default as far as I can tell, yet NVD has assigned a CVSS of 9.8 to make CVE
scanners scream at full volume, while Red Hat went with a CVSS of 5.3 instead:

https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45853#cve-cvss-v3

A fix has been checked into the upstream git repo:
https://github.com/madler/zlib/pull/843
but a release has not yet been made including it.
