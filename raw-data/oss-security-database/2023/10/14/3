The fix for Rocky 8 and Rocky 9 are purely imports from RHEL:

* R8: https://git.rockylinux.org/staging/rpms/glibc/-/commit/6433675bfaab392b362993d8ff8d576335e6bcd4
* R9: https://git.rockylinux.org/staging/rpms/glibc/-/commit/610a8a6829e1e604ff018daccf6bf63620edd19d

I did see that Louis Abel attempted to do something for Rocky 8, but
it was not shipped. I have also not seen much in terms of upstream
engagement indicating the bidirectional relationship expected for
members of linux-distros@.

The point I'm making is that SIGs do not count because they cannot
obey embargo regulations. No open project or community project can do
that without having some mechanism for private controls, which is
antithetical to the community process. They fundamentally are
ineligible to join because they cannot keep anything secret.
