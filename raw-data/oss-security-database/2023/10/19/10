OK, the behaviour on my terminal is completely different depending solely on which shell I
use:

   s@...aptop ~> bash
   s@...aptop:~$ That is plain not true, but depends on the "bracketed paste" mode

   Command 'That' not found, did you mean:

     command 'phat' from deb phat-utils (1.5-3build2)
     command 'chat' from deb ppp (2.4.7-2+4.1ubuntu5.1)
     command 'jhat' from deb openjdk-8-jdk-headless (8u382-ga-1~20.04.1)

   Try: sudo apt install <deb name>

   s@...aptop:~$ of readline which in turn depends on the terminal (emulator) and
   bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
   s@...aptop:~$ likely even upon the ncurses library.
   likely: command not found
   s@...aptop:~$ See bash(1) (Readline Variables, enable-bracketed-paste, default
   bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
   s@...aptop:~$ on).  Btw Mr. Dickey (ncurses, xterm, vile, etc) has an
   bash: syntax error near unexpected token `)'

                 likely even upon the ncurses library.
                 See bash(1) (Readline Variables, enable-bracketed-paste, default
                 on).  Btw Mr. Dickey (ncurses, xterm, vile, etc) has an
                 informative page on this:

Yes, I'm on an older release still, so maybe it has been fixed in the past 3 or so years.
