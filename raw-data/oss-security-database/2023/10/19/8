 |Also a problem with shell security. If you paste something with line \

That is plain not true, but depends on the "bracketed paste" mode
of readline which in turn depends on the terminal (emulator) and
likely even upon the ncurses library.
See bash(1) (Readline Variables, enable-bracketed-paste, default
on).  Btw Mr. Dickey (ncurses, xterm, vile, etc) has an
informative page on this:

(Not that it matters, but the MUA i maintain does not yet support
bracketed paste mode, its own yanking mechanism works only like
that though.  I will implement it for v14.10, it is in TODO.)
