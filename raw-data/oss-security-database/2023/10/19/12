Imagine situation like pasting a bank account number for money transfer into internetbankig web page, and some browser tab in background silently replaces the number. Or replaces the bitcoin address, to make situation more dramatic. The direct command execution is probably the most straight-forward approach, but with bit of a creativity you can come with many various attack scenarios.

I think it's worse than described now. We've got those apps that
monitor the clipboard and ship the data back to a server. That
includes sensitive information like bank accounts and passwords.

And I believe Reddit does it for targeted advertising.
