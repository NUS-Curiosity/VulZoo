I've just updated these headers-only archives once again, now up to
September 30, 2023.

https://www.openwall.com/lists/linux-distros/

Like before, I did not decrypt the actual messages, but the traffic
statistics and the message headers should provide some visibility into
how much and roughly what was discussed and when.

The messages appearing on distros should be strictly a subset of those
appearing on linux-distros, as per the description of the lists here:

https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros

As you may notice, the Subject lines sometimes contain [vs] and other
times [vs-plain].  This reflects whether the messages traveled to the
list exploder in encrypted or plaintext form, respectively.  They
traveled to the list members in re-encrypted form either way.

P.S. I am also working on an update of the distros list statistics on
the wiki, to be announced separately.
