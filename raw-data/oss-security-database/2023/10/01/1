Why would this not work for a more popular language like Rust?  I know
that Gentoo is limited by the compute resources of a single machine, but
cascading rebuilds should not be a problem for modern distributed build
infrastructure, provided that the build clusters are sufficiently large.

Also, are the two programs GHC and Pandoc?
