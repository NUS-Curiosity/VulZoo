The wiki page you reference above lists the membership criteria and
links to a couple of example membership request messages.  You may post
a request like that in here, addressing the criteria in it one by one.

The outcome of such posting is not predetermined - your organization
may or may not be accepted as a linux-distros list member, depending on
whether it convincingly meets the criteria or maybe not.
