Subject: [vim-security] integer overflow in :history command in Vim < 9.0.2068

Integer overflow in :history Ex-Command in Vim < 9.0.2068
=========================================================

Severity: Low

When using the :history ex-command, it's possible that the
provided argument overflows the accepted value. Causing an
Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free.

This is not a major issue as most users probably won't use
intentionally large values for the :history command

The issue is fixed in Vim version 9.0.2068.

This issue was reported on October 26th, 2023 by Cole
Dilorenzo to the vim-security mailing list.
