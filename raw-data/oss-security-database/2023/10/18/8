The discussion in https://github.com/apache/httpd-site/pull/10 makes the
situation a little murkier.

Also,https://mstdn.social/@jschauma/111252863550361935 points out that the
Rust h2 crate seems to have announced a very similar issue under a
different CVE id back in April:

https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0034.html
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f8vr-r385-rh5r

and a followup post notes further similarities to Netflix's CVE-2019-9514
“Reset Flood” from
https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md
except in that case the RST_STREAM seem to have been sent from the server,
not the client side.
