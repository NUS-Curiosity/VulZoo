I have some misgivings about this.

The *primary* /selection/ /buffer/ is updated by simply selecting text 
on the screen.

About the only thing that I can see being a problem is if something 
updates the chosen selection buffer without my knowledge while I'm in 
the middle of doing something using the selection buffer.

*Selection* /buffer/ being a buffer referencing something that is selected.

Remember, the selection buffers; primary and / or secondary, are 
completely independent of the clipboard.

I'm not convinced of that.

1st, simply updating the selection buffer doesn't mean that what's in it 
will be used for anything,
2nd, the updated selection buffer must be used in a way that tries to 
execute a command or maliciously alters contents, e.g. swapping 
something of value for something else malicious, say an address to send 
something.

The ability to update the selection buffer doesn't extend into the 
ability to cause what's in the selection buffer to be executed.

It probably applies to a lot more than that.  I suspect that anything 
that can run 3rd party code can do the same thing.

I can do the same thing with most shells that you're claiming is a 
Mozilla / Firefox bug:

    while sleep 1; do echo "yes LOL" | xsel -ip; done

Change your sleep duration, what goes into the primary selection buffer, 
tool used to modify the selection buffer, which selection buffer / 
clipboard you monkey with, etc.

I think that this is more a problem with X11 security than it is a 
problem specific to Mozilla / Firefox.

This X11 security issue is well known and has been well known for 
decades.  Anybody / anything that can read / write to your DISPLAY can 
do this.

Maybe the fact that malicious JavaScript can do this is a surprise.  But 
I don't see this as a new issue.

As I said earlier, I'm unconvinced that this is a Mozilla / Firefox 
specific bug, but I'm trying to keep an open mind and understand ~>

As for patching Firefox, that's sort of like closing one vector out of 
the undetermined / infinite number that exist on the system.

Yes, what you're talking about is a problem.  It's also a known problem. 
  What's more is I believe the root of the problem is outside of where 
you have targeted your scrutiny.
