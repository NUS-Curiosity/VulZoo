If there's more than one bug they must be features, duh.

Thanks for this. Since nobody else has responded, I agree that it's a
security issue. The data in the clipboard are mine and there should be
exactly one way for me to overwrite them. This is a problem even if the
data is not sensitive and if the terminal paste is not exploitable:

1. A third party
2. Has tricked my computer
3. Into doing something I didn't want it to

Those are the three criteria for a vulnerability that I just made up.
