I'd like to give an example against this. With the recent glibc issue 
(CVE-2023-4911) we were closely following the upcoming fixed packages. 
While we were installing the Rocky packages in the late evening of Thu Oct 5, 
I had the impression that the Redhat packages became available later on Friday.
It might be attributed to some hours of delay between arriving on the repo 
servers vs. being announced via advisory. But, anyhow, accusing Rocky being
late in providing packages at least is not valid in general imho. At least 
important ones, like this one, seem to arrive rather quickly. Without mentioning 
the distros, I have seen quite some announcements even around a week later.

I think the point here is "*not only* being a rebuild of another distro". 
So, their engagement with SIG should already be a valid add-on to be honored.
Anyhow, the fact that CIQ offers LTS branches and professional support, 
as well as their promise to provide backports of upstream fixes independent 
of RHEL clearly distinguishes them from a "pure distro rebuild".

You could take the hardened glibc version of the before mentioned SIG for this

https://rockylinux.org/news/security-sig-update/

Note, this is a different story than the backport of the fix for CVE-2023-4911.

Well, assuming there was a security team in these projects able to obey
the embargo regulations, wouldn't they have tried to join? 
But, nevertheless, what is the relation of the organizational structure 
of these projects with the current application of CIQ/Rocky, after all?

The membership on the list is always by person, and it is always 
on behalf of a distro. The fact that Alexander is already engaged in
the Security SIG @Rocky already makes it a reasonable next step
to represent them on the linux-distros list.

Furthermore, I would like to express my deep admiration for his 
very professional way of working. Especially in this case, when it 
is about his own person, he handles the application process transparently
as if it was any other distro's. Sure, that's one would expect in 
this position, but it's just another proof in a long list that he is 
the right person to do this job of running, maintaining, and moderating
these lists.

Not being member of any distribution, but a long-time subscriber to
oss-sec, fd, and others, I give my vote for Alexander as a representative
of CIQ Rocky Linux Security Team on linux-distros list.  

Best regards,
Martin
