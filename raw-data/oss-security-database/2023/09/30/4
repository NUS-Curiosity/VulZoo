It was released yesterday, with the note:

    "This release contains two security related fixes. One each for VP8 and VP9."

    https://github.com/webmproject/libvpx/releases/tag/v1.13.1

CVE-2023-44488 has been assigned to the VP9 bug:

    "VP9 in libvpx before 1.13.1 mishandles widths, leading to a crash related
     to encoding."

It points to this commit for the fix:
