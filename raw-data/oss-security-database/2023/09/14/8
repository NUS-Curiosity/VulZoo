For this criteria I think you'd want to point to either the github logs
or release announcements for the distros themselves (OpenIndiana,
SmartOS, OmniOS, etc.) as it's asking for the history of the distro in
security response.   I don't think the illumos-gate has any relevant
history for this criteria - you can certainly show fixing security bugs
in that code base, but I don't think any of them would have been shared
on the distros list, as illumos-gate only contains a small number of
externally maintained FOSS packages - most illumos distros add many more
FOSS packages on top of what the gate ships, and its those FOSS packages
(things like curl, cups, git, sudo, etc.) that info is shared about on the
distros list, as you can see at https://www.openwall.com/lists/distros/ .

I am on the distros list, and have been active on oss-security for years,
and can vouch for Dan personally.
