I am not a member of the 'distros' list, but can vouch for Dan 
McDonald's dedication and capabilities, as observed over several 
years.  Dan did not mention it, but he previously became the primary 
maintainer of an Illumos distribution known as "OmniOS", which I use. 
As a maintainer, Dan did pay close attention to security issues.

In terms of capabilites, Illumos-based distributions are similar in 
capabilty to major Linux distributions, or the major BSD 
distributions.  Illumos has a long heritage derived from Solaris, 
which emerged from SunOS/SVR4, but includes many unique capabilities, 
some of which were developed under Illumos after 2010. Each 
Illumos-based distribution seems to target a different usage model.
