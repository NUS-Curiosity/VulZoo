Hello.

> I saw your email about joining oss-security, and I think it’s a wonderful idea for illumos. I am fully in support of this, and I’m wondering: is there a Foundation of any kind behind illumos? Are there any conferences dedicated to illumos or SmartOS?

illumos is very VERY loosely governed by its core team.  We don't have a foundation, just a cooperation of several stakeholders (most of whom have their own illumos distros).

We don't have dedicated conferences either (though apparently every-four-years dtrace.conf, an OpenSolaris-turned-illumos-and-more unconference, is going to happen in 2024 again after pandemic-cancelled 2020 one).

Sorry I don't have better answers there,
Dan
