No, aside from Linux kernel issues most are not Linux-only (and for
Linux kernel ones upstream's current preference is to only bring them to
linux-distros once a fix is ready, if at all).

I don't recall Flatcar Container Linux helping with this task lately
(please correct me if I'm wrong), so we may reassign the backup role to
OmniOS, knowing that you'd only handle this for issues that get to the
distros list (and not those staying on the linux-distros sub-list).

Should we?

Separately, I'd like to hear from Flatcar Container Linux here. ;-)

There are lots of options here.  As I understand, the current Twitter
feed at https://twitter.com/oss_security works off the
https://seclists.org/oss-sec/ RSS feed.  This is a third-party archive
of the list, and somehow the Twitter feed often misses messages (even
those I do see in that web archive).  So the main requirement for an
alternative feed is for it to be far more reliable.  We do not currently
have RSS for the official web archive, but we/you could add that to the
blists software if needed.

It does.  Thanks!
