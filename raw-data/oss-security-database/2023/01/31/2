Subject: CVE-2022-44645: Apache Linkis (incubating): The DatasourceManager
 module has a serialization attack vulnerability 

Severity: important

Description:

In Apache Linkis <=1.3.0 when used with the MySQL Connector/J, a deserialization vulnerability with possible remote code execution impact exists when an attacker has write access to a database and configures new datasource with a MySQL data source and malicious parameters. Therefore, the parameters in the jdbc url should be blacklisted. Versions of Apache Linkis <= 1.3.0 will be affected.

We recommend users to upgrade the version of Linkis to version 1.3.1.
