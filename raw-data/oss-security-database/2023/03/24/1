Subject: New distros list statistics

Hi,

I've been working to automate[*] tracking posting on the distros@ mailing
list for reporting purposes.  This includes searching oss-security for
posting information, extracting CVEs, and trying to tie it all together.

Anywhere, I have full stats for 2022 and stats for Jan/Feb of 2023.  As
long as everyone is happy with the content, I'll update regularly moving
forward.

https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros/stats/2023

[*] this has to be invoked manually in order to unlock my signing key so
it's only semi-automated.

Regards,

Anthony Liguori
