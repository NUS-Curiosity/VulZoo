            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-42331 / XSA-429
                               version 3

          x86: speculative vulnerability in 32bit SYSCALL path

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Due to an oversight in the very original Spectre/Meltdown security work
(XSA-254), one entrypath performs its speculation-safety actions too
late.

In some configurations, there is an unprotected RET instruction which
can be attacked with a variety of speculative attacks.

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host
memory, including memory assigned to other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.5 through 4.17 are vulnerable.  Older versions are not
vulnerable.

Only x86 CPUs are potentially vulnerable.  CPUs of other architectures
are not vulnerable.

The problematic codepath is only reachable on x86 CPUs which follow
AMD's behaviour with respect to SYSCALL instructions from compatibility
mode segments.  This means that AMD and Hygon CPUs are potentially
vulnerable, whereas Intel CPUs are not.  Other vendors have not been
checked.

Only PV guests can leverage the vulnerability.

On Xen 4.16 and later, the vulnerability is only present if 32bit PV
guest support is compiled in - i.e. CONFIG_PV32=y.  On Xen 4.15 and
older, all supported build configurations are vulnerable.

The vulnerability is only present when booting on hardware that supports
SMEP or SMAP (Supervisor Mode Execution/Access Prevention).  This is
believed to be some Family 0x16 models, and all later CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

Not running untrusted PV guests will avoid the issue.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of XenServer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
