Subject: Re: TTY pushback vulnerabilities / TIOCSTI

I think that the original reason was for csh(1) to implement file completion:
https://nxr.netbsd.org/xref/src/bin/csh/file.c#161
I still have a use case for it. Sometimes I lose my VPN tunnel and an
ssh session where I am running vi(1) suddenly dies. When I ssh to that
machine, I can easily find the tty where the vi session is with ps(1) and
then type "sti pts/X :wq\\n" and save the file  (https://man.netbsd.org/sti.8):-)
Of course on NetBSD you need to be root to use TIOCSTI.

Best,

christos
