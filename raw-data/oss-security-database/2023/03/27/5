Hi,

Thank you very much for contributing this, Anthony!

I've just edited the wiki to credit Amazon for this (just like we did
for Gentoo's similar contribution in 2017-2019) and to assign the task
to Amazon.  Please let me know whether this is right.

Yes, please do update this regularly.

Regarding the content, I notice some issues that I hope you can address:

You show "Coordinated Release Date" and "Days embargoed (scheduled)" as
7.00 days from date "Reported" for most entries, which I assume is in
most cases a placeholder when no specific CRD was extracted.  I
understand it would be tricky to extract that from the private list
threads automatically.  So for now I suggest that instead of stating
7.00 in such cases, you leave these fields blank.  Longer-term, maybe we
need to agree on a syntax (to include in list messages setting, ack'ing,
or adjusting the CRD), so that your script would extract this more
reliably?

By the way, when an initially set CRD is later adjusted, how would you
report that - report just one of them (I guess so, but need to decide
and document which one) or add an extra column?  What if there's more
than one adjustment?

You show extreme delays of 150+ days for two Linux kernel issues that
you claim were brought to linux-distros in March 2022.  Neither of these
two looks correct to me.  In one case, I merely added detail to an old
thread where satisfactory disclosure on oss-security had been made
months earlier.  In the other, you seem to link to a wrong CVE ID and
thus picked up a correspondingly wrong linux-distros disclosure; in
fact, you also list the same CVE ID for another issue, where it's
probably correct, and you show that one was disclosed publicly on time.

You show "A race condition vulnerability in drivers/tty/tty_buffers.c"
as Reported on 2022-05-26, but I see this Subject first appear on
2022-04-24.  You show nothing Reported in April at all, but I think this
is a counter-example.  In fact, I only checked this one because I found
it weird to see nothing for April.  I guess there are more issues like
this that I did not notice.

I think more issues were handled via (linux-)distros than you report.
For example, we had some "Embargoed OpenSSL issue" pre-notifications in
2022, but you don't list them.  I understand they were not full
disclosures of the issues to linux-distros - rather, the distros were
invited to contact OpenSSL for more information - yet I think we should
not exclude them from statistics.  Perhaps your script didn't capture
something else as well.

Once you've addressed these, I think it'd be a good idea to re-add the
average and median embargo times - I think per year would be enough.

Overall, this makes me skeptical about the automated processing.  We
track these issues manually anyway, like we ought to, so we can as well
manually keep track of the aspects needed for the statistics collection
and reporting.  This would take some effort, but that's fine, and maybe
we'll end up cross-verifying results of both approaches.

Thanks again,

Alexander
