With commit c7d6d4bb4874720d9dab1625df62c2ea6eeb9df5[0], I've added a
toggle in HardenedBSD to disable TIOCSTI. The toggle is set to
prohibit TIOCSTI by default. Now attempts to use TIOCSTI will be met
with EPERM.

I've verified the toggle in a real-world scenario with the doas issue
PoC found at [1].
