Subject: CVE-2023-24278 - Reflected XSS vulnerabilities in Squidex
 "/squid.svg" endpoint

Hello all, 

Squidex, a "headless" open source CMS framework was found to have two reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the "/squid.svg" endpoint 
affecting versions prior to 7.4.0. The vulnerabilities have been addressed in version 7.4.0 of the framework. 

CVE-2023-24278 was assigned to these vulnerabilities by MITRE. 

The vulnerabilities affect both authenticated and unauthenticated users and allow for 
malicious JavaScript to be executed within victim user browsers. Moreover, the vulnerabilities 
enable an attacker to collect the CMS authentication token from browser local storage 
and it is therefore possible for the attacker to gain unauthorized access to a victim user's session.
