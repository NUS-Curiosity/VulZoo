Subject: First result on google promotes insecure coding (XSS)

>From my IP and cookie jar, searching google for
"tutorial python cgi" returns as first result [1]
on tutorialspoint.com

In "Simple URL Example:Get Method"

```
first_name = form.getvalue('first_name')
last_name  = form.getvalue('last_name')
print "<h2>Hello %s %s</h2>" % (first_name, last_name)
```

Besides cgi tutorial, this is XSS and CSRF tutorial by example.

Does the so called security "community" plan to reduce teaching
insecure code?
