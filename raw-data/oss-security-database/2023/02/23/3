Unfortunately, no: sshd calls _exit() immediately after this information
leak, and fork()s + re-execv()s itself (and therefore re-randomizes its
address space) the next time we connect to it; i.e., a memory address
leaked in one connection is useless in another connection.

We are focusing on OpenBSD for now, because its malloc seems more
compatible with this particular double-free bug than glibc's malloc; we
will look into glibc/Linux at some point, and will keep you posted.

Thank you very much! With best regards,
