Hi Seth,

Thank you very much for your feedback.  I wouldn't have guessed you feel
that way about some of this.

Yet you suggest specific changes below.  Do you mean waiting until next
year before making written policy changes yet changing the way we
actually work sooner, or do you intend your suggestions for next year?

Usually, maybe - for less important issues such as most of the syzkaller
stuff you mention.  However, for StackRot there were so many messages on
the actual issue that even the significant number of messages on the
policy was relatively much smaller.  Of course, it could still be
annoying when people were working hard on getting the issue fixed.

Yes, that would make it easier to work together.  However, it wouldn't
work well for the kinds of disclosures we were getting to linux-distros
so far unless we decide and state in advance that Linux kernel issues
are exempt from our policies.

On the other hand, with the Linux kernel documentation edit, maybe we'll
start seeing linux-distros notified after s@k.o has fixes ready, and
maybe this will work well, and if so we can keep our policies.  Perhaps
in that case we won't need to remind the reporters of the policies in so
many messages because there would be a lot less coordination left to do.

Waiting until next year to see how it goes makes sense to me.

I agree that following the process so strictly makes little sense when
it's just an arbitrary subset of the actual issues being found and
(hopefully) fixed (unfortunately, in other cases silently).

Is every syzkaller issue a vulnerability?

However, the current policies require certain things from the reporter.
If we don't notify the reporter of this early on, we rely on them having
carefully read and understood the policies on their own, or else our
last-moment enforcement may come as a big unpleasant surprise to them.

Alternatively, we'd have to give up on the enforcement altogether.

I think a less unreasonable alternative to the above two options would
be (like I wrote above) to decide and state in advance that Linux kernel
issues are exempt from our policies.

The problem with this is that Linux kernel patches appearing "in
publicly visible trees or mail lists" tend not to have their security
relevance documented yet, and deliberately so, whereas "distributions
can apply fixes to their kernels" typically only along with documenting
the security relevance.  Surely distributions can start "integrating
patches, performing quality control" as soon as the fixes are available
and privately known to them as being important to integrate ASAP, but
they'd have to delay publication of the update packages.  This is how
it's been lately.  Are you suggesting that distributions start to ignore
the kernel maintainers' preference on not disclosing the security
relevance publicly for a while?  I doubt it, but then I don't see what
other change you might be suggesting.  Please clarify.

This is an interesting suggestion.  I think we'd first need to determine
whether this can be automated at all without ending up with CVEs
assigned in cases where they shouldn't have been per MITRE's guidelines
(e.g., when no security boundary is crossed in proper documented usage).

On one hand, I agree.  On the other, if it were not just an arbitrary
subset of issues, what would matter most isn't the researchers' effort
nor intent, but the nature of the issues - are they in fact security
issues, are they important, are they actionable by distros within days.
"No" to any of these means the issue is best not handled in private, but
first it takes effort to determine this.  Yes, it wastes our resources.

I do not have a solution I'd be entirely happy with, which is a reason
why we're having this discussion.
