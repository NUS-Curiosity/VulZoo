Subject: Node.js security updates for August

Reading the blog entry for this,
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/august-2023-security-releases
it appears that ALL of these vulnerabilities are for an experimental
feature ?

If so, is it practical to disable the feature when building current
LTS releases, or indeed when building current release ?  If not, is
there any easy way to determine what uses it ?
