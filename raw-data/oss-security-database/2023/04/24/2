Subject: CVE-2023-27524: Apache Superset: Session validation vulnerability
 when using provided default SECRET_KEY 

Description:

Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.
