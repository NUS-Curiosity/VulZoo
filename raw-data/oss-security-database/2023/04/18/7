Hello Jialin, thanks for contacting the oss-security mail list about this
security issue in an Apache project.

I'd like to suggest that your email would be far more useful if
it included some details like affected versions: ideally, when a
vulnerability was introduced, and definitely, when it was fixed, if a
fix is available. Best would be a direct link to a patch in a source
control system, or attaching the patch directly.

This particular email has very few details and no references for a fix so
it is very difficult for anyone to take concrete actions.

Here's two recent postings that are far easier for downstream distributors
and consumers alike to use:
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/04/1
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/03/21/3

I'd like to encourage Apache to use these as inspiration for future
oss-security postings.

Thanks
