I hesitate to reply to this thread because I struggle to understand what 
topic it has diverged into, but I just wanted to note that embedded 
browsers configured to accept a single self-signed certificate are not 
uncommon in corporate environments. Thus a (non-technical) end user may 
be using a browser like this that has been configured for them by device 
management. Whether this is a good design/idea, I leave to others’ 
judgement.
