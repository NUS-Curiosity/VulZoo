It's better for organizations to be aware of the vulnerabilities and risks
related to used software. Sometimes it is challenging to get the author/team to
fix the security issues (busy/unresponsive/miscommunication etc). This is very
common with plugins in different software as there are large number of
developers. It's better for users and community to disclose the issues if no
fix is provided as plugins can be disabled, WAF can be configured etc.
