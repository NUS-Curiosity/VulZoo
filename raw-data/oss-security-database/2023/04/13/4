(distros maintain "downstream" versions of the ncurses "upstream")

Ideally, a security patch should only include security relevant changes. 
If a bunch of a documentation or miscellaneous changes are added, it 
makes backporting difficult (i.e., the non-security relevant changes may 
not be desired or cause the patch to not apply cleanly to old versions 
of ncurses). The upstream patch is already made, but that's what I'd 
recommend for future patches. If there's a regression as Alice suggests, 
that might be a good opportunity to redo the patch format.

When you publish the CVE json5, you can references the patch URL and 
relevant bug discussions to help downstream. Including the CVE number in 
the patch commit is also quite helpful.

Thank you!

Which email did you contact Canonical with? I cannot find anything 
recent for ncurses on security@...ntu.com
