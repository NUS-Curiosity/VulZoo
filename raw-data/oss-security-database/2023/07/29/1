Subject: CVE-2023-36542: Apache NiFi: Potential Code Injection with
 Properties Referencing Remote Resources 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0

Description:

Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services that support HTTP URL references for retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code execution. The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.

This issue is being tracked as NIFI-11744
