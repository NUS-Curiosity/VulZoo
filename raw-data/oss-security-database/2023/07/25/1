Yes, but it by no means covers all zen 2 models.  See amd-ucode/README

  Family=0x17 Model=0x31 Stepping=0x00: Patch=0x0830107a Length=3200 bytes
  Family=0x17 Model=0xa0 Stepping=0x00: Patch=0x08a00008 Length=3200 bytes

17-31-00 Rome/Castle Peak	0x0830107a
17-a0-00 Mendocino		0x08a00008

Models missing include:

17-60-01 Renoir			0x0860010b
17-68-01 Lucienne		0x08608105
17-71-00 Matisse		0x08701032
17-90-02 Van Gogh

The known good patch levels are used by xen and linux.  But the
microcode for Renoir, Lucienne and Matisse is not available as far as
I can tell.
