                    Xen Security Advisory XSA-433

                          x86/AMD: Zenbleed

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers at Google have discovered Zenbleed, a hardware bug causing
corruption of the vector registers.

When a VZEROUPPER instruction is discarded as part of a bad transient
execution path, its effect on internal tracking are not unwound
correctly.  This manifests as the wrong micro-architectural state
becoming architectural, and corrupting the vector registers.

Note: While this malfunction is related to speculative execution, this
      is not a speculative sidechannel vulnerability.

The corruption is not random.  It happens to be stale values from the
physical vector register file, a structure competitively shared between
sibling threads.  Therefore, an attacker can directly access data from
the sibling thread, or from a more privileged context.

For more details, see:

IMPACT
======

With very low probability, corruption of the vector registers can occur.
This data corruption causes mis-calculations in subsequent logic.

An attacker can exploit this bug to read data from different contexts on
the same core.  Examples of such data includes key material, cypher and
plaintext from the AES-NI instructions, or the contents of REP-MOVS
instructions, commonly used to implement memcpy().

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

This bug is specific to the AMD Zen2 microarchitecture.  AMD do not
believe that other microarchitectures are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be mitigated by disabling AVX, either by booting Xen with
`cpuid=no-avx` on the command line, or by specifying `cpuid="host:avx=0"` in
the vm.cfg file of all untrusted VMs.  However, this will come with a
significant impact on the system and is not recommended for anyone able to
deploy the microcode or patch described below.

RESOLUTION
==========

AMD are producing microcode updates to address the bug.  Consult your
dom0 OS vendor.  This microcode is effective when late-loaded, which can
be performed on a live system without reboot.

In cases where microcode is not available, the appropriate attached
patch updates Xen to use a control register to avoid the issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.
