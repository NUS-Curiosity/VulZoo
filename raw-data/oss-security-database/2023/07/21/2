The openssh fixing patches (besides disallowing this remote agent
behaviour by default) now just abort() the pkcs11 helper if they load a library 
without the pkcs11 interface C_GetFunctionList() which should largely
solve the problem, unless a library can be exploited on first load.

Longrange thinking is if these kind of load/unload impacts could be
detected by tooling easily and/or get fixed in affected libraries.
