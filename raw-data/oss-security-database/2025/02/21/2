Subject: OpenH264 Decoding Functions Heap Overflow
 Vulnerability

https://github.com/cisco/openh264/security/advisories/GHSA-m99q-5j7x-7m9x reports:

> Description
> -----------
> A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could
> allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap overflow.
> 
> This vulnerability is due to a race condition between a Sequence Parameter
> Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous Decoder
> Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage.
> An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious
> bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video
> containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the attacker to
> cause an unexpected crash in the victim's user decoding client and, possibly,
> perform arbitrary commands on the victim's host by abusing the heap overflow.
> 
> Conditions
> ----------
> This vulnerability affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier releases.
> 
> Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced Video Coding (AVC) mode
> are affected by this vulnerability
> 
> Fixed Software
> --------------
> OpenH264 software releases 2.6.0 and later contained the fix for this
> vulnerability.
>
