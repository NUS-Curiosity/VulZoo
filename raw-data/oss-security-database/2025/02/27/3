> ISSUE DESCRIPTION
> =================
> 
> When setting up interrupt remapping for legacy PCI(-X) devices,
> including PCI(-X) bridges, a lookup of the upstream bridge is required.
> This lookup, itself involving acquiring of a lock, is done in a context
> where acquiring that lock is unsafe.  This can lead to a deadlock.

Is disabling interrupt remapping another way of mitigating this 
vulnerability (e.g iommu=no-intremap) ?
