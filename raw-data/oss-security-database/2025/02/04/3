KL-001-2025-001: Checkmk NagVis Reflected Cross-site Scripting

Title: Checkmk NagVis Reflected Cross-site Scripting
Advisory ID: KL-001-2025-001
Publication Date: 2025-02-04

1. Vulnerability Details

      Affected Vendor: Checkmk
      Affected Product: Checkmk/NagVis
      Affected Version: Checkmk 2.3.0p2, NagVis 1.9.40
      Platform: GNU/Linux
      CWE Classification: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input
                          During Web Page Generation
                          ('Cross-site Scripting')
      CVE ID: CVE-2024-13722


2. Vulnerability Description

      The "NagVis" component within Checkmk is vulnerable to reflected
      cross-site scripting. An attacker can craft a malicious link
      that will execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the
      browser once clicked. The attack can be performed on both
      authenticated and unauthenticated users.

3. Technical Description

      Checkmk version 2.3.0.p2 ships with a component named
      "NagVis", which is an addon for the network management
      system "Nagios". When receiving an HTTP POST request for the
      "userfiles/gadgets/std_table.php" file, the query and body
      parameters contained within the request are processed by the
      script. Specifically, the script accepts the "members" body
      parameter, which is then parsed as a JSON object.

      The "summary_state" property of the "members" JSON object is
      reflected into the page response without validation. A POST
      request containing a malicious "summary_state" value can inject
      arbitrary JavaScript via the HTML "script" tag into the page
      response. When rendered in a browser, the attacker controlled
      JavaScript executes, enabling an attacker to perform actions
      as the currently logged-in user.

      The "members" JSON object must be supplied via a POST
      body parameter, so exploitation of this issue relies
      on a cross-origin HTTP request originating from an
      attacker controlled web page. The malicious website
      (e.g. https://attacker.com/foo.html) can contain an HTML
      "form" tag with an "action" attribute pointing at the URL
      for the "std_table.php" script.  Additional JavaScript on the
      attacker controlled page can automatically submit the form once
      a user loads the page. The browser will send a POST request
      cross-origin and redirect the browser to the HTTP response of
      the POST request, thereby executing the malicious JavaScript
      on the NagVis web page.

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

      This issue has been remediated in Nagvis 1.9.42 and Checkmk
      2.3.0p10, both release 2024-07-15.

7. Proof of Concept

      1) Serve the following HTML from a web server (e.g. python -m http.server)
      2) View the URL serving the file in a web browser:
          <html>
               <form method='POST' 
action='http://checkmkhost/cmk/nagvis/userfiles/gadgets/std_table.php?object_id=1337&scale=100&opts=show_service_states=foo;group_states=0;&type=dyngroup&object_types=host&state=FL'>
                    <input type='hidden' name='members' 
value='[{"summary_in_downtime":1,"summary_state":"\"><script>eval(window.name)</script>"}]'>
               </form>

               <script>
                    window.onload = function() {
                         window.name = `prompt('KoreLogic')`;
                         document.forms[0].submit();
                    }
               </script>
          </html>
