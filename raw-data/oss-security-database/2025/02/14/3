Subject: Re: Monero 18.3.4 zero-day DoS vulnerability has been
 dropped publicly on social network.

Hi,

A patch [1] has just been merged upstream. The associated PR was already 
public for weeks and mentions a mitigation script [2] that was known for 
years already. Are they are related to the same DoS vulnerability that 
is now exploited in the wild?

> The paste link includes a list of nodes that the attacker has instructed to target, along with a Python code to leverage the attack. According to their explanation, this vulnerability is expected to be patched in the next release of Monero. Any Monero node that exposes its RPC port is vulnerable to memory exhaustion.
> 
> I can confirm that the Python code works and using it against a test node leads to a crash due to memory exhaustion. The code is extremely simple, as it spams requests without attempting to read responses, causing Monero to keep them indefinitely in memory until a crash occurs.
