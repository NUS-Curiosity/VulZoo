Subject: CVE-2024-37358: Apache James: denial of service through the use of
 IMAP literals 

Affected versions:

- Apache James server through 3.7.5
- Apache James server 3.8.0 through 3.8.1

Description:

Similarly to CVE-2024-34055, Apache James is vulnerable to denial of service through the abuse of IMAP literals from both authenticated and unauthenticated users, which could be used to cause unbounded memory allocation and very long computations

Version 3.7.6 and 3.8.2 restrict such illegitimate use of IMAP literals.
