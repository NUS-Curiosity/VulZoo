Attestations are cryptographically signed by the cpu, and meant to be sent
elsewhere and verified remotely. The key used to sign (VCEK) are dependent on
the microcode version, so it shouldn't be possible to forge new-looking
signature with old microcodes (i would hope this hold would someone be able to
decrypt a microcode, though i couldn't find information on that subject).
