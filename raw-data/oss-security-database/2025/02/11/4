Subject: Re: CVE-2024-12797: OpenSSL: RFC7250 handshakes with
 unauthenticated servers don't abort as expected

I assume a minor typo in the official advisory:

> OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.2.

*should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.3.


Could you fix it on https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250211.txt?

Thanks!
