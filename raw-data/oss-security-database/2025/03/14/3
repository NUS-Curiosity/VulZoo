I think if you're removing the 4 "phantom points" from outline.n_point and 
outline.n_contours, you probably need to add them back in other places, like the 
parts you are missing from this patch does:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/commit/47103b2f195e0f9664c9470182f063cb7d41dc9f

Is there a reproducer available for this CVE? I was thinking of just doing a 
minimal fix for older freetype versions in Ubuntu, maybe something like this:

-- a/src/truetype/ttgload.c
+++ b/src/truetype/ttgload.c

          outline.n_points   = (short)( gloader->current.num_subglyphs + 4 );
