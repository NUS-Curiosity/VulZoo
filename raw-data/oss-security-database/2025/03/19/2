How the attacker got the commit into the tj-action/changed-files 
namespace seems obvious (GitHub uses a common storage pool for a 
repository and its forks; an attacker need only fork a repository and 
push the malicious commit to his own fork), but has there been any 
progress on determining how the tags were repointed?

I hope the explanation is stolen credentials, but possibilities include 
exploits on maintenance bots or even GitHub itself.
