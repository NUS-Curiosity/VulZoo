Subject: tj-action/changed-files GitHub action was compromised

On March 14 2025 at 16:57:45 UTC the tj-action/changed-files GitHub action was
compromised with commit 0e58ed8 ("chore(deps): lock file maintenance (#2460)").
This commit was added to all 361 tagged versions of the GitHub action. This
malicious commit results in a script that can leak CI/CD secrets from runner
memory.

The compromised action has been removed from GitHub.

We are discovering open source projects which are using the compromised action.

StepSecurity [0] and Semgrep [1] posted early analysis.

Cheers,
Mark
