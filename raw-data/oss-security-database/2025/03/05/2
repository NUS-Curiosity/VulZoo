SECURITY-3495 / CVE-2025-27622
Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not redact
encrypted values of secrets when accessing `config.xml` of agents via REST
API or CLI.

This allows attackers with Agent/Extended Read permission to view encrypted
values of secrets.


SECURITY-3496 / CVE-2025-27623
Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not redact
encrypted values of secrets when accessing `config.xml` of views via REST
API or CLI.

This allows attackers with View/Read permission to view encrypted values of
secrets.


SECURITY-3498 / CVE-2025-27624
Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not require POST
requests for the HTTP endpoint toggling collapsed/expanded status of
sidepanel widgets (e.g., Build Queue and Build Executor Status widgets),
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to have users toggle their
collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets.

Additionally, as the API accepts any string as the identifier of the panel
ID to be toggled, attacker-controlled content can be stored in the victim's
user profile in Jenkins.


SECURITY-3501 / CVE-2025-27625
Various features in Jenkins redirect users to partially user-controlled
URLs inside Jenkins. To prevent open redirect vulnerabilities, Jenkins
limits redirections to safe URLs (neither absolute nor
scheme-relative/network-path reference).

In Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier, redirects starting
with backslash (`\`) characters are considered safe.

This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a
Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site, because browsers
interpret these characters as part of scheme-relative redirects.
