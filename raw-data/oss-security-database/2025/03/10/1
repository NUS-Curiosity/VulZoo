Wow, this is amazing, and your write-up is a gem, thank you so much for
working on all this and for sharing it!

Just thinking out loud, but would it somehow be possible to continuously
run Jordy's and/or Buher치tor's CodeQL queries to prevent the
reappearance of such issues?

Maybe someone from CodeQL or GitHub Security Lab could chime in or help
with this? Again, just thinking out loud.

Thank you very much! With best regards,
