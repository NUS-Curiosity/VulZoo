It certainly surprised me! That being said, given the potential danger
is I guess limited to extracting multiple archives you didn't expect but
you still cannot control the location (without using the
member-named-leading-dash-d trick as well) and you also have to convince
the user to have multiple zip archives in the same directory, it seems
harder to pull anything off like this.

Note: unzip won't re-parse globs in a directory segment, only the final
filename segment.

unzip will not permit you to run:

```
unzip foo.zip ./dir1/member
```

in order to extract an archive member named "dir1/member". There is no
./ member in the archive, it's not resolved like a filesystem path.

It will print a diagnostic: "caution: filename not matched:
./dir1/member" and exit 11 (no matching files were found.)
