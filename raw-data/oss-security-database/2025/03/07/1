Subject: CVE-2025-26865: Apache OFBiz: Server-Side Template Injection
 affecting the ecommerce plugin leading to possible RCE 

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache OFBiz 18.12.17 before 18.12.18

Description:

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine vulnerability in Apache OFBiz.

This issue affects Apache OFBiz: from 18.12.17 before 18.12.18.  

It's a regression between 18.12.17 and 18.12.18.
In case you use something like that, which is not recommended!
For security, only official releases should be used.

In other words, if you use 18.12.17 you are still safe.
The version 18.12.17 is not a affected.
But something between 18.12.17 and 18.12.18 is.

In that case, users are recommended to upgrade to version 18.12.18, which fixes the issue.
