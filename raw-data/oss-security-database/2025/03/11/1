Subject: CVE-2025-27017: Apache NiFi: Potential Insertion of MongoDB Password
 in Provenance Record

Affected versions:

- Apache NiFi 1.13.0 through 2.2.0
- Apache NiFi 2.3.0 unaffected

Description:

Apache NiFi 1.13.0 through 2.2.0 includes the username and password
used to authenticate with MongoDB in the NiFi provenance events that
MongoDB components generate during processing. An authorized user with
read access to the provenance events of those processors may see the
credentials information. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.3.0 is the
recommended mitigation, which removes the credentials from provenance
event records.

This issue is being tracked as NIFI-14272
