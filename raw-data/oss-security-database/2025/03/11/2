The timeline basically looks like this:
- CVE-2024-43768, CVE-2024-43767 and CVE-2024-43097 were fixed in the December
  Android update and are in Skia, a 2G graphics library which is also bundled
  by Firefox/Thunderbird
- These CVEs appeared in the CVE feed on 2025-01-02 and when triaging incoming
  security issues for Debian, I noticed that while Firefox was fixed via some
  rebase to a newer version of Skia, these fixes were missing in Firefox ESR
  128, which hadn't seen the respective Skia rebase (since these fixes were
  not identified as security-relevant)
- I reported these to the Mozilla security team on 2025-01-09
- On 2025-02-03 they confirmed that CVE-2024-43768 and CVE-2024-43767 are
  in code which isn't exercised in Firefox
- On 2025-03-04 the Firefox/Thunderbird 128.8 releases were published which
  include a fix for CVE-2024-43097

Cheers,
