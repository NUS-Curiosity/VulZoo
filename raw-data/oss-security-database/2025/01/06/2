For those wanting to understand this, that means that any kernel version
from release of:
	3.17
to the following releases:
	4.9.331 4.14.296 4.19.262 5.4.220 5.10.150 5.15.75 5.19.17 6.0.3 6.1
is vulnerable, and anything newer than that (i.e. any kernel newer than
August of 2022) is just fine.

Hopefully everyone here is running a kernel newer than August of 2022,
but hey, who knows!

hope this helps,
