Subject: Go 1.23.5 and Go 1.22.11 are released with 2 security fixes

https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/sSaUhLA-2SI announces:

> We have just released Go versions 1.23.5 and 1.22.11, minor point releases.
> 
> These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:
> 
>     crypto/x509: usage of IPv6 zone IDs can bypass URI name constraints
> 
>     A certificate with a URI which has a IPv6 address with a zone ID may
>     incorrectly satisfy a URI name constraint that applies to the certificate
>     chain.
> 
>     Certificates containing URIs are not permitted in the web PKI, so this
>     only affects users of private PKIs which make use of URIs.
> 
>     Thanks to Juho ForsÃ©n of Mattermost for reporting this issue.
> 
>     This is CVE-2024-45341 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/71156.
> 
>     net/http: sensitive headers incorrectly sent after cross-domain redirect
> 
>     The HTTP client drops sensitive headers after following a cross-domain redirect.
>     For example, a request to a.com/ containing an Authorization header which is
>     redirected to b.com/ will not send that header to b.com.
> 
>     In the event that the client received a subsequent same-domain redirect, however,
>     the sensitive headers would be restored. For example, a chain of redirects from
>     a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectly send the Authorization
>     header to b.com/2.
> 
>     Thanks to Kyle Seely for reporting this issue.
> 
>     This is CVE-2024-45336 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/70530.
> 
> View the release notes for more information:

> git checkout go1.23.5 and build as usual.
>
