Subject: iTerm2 < 3.5.11 logs input/ouput to /tmp/framer.txt on remote host

iterm2 (https://iterm2.com), a popular Terminal.app
replacement for macOS, announced a vulnerability in
versions < 3.5.11 whereby input/output from an SSH
connection may be logged to the file /tmp/framer.txt
on the remote host.  To the best of my knowledge,
there is no CVE associated with this vulnerability.

The announcement (below) notes that this file "may be
readable by other users", presumably depending on the
user's umask on that system.

iterm2 is published under the GPL with source code

Version 3.5.11 of iTerm2 was built on January 2, 2025.

This release contains a critical security fix. I
strongly recommend updating immediately.

Who is affected?
----------------
You may be affected if you used the SSH
integration feature in any of the following
versions:

* 3.5.6
* 3.5.7
* 3.5.8
* 3.5.9
* 3.5.10
* Any beta versions of 3.5.6 and later.

What is the issue?
------------------
A bug in the SSH integration feature caused input
and output to be logged to a file on the remote
host. This file, /tmp/framer.txt, may be readable
by other users on the remote host.

When does this occur?
---------------------
The issue occurs if both of the following conditions
are true:

1. Either:
   a) You used the it2ssh command, or
   b) In Settings > Profiles > General, the
      Command popup menu was set to "SSH" (not
      "Login Shell", "Command", or "Custom
      Command") AND "SSH Integration" was checked
      in the SSH configuration dialog. That dialog
      is shown when you click the Configure button
      next to the ssh arguments field in Settings.
2. The remote host has Python 3.7 or later
   installed in its default search path.

What should you do?
-------------------
* Upgrade immediately to version 3.5.11.
* Delete /tmp/framer.txt on affected hosts.

How I'm addressing this
-----------------------
I deeply regret this mistake and will take steps
to ensure it never happens again.

The code to write to log files in SSH integration
has been deleted and will not be publicly released
again.
