The larger problem is that component scoring tends to be higher than
whole-system scoring.  If a security component fails in its security
function, it certainly deserves an impact rating that reflects that it's
totally broken due to the vulnerability.  But if this component is
integrated into a larger system, impact is often lower and might even be
insignificant due to the way the component is used.

The current system does not really reflect that.  One way to deal with
it could be to treat everything as a fork, but not to decouple from
upstream changes, but to make it clear that the upstream impact ratings
do not apply.

Thanks,
Florian
