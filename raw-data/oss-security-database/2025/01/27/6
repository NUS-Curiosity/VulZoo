Florian,
The question is about who is scoring and a level of their knowledge and
understanding.   Assuming that each is using CVSS v3.1 then the question is
does the scoring entity look at how the component is built and used or are
they scoring for every eventuality and device across all time (and in turn
introducing 'temporal' scoring into that 'base' score).   We often see that
broad interpretation and the creeping in of temporal scoring to "elevate"
the CVSS.

It is why I would advocate for a CVSS review (as we do at Red Hat) and then
assign a 'Severity Rating' as that now involves how the component is used
within our software which changes HOW a customer/downstream/user should
actually view that CVE.

So I will state that the way some aggregators of CVEs assign CVSS is the
problem.   Consider that overreach and then the reliance by regulators
and/or internal audit make a broad rule and everyone is bringing down the
house.

So the issue of identifying the 'component' becomes truly important (CPE
does not cover OSS and hence the new drive to incorporate PURL to better
identify CVEs and essentially get to your fork construct.
