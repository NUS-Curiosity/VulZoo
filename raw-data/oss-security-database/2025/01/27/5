Johannes,
If that community does not have a CNA with it in their scope, it is open
for assignment.    Sometimes it is easier to have a Root CNA assign for
that under the CVE Services.  Just note that as the CNA, everyone can /
should come back to you for the updates and the CNA vulnrichment will come
back to your CNA.
Pete
PS I am on the CVE Board.
