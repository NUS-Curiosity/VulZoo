We will sent eMail notifications to anyone that requests them , 
including oss-security, when we release security advisories which 
include both open source and closed source products.   Oracle will not 
specifically call out open-source projects such as Java and MySQL but 
Oracle expects recipients to filter Oracle's advisories for their 
specific areas of interest.   Since Oracle provides our advisories in 
the Oasis machine readable standard CSAF format, Oracle expects such 
organization to be able to automate such filtering and we know that many 
customer do filtering by processing CSAF machine readable documents.

I am unclear regarding what you are requesting.   Can you provide some 
examples.   I would note that security vulnerabilities and associated 
CVEs are only published in Critical Patch Update and Security Alert 
advisories.

Security vulnerabilities are announced in quarterly Critical Patch 
Update Advisories such as

    * https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2025.html

These include CVE and CVSS information.    Vulnerabilities are not 
announced until
all supported product versions have patches available so that 
vulnerability fix information in
one version is less likely to be used in successful attacks against 
versions that do
not yet have patches.    Also, we like to test dependent versions of 
batched products to
reduce the chances that vulnerability fixes in one product will lead to 
incompatibilities
in other dependent products.

The embargo end is coordinated centrally, as you suspected.

I am not familiar with the details of patch delivery in MySQL vs Virtual 
Box vs Java, etc. with
respect to identification of which CVEs are addressed in specific 
fixes.    However, in many
other products this mapping is evident so I expect the same is true 
here, as well.
