You're correct, these would generally be off-topic here.

So in this thread I am not talking about Oracle's OS distros, but about
Oracle's upstream Open Source projects.  Looking at the Critical Patch
Update, I don't know which projects fit such criteria.  Like I wrote, I
think it's MySQL and VirtualBox, but probably not only these two.
Perhaps also Java?  I'm not familiar with most of Oracle's products and
their licensing.

Also, in some cases we make exceptions for projects closely related to
or enabling Open Source ones e.g. as in the recent AMD microcode thread.
