We considered this and might go this route, but this is mostly for embargoed
issues. For more important vulnerabilities we share them via (linux-)
distros, but it would be IMHO kind of weird to request CVEs for non-public
vulnerabilities from RH.

We're not empowered to do this. We are a CNA for code that we own (e.g.
zypper), but not for arbitrary open source projects.
