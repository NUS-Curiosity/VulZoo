Subject: AMD Microcode Signature Verification Vulnerability

It looks like an OEM leaked the patch for a major upcoming CPU
vulnerability, i.e. "AMD Microcode Signature Verification
Vulnerability":

https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-x870-i-gaming-wifi/helpdesk_bios/

I'm not thrilled about this - the patch is *not* currently in
linux-firmware, so this is the only publicly available patch.

However, other people are discussing how to extract them:
