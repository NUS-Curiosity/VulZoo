Subject: CVE-2024-53299: Apache Wicket: An attacker can intentionally
 trigger a memory leak 

Severity: critical

Affected versions:

- Apache Wicket 7.0.0 through 7.18.*
- Apache Wicket 8.0.0-M1 through 8.16.*
- Apache Wicket 9.0.0-M1 through 9.18.*
- Apache Wicket 10.0.0-M1 through 10.2.*

Description:

The request handling in the core in Apache Wicket 7.0.0 on any platform allows an attacker to create a DOS via multiple requests to server resources.
Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 9.19.0 or 10.3.0, which fixes this issue.
