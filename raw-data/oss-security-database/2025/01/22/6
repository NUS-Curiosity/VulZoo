Is this fix effective, or can it be bypassed via a downgrade attack?

Since microcode loading can (hopefully!) only be done in ring 0 and SVM
root mode, this means that one needs OS kernel access to perform an
exploit.  However, if an attacker could load arbitrary microcode, they
could compromise SMM, SEV-SNP, and DRTM, so this is still pretty bad.
