Subject: Re: issue with stuck Mitre CVE requests

Hello,

For CVE assignments there is no need for a Root CNA. You can request a
CVE ID from any CNA which has a valid scope for the affected
component/product.

Root CNAs work only with other CNAs to onboard them, provide support,
and mediate disputes. Red Hat works in both roles, but only the CNA is
needed in this case.

To request a CVE ID from us, you can use our contact listed at Mitre's
Partners List[1] (secalert@...hat.com). No need to have prior
relations or communications.

If a project wants to become a CNA themselves, the Root CNA contact
(or both) may be used (rootcna-coordination@...hat.com).

Mitre is CNA of Last Resort and can assign CVE IDs for anything.
However, relying solely on them may overwhelm their request channels.
And although we want to avoid duplicate assignments, If you get no
response for a long time, you can request a CVE ID from another CNA.
As it is also possible to request CVE Rejection for duplicate CVEs
later.
