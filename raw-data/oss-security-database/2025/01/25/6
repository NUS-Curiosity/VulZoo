An issue we've observed is it can be hard to map to open-source projects
for Java/OpenJDK at least.

For example, CVE-2025-21502 appears under "Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix",
but determining if OpenJDK was affected (and what the actual details,
inc. patch) were involved googling it and happening upon
https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0421.

Is there another source of this information anyone is aware of? Thanks.

(Ideally one published by Oracle rather than something others then
collate otherwise.)
