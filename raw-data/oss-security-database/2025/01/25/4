Subject: Re: Node.js EOL CVEs: CVE-2025-23087, CVE-2025-23088, CVE-2025-23089

Assigning a CVE for EOL is actually outside the normal practice (there is
another standard for that underway) and is not in line with Rule 4.1 as
part of the CVE program.

I do agree with Greg K-H that open source projects should become CNAs.
 But do want to note that missing elements of the CVE when submitting
allows CISA-ADP to 'vulnrich' your data.  Here is where
misinterpretation and/or lack of understanding by CISA confuses downstream
users and once you gain that 'critical' stigma in the system, you have to
be persistent to get that changed.

Is that a problem?   I think so and so do a number of PSIRTs so now we have
to contend with CISA-ADP and NVD to adjust their scores when the CNA is
'the authoritative source' within the CVE Program.
