segmentation fault in win_line() in Vim < 9.1.1043
==================================================
Date: 20.01.2025
Severity: Medium
CVE: CVE-2025-24014
CWE: Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just
operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to
trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim
by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the
scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the
ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated
(since there is no screen).

In Patch 9.1.1043 Vim will therefore skip the redraw attempt, by testing
whether the ScreenLines pointer is NULL.

Impact is medium since the user must intentionally and explicitly feed
some binary data to Vim in ex mode.

The Vim project would like to thank github user @fizz-is-on-the-way
for reporting this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1003
