Yhe errata mailing list: https://oss.oracle.com/mailman/listinfo/el-errata is an analogue of the late lamented red hat announcement mailing list and it's a bit too busy to post that here (eg there we bout 20 new messages today which are announcements,basically, of backported security fixes to the various bistro versions).  The quarterly linux security bulletin is unfortunately about three months out of date by the time it arrives.
