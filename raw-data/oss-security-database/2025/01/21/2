It was reported to us via the Security Advisory feature of Github and
while I am convinced that this cannot be used to do any harm to users
(except for crashing), there was still a small possibility that this may
have been abused in the future.

So when in doubt, I go with the handling this as security relevant.

The CVE calculator tends to exaggerate the score, even when being
conservative with each metric.

Thanks,
