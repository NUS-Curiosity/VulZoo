Subject: Re: issue with stuck Mitre CVE requests

Hi list,

thank you all for your input so far.

It seems this thread somehow reached Mitre and my stuck CVE request got
a CVE assignment by now. The reply also contains some additional
information which I believe will be interesting to share in this thread
as well:

Additionally Mitre expressed that they are working on improvements to
prevent such situations in the future.
