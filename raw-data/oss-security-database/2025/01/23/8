Subject: Re: [External] : Fwd: Oracle January 2025 Critical Patch Update

Bruce,

Thank you very much for your reply.  My reading of it is that Oracle is
already doing a lot (publication in 3 formats) and isn't willing to do
more (also separately send info pertaining to Oracle's Open Source
projects to oss-security).  Is that correct?

If so, maybe someone external should start doing that... or someone from
Oracle on one's own time... or people with the individual projects
(e.g., someone involved in MySQL and someone involved in VirtualBox
development)?

Related to the last point/idea, I notice that the individual projects do
not appear to include security/CVE info in their release announcements.
For example, here are the recent ones for MySQL and VirtualBox with no
mention of the security issues/fixes at all:

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/9.2/en/news-9-2-0.html
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.2/en/mysql-nutshell.html

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-7.1
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-7.0

Maybe that's because the embargo end is coordinated centrally for the
Critical Patch Update, and the projects end up never being given a green
light to release the info on their own as well?  Or just do not go back
and add previously-suppressed change log entries?  If so, could this be
corrected?  Just guessing here, I could as well be wrong about it.

Thanks again,

Alexander
