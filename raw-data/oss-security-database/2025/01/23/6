Once a quarter, per the schedule published on:

People from Oracle have read this, but it's specifically people from
the Security Alerts team who publish those documents who would need to
do this.

The open source packages delivered in Oracle Linux & Oracle Solaris are
listed separately, but these are downstreams, so I've always thought they'd
be off topic here, since we normally only cover upstream issues, and don't
publish every distro's notices that they've applied the latest fixes to
rsync, openssl, glibc, or whatever upstream was fixed this week.

For those who want to see such downstream notices, you can find them at:

Oracle Linux:
