I mean we shouldn't sweep the logrotate issues under the carpet, even if
logrotate wasn't suppose to handle such use cases initially. I have an
impression that's what you suggest. I mean this:

So I think all the logrotate issues should get their CVEs with an advise to
work around misuse cases by chowning the log directories root:root.

The Gentoo issues, I think they don't need CVEs and will be fixed by the
Gentoo security team (they are aware). The point was to show the misuse
cases are common.
