Subject: CVE Request -- Erlang/OTP R14, Erlang/OTP R14B01, Erlang/OTP R14B02
 -- multiple security fixes

Hello Steve, vendors,

   based on:
   [1] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=619857

   and:
   [2] http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R14B.readme
   [3] http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R14B01.readme
   [4] http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R14B02.readme

performed some initial issues review -- erlang-CVE-request.txt
attached. But since not sure, which of those are real security
flaws and how many CVE ids will be needed for those, Cc-ing
also Erlang upstream developers to shed more light into this.

The distribution of OTPs is as follows:
=======================================
Rickard Green:          OTP-8810, OTP-8781, OTP-8925, OTP-9005, OTP-8999
Bjorn-Egil Dahlberg:    OTP-8814, OTP-8827, OTP-8943
Sverker Eriksson:       OTP-8945, OTP-8716
Patrik Nyblom:          OTP-7178, OTP-8780, OTP-8993
Raimo Niskanen:         OTP-8729, OTP-8795
Bjorn Gustavsson:       OTP-8831, OTP-8892, OTP-9117
Niclas Axelsson:        OTP-9101
Hans Bolinder:          OTP-8898

Rickard, Bjorn-Egil, Sverker, Patrik, Raimo, Bjorn, Niclas, Hans,
could you please have a look at the attached review file
and reply which of the #20 OTPs in the list are security flaws
(so we would know the count of CVE identifiers needed) and which
are just bugs? (since you know the Erlang code better than me)

Help / guidance from your side is really appreciated to resolve
this one.

Thank you in advance for your time and cooperation.

Regards, Jan.
