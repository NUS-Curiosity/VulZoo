Looks this one being just security hardening with the patches:
[1] http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/4503
[2] http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/4504

For the CSRF flaws:

> Security: protect login form submission from CSRF
Patch: [3] http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/4490

> Security: prevent from relaying malicious requests through modcss.inc"
Patch: [4] http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/4488

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
