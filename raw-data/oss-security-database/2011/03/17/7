Subject: Re: The risks of cleaning /tmp

The tmpreaper package (at least in Debian) has a pretty good writeup
of a lot of the security problems involved in cleaning /tmp, which
I've copied at <http://nelhage.com/files/README.security>, since I
can't find another good source online.

It's probably worth reading that document to get perspective on some
of the thought that's been put into this problem before.
