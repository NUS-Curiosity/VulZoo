Subject: CVE request: kernel: heap corruption in IrDA

When providing an invalid IrDA nickname for an IrNET peer, a local
attacker can cause a kernel panic due to an underflow in a memcpy()
size calculation or cause a controllable heap overflow that may lead
to privilege escalation.  Write access to the /dev/irnet device file
is required to trigger the vulnerability.
