Of course failing to anticipate security impact is bound to happen in
the kernel; it frequently happens in userland too, and is unavoidable.
 That doesn't mean we can't try, and it doesn't mean we should be
overly paranoid and have security folks manually audit every patch.
Currently, maintainers and bug reporters are expected to ask
themselves a simple question when deciding whether or not to CC
stable: "does this fix a bug or security issue, or is it a new
feature?".  Similarly, I don't think it's too much to ask for people
to consider the question of "does this bug it allow an unprivileged
user to crash the system, gain additional access, or otherwise cross
privilege boundaries?"  And if the answer is "I don't know, maybe?",
then they should CC this list to be safe.  I think this would result
in not nearly as much volume as you're anticipating.

Why is CC'ing a security list any more difficult than CC'ing stable?

Perhaps you're right, but maybe we can generate some discussion to
come up with a solution that improves upstream security communication
and IS workable.
