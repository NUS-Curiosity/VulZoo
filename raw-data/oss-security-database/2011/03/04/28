I think that "chmod 777 /var/log" is "blatant admin negligence".  As to,
say, "chown nginx /var/log/nginx", it could be negligence or it could be
lack of familiarity with the risks involved.  So I am willing to admit
that it's not necessarily negligence that turns those issues into
vulnerabilities on specific systems.

Oh, this is something I did not realize.  A lot of people assume that
CVEs "blame" the software and its authors for having made an error.

It felt wrong, say, to blame a text editor for being unsafe to use on
files in untrusted directories when such unsafety was the typical and
expected situation for text editors in general.

Thank you for your responses!
