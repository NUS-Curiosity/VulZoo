We do this *if* we are aware of the subtleties.  But this often requires 
an understanding of the expected software behavior, and CVE covers 
thousands of different applications each year.  Unfortunately, we can't 
have that level of understanding about each app.

Some items can be assigned a CVE without deep thought about the larger 
context.  This may happen due to volume, time constraints, or an 
under-specified attack scenario by the requester.  That may be the case 
with the case you're talking about here, but I don't remember it.
