Actually, not so much.  Of the flaws we rated impact critical or with a 
CVSS of 'high', only 4 were from that 29 from vendor-sec.

It's where the date the issue was public is the same date it was reported 
to vendor-sec.  This can be because it was brought to the wrong list, the 
embargo was a day or less, or less often vendors wanted to discuss 
something about it confidentially (a way to exploit it, etc)
