I guess that is the most likely vector - how often did you download ISO images 
from somewhere - it is often for me?

How often did you get USB drives from somebody - it happens frequently?

How often did you mount them?

I guess, this happened often. The concern here is that most users are very 
unsuspecting of the discussed issue. Most people think that you should not 
execute files from unknown media. But hardly anyone thinks that simply 
mounting the media or listing directory contents would cause problems. At 
least that is what I have learned.

Ciao
