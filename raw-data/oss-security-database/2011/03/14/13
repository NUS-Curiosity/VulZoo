Subject: CVE request: format-string vulnerability in PHP Phar extension

Hi,
I just found several format-string vulnerability in PHP Phar extension, a
bug has been filed in the PHP bugtracker (private):
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54247
On error several class methods passes the supplied argument to
zend_throw_exception_ex()
which prints a formatted error message using such value as the formatter
string.

$ sapi/cli/php ../bug.php "%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x"
PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PharException' with message 'unable to
open phar for reading "00000008.00000000.bf95c204.0963e050.00000014"' in
/home/felipe/dev/bug.php:4

Thanks.
