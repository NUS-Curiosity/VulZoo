It should, for the reasons you gave:

There are various precedents in CVE.  For example, when a browser shows a 
lock icon (or some other indicator of connection 
confidentiality/integrity) when the connection isn't actually encrypted 
(e.g. CVE-2010-3312, CVE-2009-1107).


Regarding UPnP warning for vino - it's a little more difficult to clearly 
define when a product doesn't give "enough warning" to a user, but there 
are precedents (e.g. CVE-2010-0497, CVE-2008-4234, CVE-2000-0277, 
CVE-1999-1055).

FYI, people interested in security issues related to the UI could look at 
CWE-445, CWE-357, and CWE-355 for starters.  It doesn't seem like a very 
well-explored area.
