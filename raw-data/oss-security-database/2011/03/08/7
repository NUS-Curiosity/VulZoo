Upstream does not seem to consider this to be an issue:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=531160#c1

Debian also uses the patch similar to what ldv pointed out - it changes
ldd to always do:

  LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /path/to/ELF-lib-or-binary

rather than:

  LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /path/to/ELF-lib-or-binary
