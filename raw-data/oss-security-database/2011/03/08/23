Here is the latest fix for the TOCTOU (e.g. time-of-check-time-of-use) problem: http://news.php.net/php.pear.core/9791 - A proper mix of lstat, fopen, fstat (to ensure no one has messed around with the file pointer between the check and getting the handler) as well as adding in a nlink check to make sure it is 1.

Hopefully this is enough to fix the problem you had with my earlier fixes and get me the CVE number.
