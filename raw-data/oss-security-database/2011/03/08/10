The DISA STIG now recommends that ldd be disabled, that pretty much means deleted, on 
any Linux OS that is not patched to protect against it:

  <Rule id="SV-28909r1_rule" severity="medium">
            <version>GEN007960</version>
            <title>The 'ldd' command must be disabled unless it protects against the 
execution of untrusted files.</title>
