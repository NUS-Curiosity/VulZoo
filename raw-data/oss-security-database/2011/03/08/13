Subject: KDE SSL name check issue

Hi!

KDE recently fixed an issue in the code checking host names of the
server SSL certificates.  Previously, it accepted certificate as valid
for the site if it was issued for the user-specified host name, or if
it was issued for an IP address to which user-specified host name
resolved.

An attacker able to get an SSL certificate form a trusted CA issued for
an attacker-controlled IP address could perform a MITM attack, if they
were also able to hijack victim's DNS to resolve host names to the
attacker's IP.

Fixed upstream in:
https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdelibs/repository/revisions/76f935197599a335a5fe09b78751ddb455248cf7

Patch is included in kdelibs 4.6.1.
