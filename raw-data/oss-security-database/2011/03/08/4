Subject: CVE request: kernel: dccp: fix oops on Reset after close

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/682954
http://git.kernel.org/linus/720dc34bbbe9493c7bd48b2243058b4e447a929d

"This fixes a bug in the order of dccp_rcv_state_process() that still 
permitted reception even after closing the socket. A Reset after close 
thus causes a NULL pointer dereference by not preventing operations on 
an already torn-down socket."

Thanks, Eugene
