Right. So that CVE should apply to the case of it listening on a
publicly available IP address with no auth, whether it uses uPnP or not.

If it just listens on the socket and is usable from the outside world
without a password, that's the *same* problem.

The CVE really has nothing to do with uPnP; it's about the lack of
authentication on a publicly-available service.
