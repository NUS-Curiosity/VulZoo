I strongly disagree that this is CVE-worthy, or even a bug.

That's what uPnP is *for*.

Opening a port with uPnP, in a NAT-afflicted situation, is identical to
binding to and listening on INADDR_ANY when you have real network
connectivity. It's the moral equivalent to automatically using SOCKS to
make outbound connections, if you're afflicted with a network that needs
that.

There *is* an option to disable this feature, if the user really wants
to. And of course it should be clearly indicated that the service is
available to the public; but *that* is what CVE-2011-1164 is for.

There is also some merit in arguing that connections from outside the
local network should not be permitted without a password. But again,
there's nothing specific to uPnP in that.
