Subject: Re: announcing libwipe

hi,

I like this idea, and could be very useful especially in massive
shared environment (as in lot of users sharing a server, like web
servers for example).

My only concern right now is the choice of the gplv3, which is a no go
for many projects, especially for a library. Any chance to release it
under a more permissive or non viral license like bsd or MIT?

ps: that's not a license FUD, only a question (before I got shot :).

Cheers,
