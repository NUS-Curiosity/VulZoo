Subject: CVE Request: MyBB 1.6 <= Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

1. OVERVIEW

MyBB was vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.


2. APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

MyBB is a free bulletin board system software package developed by the
MyBB Group.
It's supposed to be developed from XMB and DevBB bulletin board applications.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Two XSS vulnerabilities were found. One is user-driven XSS on "url" parameter.
User will get xssed upon successful log-in.
The other is a reflected XSS on "posthash" parameter where the valid
tid (topic id) is required for successful attack.
The anti-CSRF check against "my_post_key" parameter was not done in
thread/post preview mode and thus there came a way for XSS to be
successful.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
