This certainly underscores that very few flaws need vendor-sec
coordination, but I would suspect that out of those roughly 725 flaws,
many of the really critical ones came through vendor-sec. Does that match
your records? (Ubuntu doesn't currently track the origin of flaws beyond
giving credit, so I'm curious if RH's data matches my sense of critical
flaw origin.)

I'm also curious what "issues already public but found out about it on
vendor-sec" means? Does that mean it was inappropriately brought to
vendor-sec after it was already public, or that RH found out about it
after it was public even though it had already been discussed privately
on vendor-sec?

Several upstreams, though disappointingly not the Linux kernel, are very
good about keeping their end-users in mind and providing direct distro
coordination for important security updates (MIT Kerberos comes to mind
first as a great example). This number of upstreams has been growing,
but it's not nearly large enough to supplant a vendor-sec-like mailing
list, IMO.

I'm all for the public disclosure of things that are low priority. But I
think it's important to maintain coordination for really nasty flaws,
otherwise we're in a position to really do a disservice to end-users.
