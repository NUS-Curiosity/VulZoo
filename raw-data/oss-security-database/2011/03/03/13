As an outsider with limited visibility into vendor-sec, this would be my 
impression too.  I would imagine that things like major protocol design 
flaws or critical, hard-to-fix bugs in popular software would still need 
coordination across multiple parties with a need for non-disclosure for a 
relatively long period of time.  Maybe vendor-sec-2 could handle that 
need.
