We monitor how we first found out about every issue we eventually fix, and 
if we found out before or after the issue was public.

For vendor-sec, during last calendar years

date		# issues in advance		# issues already public
2008		69				32
2009		57				17
2010		29				22

That 29 represents just 4% of the total number of our vulnerabilities 
fixed in 2010.  The median time of embargo for those 29 issues was 15 days 
(average 24)

But I think that trend is what was expected, as upstream projects 
communicate with affected vendors directly, and we use oss-security for 
issues that don't need embargo or co-ordination.

Thanks, Mark
