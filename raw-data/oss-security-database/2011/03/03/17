Ok, that's fair enough, I will not disagree with that.

Then, as I have always said, someone needs to step up and actually do
this type of communication work.  I personally don't have the time to, I
am swamped with just getting the stable updates out in a semi-timely
fashion.  Digging through every patch in these releases and properly
conveying the real, or percieved reason why they are needed, is a lot of
thankless work.  Jon at lwn.net tried it for just one release, and we
are averaging about one a week (total number of kernels released that
is).  No one else has yet tried to do that, but if they will, I will be
_glad_ to point my release notifications at that summary.

So in other words, help is gladly accepted :)
