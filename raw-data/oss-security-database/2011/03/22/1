Subject: Possible security fixes in 5.05?

Hi,

From file's 5.05 changelog[1] it seems like some security-relevant changes were 
made, but I'm unable to find further information. I saw a git repository being 
mentioned in a message but I can't find it either.

Can anyone please shed some light to the security-related changes?

I would like to encourage developers to communicate such kind of issues openly 
in this list, as it helps getting them fixed in distributions.

Thanks in advance.
