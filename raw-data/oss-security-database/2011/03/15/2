:No, it is closed, as it should be as potential security problems are
:mailed there.  You don't want that to be totally open, right?

One suggestion I've made in the past is to have the list _archives_ be
open.  So anything older than, say, a month is made public.  That way,
folks can see how issues were disclosed, how decisions were reached,
etc.  for old issues that are no longer under embargo.  The way I see
it, if we don't publish the list archive on our own terms, miscreants
will get around to publishing it for us.
