First 19 bugs allow anybody to interact with hardware on low level -
write to hw registers, load firmware, etc.

I'm not sure about ubifs debugfs files - they allow anybody to dump some
fs related information via printk(KERN_DEBUG, ...);  maybe it is just a
bit more precise statistics than statvfs(2) without any disclosure, but
I cannot understand it without understanding UBIFS internals.  Also this
may be not a bug in default distro setups as KERN_DEBUG messages are not
usually logged into world-readable log files.

Thanks,
