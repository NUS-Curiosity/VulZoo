Crash-only issues are always/typically worth a CVE when it can prevent a 
product from working in a security context.  Wireshark monitors network 
traffic, sometimes live; therefore, in some reasonable/common usage 
scenarios, attackers can cause a crash and prevent network activities from 
being detected.

We apply similar logic in forensics and other scenarios.  Therefore a CVE 
is needed for both wnpa-sec-2011-12 (crash reading live packets) as well 
as wnpa-sec-2011-14 (by only reading a packet trace file) - in the latter, 
analysis of a packet trace could be hampered/delayed because the 
investigator can't use the product without it crashing.

Wireshark does not get any more "preference" than any other tool, except 
indirectly because it gets more attention.
