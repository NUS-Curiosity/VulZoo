Subject: CVE Request --- phpMyAdmin -- Multiple XSS flaws in versions v3.4.0
 to v3.4.4 (PMASA-2011-14)

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   multiple XSS flaws have been recently reported in the v3.4.4
(and earlier 3.4.X) version of phpMyAdmin (PMASA-2011-14):

[1] http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-14.php

1) An XSS flaw was found in the way phpMyAdmin processed row content,
    containing JavaScript code, after its inline editing and saving,

2) It was found that phpMyAdmin did not properly sanitize the content
    of db, table, and column names prior use of their values.

A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks (execute
arbitrary HTML or web script) by tricking authenticated phpMyAdmin user 
into visiting of a specially-crafted URL.

Could you allocate a CVE id for these?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
