Thanks!  My current understanding is that both the NetBSD/FreeBSD gzip
and GNU gzip reuse mid-1980's code from compress, which was in the
public domain.  Those revisions thus could use different licenses (BSD
vs. GPL), and indeed the code is quite different by now.  (Also there's
a lot of code that is not from compress.)

Tomas, Tim - thank you for explaining the "maxbits < 12" check.  It
appears that we don't need it for GNU gzip, and NetBSD/FreeBSD gzip
could want to relax the check too.
