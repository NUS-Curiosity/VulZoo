See
http://status.net/2011/08/02/security-alert-for-all-versions-of-statusnet

"Incorrectly sanitized input from the URL for "tag stream" pages,
combined with incorrect encoding of dynamically-generated JavaScript,
allows an attacker to create a carefully-crafted URL that will execute
arbitrary JavaScript code on other users' browsers."
