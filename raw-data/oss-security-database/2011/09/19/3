Oops.  Thank you for this crucial correction.

That's weird naming, apparently based on inclusion of the Chrome web
browser only.

OK, I read up some more on Chrome OS and Chromium OS.

Per the Chromium OS FAQ:

http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromium-os-faq

it appears that Chrome OS is only available with a Chromebook purchase,
but those may be purchased from multiple OEMs.  I think this latter fact
qualifies Chrome OS for the closed list since it's similar to how
multiple hardware product vendors redistribute the distros of MontaVista
Software and Wind River, who we accepted (thereby setting a precedent).

"Multiple" is the keyword here.  (We might have difficulty making a
determination in case a distro is only used by a very low and fixed
number of hardware vendors, though - like just two.)

Also, Chromium OS is generally available, albeit not in a form suitable
for end-users (there's a public git repository, but no images ready to
boot/install).  Arguably, this makes Chromium OS eligible too, and I
guess the security team behind Chrome OS and Chromium OS is the same.

Any other comments?
