Subject: CVE Request? etherape remote crash (denial of service)

Hi,

The authors of Etherape, a network traffic overview tool, fixed a remote
denial of service (NULL ptr dereference) fixed in etherape 0.9.12.

http://etherape.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3309061&group_id=2712&atid=102712

This tool is in the same area as wireshark, so this probably needs a CVE.

Ciao, Marcus
