Subject: CVE request: is_a() function may allow arbitrary code execution in
 PHP 5.3.7/5.3.8

Could a CVE be assigned for this flaw?  PHP 5.3.7 changed how the is_a()
function worked, and as a result it could allow for remote arbitrary
code execution if certain specific conditions are met (the blog post
referenced below has a good writeup of the flaw).

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=741020

It looks like this is the fix:

Thanks.
