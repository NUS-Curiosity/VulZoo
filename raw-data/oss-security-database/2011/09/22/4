Subject: CVE Request -- drupal6-views_bulk_operations: XSS due improper escaping
 of a vocabulary help (SA-CONTRIB-2011-042)

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was found in the way Drupal Views Builk Operations (VBO) module
did not escape the vocabulary help properly, when the vocabulary has
had user tagging enabled and "Modify node taxonomy terms" action was
used for modification of the taxonomy. A remote attacker could provide
a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by unsuspecting Drupal
user, disposing with the 'administer taxonomy' permission / privilege,
could lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution (cross-site
scripting [XSS] attack).

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
