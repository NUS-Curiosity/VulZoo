Subject: CVE Request: Missing input sanitation in various X GLX calls

Hi,

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28823 
is a tracker bug for input sanitation lacking in various GLX X calls.

Reporter is me@...fdog.net

These can probably allow a attacker with access to the GLX calls
(typically just the logged in user) to crash the X server or execute
code within it.

(Not thought about WebGL introduced crash potential here.)

The lacking checks were reported and fixed in x.org git in 2010, so they
probably need a 2010 CVE id. (Single one should be sufficient I guess.)

Ciao, Marcus
