Subject: CVE request: kernel: oom: fix integer overflow of points in oom_badness

An integer overflow will happen on 64bit archs if task's sum of rss,
swapents and nr_ptes exceeds (2^31)/1000 value. This was introduced by
commit f755a04 oom: use pte pages in OOM score. This can cause a denial
of service.
