Subject: CVE request for Django-piston and Tastypie

"It was discovered that both Piston and Tastypie share a similar
vulnerability with respect to their de-serialization of YAML post
data. Both Piston and Tastypie used the yaml.load method, which is
unsafe. In certain circumstances this could be used to allow remote
execution of arbitrary code." [0]

Can a CVE be assigned to both Tastypie and Django-piston regarding
these issues ?
