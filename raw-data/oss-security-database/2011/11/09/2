Subject: CVE request: gnutls possible DoS (GNUTLS-SA-2011-2)

A potential DoS flaw was found in gnutls:

http://www.gnu.org/s/gnutls/security.html
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5596
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=752308

Fixes are available in git, and fixed in upstream 2.12.14 and 3.0.7
versions:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnutls.git;a=commitdiff;h=190cef6eed37d0e73a73c1e205eb31d45ab60a3c
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnutls.git;a=commitdiff;h=e82ef4545e9e98cbcb032f55d7c750b81e3a0450

It seems to me like the DoS is on the client side, from a malicious
server, and upstream also indicates it is unaware of any clients that
use the code improperly (as not documented) and would be vulnerable.

Could a CVE be assigned to this issue please?

Thanks.
