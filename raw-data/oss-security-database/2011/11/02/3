Subject: Re: CVE request for Calibre

Oh, and I suppose there's a very obvious but critical #6:

6. An unprivileged user an mount/unmount/eject whatever he wants, with
root permissions. Danger.

This may help to "confirm":
https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/885027/


As well, the maintainer has already issued a fix. From the bug report:
"Fixed in branch lp:calibre. The fix will be in the next release.
calibre is usually released every Friday.", which means the above
source link, that went to the trunk, now shows the fixed result. The
old broken code is still available here:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kovid/calibre/trunk/view/9675/src/calibre/devices/linux_mount_helper.c

Note that the maintainer has chosen only to address #5.
