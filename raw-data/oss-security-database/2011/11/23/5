Subject: CVE request: jenkins

XSS in jenkins[1]:

"Luca De Fulgentis discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
Jenkins that allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript into pages
generated by Jenkins. The attacker does not need a valid user account in
order to exploit this vulnerability."

This is part of the "winstone" servlet container that Jenkins runs in
when running in standalone mode.
