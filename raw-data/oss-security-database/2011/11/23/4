Subject: CVE request: ffmpeg before 0.7.8 and 0.8.7  2 buffer overflows and
 out-of-bounds read

New ffmpeg releases contain a couple of security fixes:
http://secunia.com/advisories/46888/

1) An error within the QDM2 decoder (libavcodec/qdm2.c) can be
exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

2) An integer overflow error within the "vp3_dequant()" function
(libavcodec/vp3.c) can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

3) Errors within the "av_image_fill_pointers()", the
"vp5_parse_coeff()", and the "vp6_parse_coeff()" functions can be
exploited to trigger out-of-bounds reads.


Please assign CVEs.


Maybe someone wants to have a look if other issues in those releases are
security relevant:
