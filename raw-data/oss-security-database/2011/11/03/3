Subject: CVE Request -- phpMyAdmin -- Arbitrary local file read flaw by loading
 XML strings / importing XML files

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors, phpMyAdmin Security Team,

   a local file inclusion flaw was found in the way XML import plug-in of
phpMyAdmin, a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration
of MySQL over the World Wide Web, performed import of malformed XML
files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file,
which once imported into the phpMyAdmin service instance would lead to
arbitrary local file (accessible with the privileges of the phpMyAdmin 
user) read / retrieval.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
