Subject: CVE Request -- yaws -- Directory traversal flaw

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a directory traversal flaw was found in the way yaws, web server
for dynamic content written in Erlang, processed certain URLs. A
remote, authenticated yaws user could use this flaw to obtain content
of arbitrary local file, available to the yaws server user via
specially-crafted URL request.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
