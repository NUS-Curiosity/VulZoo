Subject: linux-distros list setup update

Hi,

Not surprisingly, we started receiving spam to the linux-distros list.
PGP-encrypted spam is fun, yet I decided to introduce an anti-spam
measure, now documented on this new wiki page:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/linux-distros

"Be sure to include [vs] (four characters) in the Subject line, or your
message will most likely be rejected by the mail server."

Some kinds of messages should pass despite of lacking [vs] in the
Subject - for example, this should be the case for most PGP-encrypted or
PGP-signed messages - but to be safe, please use the [vs] thing even if
you encrypt and/or sign.  The rejected messages are rejected at SMTP
level, so senders should receive bounces from their own mail relays.

Alexander
