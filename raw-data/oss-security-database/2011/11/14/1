Subject: Re: Fwd: DSA 2338-1 moodle security update

Ok so for the sake of completeness the following is all Moodle Security
Advisories from 2011 so far. One has a CVE assigned (rather, it moodle
repackages phpMyAdmin which has a CVE assigned), several are security
hardening fixes (so no CVE) and several require admin access (so they
don't cross a security boundary, so no CVE). Notes are included.

I also found CVE-2011-3757, I'm unable to confirm this issue (I just get
a 500 internal server error) but
http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git;a=commitdiff;h=2c28fa7643b168006883a81a2421012d357a22d6
would indicate it's been fixed.

P.S. could someone from moodle maybe request CVE's when they assign a
security advisory (just forward a copy of the MSA to the OSS list would
do the trick), barrnig that if a community member could take it upon
themselves that would be nice (then CVE's can be assigned promptly).
