Subject: CVE id request: ffmpeg

Hello,
it seems the new ffmpeg issue described in 
http://www.usenix.org/events/woot11/tech/final_files/Yamaguchi.pdf has fallen 
through the cracks. Can someone assign a CVE id to the described issue in 
vmd_decode (see see page 6, Extrapolation. page 7 contains the vulnerable code)?

Please note that this is not CVE-2010-3429. The paper is about finding bugs 
similar to a given one and CVE-2010-3429 is the original bug, while the one in 
vmd_decode is similar.

Kind regards
Nico
