Subject: CVE request: drupal before 7.5 access bypass

http://drupal.org/node/1231510

If a Drupal site is using these features on comments, and the parent
node is denied access (either by a node access module or by being
unpublished), the file attached to the comment can still be downloaded
by non-privileged users if they know or guess its direct URL.
