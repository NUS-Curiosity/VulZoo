Subject: Re: non-Linux advance notification list

Sorry about the confusion. I work for the Gentoo security team, and I am
not sure whether it would be beneficial for me to be on the closed list
or not. It is my presumption that the release of non-Linux
vulnerabilities might better help us identify vulnerabilities across the
board. If you do not believe this is the case, please disregard my
request to be on the closed. I apologize for any extra work my request
caused you. I caught the middle of the thread, and may have missed
something along the way.

Sincerely,

Michael
