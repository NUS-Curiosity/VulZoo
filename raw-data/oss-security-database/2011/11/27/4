Subject: Re: non-Linux advance notification list

All -

OK, now this is starting to look about as ridiculous as the old "closed
list" thread did. ;-)  I am approving these messages so far in part
because I think they serve as (valid) criticism of the idea of such
lists, even if the senders did not intend such meaning.  I have mixed
feelings about these advance notification lists myself.

As I wrote to someone else the other day:

"What OS distribution are you a security contact for?  And how do we
verify that?"
