I think this needs three different CVE-identifiers. Here is a description from Secunia and the last item seems critical.

1) Input passed to the "from" parameter in index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

2) Input passed to the "page_no" parameter in recentchanges.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

3) Input passed to the "userfile" POST parameter in edit.php is not properly verified before being used to upload files. This can be exploited to e.g. upload arbitrary PHP files with e.g. a ".gif" extension.

Best regards,
