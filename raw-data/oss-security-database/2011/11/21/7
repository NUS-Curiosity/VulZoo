Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- gnash -- Unsafe management of HTTP cookies

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way Shockwave Flash plug-in of the
gnash, a GNU flash movie player, performed management of HTTP cookies
(they were stored under /tmp directory with predictable name and world-
readable permissions). A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain
sensitive information.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
