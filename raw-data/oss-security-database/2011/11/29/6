Subject: CVE request: mediawiki before 1.17.1

http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-November/000104.html

From announce mail:

-------------
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.17.1. Two security
issues were discovered.

Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be
redirected to Special:BadTitle.

For more details, see
https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32276

The second issue was found by Tim Starling, who discovered that
action=ajax requests were dispatched to the relevant function without
any read permission checks being done. This could have led to data
leakage on private wikis.

For more details, see
https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32616

------------------------

Please assign two CVEs.
