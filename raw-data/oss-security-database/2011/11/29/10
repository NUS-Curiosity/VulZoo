Hello Pat,

It would be a security flaw .... Patrick I only report here on the list
because I sent an email to 30 days and getting no return. It would be
a bug that
affected the slackware developers.

But if you want to play a scenario, okay. Simply just change the variable mount
point to a directory other than / mnt and try to run the default
installation of Slackware, so you have a broken installation.

Thank you for your attention.

Att,
