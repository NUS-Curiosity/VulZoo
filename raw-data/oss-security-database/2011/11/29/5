As Kurt said, you definitely need to provide more information.  I found
your posting cryptic and I was unsure about approving it for
distribution to the list (yet I did), because it could at best result in
a request for more info.  Security relevance of your finding is unclear
from what you posted.

Please clarify.

Thanks,

Alexander
