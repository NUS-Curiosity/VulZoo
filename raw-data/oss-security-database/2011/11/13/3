With apologies, I replied to the same message twice, the correct CVE
assignment should be:

CVE-2011-4131 kernel: nfs4_getfacl decoding kernel oops (correct for
this email)

The second one, CVE-2011-4132 is for kernel: jbd/jbd2: invalid value of
first log block leads to oops which is in a second email.
