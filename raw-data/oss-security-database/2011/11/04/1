Subject: CVE Request -- Drupal (v6.x based) Views module - SQL injection due
 improper escaping of database parameters for certain filters / arguments
 (SA-CONTRIB-2011-052)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a SQL injection flaw was found in the way the views module for the
Drupal (v6.x based), open-source content-management platform, performed
sanitization of the database parameters for certain filters / arguments
on certain types of views with specific configuration of arguments. A
remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted SQL query, which once
processed by the Drupal system instance could lead to arbitrary SQL
commands execution.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
