I'm not sure this is a security flaw. It's not running user controlled
scripts (at least not by default). In order for it to run a user controlled
script, the admin would have to modify the Default script. Is this normal?

I'm not all that familiar with expected use of gdm, perhaps someone who
knows more can chime in?

Thanks.
