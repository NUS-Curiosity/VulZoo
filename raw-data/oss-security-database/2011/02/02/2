Subject: CVE request: fuse

Hello,

A few more fixes have made their way to FUSE to prevent TOCTTOU symlink
attacks. An unprivileged user was able to unmount arbitrary mounts:

http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=cbd3a2a84068aae6e3fe32939d88470d712dbf47

Could we please get one or more CVE numbers for them?

Thanks,

Marc.
