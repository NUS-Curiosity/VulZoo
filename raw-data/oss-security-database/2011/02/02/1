Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like all versions of xpdf and
poppler <= 0.12.x should not be affected by this issue (since graphics
states are not tracked via stackheight in those versions).  Also,
according to redhat, poppler in rhel5 does not crash when tested with
your poc.  Would you be willing to share so we can test that?

Best wishes,
