Subject: Re: CVE Request for phpMyAdmin 3.4.x, 3.4.0 beta 2
 <= Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability


I'm not sure about this one.

My read of the situation is that the attack depends entirely on the 
successful exploitation of another issue that gives the attacker 
privileges to modify the database.  This would rarely be a vulnerability 
to me unless the problem was in some protection mechanism.

It seems likely that phpMyAdmin's "intended" security policy is that 
anybody with privileges to directly modify the DB (e.g. to create or 
rename the DB) is a "trusted" user who also has privileges to generate 
HTML/scripting code.  If that's the case, then this XSS is only available 
to a privileged user - even if it happens to be someone who got the 
privileges through some other attack.

Consequently, the XSS is "resultant" from some other vulnerability, and 
would not be worthy of a CVE itself.

If there's some specific vulnerability that gives someone the 
privileges to modify the DB when they shouldn't be able to, then a CVE 
could be assigned for that specific issue.

If there's more than one user with privileges to modify the DB, then one 
user could XSS the other, so I suppose that would get a CVE.

If I'm mis-understanding the advisory and the attacker (or the XSS victim) 
does not have privileges to modify DB names or create a DB, then it gets a 
CVE.

If phpMyAdmin's "intended" security policy is that the application should 
be safe from XSS injected into a compromised DB, then it gets a CVE.
