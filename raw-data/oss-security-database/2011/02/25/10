Does it fit into any current security model?  I mean that containers of
vanilla kernel are not fully restricted, neither sysfs or procfs differ
much in different namespaces.  If one may locate one sysfs file it may
locate all of them (chrooting into /sys is rather pointless :-D); with
sysfs one may change many hardware setting, they are driver-dependend,
but still very sensitive.  With /proc/sys/ one (inside of namespace
constainer) may change sysctl settings.  I suppose that it is not hard
to gain full root in such situation even without any bugs in sysfs file
read/write implementations (I didn't tried it, though).

UID 0 without capabilities has not been made really unprivileged yet.
It makes sense only within namespace container without any virtual
filesystem which handles permissions with uid/gid checks (not CAP_*).
But this is rather strange.
