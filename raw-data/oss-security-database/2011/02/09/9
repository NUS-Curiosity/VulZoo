Just over a year has passed since Issue 001 and 2010 was definitely a
great year for our humble magazine with over a 100,000 downloads of the
4 issues released which included 24 unique technical articles authored
or co-authored by over 30 security experts from around the world! Since
April 2010, readers have also had an opportunity to get familiar with
prominent figures from the IT security industry thanks to the new
"Interviews" section.

As always, feedback of any kind is greatly appreciated so don't hesitate
to drop us a line if you have any suggestions or comments on the issue.

Stay tuned for Issue 006 which will be released in May 2011 in
conjunction with our 2nd annual HITB Security Conference in Europe,
HITB2011 - Amsterdam!

See you there and in the meantime, enjoy the issue!
