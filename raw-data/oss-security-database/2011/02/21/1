Subject: clamav 0.97

A new clamav version is out and as usual, they don't mention if it's
security-relevant.

Though from the changelog
http://git.clamav.net/gitweb?p=clamav-devel.git;a=blob_plain;f=ChangeLog;hb=clamav-0.97

at least this sounds like security:
 * libclamav/vba_extract.c: fix error path double free (bb#2486)
