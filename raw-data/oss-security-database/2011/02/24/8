Correct. rt3 is community maintained in Fedora and RHEL. I am doing so 
for Fedora and other people do for RHEL.
So, strictly speaking it's not "Red Hat packaged", but 
community-contributed to "Red Hat owned products" (Fedora rsp. Fedora 
EPEL) and some folks @RH are filing CVS against it, for reasons I don't 
know.
