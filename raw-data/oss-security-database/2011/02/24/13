Subject: CVE Request -- logwatch: Privilege escalation due improper sanitization
 of special characters in log file names

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way logwatch, a log file
   analysis program, pre-processed log files, containing certain
   special characters in their names. A remote attacker could
   use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
   of the privileged system user (root) by creating a
   specially-crafted log file, subsequently analyzed by the
   logwatch script.

   Upstream bug report:
   [1] http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3184223&group_id=312875&atid=1316824
