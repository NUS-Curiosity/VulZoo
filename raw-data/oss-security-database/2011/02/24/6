Subject: XSSer v1.5 -beta- aka "Swarm Edition!" released.

Hi,

I am very happy to present a new version of *XSSer* (v1.5-beta-) - the
cross site scripter framework.

Take a look to the XSSer website to see new features implemented,
screenshoots, documentation, etc...

You can download new code directly from here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsser/files/xsser_1.5-1.tar.gz/download

There is one package pre-compiled for Ubuntu/Debian here:

And here, you have a video demostration:

"Remeber, now mosquitos... are swarm!"

Happy cross hacking.

psy.
