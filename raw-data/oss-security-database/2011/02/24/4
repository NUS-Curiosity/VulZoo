The advisory Timo posted mentioned ldm_frag_add() so it's public for all
practical purposes at this point:

static bool ldm_frag_add (const u8 *data, int size, struct list_head
*frags)
{
...
        f = kmalloc (sizeof (*f) + size*num, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!f) {
                ldm_crit ("Out of memory.");
                return false;
        }
...
        memcpy (f->data+rec*(size-VBLK_SIZE_HEAD)+VBLK_SIZE_HEAD, data,
size);
        return true;
}
