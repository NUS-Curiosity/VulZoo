Subject: CVE request: kernel: Corrupted LDM partition table issues

Reported by Timo Warns, "The kernel automatically evaluates partition 
tables of storage devices. The code for evaluating LDM partitions (in 
fs/partitions/ldm.c) contains a bug that causes a kernel oops on certain 
corrupted LDM partitions.  A kernel subsystem seems to crash, because, 
after the oops, the kernel no longer recognizes newly connected storage 
devices."

This should affect kernels version v2.6.27-rc1 and above. Of course, 
CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION needs to be set.

Thanks, Eugene
