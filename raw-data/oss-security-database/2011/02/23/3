Just some, not all, since not all the patches listed here affect Red Hat 
and I do not think I want to go through them again. Other vendors 
affected by these can provide their inputs.

I read some interesting discussions on LKML. These require debugfs to be 
mounted on a local system. It is usually not mounted by default, and you 
would not want to mount it on a production system unless you really have 
to use the kernel tracer, etc.
