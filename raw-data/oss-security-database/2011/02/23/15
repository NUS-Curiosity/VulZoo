This all sounds like a replay of the month of kernel bugs from back in 2006. I had 
this new tool that fuzzed file systems. (latest public release is here: 
http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/files/fsfuzzer-0.7.tar.gz) The discussion at the time 
went something like this...in order to exploit it, you have to have physical access. 
If you have physical access, why not put a live CD in and reboot the system? If DoS is 
what you are after, why not unplug the machine?

As far as I know, automounting is not a problem you have to worry about at run level 
which is most servers. Desktops are different. In run level5, you have the gnome-
volume-manager which may want to be overly helpful. If you are at your machine, you 
should be able to smack anyone hand trying to put something in your USB slot. So, the 
problem comes when you are away from your desk. I opened this bz in attempt to have 
that addressed:  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=215057  Not a lot in 
details, but supposed there is a new setting.

However, this doesn't help in the scenario where you have a kiosk or internet cafe and 
untrusted people walk up to machines. It was also pointed out at the time that perhaps 
iSCSI was another attack vector.

The handling _was_ good until sometime last summer. I found that I could kill just 
about any file system

I think there were others, but can't find them.

You should be able to turn it off. You can also block the loading of any kernel modules 
for file systems that you know you don't want to load. If you have a bug that alters 
function pointers or the kernel stack, you have a real vulnerability. I found a couple 
of those back in 2006. If it simply hits a BUG() or crashes in a way that is not 
exploitable, you have the same effect as having pulled the power cord. Yes, its a 
robustness error, but not a security error.

This feature was added a long time ago. (But how does anyone know all the things you 
can configure in a gnome desktop?)

MOKB 2006. Not to say that people shouldn't fuzz the file systems and fix all these 
things. I think I have fuzzing for all major file systems in the fsfuzzer if anyone 
wanted to go bug hunting. I recently added LVM support, but have not released this 
newer, more evil fuzzer.
