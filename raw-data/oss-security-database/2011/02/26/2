True, but I was just trying to show some examples. The case I'm most
concerned about is the case where modules_disable has been set. It
is possible to use acpi/custom_method to unset this and then load
kernel rootkit modules, etc.

I know it's a special case, but it still provides arbitrary kernel
memory writes which is not an intended ability for any user to
have, even root.
