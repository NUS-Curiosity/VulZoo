Sorry, misunderstood what you were getting at  :-)

Yes, agreed. It should be defined better, and as you pointed out apps
trying to filter or restrict things can be prone to mistakes. Which I
think exactly points out why this CVE is invalid; the lack of real
specification means that an application cannot successfully guess what
is valid, nor is it specified that an application should even try to
make such guesses. Given the current situation, OpenPAM is culpable
here, both for not checking the data it's receiving, and for having a
specification that makes it impossible for upstream apps to properly try
to help out.
