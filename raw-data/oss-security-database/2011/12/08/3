Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: send(m)msg: user pointer dereferences

Dereferencing a user pointer directly from kernel-space without going
through the copy_from_user family of functions is a bad idea. Two of
such usages can be found in the sendmsg code path called from
sendmmsg, added by upstream commit
c71d8ebe7a4496fb7231151cb70a6baa0cb56f9a. Usages are performed through
memcmp() and memcpy() directly. 

Upstream commit:
bc909d9ddbf7778371e36a651d6e4194b1cc7d4c
