I considered this a low impact vulnerability and therefore followed the
procedures for reporting to oss-security. Additionally, I looked for a
security contact at http://www.icecast.org/contact.php but could not
find one, so I sent to the list since it said this was a valid way to
submit bugs. If the issue were more severe, I would have followed a
different procedure. I apologize for the inconvenience.
