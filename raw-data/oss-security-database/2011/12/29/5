I've just unsubscribed Hui Zhu, who apparently is no longer with Wind
River - e-mail started bouncing, and the LinkedIn profile says "March
2008 - December 2011" (not "- Present"):

Zhenfeng(Jeffrey) Zhao is still subscribed, so Wind River is still
present on the linux-distros and distros lists.

BTW, this is a good example of how PGP with people's personal keys helps -
even if the e-mail address would be e.g. forwarded to a non-security
person at Wind River, that person would (hopefully) not have Hui's PGP key.

P.S. Indeed, I would have preferred to learn of this from a Wind River
person rather than from their mail server and own "investigation". ;-)
