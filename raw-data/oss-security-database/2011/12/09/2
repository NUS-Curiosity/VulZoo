Subject: CVE Request: icu out of bounds access

Hi,

An of bounds access was reported in icu:
http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8984

Unfortunately the chrome bug is private but the commit says "buffer
overflow":
http://codereview.chromium.org/8822005/patch/6001/7002

I suppose a negative len could end up in the strncpy at the end of the
function causing a buffer overflow.

cu
Ludwig
