Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: tight loop and no preemption can cause system
 stall

A tight loop in user level process isn't preempted unless a realtime
process is woken up on the cpu.  Some important kernel threads such as
events/*, kblockd/* can be blocked by the process, and the machine
stalls.

Unprivileged local user could use this flaw to DoS the system.
