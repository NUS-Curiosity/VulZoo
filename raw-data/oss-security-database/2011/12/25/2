Subject: CVE Request for Apache ActiveMQ DoS

A flaw in Apache ActiveMQ before 5.6.0 could allow a remote unauthenticated
attacker to abuse the 'failover' feature, allowing them to trigger a denial of
service against the broker service.  An attacker can issue multiple ActiveMQ
openwire connection requests using the string 'failover:tcp://[IP]:61616', and
due to the 'failure' mechanism, all TCP connections remain active even if a
valid session is not created.  After a few thousand requests, a
'java.net.SocketException: Too many open files' exception is triggered, leading
to a freeze or crash of the broker (and possibly connected systems as well).
