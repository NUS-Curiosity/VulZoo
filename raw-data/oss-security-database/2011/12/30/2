Subject: CVE-request: Elxis CMS two XSS-vulnerabilities

1) Input passed to the "task" parameter in index.php (when "option" is set to "com_content") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

2) Input passed via the URL to administrator/index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Fixed in same version "2009.3 Aphrodite rev2684" so one CVE-identifier might be enough.
