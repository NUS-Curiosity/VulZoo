We do not have a strict policy on whether security tool announcements
are appropriate in here or not.  My current stance on it is that
one-time announcements of tools with specific relevance to Open Source
are OK, whereas repeated new version announcements are not.  Thus, I
approved the announcement of XSSer this one time, but I don't intend to
approve an announcement of the next version of XSSer.  Please let me
know if you'd like this approach changed in some way.

Meanwhile, the various CFPs and e-magazine issue announcements that are
arriving to oss-security are being rejected - as we decided previously.
