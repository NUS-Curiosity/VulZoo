Vulnerability description
===========================
The openssl-dev mailing list thread

http://marc.info/?t=119271238800004

describes a bug affecting 32-bit builds of OpenSSL 0.9.8g. In extremely 
rare instances, it causes incorrect computation of finite field operations 
when using NIST elliptic curves P-256 or P-384.

Exploiting said bug, we designed and implemented an attack that recovers a 
TLS server's private key. As far as we are aware, this is the first public 
exploitation of the bug.

The bug is fixed in OpenSSL >= 0.9.8h and a series of patches is available 
to resolve it for version 0.9.8g starting from check in version 1.15 at

http://cvs.openssl.org/rlog?f=openssl%2Fcrypto%2Fbn%2Fbn_nist.c

As a more generic countermeasure to these types of attacks, we implemented 
coordinate blinding as a patch to the OpenSSL source, available on the 
openssl-dev mailing list at

http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=131194808413635

Vulnerability prerequisites
===========================
REQUIRED:

- OpenSSL 0.9.8g (32-bit build)

One or more of:
- Use of curve P-256
- Use of curve P-384

One or more of:
- Use of ECDH family ciphers
- Use of ECDHE family ciphers *and* lack of SSL_OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE context 
option

Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic ships with OpenSSL 0.9.8g and we verified the attack 
against it.
Debian 5.0 Lenny ships with OpenSSL 0.9.8g and, although we did not verify 
the attack, the code suggests it is vulnerable.
We verified the attack against stunnel 4.43 (linked against OpenSSL 
0.9.8g) configured to use an ECDH cipher and P-256.
Our methods do not seem to be effective for attacking OpenSSH: their 
implementation strictly uses ephemeral ECDH keys.



Vulnerability impact
===========================
The attack allows recovery of a TLS server's private key.
For ECDH family ciphers, this is the long term private key of the public 
key in a certificate.
For ECDHE family ciphers, this is the private key of the per application 
instance's ECDH ephemeral-static public key.
The attack is remote and in that sense only requires observing the result 
(success or failure) of repeated attacker-initiated TLS handshakes.
