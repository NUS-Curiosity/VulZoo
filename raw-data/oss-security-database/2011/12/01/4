Subject: CVE-request: Serendipity 'serendipity[filter][bp.ALT]' Cross-Site
 Scripting vulnerability

Original post: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2011/Nov/15
Advisory URL: http://www.rul3z.de/advisories/SSCHADV2011-015.txt
New version announcement: http://blog.s9y.org/archives/233-Serendipity-1.6-released.html

I contacted Garvin Hicking and he said this is indeed fixed in 1.6 code, but they changed from SVN to Git so can't really refer to proper commit. Secunia is linking in http://secunia.com/advisories/46666/ to https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/commit/1f037b462761cd592b90541ce4dfda2518ad4711, which has nothing to do with the actual issue. Shame on Secunia.

This is one of logs, which can act like proof: https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/commit/db590df6087969e5ef3b07b1b7040e7ec122a4fd

Please notify me if this is not enough information.
