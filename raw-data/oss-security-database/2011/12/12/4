Subject: CVE request: putty does not wipe keyboard-interactive replies from
 memory after authentication

Putty 0.59-0.61 does not wipe keyboard-interactive replies from memory
after authentication.  If malware is installed on the system and can
access arbitrary memory locations, or if the memory is swapped to disk
or written in a crash dump file, it can expose sensitive authentication
information like passwords, public-key passphrases, etc.

This is fixed upstream in 0.62.

Could a CVE be assigned to this?
