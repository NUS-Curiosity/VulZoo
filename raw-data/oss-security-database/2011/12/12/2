Subject: CVE request: rocksndiamonds world-writable working/config directory

rocksndiamonds creates its ~/.rocksndiamonds/ directory as
world-writable.  This could allow a local attacker to replace a cache
file with a symbolic link to a file they would not otherwise have access
to, and the next time the victim loaded the game, it would be
overwritten.

Could a CVE be assigned to this please?
