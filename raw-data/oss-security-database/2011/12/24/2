 injection

Is it possible to get CVE assigned for very old Joomla-issue?

http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/26626
http://secunia.com/advisories/20746/

I can see from honeypot-logs that they are still using this vulnerability. I did not yet find Joomla-references for this. If this is too old vulnerability for CVE or wrong reason please notify me.
