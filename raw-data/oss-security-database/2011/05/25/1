Subject: CVE Request: Post Revolution multiple security vulnerabilities

 Hi,  I need a CVE for Post Revolution 0.8c multiple security
vulnerabilities. (Post Revolution is a CMS similar to Wordpress
released under GPLv2)

The vulnerabilities are:
1. A Denial of service vulnerability.
2. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
3. Cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities.

Vendor has publicly confirmed the existence of the vulnerabilities:

I will wait for vendor to fully patch these issues before
full-disclosure (probably by Friday)
