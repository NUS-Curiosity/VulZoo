Subject: CVE request : client-side file creation via XSLT in Webkit


The bug was opened on January 18 :
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52688 (restricted)

A patch is available since February 20 :
http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/79159 (public)

Given some recent mail exchanges with Apple, they still not have
affected a CVE to this issue. Could you please allocate one, in order
for me to have an easier job communicating with the numerous impacted
vendors (many Linux distributions, RIM, Maxthon, ...) ?

Regards,
Nicolas Grégoire
