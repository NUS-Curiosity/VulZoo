There is a problem: in upstream glibc, __libc_enable_secure is placed into
GLIBC_PRIVATE section, thus making it unavailable in most of rpm-based
distros.  This is surely not the case in Owl and ALT Linux, where
__libc_enable_secure is legal interface for use in applications,
and some essential libraries are already patched to use
__libc_enable_secure instead of uid comparisons.
