Subject: CVE request: firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading HTTPS page

Hi,
found this in RH's bugzilla: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=709165

A Debian bug report [1] indicated that Firefox 4.0.x handled the
validation/revalidation of SSL certificates improperly.  If a user were to
visit a site with an untrusted certificate, Firefox would correctly display the
warning about the untrusted connection.  If a user were to confirm the security
exception for a single session (not check off the "permanently store this
exception"), then restart the browser and re-load the page, the contents of the
page would be displayed from the Firefox cache.  Upon reloading the page, the
security warning would appear, but incorrectly indicates that the site provides
a valid, verified certificate and there is no way to confirm the exception.
