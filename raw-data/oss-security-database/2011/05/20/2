Subject: systemtap divide-by-zero issues (CVE-2011-1769, CVE-2011-1781)

Hi!

Two divide-by-zero flaws were recently discovered and fixed in
systemtap:

http://sourceware.org/git/?p=systemtap.git;a=commit;h=fa2e3415185a28542d419a641ecd6cddd52e3cd9

These issues can be use to crash the system.  The decision was to
handle these issues as security because of the unprivileged systemtap
mode, where stap author is not to be considered a root-equivalent.  In
normal mode, unprivileged user can only trigger this if she's able to
trick some privileged user to instrument specially crafted ELF file.

More details on the CVE allocation is in:
