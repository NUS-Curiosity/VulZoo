Subject: CVE request -- virt-v2v: vnc password protection is missing after
	vm conversion

Hello Steve, vendors.

Description:
It was found that after virtual machine conversion using virt-v2v the
target VM does not have VNC password enabled even though the source VM does.
An attacker able to connect to the target VM can possibly use this flaw to
operate the VM with privileges of the logged in user.

Thanks you,
