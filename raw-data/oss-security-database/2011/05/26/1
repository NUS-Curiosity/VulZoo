Subject: CVE Request -- syslog-ng -- Possible DoS

Hi All,

In syslog-ng if a recent enough libpcre is installed (ie. 8.12 or newer)
there is a possible Denial of Service.

In our (BalaBit) opinion tis is not a big security issue, because if you
use the vulnerable setting you will run into the DoS for sure without
any malicious attack.

The attack vector is that the attacker send a message which the regexp
not match. 

But because of this bug get this amount of attention, it' may worth the
CVE id.
