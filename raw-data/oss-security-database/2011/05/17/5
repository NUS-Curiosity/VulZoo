Indeed, for example if you use the engine, one can specify which
directory should be used for drivers...

I uploaded a openssl-1.0.0d patch to

http://suse.de/~krahmer/libs-vs-fscaps

[modulo synchronization time]
I will upload patches for other libs as soon as I wrote them.
Included is support for __libc_enable_secure (which might be also
not available on systems without glibc, or more particular
without glibc rtld such as systems using bionic) but it needs
to be enabled by hand inside the Makefile (as I dont know
of an easy check to detect that). The "static" nature on most
dists has already been mentioned.

The prefered way is to check the dumpable flag via prctl() which
is detected by the config script. Additionally, euid and egid is
always checked unless enable_secure or dumpable flag already
detects secure-mode.
I hope I didnt miss a getenv() (some are in testcases) and got
the logic wrong. :p
