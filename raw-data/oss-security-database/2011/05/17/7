The Debian bug is really light on details, so here is the git commit
that fixes this:

http://nbd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=nbd/nbd;a=commitdiff;h=ebbbe0b3ce5393fa42a259f5e03d549508586aaa

But I don't see any evidence that this _only_ affects 2.9.21.  Are we
sure that it doesn't affect earlier versions?  The reporter doesn't
indicate one way or the other.

CC'ing Wouter for clarification.
