Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: validate size of EFI GUID
 partition entries

Hi,

from my point of view, these are different bugs:

CVE-2011-1577 addresses the overall header size used for a CRC32
computation.

CVE-2011-1776 addresses the size of partition entries used for
allocating a data structure.

Of course, one could argue that this is only one issue "missing input
validation on GUID partition tables".

Cheers, Timo
