Yes, Red Hat advisories say that, but in practice the .src.rpm's are
freely downloadable.  Here's one mentioned in the advisory above:

lftp ftp.redhat.com:/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/6Server/en/os/SRPMS> ls -l kernel-2.6.32-71.24.1.el6.src.rpm
-rw-r--r--    5 ftp      ftp      67060785 Apr 07 02:51 kernel-2.6.32-71.24.1.el6.src.rpm

Yes, it's weird.

For binary updates, yes.  For sources, no (although the wording in the
advisories is such that you get that impression).
