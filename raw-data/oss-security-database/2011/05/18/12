Subject: CVE request: Several Moodle issues

Hi Steve,
(since I assume Josh will pass this on to you :-) )

http://www.moodle.org/security/ lists more than a dozen
vulnerabilities requiring a CVE assignment:
MSA-11-0002 to MSA-11-0017 require CVE assignments.

(Some issues might be amalgamated to a single CVE)

Cheers,
        Moritz
