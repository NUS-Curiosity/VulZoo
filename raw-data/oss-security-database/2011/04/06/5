Probably worth pointing out, since I didn't see it mentioned
elsewhere, that these distinctions are not so cut-and-dried as that.
Debian, for example, is not only a GNU/Linux distribution but also a
GNU/BSD distribution:

http://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/

(...and a GNU/Hurd distribution, though perpetually short of release
status, and it's not like there are likely enough of those to
warrant a separate ML of this nature anyway.)
