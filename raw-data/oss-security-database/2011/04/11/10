My initial thought is that a vendor without public advisories is a
liability.

I don't want to get into the politics of not publishing your advisories,
but at the same time, public information such as this is all we have to
measure if a vendor is using the information at hand.

I'm happy to draw a line in the sand and make public advisories a mandatory
requirement. If anyone disagrees, please speak up. This is my personal
opinion, other viewpoints are welcome.

Thanks.
