Josh, I think in your quest to make things less vague, you may have
actually made them more vague.

"security updates" and "public advisories" aren't the same thing,
That's not just a semantic distinction.  There's many s vendors who
release security updates, but not necessarily public advisories on
them.  They may have constituencies that would simply get confused 
by advisories, or they have auto-update mechanisms, or part of their
support model involves pushing their customers to keep up with all
fixes, security or otherwise.  They may simply thing that advisories
are a waste of time because customers don't read.  

For linux-distros, I think what you really want to go for here are
*timely* updates.  If a distro isn't generally capable of producing a
security update within, say, a month of when the issue was released,
then their getting the issue in advance through linux-distros isn't
going to do them or their distro community a lot of good because they
have other constraints in getting fixes out the door.  Focusing on how
you think an update ought to *look* (e.g. should the advisories be
public?) isn't as important as the update getting *out*.  Especially
since you're dealing with GPL'ed code, I think that's something you
can measure.  Just ask the constituency a month or so after some major
kernel issue who has released updates/fixes and who hasn't, show the
relevant source, and take it from there.

Take it for what it's worth...
-Mike
