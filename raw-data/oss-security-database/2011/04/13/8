Hi Armin,

Sorry for putting my $0.02 in the bucket here as well, but the whole
purpose of a closed list is that you can fix them before releasing a
public advisory. When you fixed it, the customers can (just like other
dist's do, just get it patched before you publish it. It's not that this
is so strange, as closed source OS makers are doing the same (remember
Black Tuesday's at MS and Apple's releases).

Just my 2 cents.
