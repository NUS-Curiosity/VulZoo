I don't want to start arguing technicalities, semantics, or politics. Here
is my current view, I'm going to leave the final decision up to Solar
Designer, I view this as Openwall's list.

We have rejected certain membership requests because they are not currently
releasing security updates. I agree with this policy, I would say my
initial mail was too vague. This instance is no different. It's clear that
one of the membership requirements is now producing security updates.  If
you can show you're doing this, that's grounds for membership in my
opinion.

Thanks.
