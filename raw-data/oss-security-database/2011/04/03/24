I've subscribed you with this key for now, but you really ought to
upgrade to a larger key, and I'd appreciate a statement on what Linux
distro you represent on the new list.

All: my decision is based on some info known to me, but I'd prefer to
base it on Mike's posting to oss-security.  I am saying this to explain
that there's a reason why I subscribed Mike, whereas I would not
subscribe another "random" person posting the same kind of message from
a personal address. ;-)
