Thanks for the key, but as far as I am aware you do not currently
qualify for the Linux distros list (even though you did some security
work on Owl, thanks), nor were you on vendor-sec (Josh's suggested
requirement for the seed membership of the new list).  You might qualify
for a separate security researchers list if/once we set one up (or for a
combined distros+researchers list, but I doubt that we'd set one up).
