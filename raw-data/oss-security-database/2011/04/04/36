FWIW, I found Tomas' posting appropriate and his question desirable,
which is confirmed by your helpful response (starting with the second
paragraph).  If not Tomas, others would (hopefully) have the same
question, which was reasonable and it needed to be addressed in here.

So I'd like to thank both of you.  I only wish this did not result in
that tone of Russ' response, but we can live with that.
