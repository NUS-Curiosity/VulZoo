I'm actually not arguing in opposition to participant transparency.  In
fact I am 100% supportive of that.  Instead, I'm simply stating
that there is an increased threat to those participating (due to the
value attackers will find in being able to decrypt your private
traffic).

I was hoping to spur a discussion on some common practices to mitigate
this bigger threat (perhaps starting with a requirement to use pgp/gpg
smart cards so that an account compromise only leads to a passphrase
compromise rather than a key+passphrase compromise).

Best wishes,
Mike
