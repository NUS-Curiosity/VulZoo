I'm not trolling.

I think your argument for this mailing list is that vulnerabilities need to
be fixed before they're released to the greater public. While I can
understand that, it seems ridiculous to parade yourselves around in public
with a signup system that is akin to


>>Huh?  Now you're with "the other" group that accuses "us" of "hiding"?

Can I not be part of the group that thinks a public signup system for a
mailing list that previously had the mail server owned due to the fact it
was secret (showing interest in possibly owning users now that emails like
mjo@...o.mi.org have been confirmed on the list) for a mailing list that is
'embargoed' when really it shouldn't be.

>>What is your opinion on making the list's archive public with a delay(when
the corresponding security issues are already public)?

It would be better. In my opinion, delay would be 1-2 days. Vendor-sec
(alternatives) should be a last resort in publishing issues, other projects
don't get the same "privileges", and have to "make do" with oss-sec. If you
really need such help 'co-ordinating' and fixing things, maybe you should
have a policy to, release advisory/info first, then have a 'co-ordination'
list.

Yes Dan, but now we have private email accounts as well (by people who
apparently don't like to use vendor email addresses) that are also signed up
to this, allowing targeting and easy identification of probably less secure
infrastructure.


Excuse my "trolling" if some of this has already been covered, I'm up early
(for me) and thus can be slightly unintelligible.
