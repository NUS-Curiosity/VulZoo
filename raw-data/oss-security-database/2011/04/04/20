I was thinking that only a subset of issues discussed on the list will
be relevant to a given distro, and only a subset of those will need to
be communicated to the distro's entire security team right away.  Maybe
this is not true for large distros, which package almost all software
that Linux distros package at all.

Please suggest a specific e-mail address and key combination.  And if
you suggest other than your @debian.org address, please suggest a way to
verify that the address is really "yours" (the Debian security person's).

Thanks,
