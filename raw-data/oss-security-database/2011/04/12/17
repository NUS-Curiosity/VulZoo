Subject: CVE Request: kernel: fs/partitions: Corrupted GUID partition tables
 can cause kernel oops

The Linux kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage
devices. The code for evaluating EFI GUID partitions (in
fs/partitions/efi.c) contains a bug that causes a kernel oops on certain
corrupted GUID partition tables.

A patch is available at
http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg83274.html

Cheers, Timo
