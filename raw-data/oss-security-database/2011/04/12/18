Josh,

Your initial e-mail indicated we would be part of this new group since
we where a vendor-sec member. Now there are new requirements we have to
meet. Is there a possibility of a probationary period so we can try to
comply to these new requirements and still be on the closed list?

Mahalo,
Armin
