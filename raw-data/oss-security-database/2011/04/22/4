Hello Matthew,

   thank you for the heads up.

Was this request intended to be for the following one:
[1] http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-006.html ?

Note: Because http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-005.html
       already got an id of CVE-2011-1507.

If the request was meant for [1] is it still valid? (i.e. still a CVE id needs
to be assigned to this?)

Or was it requested for yet something completely different from above two?

Thank you, Regards, Jan.
