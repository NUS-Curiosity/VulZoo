This raises an interesting point, "downstream providers of third-party
software".

In my case, I'd understand that I might want to offer vendors the
possibility to co-ordinate upgrades for bogofilter, fetchmail, and
leafnode, in lexicographical order, and possibly for a FreeBSD port --
although I'm not a representative of FreeBSD's security officer team
(nor would that team usually deal with third-party software
vulnerabilities unless it's in the basde system).

Questions:

#1 would the new private list be allowed to Cc: outside members (for
instance, FreeBSD's unencrypted internal developers@ list does not allow
that)?  Who would make sure that no end user agent allows an unencrypted
Cc: slip?  A major concern IMO.

#2 will the subscriber list be public for subscribers that are later
joining according to a policy that the new subscribers will have voted
on in the secret list?

#3 will the list rules themselves be open to non-members?

Best regards
Matthias Andree
