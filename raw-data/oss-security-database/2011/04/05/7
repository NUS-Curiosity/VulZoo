Fixing issues secretly is definitely a no-go in my book. It will and clearly
has, created hostility between different developer groups and those that are
allowed in and those that aren't.

So.... if this list isnt for high-severity issues what is the point of it?
Why not use OSS-Sec. I thought the only way this el8 mailing list was even
justified was the fact that the vulnerabilities were mission-critical and
the POCs for these vulnerabilities would potentially lead to throwing us
back into the ice-ages.

So why are you using a last resort for 'medium-severity issues'?
Currently, from what you've said, it seems like you're trying to, as some
people apparently correctly feared, an elite mailing list where you can all
boost your egos and, excuse the term for lack of a better one, 'circlejerk'.

Well pfft, if someone already has it we may aswell just give everything
away!

Question; now that vendor-sec has been compromised, I suppose we can expect
a full public archive of all the emails?
