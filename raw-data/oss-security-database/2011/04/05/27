Damn, my corporatish evilness unveiled after all... ;)

The request was meant to be in the same spirit as Alexander's questions
to rPath or Frugalware folks to see if the membership provides the
expected benefits, and seemed natural given the specific development
mode used by CentOS.  You're free to view it however you want, of
course.

I certainly do not follow.  I did check extras and centosplus though
and referred to them as those components that are not rebuilds.  Not
many components there seemed to be an obvious candidates that can
benefit from v-s info, imo.
