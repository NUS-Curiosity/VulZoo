Looks like there are a few issues here:


2011-01-16  19:31  Reuben Thomas <rrt at sc3d.org>
     * Fix two potential buffer overruns in apprentice_list.

https://github.com/glensc/file/commit/148f1089b5c4f5ec5d51c2f147379817cb9ac47d


2010-09-20  15:24  Reuben Thomas <rrt at sc3d.org>
     * Minor security fix to softmagic.c (don't use untrusted
       string as printf format).

https://github.com/glensc/file/commit/b05926f28f3cab0ef77101f89be154329dcb8dea


I have not looked at them in more depth to see how much of a problem they are,
or when they were introduced (in order to know which versions are affected),
etc.

I'm cc'ing Christos to see if he can perhaps enlighten us.
