This is an order of evaluation issue, that could read memory over the allocated
limit. The limit check is done after the read instead of before. The code
has not been present in any release.

The code is present in [5.00-5.04]. It should not be an issue because the desc
printf formats are checked during parsing. It is mostly to silence a compiler
warning for printf(ms->desc) -> printf("%s", ms->desc). The code does
printf(ms->desc, argument) in a ton of other places.
