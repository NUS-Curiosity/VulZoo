Subject: CVE Request -- OpenVAS Manager v2.0.3


Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   based on:
   [1] http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-announce/2011-April/000120.html

This release fixes a severe security issue discovered after the release
of openvas-manager 2.0.2. By crafting a special report format plugin,
and knowing about the operating system on which OpenVAS Manager is
running, a rogue user was able to upload the plugin and execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the OpenVAS
Manager.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
