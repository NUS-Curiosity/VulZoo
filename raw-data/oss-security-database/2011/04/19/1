Subject: CVE request -- kernel: proc: signedness issue in next_pidmap()

"A signedness issue has been found in next_pidmap() function when the "last"
parameter is negative as next_pidmap() just quietly accepted whatever
"last" pid that was passed in, which is not all that safe when one of the
users is /proc.

Setting f_pos to negative value when accessing /proc via readdir()/getdents()
resulted in sign extension of this value when map pointer was being
constructed.

This later lead to #GP because the final pointer was not canonical (x86_64)."
