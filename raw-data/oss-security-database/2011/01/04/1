Subject: CVE request: AusweisApp

The "AusweisApp" is an official government application for the electronic ID
in germany.

The original version contained a vulnerability in the update function. It
didn't verify the host of the https connection and allowed to install
malicious files through a directory traversal vuln in the used unzip
routine.
I'm not sure if this makes one or two CVEs, as there are two "vulns" that
can only be used together to do malicious things.

Also, the versioning is a bit broken, the article claims that the version
was both 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 depending on the source, but the new "fixed" version
is also called 1.0:
