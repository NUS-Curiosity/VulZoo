Subject: Re: CVE Request for phpMyAdmin 3.4.x, 3.4.0 beta 2
 <= Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

Steve,

Can MITRE comment on this? The advisory suggests that in order to exploit
this, you already have to have access to the user's account in some way.
I'm not sure what the precedent is for such a situation.

Thanks.

> 
> 
> 1. OVERVIEW
> 
> The phpMyAdmin web application 3.4.0 beta 2 and lower versions of
> 3.4.x were vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.
> 
> 
> 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
> 
> phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP intended to handle
> the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web.
> phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations with MySQL.
> The most frequently used operations are supported by the user
> interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations,
> indexes, users, permissions, etc), while you still have the ability to
> directly execute any SQL statement.
> 
> 
> 3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
> 
> The 'db' parameter in phpMyAdmin was not sanitized and an attacker can
> inject XSS string in 'db' field when creating or renaming a database.
> An attacker can create new database name or rename database name
> through several means like SQL Injection in user's vulnerable web
> applications or
> compromise of user account through brute-force or bypassing CSRF
> protection.
> Even though the phpMyAdmin uses httpOnly as a protection against
> cookie theft via XSS, attacker could use XSS tunneling proxy to
> manipulate database names and fields. From it, he could execute
> arbitrary database commands to allow him higher access to the server.
> 
> 
> 4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
> 
> phpMyAdmin 3.4.0 beta 2 and lower versions of 3.4.x
> 
> Vendor confirmed this flaw did not exist before the 3.4 version
> family.
> Thus, it is assumed 2.x and 3.3 <= versions are not affected.

> 6. IMPACT
> 
> Attackers can compromise currently logged-in user session, plant xss
> backdoors and inject arbitrary SQL statements
> (CREATE,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE)
> via crafted XSS payloads.

> 
> 7. SOLUTION
