We're still missing CVE assignments for several issues from 2009.
These have been requested on oss-security before, but couldn't be 
processed by Josh/Red Hat, since RH doesn't have 2009 IDs. As such, 
they need to be handled by MITRE:

1. Overkill (this should be a CVE-2009 ID)
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=549310

2. Emacs mode for reStructuredText (from DocUtils) (this should be a CVE-2009 ID)
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560755

3. FireGPG (this should be a CVE-2008 ID)
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=514386
http://securityvulns.com/Udocument757.html

4. Burn (Homepage: http://www.bigpaul.org/burn/) (That's a CVE-2009 ID)
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=542329

5. pdfroff (from GNU groff) (That's a CVE-2009 ID)
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538330
http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/groff/groff-1.20.1-owl-tmp.diff

6. Jetty (That's a CVE-2009 ID)
http://www.ush.it/team/ush/hack-jetty6x7x/jetty-adv.txt

7. Konversation (That's a CVE-2009 ID)
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219985
