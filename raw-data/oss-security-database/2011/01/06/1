Subject: CVE Request: Multiple XSS Vulnerabiliies < Piwik 1.1

Piwik 1.1 released on Jan 4, 2011, addresses numerous security issues
following a security audit by SektionEins (led by Stefan Esser), an internal
review, and coordinated disclosures from JarosÅ‚aw Sajko (Pentesters.pl) and
Fabian Becker.

Notably, versions of Piwik prior to 1.1 contain multiple persistent and
reflective XSS vulnerabilities through unescaped parameters and/or output.
