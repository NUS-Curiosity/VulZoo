Subject: CVE request: heap corruption in libpango

>From Launchpad [1]:

"When used with FreeType2 as a backend, Pango is vulnerable to heap
corruption when rendering malformed fonts. The vulnerability occurs in
pango_ft2_font_render_box_glyph() in pango/pangoft2-render.c. A buffer
is malloc'd with size box->bitmap.rows * box->bitmap.pitch.
Subsequently, 0xff is written at offsets into this buffer without
checking that these offsets fall within the buffer's boundaries,
leading to heap corruption."
