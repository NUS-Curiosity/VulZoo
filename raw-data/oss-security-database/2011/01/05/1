Subject: CVE-2010-4525 kvm: x86: zero kvm_vcpu_events->interrupt.pad infoleak

In addition to CVE-2010-3881, some versions of the Linux kernel forgot 
to initialize the kvm_vcpu_events.interrupt.pad field before being 
copied to userspace. I have assigned CVE-2010-4525 to this. I briefly 
checked, linux-2.6.33/34.y are affected, linux-2.6/.31/.32.y are not.

Thanks, Eugene
