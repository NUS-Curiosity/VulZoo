Now having announced that, I was notified that while I have permission
to upload in the "CGI" name space, there are several other parts of the
distribution which I don't have permission to upload to, so the release
many not become "official" and be downloadable by the "cpan" client
until this is resolved.

I will work with Lincoln Stein on making this release official so that
the bits available at the link above will eventually be deemed official
as the 3.51 release.

If for some reason the release needs to be changed, I will be sure to
move the version number further forward so there is no confusion.

Details about the permission issue are below (of possible interest to
those who are also CPAN authors)
