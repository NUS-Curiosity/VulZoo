OK, let's split the CVE id then.

So for 
A, "* prevent crash in mod_dav_svn when using SVNParentPath (r1033166)"
  Upstream changeset:
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1033166

Let's use CVE-2010-4539.

For 
B, * fix server-side memory leaks triggered by 'blame -g' (r1032808)
  References:
  http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-11/0102.shtml
  Upstream changeset:
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1032808

Let's use CVE-2010-4644.
