Subject: CVE request: MaraDNS DoS via long queries

Hi,

A crash bug has been reported against MaraDNS 1.4.03 when long queries are 
sent to the resolver. Details can be found at:
http://bugs.debian.org/610834

As of the time of writing, the reporter is testing other versions and at least 
1.4.05 also seems to be affected.

Josh, Steven: could a CVE id be assigned? Thanks in advance.

Regards,
