Subject: CVE request: libxml2 heap contents leak

Hello,

I'd like to get a CVE assigned for a minor heap contents leak in
libxml2. I reported that it is possible to leak heap memory contents
from libxml2 (and things linked against it, for example PHP[1], or things
written in PHP[2]):

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631551

Thanks,

-Kees
