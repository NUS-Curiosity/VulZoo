Minor correction: CAP_SYSLOG is needed to read the kernel ring buffer,
with CAP_SYS_ADMIN being a fallback for legacy reasons.  But it's
correct that CAP_SYS_ADMIN is now required to modify the sysctl.

I also agree with Vasiliy's point that LXC security boundaries in the
mainline kernel are not well defined at this point, so the whole thing
is a bit silly.
