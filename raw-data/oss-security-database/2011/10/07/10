Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Multiple security issues in various versions of AWStats

Hi Jan!

You asked about 6 CVE for holes, but there are 7 holes (with two variations 
for holes #2 and #3), which I disclosed (but it's possible to make one CVE 
entry for #4 with two XSS holes). Here is few moments concerning your asking 
about CVE.

1. The holes #1 and #2 was already disclosed earlier, as I stated in my
advisory. I just remind about them for fullness of my advisory and to show
differences between versions of AWStats (that protecting parameter key was
added in version 1.2) and that this parameter can be bypassed. As I show in
examples for holes #2, #3, #5 and #6.

2. As I stated in my advisory, as I tested, for hole #1 (XSS) was vulnerable
version 1.1 build 1.6, but was not vulnerable 1.1 build 1.5 (which shipped
with AWStats 6.0 - from this version I've started using AWStats in 2004).

3. There are CVE entries already for #2 (and should be for #1, but I don't
know about such CVE and I've not found it in CVE database).

Open redirect vulnerability
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-5020

But as I showed in my advisory in case of #2, this fix can be bypassed, so
there can be made update for this CVE entry or made new entry.
