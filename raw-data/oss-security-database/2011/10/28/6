Subject: CVE Request -- Opera Manipulating fonts in SVG can allow execution
 of arbitrary code

Hello,

Can a CVE be assigned for the below issue?

"Certain font manipulations inside a dynamically added and specifically
embedded SVG image can cause Opera to crash. Additional techniques can
reliably be used in combination with this crash to allow execution of
arbitrary code.

Opera Software has released Opera 11.52, where this issue has been fixed."
