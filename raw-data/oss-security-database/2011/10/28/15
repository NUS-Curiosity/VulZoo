Doug Lea's Malloc stores chunks whose size is small than 512 bytes in one of the small bins, which holds identically sized chunks. The size of a chunk is always a multiple of 8 bytes, and the first small bin holds 16 bytes chunks. Since the minimum allocated size is 16 bytes, it seems no data that can result in application crash can be overwritten as a result of this.
