Subject: CVE Request: apt

Hello,

Could a CVE please be assigned to the following issue:

Apt before 0.8.11 incorrectly handles the Verify-Host configuration
option, resulting in a successful connection instead of a verification
failure when the certificate host name doesn't match.

See:

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~donkult/apt/sid/revision/2053.1.28
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/868353


Thanks,

Marc.
