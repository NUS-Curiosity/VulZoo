Something is odd with the MITRE CVE:

According to http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4062
the bug is in the Linux emulation code. However the bug is really in
the bind(2) system call. There was a different bug in the emulation
code exposed by fixing the bind vulnerability but the system is
vulnerable even without linux emulation turned on.

Additionally Debian appears to have copied the incorrect data from the
MITRE cve (http://www.debian.org/security/2011/dsa-2325)/
