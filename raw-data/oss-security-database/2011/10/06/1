Yes, this is a known bug with Polipo 1.0.4 and 1.0.4.1.  I believe that
it is fixed in the Git trunk, which is unfortunately not ready to be
released (and might never be unless a maintainer is found).

At any rate, I do not recommend running Polipo as a publicly accessible
proxy.  While I have made reasonable efforts to ensure that this is
safe, Polipo was not designed for that.
