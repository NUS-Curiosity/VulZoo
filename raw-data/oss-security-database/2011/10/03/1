Subject: CVE Request -- Polipo -- Assertion failure by processing certain
 HTTP POST / PUT requests

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   a denial of service flaw was found in the way Polipo, a lightweight
caching web proxy, processed certain HTTP POST / PUT requests. If
polipo was configured to allow remote client connections and particular
host was allowed to connect to polipo server instance, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (polipo daemon
abort due to assertion failure) via specially-crafted HTTP POST / PUT
request.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
