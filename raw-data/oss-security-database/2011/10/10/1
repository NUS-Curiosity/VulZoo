Hello vendors,

   1) apologize for capital letters in the subject. Just wanted this
message not to be overlooked, since it's important.

2) Due to a mistake, an incorrect CVE identifier of CVE-2011-2390 was
used  here / in the previous post. The proper one should be 
CVE-2011-3590, as detailed here:
[1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=716439#c61

Since there are some incorrect references present in the public already:
[2] http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/49944/info

we wanted to kindly ask you to update your entries. CVE-2011-2390 is
NOT the correct one, please use CVE-2011-3590 identifier to reference
the following security flaw:

3. kdump/mkdumprd copies all the .ssh keys of root user on the vmcore
    file. This may include keys which are not-required and may be
    confidential to the root user also.

in the kexec-tools package.

Apologize to all of the affected parties for the inconvenience.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
