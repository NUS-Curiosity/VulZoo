This has already received a CVE ID, although for some reason it was     
never set public on the MITRE website:  
                                  
http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2043                    
http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2044                    

-> CVE-2010-2062

Cheers,
