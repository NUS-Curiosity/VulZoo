Subject: Ruby 3.0.10 WEBrick::HTTPRequest X-Forwarded-*

Various methods in WEBrick::HTTPRequest in Ruby on Rails 3.0.10 do not
validate the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Server
headers in requests, which might allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary text into log files or bypass intended address parsing via a
crafted header.

Can we get a CVE for this please?
