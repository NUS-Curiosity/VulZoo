We generally strive to include the first public announcement from the 
researcher as a reference in all CVEs.  In this case, 
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/27/6 was the first 
(vague) announcement that a lot of path-disclosure issues existed in 
multiple products, so it is included in the various CVEs that were created 
as a result of examining the 
http://code.google.com/p/inspathx/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpaths_vuln 
that was mentioned in that MLIST.
