Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: ext4: ext4_ext_insert_extent() kernel oops

A flaw was found in the way splitting two extents in
ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() worked. Althrough ex has been updated
in memory, it is not dirtied both in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized()
and ext4_ext_insert_extent(). The disk layout is corrupted. Then it
will meet with a BUG_ON() when writting at the start of that extent
again.

Local unprivileged users can use this flaw to crash the system when ext4
filesystem is in use.
