Understood. I've looked at the issue more closely and found a similar
DOS-exploitable timerace and a buffer overwrite unrelated to this. Just
for study, I'm currently trying to combine 3 timeraces + buffer
overwrite + ROP to get code execution. Since apache will quite likely
fix the other two issues, they have to touch the code anyway, so the
symlink issue might be historic soon also.
