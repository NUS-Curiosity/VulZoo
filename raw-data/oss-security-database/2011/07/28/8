Subject: libxml security fix from apple ... any information?

Hi folks, Billy, Daniel,

On
http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4808
there is a libxml security issue listed:

-----------------------------------------
libxml

Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

Description: A one-byte heap buffer overflow existed in libxml's handling of XML data. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-ID

CVE-2011-0216 : Billy Rios of the Google Security Team
-----------------------------------------

I suspect this is libxml2 and it likely also affects Linux?

If this is correct, could you identify the commit fixing this issue?

Ciao, Marcus
