Subject: [oCERT-2011-001] Chyrp input sanitization errors


#2011-001 Chyrp input sanitization errors

Description:

The Chyrp framework, an open source blogging engine, suffers from cross-site
scripting (XSS) and local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.

Insufficient input sanitization on the parameters passed to pages related to
administration settings, the javascript handler and the index handler leads to
arbitrary javascript injection in the context of the user session. This could
be potentially exploited to hijack the session of the administrator.

Insufficient path sanitization on the root 'action' query string parameter
leads to inclusion of arbitrary files from local sources, this could be
exploited to read arbitrary accessible files on the hosting server filesystem
and potentially execute arbitrary commands or code.

Affected version:

Chyrp <= 2.1

Fixed version:

Chyrp, N/A
