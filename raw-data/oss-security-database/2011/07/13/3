Subject: CVE Request: hplip/foomatic-filters

Hi

The foomatic filters of the hplip package allow remote users
to execute arbitrary commands as the lp user. The flaw allows
hosts which are listed in the printing ACL or local users to
pass PPD file arguments to the foomatic filters. A PoC was
demonstrated using the CUPS server.

More info and patches are here:
