Subject: CVE request: hplip: insecure tmp file handling

Hi,

hplip has a tmp file issue:

  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=704608
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/hplip/+bug/809904

Could someone possibly assign a CVE to it, please? Thanks in advance!

Matthias

PS: Not too critical IMO as the code path is probably rarely used anyway.
