Subject: Re: CVE Request -- foomatic (foomatic-filters):
 foomatic-rip (debug mode) insecure temporary file use in renderer command
 line by processing PostScript data

Steve,

Can you weigh in on how to assign this one. I'm thinking we want two IDs,
but I know in the past one ID has been used for catchall type IDs (I'm not
sure if that's simply done due to lack of details).

Thanks.
