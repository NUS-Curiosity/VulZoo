Subject: CVE request: kernel: nl80211: missing check for valid SSID size in
 scan operations

In both trigger_scan and sched_scan operations, we were checking for the
SSID length before assigning the value correctly.  Since the memory was
just kzalloc'ed, the check was always failing and SSID with over 32
characters were allowed to go through.

This is causing a buffer overflow when copying the actual SSID to the
proper place.

Please note that it needs CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges.
