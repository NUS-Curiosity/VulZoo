They are different, but as OEL is based on RHEL, I believe they're
still sufficiently similar (same upstream versions, mostly the same
patches and spec files) to expect most flaws affecting components
shipped in both should affect both distros in the same way.  Hence the
interest in those differences that required different fixes in the
past, or were for the common component but did not affect one of the
distros.
