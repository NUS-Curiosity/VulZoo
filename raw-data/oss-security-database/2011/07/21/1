Done.  I kept the old one, but added a mention of it's existence in
the regular NetBSD entry.

I'm afraid I don't know about interest.  I had hoped others would have
jumped in earlier... but they have not...

In the end did the opensolaris based distributions get into the closed
linux list?  If not, I wonder if a list for everyone who
repackages/distributes free/open source software (other than linux
distro's) would make more sense than a BSD specific one?

As far as you being on the list... I at least have no problem with it.
 In fact I would be surprised to find much if anything on such a list
that was not also on the linux list.
(My personal preference would be to have the BSD folks on the linux
list and trust us to just ignore the kernel issues that are not
relevant to us :)

Thanks for all your work to provide good communication options!
