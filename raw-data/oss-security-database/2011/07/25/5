If I got it right, the CVE-2010-4555 ID has been assigned to the XSS
flaws:

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the SquirrelMail
webmail client:
* XSS flaws in generic options inputs,
* XSS flaw in the SquirrelSpell plug-in,
* XSS flaw in the Index Order page.

while the CVE-2011-2753 ID has been assigned to the CSRF protection add-ons:

Also protection against Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaws has
been added to the empty trash feature and to the Index Order page.
