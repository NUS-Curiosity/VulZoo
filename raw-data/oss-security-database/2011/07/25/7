Subject: CVE Request -- GLPI -- Properly blacklist some sensitive fields

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was found that GLPI, the Information Resource-Manager with an 
additional Administration-Interface, did not properly blacklist certain 
sensitive variables (like GLPI username and password). A remote attacker 
could use this flaw to obtain access to plaintext form of these values 
via specially-crafted HTTP POST request.
