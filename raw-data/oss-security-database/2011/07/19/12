Subject: Re: CVE Request -- MapServer -- SQL injections in OGC filter encoding and in WMS time support.

Selon Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@...hat.com>:

Jan,

I believe Alan Boudreault (MapServer team member that I've added to the CC list)
has already asked the Debian security team to request for a CVE number, but
without any result for now. Maybe he can confirm.

Best regards,

Even
