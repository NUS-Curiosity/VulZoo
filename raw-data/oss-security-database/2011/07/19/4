I've just added NetBSD pkgsrc to:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors

While at it, I've also added FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD.  NetBSD itself
and OpenBSD were already there.

I also went to the MirBSD website, but couldn't find any security
contact info there - I guess they don't care much.
