Subject: CVE Request: foo2zjs

Hello,

A temp file issue was reported in a distro-specific patch to foo2zjs.
This probably only affects Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives.

The original bug report can be found here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/805370

Could a CVE please be assigned to this?

Thanks,

Marc.
