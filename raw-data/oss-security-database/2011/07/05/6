This is very helpful, thank you!  How did you find it?

So, I failed to get this server to give me ctime (looked at HTTP headers
and also tried several FTP commands), and the mtime is Feb 15.  We could
ask the server admins for the ctime.

However, inside the archive we see 2011-06-30 14:15 UTC on the top-level
directory, and 2011-06-30 13:46 on the .o files.  This suggests that the
backdoored tarball was put in place no earlier than 2011-06-30 14:15 UTC,
although that's using the intruder's system time, which might not be
accurate. ;-)

My guess is that the mirror is automatically updated, perhaps nightly,
and not necessarily via rsync.  It is possible to transfer/preserve the
mtime via ftp and http as well - typical mirror programs do that.

Looks like it was 3 days, actually.

Thanks,
