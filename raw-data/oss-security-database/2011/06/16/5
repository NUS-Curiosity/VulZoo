This certainly is a nice enhancement, that makes it a lot easier to find
specific mail in the web archive.

Thread view is what other archive managers tend to provide.  It's
usually more convenient for navigating through longer / more complex
threads than only thread-prev / thread-next.  Most archive managers
split archive on the month boundary, which breaks threads view, but,
guessing from what you've written, it seems blists should not suffer
form such problem.

For oss-security, there's also a gmane hosted archive which already
offers a rather nice thread view.  It also provides short links to
views that only show specific thread, with option to focus on a
particular post. I'd expect you don't plan to compete with gmane
feature set, but there surely is some inspiration to be found there if
you're after ideas.
