On one hand I agree, on the other hand I remember hard time getting rid of
Debian specific patches for su.
The behavior of -c changed and since dependencies to this tool are not
traced, there were no other ways than grep'ing the whole distro for those
two letters 'su' to prepare the transition.

One first step could be to compare their features and behaviors


PS: regarding the original issue, was the CVE requested? I would need the
    number for documentation purpose.
