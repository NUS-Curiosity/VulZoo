Subject: CVE Request -- DokuWiki -- XSS in DokuWiki's RSS embedding mechanism

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was found that DokuWiki's RSS embedding mechanism did not properly
escape user-provided links. An attacker could use this flaw to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary
JavaScript code execution.
