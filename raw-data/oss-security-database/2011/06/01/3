Subject: CVE Request -- OpenOffice.org -- InteVyDis Demo of OpenOffice 0day.
 Released with VulnDisco 8.8 pack (release date May,2009)


Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   A new security flaw, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the OpenOffice.org suite tools
has been reported by the InteVyDis security researchers team:
[1] http://intevydis.com/oo_0day.html
[2] http://twitter.com/#!/legerov/status/75482755194032128

References:
[3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=709705

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be further detailed information
available right now. But from the Twitter post, looks this issue is
still valid against OpenOffice.org v3.3.

Hopefully Evgeny Legerov of InteVyDis security researchers team (Cc-ed)
could provide further background information about this issue, i.e.
if it is an old issue (like date of 2009 would suggest) and thus a CVE
identifier has been already assigned to this issue or is this completely
new issue (which did not get fixed from 2009 till now) and thus it 
requires a new CVE id.

Evgeny, any further information you could provide here, to clear the
CVE doubt is really appreciated.

Once the CVE doubt cleared, could you allocate a CVE id for this issue?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
