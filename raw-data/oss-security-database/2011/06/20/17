Subject: CVE request: Joomla unspecified information disclosure
 vulnerability

Couldn't find a CVE-identifier for this issue. Joomla does have too many vulnerabilities. Joomla prior to 1.5.23 contains a flaw that may lead to an unauthorized information disclosure. Should this one get a 2010 or 2011 identifier?

Reported: 2010-12-08
Joomla advisory: 2011-04-01
Release with a fix (version 1.5.23): 2011-04-04

I hope this request isn't duplicate. I included oCERT to this email as Joomla is part of that group. Please notify me and mailing-list if this issue already has a CVE-identifier.
