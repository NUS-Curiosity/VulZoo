AFAIK, on some architectures, unaligned accesses will generate a
fault, which will be handled by emulating the access via byte-size
loads and stores (for example).  So while unaligned accesses like this
should be avoided, I don't think there's a security impact.  Anyone
who knows better, please correct me if I'm wrong.
