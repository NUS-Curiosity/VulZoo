Subject: CVE Request -- Cherokee -- server admin vulnerable to csrf


Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   this doesn't seem to have a CVE identifier yet:
   [1] http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jun/0

Though not sure, how much probable it is, it would get fixed,
since upstream looks to consider this not to be an issue.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
