The issue also reminds me that there are several su implemenations.
On Fedora and SUSE we have a patched coreutils version, Debian uses
the one from shadow-utils and then there's also a su from
SimplePAMApps, used by e.g. Owl. Of course each one has it's own
quirks and weird features. Does anyone still remember why a
particular implementation was chosen? :-)
