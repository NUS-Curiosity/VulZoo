This really shouldn't get a CVE id. It's well known, and sadly not easy to
fix. There are more details in this bug:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479145

I would classify this as an administration issue, not a flaw in su or sudo.
If you're running arbitrary things, you're in far more trouble than this.

I'm happy to let MITRE overrule me.
