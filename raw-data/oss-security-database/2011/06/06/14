Just to correct / tune up the impact a bit yet:
"A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause memory pressure (kernel
OOM killer protection mechanism to be activated and potentially
terminate vsftpd or arbitrary [vsftpd independent] process, which
satisfied the OOM killer process selection algorithm)."

Based on record of apache2 process termination in:

Thanks to Petr Matousek for pointing this out.
