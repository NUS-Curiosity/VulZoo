Subject: CVE Request -- xscreensaver -- exits when activated


Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was found that xscreensaver terminated, when it was activated upon 
launch. A local proximate attacker could use this deficiency to access
resources, which should be otherwise protected by authentication.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
