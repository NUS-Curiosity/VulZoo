Subject: Re: Linux kernel proactive security hardening

Hi all,

We have started with the project described below under GSoC 2011, and
I've just setup a new mailing list for it, as well as for Linux kernel
hardening topics in general.  Here's my "welcome" message explaining
this in more detail and referencing work that has already started:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2011/06/03/1

Folks interested in getting involved (or just watching) are welcome to
join the kernel-hardening list (some already did).  Subscribe here:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/#subscribe

(choose "kernel-hardening" from the drop-down at the bottom of this page).

Now the context to this (which was too long to top-quote):
