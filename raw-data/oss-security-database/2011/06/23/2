NLM: Don't hang forever on NLM unlock requests

If the NLM daemon is killed on the NFS server, we can currently end up
hanging forever on an 'unlock' request, instead of aborting. Basically,
if the rpcbind request fails, or the server keeps returning garbage, we
really want to quit instead of retrying.

In English, it means that a local, unprivileged user could use the flock
system call on a NFS share to cause a denial of service.
