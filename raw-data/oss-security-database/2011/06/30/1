Subject: CVE request: kernel: tomoyo: oops in tomoyo_mount_acl()

Description of problem:
In tomoyo_mount_acl() since 2.6.36, kern_path() was called without
checking dev_name != NULL. As a result, an unprivileged user can
trigger oops by issuing mount(NULL, "/", "ext3", 0, NULL) request.

Upstream fix:
4e78c724d47e2342aa8fde61f6b8536f662f795f
