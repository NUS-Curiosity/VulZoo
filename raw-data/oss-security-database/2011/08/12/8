Subject: CVE request: multiple vulnerabilities in dtc

Hi,

A number of problems have been found recently in dtc (Domain Technologie
Control) and reported to the Debian BTS. These are the bugs that affect
upstream code; please assign CVEs as you feel appropriate:

#566654
dtc saves the administrator password in plain text in
/var/lib/dtc/saved_install_config under the variable name conf_adm_pass.
It remains there even after initial configuration.

#611680
dtc-xen includes several command executions as root that use unchecked
user input in dtc-soap-server.

#614304
dtc stores user passwords and passwords for various services in unencrypted
form in the database.

#637477
Insufficient input checking in /shared/inc/sql/lists.php

#637485
The setup script for dtc writes the password for the MySQL user in the
world-readable file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.

#637487
Insufficient input checking leads to a SQL injection vulnerability in
shared/inc/forms/domain_info.php.

#637498
A SQL injection vulnerability in logPushlet.php can overwrite arbitrary
files as the MySQL system user.

#637537
dtc passes passwords to htpasswd using command line arguments, which can be
read by a local user.

#637584
dtc does not escape variables in HTML output in many places; for example
in the "Domain root TXT record:" field on the "DNS and MX" page where
JavaScript can be injected.

Note that these descriptions are mostly taken from the bug reports and may
not be suitable for direct publication without editing. I have checked as
far as possible that none of these were previously assigned CVEs but they
could be duplicates. There are often mitigating factors such as
user or administrator authentication.

Thanks,
