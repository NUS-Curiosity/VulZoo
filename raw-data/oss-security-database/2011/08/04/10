Subject: CVE-request: FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD(?) ftpd remote crash (2010)

Can I get 2010 CVE-ID for this issue? I am not sure if other distributions/operating systems need their own IDs. If I am correct one ID should be enough.

Original discussion: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Mar/117
Bug report to FreeBSD: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=144761
NetBSD: http://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=43023
Reported to OpenBSD (and patched), but can't find references.
Does not affect Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=572813
Not listed in OSVDB, but I can handle it.

Best regards,
Henri Salo
