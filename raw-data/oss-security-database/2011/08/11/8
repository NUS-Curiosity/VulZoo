Subject: CVE request: improper permissions on ~/.qtnx/*.nxml

A Debian bug report noted that qtnx stores its configuration file
insecurely.  If a non-default SSH key is used, the key is stored in this
world-readable file (~/.qtnx/*.nxml) in a world-readable directory
(~/.qtnx/).

Could a CVE be assigned to this please?
