Subject: Closed List

Hello,

I'm John Haxby, a member of the Linux group at Oracle Corporation.  I'm
actually in the Linux sustaining team, the team actually responsible for
fixing most of the bugs.

Could you please add me to the closed list?   There is one other person
on the list for Oracle, but none, yet, from the Linux group.

My public key can be found on the keyservers, and this is its fingerprint:
