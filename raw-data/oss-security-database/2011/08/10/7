While you're at it, here are a couple more:

* Out-of-bounds read on lines 166-171 due to signedness error
* Out-of-bounds read on lines 224-240 due to signedness error

Line numbers based on upstream git:
http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=libavcodec/cavsdec.c;h=acf040788c9a4c34807ba2efa10312b5b8e84f02;hb=6481a36010d8f7d834676f17ba555d0a3815c760


Hint to distributions and software developers: if you're going to use
libavcodec (or libavformat, etc.) for your project, consider
restricting the default build to include only *commonly* used codecs
and demuxers.  The code quality of many of the more obscure formats is
questionable at best.
