Subject: CVE-request(?): squid: buffer overflow in Gopher reply parser

Hi,

squid 3.x seems to have re-introduced a security issue found by Ben Hawkes of 
the Google Security Team in 2005,

  2011: http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2011_3.txt
  2005: http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2005_1.txt (CVE-2005-0094)

Will there be a new CVE required? Not quite sure how such "special" cases are 
handled usually.

Thanks,
Matthias
