Subject: CVE request: perf: may parse user-controlled config file

This was reported by Christian Ohm at:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=632923

The perf command, provided as part of the Linux kernel source, looks
for and honors configuration settings in ./config. A local user could
obtain elevated privileges by convincing a superuser to run the perf
command from a directory the user controls.
