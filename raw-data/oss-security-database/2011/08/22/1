Subject: Re: CVE request: Pidgin crash

Hi Mark,

>Hi!  Would it be possible to issue a CVE for a new crash in Pidgin?

>http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=53

Please use CVE-2011-2942 for this issue.

Also looking at http://pidgin.im/news/security it seems two other security issues were also
fixed in 2.10.0, do you want CVEs to be assigned for them as well?

Thanks.
