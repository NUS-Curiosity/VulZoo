That's fine by me.  As an upstream developer I don't feel like I have
a strong incentive to obtain a CVE.  But if it's helpful to packagers,

The two issues in question are discussed here:
http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=54
http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=55

The second one only affects Pidgin on Microsoft Windows.
