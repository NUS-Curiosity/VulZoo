Hi!

We used self-compiled python to run the tests against the older python bundled with the OS 
(see Dockerfile at https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/blob/shootout-0.3/shootout/debian-7/Dockerfile).

To elaborate a bit, we are actually looking two different set of requirements.

1) TryTLS runner itself requires 2.7.9 or 3.4.0
2) However, it can call older python version (or what ever command) when executing the tests.

That being said, python2-urllib2 did not execute cleanly with 2.7.3. 
There is a pull request about that <https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/pull/237>, 
and the corresponding result has been marked as N/A in the summary table.
