Hi

that is intended to restrict a user's environment to only a limited
sets of commands.

1/ Shell outbreak due to bad syntax parse
   - https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/147
   - https://bugs.debian.org/834949

2/ Shell outbreak with multiline commands
   - https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/issues/149
   - Fix: https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell/commit/e72dfcd1f258193f9aaea3591ecbdaed207661a0
   - https://bugs.debian.org/834946

Salvatore
