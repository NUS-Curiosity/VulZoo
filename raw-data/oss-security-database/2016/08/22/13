Subject: Re: Re: CVE Request: Linux kernel crash of OHCI when
 plugging in malicious USB devices

Hi,

This seems a bit sore topic, and Mitre does not want to chime in.

Perhaps we need to add more criteria to select CVE assignment.

- simple DOS (e.g. NULL ptr dereference) when plugging in: No CVE
- code execution (use after free, write overflows) when plugging in: Assign CVE


That said, this leaves malicious USB devices posing as regular keyboards 
for text injection unclassified ... 

Ciao, Marcus
