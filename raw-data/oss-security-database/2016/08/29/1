 via setxattr doesn't clear the setgid bit

Hello,
 
Honestly, I do not see a relation between this patch and overlays. The patch
touches the code of underlying filesystems. So, most probably, upperdir ACL
issue is not fixed by this suggested patch.

Best regards,

Does this also fix the upperdir ACL access gain from
http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2016/UserNamespaceOverlayfsXattrSetgidPrivilegeEscalation/
?

The overlayfs upperdir part is already fixed, so the one would
have to execute replacement commands for the steps already prohibited
by the userns/overlayfs fixes.
