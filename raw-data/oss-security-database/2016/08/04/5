Subject: CVE-2016-0760: Hive builtin functions “reflect”, “reflect2”, and “java_method” are not blocked in Apache Sentry

CVE-2016-0760: Hive builtin functions “reflect”, “reflect2”, and
“java_method” are not blocked in Apache Sentry

Severity: Very Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Sentry 1.5.1 and 1.6.0

Description:
Some functions in Hive which allow arbitrary code to be executed are
not blacklisted properly in some versions of Sentry, which would allow
authenticated
users to potentially use these functions for malicious purposes.

Mitigation:
Upgrade to 1.7.0 (or)
Workaround - Users can explicitly configure the blacklist
functions in the hive configuration by setting the property
"hive.server2.builtin.udf.blacklist" to "reflect,reflect2,java_method"
