Well, it happened to me when I was a kid, with a PS/2 port. I handed off
a device to someone of trust to connect to the PS/2 port and parallel port.
(PS/2 to pick the +5V). I wired it wrong and the motherboard died, as
amazing as it seems and the person didn't find it fun as it was not his PC.

So yes it can be done even without suspecting. It's easy to do whatever you
want using a USB stick. You can use the 3W it provides to charge a 300V
capacitor and discharge it on the D+/D- to test the clamping diodes
robustness, etc...

Thus I don't think either that something "only causing a panic" deserves
a CVE. It needs to be fixed however, for sure!
