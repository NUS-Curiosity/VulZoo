Subject: potrace: multiple crashes

Hello,

the past year I discovered and documented multiple crashes in potrace:

https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/08/08/potrace-multiple-three-null-pointer-dereference-in-bm_readbody_bmp-bitmap_io-c/

https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/08/08/potrace-divide-by-zero-in-bm_new-bitmap-h/

https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/08/08/potrace-multiplesix-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-bm_readbody_bmp-bitmap_io-c/

It could be obvious but each crash comes up from a different crafted 
image.


If you think that something is suitable for an identifier, please assign it.
Thanks
