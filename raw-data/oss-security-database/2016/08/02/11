Use CVE-2016-6521.

(Conceivably this could have had a CVE-2015 number if
https://github.com/sheehan/grails-console/issues/24 were interpreted as
a vulnerability disclosure; however issues/24 seems too vague.)

It is possible that a behavior like this could have its own CVE ID if
it is undocumented or interacts incorrectly with run-app. For example,
http://docs.grails.org/1.3.9/guide/single.html#6.4.5%20Mapping%20to%20HTTP%20methods
says "the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE)." Do you mean, for
example, that the OPTIONS or TRACE method can allow access, but the
documentation suggests that only GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE need to be
anticipated?
