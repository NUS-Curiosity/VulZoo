Subject: Libgcrypt and GnuPG 1.4 RNG output prediction

Hi,

This was just announced on gnupg-announce and Twitter @gnupg, and I
think it should also be in here:

https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2016q3/000395.html

> Felix Drre and Vladimir Klebanov from the Karlsruhe Institute of
> Technology found a bug in the mixing functions of Libgcrypt's random
> number generator: An attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG can
> trivially predict the next 160 bits of output.  This bug exists since
> 1998 in all GnuPG and Libgcrypt versions.
> 
> 
> Impact
> ======
> All Libgcrypt and GnuPG versions released before 2016-08-17 are affected
> on all platforms.
> 
> A first analysis on the impact of this bug in GnuPG shows that existing
> RSA keys are not weakened.  For DSA and Elgamal keys it is also unlikely
> that the private key can be predicted from other public information.
> This needs more research and I would suggest _not to_ overhasty revoke

Also off Twitter:

<@rgacogne> @gnupg @solardiz The CVE number (CVE-2016-6316) seems to have been used to track another security issue rubygem-actionview, is that correct?

There does in fact appear to be a CVE ID clash, with:
