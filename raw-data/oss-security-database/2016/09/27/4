Subject: CVE Request - OpenSLP 2.0 Memory Corruption

Hi,

The following commit fixes a memory corruption bug that I reported in OpenSLP:

https://sourceforge.net/p/openslp/mercurial/ci/34fb3aa5e6b4997fa21cb614e480de36da5dbc9a/

Below are the details of the issue:

static int SLPFoldWhiteSpace(size_t len, char * str)
{
      char * p = str, * ep = str + len;
      while (p < ep)
      {
            if (isspace(*p))
            {
                char * ws2p = ++p;
                while (isspace(*p))
                     p++;
                len -= p - ws2p;
                memmove(ws2p, p, ep - p);

The outer while loop checks for p < ep, but lack of bound check in
inner while loop could result in p > ep. This will result in passing a
very large 'size_t len' (ep - p) parameter for memmove().

Could you assign a CVE for this?
