These are crashes of a command-line program, not a program that is
supposed to continue running to handle a series of inputs. No write
access is reported. Also, running etterlog on an arbitrary
attacker-modified .ecp or .eci file probably would occur very rarely.

The "(three) heap-based buffer overflow" report is exclusively about
"AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ... READ." It's apparently
about an attacker who fuzzes a file so that an IP address-length field
is a large number rather than, for example, 4 or 32. A memcmp reads
out-of-bounds data but the flow of control isn't altered. Also, this
happens in the etterlog source code (utils/etterlog/el_profiles.c),
not in library code that might be used in other applications.

We feel that these crashes are just an inconvenience, not a security
risk, and there are no CVE IDs at this time.
