Subject: ettercap: etterlog: multiple crashes

Hello,

etterlog which is part off ettercap, crashes when try to reads malformed data.

Basically, the tool should read what you capture with YOUR ettercap, but since 
ettercap is one of the valid tools for MITM, there are dozens of blog post 
about how to use it, so there could be posts where malicious users make 
available crafted datafile to show something.

If you think that something is suitable for an identifier, please assign one.
Thanks.
