For who is interested, the details of the issue NÂ° 4 are documented here:

https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/08/23/graphicsmagick-two-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-readtiffimage-tiff-c/[1] 


The same block of code, which was rewritten because of the overflows, 
contains also a null pointer access:

https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/09/07/graphicsmagick-null-pointer-dereference-in-magickstrlcpy-utility-c/[2] 


Unfortunately this problem was not reproducible by Mr Friesenhahn, but 
seems to be disappeared after the commit which fixed the overflows.
