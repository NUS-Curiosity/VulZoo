Subject: CVE ID request: certificate spoofing through crafted SASL message in inspircd, charybdis

inspircd published 2.0.23 that fixes an issue with SASL
authentication. The details are here:

http://www.inspircd.org/2016/09/03/v2023-released.html

All versions are affected.

Upstream hasn't requested a CVE yet. I told them I would request one
from here on IRC.

It seems to also affect Charybdis, which fixed the issue in the
upcoming 3.5.3 release:
