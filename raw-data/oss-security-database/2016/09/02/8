DoS is often a gray area. Obviously if I send 10 gigabits of request
traffic and swarm gets slow/non responsive the CVE response would be "Well
yeah... that's probably what happens if you saturate the network with
requests. No CVE for you" but if a single node behaves in an odd way and
prevents the whole system from working in an expected manner, that may be a
problem that is worth a CVE, especially if it can be triggered by an
attacker/less trusted user (classic trust boundary violation to quote
@sushidude).

Regardless of whether this is CVE worthy is there any plan to add rate
limiting or other protective measures to prevent a single badly
behaved/malicious node from making the swarm unable to operate normally? I
don't see any issues in https://github.com/docker/swarm/issues for this.
Thanks!
