Subject: CVE request Qemu: virtio: null pointer dereference in
 virtqueu_map_desc

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio framework is vulnerable to a null 
pointer dereference flaw. It could occur if the guest was to set the I/O 
descriptor buffer length to a large value.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance 
on the host resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------

This issue was independently reported by Qinghao Tang and Zhenhao Hong of the 
Marvel Team of 360.cn Inc.

Thank you.
