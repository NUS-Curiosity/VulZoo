Subject: Re: Does a documentation bug elevate to CVE status? - Crypto++

Damn, you guys are ruthless...

The Crypto++ project is tracking this at
https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/277.

Please make it a public bug/CVE. The Crypto++ project believe in
complete transparency so decision makers can assess risk and and apply
remediations commensurate with their data security posture.

Jeffrey Walton on behalf of Crypto++ project.
