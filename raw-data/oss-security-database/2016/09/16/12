To clarify: this is only triggered if the hostname has been set, not the
$HOSTNAME variable, right?

Your subject line suggests setting $HOSTNAME would lead to command
execution, which would be a vulnerability reminiscent of shellshock, but
quickly glancing at the code, it looks like $HOSTNAME is only used if
gethostname(3) returned an empty string?
