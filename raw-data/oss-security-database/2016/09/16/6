Subject: Out of bounds heap bugs in glib, heap buffer overflow in
 gnome-session

https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/53-Out-of-bounds-heap-bugs-in-glib,-heap-buffer-overflow-in-gnome-session.html

By testing GNOME-related packages with Address Sanitizer I recently
discovered several trivial to find bugs.

Two out of bounds bugs in the glib library were uncovered by running
the test suite with Address Sanitizer enabled. One heap buffer overflow
in the parameter parsing of gnome-session was uncovered by trying to
start GNOME. Given that these bugs weren't discovered earlier means
that most likely nobody ever used Address Sanitizer to test GNOME
components.

I strongly recommend to GNOME and to other software communities to use
Address Sanitizer testing in order to improve the quality of their
software.
