Subject: git-hub: missing sanitization of data received from GitHub

git-hub <https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/git-hub> is a Git command-line 
interface to GitHub. When you ask it to clone a repository, it will call:

   git clone <repourl> <reponame>

where both <repourl> and <reponame> come from GitHub API, without any 
sanitization. Operators of the GitHub server (or a MitM attacker[*]) could 
exploit it for directory traversal or, more excitingly, for arbitrary code 
execution, either via option injection, e.g.:

   git clone 'git://-esystem("cowsay pwned > \x2fdev\x2ftty")/' --config=core.gitProxy=perl

or more directly with git-remote-ext, e.g.:

   git clone 'ext::sh -c cowsay% pwned% >% /dev/tty' moo


Upstream bug report:
https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/git-hub/issues/197


[*] git-hub is implemented in Python, which didn't verify HTTPS certificates 
before 2.7.9; and git-hub doesn't enable verification on its own either.
