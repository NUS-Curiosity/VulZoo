Subject: cve request: docker swarm node Dos occurs when join a cluster failed
 using local CA certificate

>From I can understand from this report, the author creates a swarm, messes
with the local certificate for a worker, and then tries to join the swarm.
The worker fails because the author messed with the local state.

This does not make the manager not available to the rest of the worker
nodes, and is essentially a self-DoS (I modified my local configuration in
such a way that docker doesn't run).

A simple rm -rf /var/lib/docker/swarm should clean all the state. Not CVE
worthy.
