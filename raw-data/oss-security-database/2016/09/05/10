Again, there is no trust boundary violation. You have a token that allows
you to join an unlimited number of workers. The system supports N workers,
you join N + 1, the system starts rejecting new workers.

No malicious attacker can ever join any workers unless they have the token,
and if you are paranoid, you can always rotate the secret token after each
worker join.

I don't believe this is the right thread to discuss other topics. I'm here
to get this CVE rescinded, since there is no reason for its existence in
the first place.

If you'd like to discuss any other matters related to docker or swarm, feel
free to do so by either open an issue on our GH repository, or our forums:
