Subject: CVEs for vulnerabilities listed in MySQL 5.6.33 release note

Hi,

the MySQL 5.6.33 changelog [1] lists multiple fixed vulnerabilities but
I can't find CVEs for all of these problems. Am I missing something? If
not, could you please assign CVEs which would help tracking the status
of these problems in MariaDB and Percona-Server (see Percona's latest
release notes for their 5.6.32-based fork [2] which seems to address
vulnerabilities listed in 5.6.33):

> For mysqld_safe, the argument to --malloc-lib now must be one of the
>  directories /usr/lib, /usr/lib64, /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu, or 
> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. In addition, the --mysqld and 
> --mysqld-version options can be used only on the command line and not
> in an option file. (Bug #24464380)

This one seems to be related to CVE-2016-6662 but one could argue this
deserve its one CVE.

This is CVE-2016-6662.


> Privilege escalation was possible by exploiting the way REPAIR TABLE
> used temporary files. (Bug #24388746)

This one seems to be without a CVE (I guess this isn't CVE-2016-6663).


Thanks!
