At least for some projects, if a vulnerability is already public or
becomes public prior to requesting a CVE privately from some CNA, it
makes more sense to go ahead and widely inform the community (via
this ML and elsewhere) and then associate a CVE with it afterward.
While having a unique identifier is important, I think rapid
dissemination of vulnerabilities so that downstream users can patch
their systems is more important.
