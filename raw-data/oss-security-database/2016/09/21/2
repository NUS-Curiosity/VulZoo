Subject: CVE requestï¼šExponent CMS 2.3.9 xss vulnerability in worldpay

Hi, I reported the following Cross Site Scripting vulnerability to the
ExponentCMS team on Sep 16, 2016:
vulnerability:
/external/worldpay/callback.php
line 7-11:
```
<head>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2;url=<?php echo URL_FULL;
?>cart/preprocess?transStatus=<?php echo $_POST["transStatus"];
?>&transId=<?php echo $_POST["transId"]; ?>"> //xss
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" />
<title></title>
</head>
```
"transStatus", "transId" parameters are fail to sufficiently sanitize.

Proof of concept:
http://www.exponentcms.org/external/worldpay/callback.php
And post:transStatus="/><script>alert(/xss/)</script>


And Now, Cross Site Scripting vulnerability have been fixed.

https://github.com/exponentcms/exponent-cms/commit/5e4b749bff4314f2a22c7afef903c67ccb862caf

This issue was reported by Peng Hua of silence.com.cn Inc. and I would like
to request a CVE for this issue (if not done so).

Thank you.
