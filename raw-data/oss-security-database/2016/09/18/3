Subject: CVE Request: GnuTLS: OCSP validation issue (GNUTLS-SA-2016-3)

Hi

Some days ago new GnuTLS version were released for GNUTLS-SA-2016-3
(OCSP validation issue):

> Stefan Bühler discovered an issue that affects validation of

> gnutls 3.3.24, 3.4.14, 3.5.3 and previous versions. Write-up[0] by

Upstream fix is at [1]. This is as well tracked in Red Hat's bugzilla
at [2].

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
