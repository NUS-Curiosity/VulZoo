Subject: CVE-2016-6299 mock: privilige escalation via mock-scm

Hi,

It was found that mock's scm plug-in would parse a given spec file with
root priviliges. This could allow an attacker who is able to start a
build of an rpm with a specially crafted spec file within mock's
environment to elevate their priviliges and escape the chroot.
