Subject: Possible CVE for TLS protocol issue

This was pointed out to me by mjc@:

https://kcitls.org/

TL;DR: if you can trick someone to install a client certificate you can
then spoof any future web site. Certainly not what we want from the people
issuing client certificates. It sounds like this is a protocol level
vulnerability affecting closed and Open Source vendors potentially, and it
is public so posting it here.
