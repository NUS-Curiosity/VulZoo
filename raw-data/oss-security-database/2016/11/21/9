Maybe you should start handling OVE and other IDs too. Two reasons:

1) MITRE is not always assigning CVEs for WordPress plugin and theme
vulnerabilities for unknown reason. It's not like the CVEs are running out
2) MITRE is not assigning CVEs to all software that has previously received a
CVE, silently dropping the software to out-of-scope area. Example case:
