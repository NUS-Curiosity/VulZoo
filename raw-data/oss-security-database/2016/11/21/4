I assume you're talking about the PHP versions that Wordpress supports (as
opposed to on their update server?).

Such sweeping version checks do not work well with Stable distributions.
Given that most web hosts use stable distros, implementing such a
requirement would lock Wordpress out of a substantial proportion of their
target market:


CentOS 6 will continue to be supported until Q2 2017, with maintenance
releases until 2020. The version in the repos is 5.3.3 with security
backports

Debian Wheezy 5.4.45 (again with security backports) and will be supported
until 2018.


An important question, of course, is whether the issues fixed in PHP 5.6.0
were correctly marked as security fixes (and as a result backported by the
distro maintainers)

There was a similar issue a while back where Joomla! decided to run a
version check to ensure PHP version was >= 5.3.10. It broke a number of
sites, and the most common fix seems to have been a core-hack to disable
that check. The logic for inserting that check was reasonable, but lacked
consideration of who the market actually is.

The alternative is that hosters move onto more bleeding edge distro's, and
I'm not convinced that's good in the long term.
