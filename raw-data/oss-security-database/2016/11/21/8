I agree, and truth be told I think there's some ground to be given on
either side.

There are good reasons for using stable distros, but as you say it makes it
very hard to build something when you can't rely on version numbers to
identify patch levels.

Sorry, didn't mean to make it sound like it was arbitrary. I know the
reasoning was based on available functionality vs required fuctionality.

The problem is that these builds still constitute the majority of your
target market. It'll start to improve for a while due to Jessie and CentOS7
having a higher version, but as those approach EOL the same issue will
probably come up again.

The average user who just buys hosting doesn't have an awful lot of control
over what the hosts run either (though things do actually seem to be
improving in this regard)

I don't have a good answer as to what the solution is. There're very good
reasons for the LTS approach, but you're right about it being a  untenable
position.

I am inclined to think it should be down to the distros to find a
resolution for, whether through exposing a reliable means to check
functionality level or some other means
