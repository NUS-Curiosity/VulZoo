Subject: Pipelight: broken validation of dependency installer signature

Pipelight <http://pipelight.net/cms/about.html> is a wrapper for using Windows 
plugins in Linux browsers. The software comes with an option to update the 
install-dependency script, which contains the plugin database. The downloaded 
code was supposed to be verified against a GPG key, but the verification code 
was broken.

Bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/pipelight/+bug/1632502
Committed fix: https://bitbucket.org/mmueller2012/pipelight/commits/c9fc745d46be
