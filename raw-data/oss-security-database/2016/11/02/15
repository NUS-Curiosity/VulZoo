Ambiguitiy in character encodings can often be a source of security
issues.

Just think of the following:
* A Certificate Authority is using different pieces of software that
  mix different IDNA encodings.
* I request a certificate for strasse.de, but the verification mail
  goes to xn--strae-oqa.de.
* I am the owner of xn--strae-oqa.de and now have a valid certificate
  for strasse.de.

IMHO the whole idea of suddenly changing how international domain names
are encoded is a very problematic security violation.
