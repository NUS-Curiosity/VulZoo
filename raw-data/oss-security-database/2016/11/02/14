From my point of view, this especially affects GNU libc for example.

On the other hand, I am wondering if this should be really classified as a
security related issue. Being interested in IDNA 2008 support myself, I did
some IDNA 2008 patches in the past, but practically IDNA 2008 support is
still not that widespread as I would wish. Does using an older standard (as
in IDNA 2003) really classify this issue as a security related one? If so,
I guess many upstreams should be explicitly made aware of that soon. Maybe
MITRE (or somebody else) could share their thoughts about this, too?

I reported the "ß" issue and the lack of IDNA 2008 support in cURL on Sun,
18 May 2014 17:17:03 +0200 directly to you, but I didn't classify it as a
security related issue though... ;-)
