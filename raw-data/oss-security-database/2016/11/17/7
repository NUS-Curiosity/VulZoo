Yup.  I agree there, but that's down to the publicity its received.  We
can't do much but grin and bear that.   Red Hat have given this a CVSS2
score of 7.2 which reflects the _potential_ severity but marked it as
"moderate" which reflects the actual effect.   It's most serious for
people like me who have an encrypted root but no grub password (and no
rd.shell=0) but, no, the sky is not falling.
