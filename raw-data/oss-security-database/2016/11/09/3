Subject: CVE Request - Samsung Exynos fimg2d Multiple Issues

Hello,

I'd like to request for CVEs for the following two vulnearbilities
fixed in Samsung Exynos fimg2d driver for Android:

Security bulletin: http://security.samsungmobile.com/smrupdate.html#SMR-NOV-2016

SVE-2016-6736: Kernel Crash on /dev/fimg2d ioctl command
Severity: Medium
Affected versions: All devices with Exynos 5433/54xx/7420 chipsets
Reported on: June 11, 2016
Disclosure status: Privately disclosed.
The fimg2d which is one of the graphic devices for Exynos chipsets
doesnâ€™t have exception control routines to handle unexpected commands
and it can lead to kernel panic.
The patch prevents kernel panic by ignoring inappropriate commands at the state.

SVE-2016-6853: Use After Free in /dev/fimg2d
Severity: Medium
Affected versions: All devices with Exynos 5433/54xx/7420 chipsets
Reported on: August 5, 2016
Disclosure status: Privately disclosed.
A use-after-free vulnerability in fimg2d allows attackers to gain
access to unauthorized data.
The patch with error handling was applied.


Thank you,
James
