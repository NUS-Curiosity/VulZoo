Subject: CVE-2016-8634: Foreman stored XSS in orgs/locations wizard step

CVE-2016-8634: Foreman organization/location wizard may run stored XSS
in name

When creating an organization or location in Foreman, if the name
contains HTML then the second step of the wizard will render the HTML.
This occurs in the alert box on the page.

This may permit a stored XSS attack if an organization/location with
HTML in the name is created, then a user is linked directly to this URL.

Mitigation: restrict permissions to organization and location creation,
don't follow untrusted links to Foreman.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.

Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
Fix due to be released in Foreman 1.14.0

Patch:
https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/commit/5a573456b5ecb3ba0d24e057722704f9afeda8f7
