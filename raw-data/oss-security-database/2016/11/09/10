Subject: libdwarf: heap-based buffer overflow in get_attr_value (print_die.c)

If it is suitable for a CVE please assign one. Thanks.

Description:
libdwarf is a library to consume and produce DWARF debug information.

A fuzz on an updated version revealed a buffer overflow.

The complete ASan output:
