Subject: libming: listmp3: divide-by-zero in printMP3Headers (listmp3.c)

If it is suitable for a CVE please assign one. Thanks.

Description:
libming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP, Perl, Ruby, 
Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way..

A fuzzing revealed a divide by zero in listmp3. The bug does not reside in any 
shared object but if you have a web application that calls directly the 
listmp3 binary to parse untrusted mp3, then you are affected.

The complete ASan output:

# listmp3 $FILE
ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL
