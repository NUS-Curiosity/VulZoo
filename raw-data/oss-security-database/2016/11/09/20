Hi, could you assign a CVE to the following issue in libtiff?

http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2587

Fixed per
>> 2016-11-10 Even Rouault <even.rouault at spatialys.com>
>> * libtiff/tif_strip.c: make TIFFNumberOfStrips() return the
>>   td->td_nstrips value when it is non-zero, instead of recomputing it.
>>   This is needed in TIFF_STRIPCHOP mode where td_nstrips is modified.
>>   Fixes a read outside of array in tiffsplit
>>   (or other utilities using TIFFNumberOfStrips()).
