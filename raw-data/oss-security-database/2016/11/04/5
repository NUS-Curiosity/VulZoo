In some situations, this would be a site-specific problem at a
registry. Although domain names can have a variety of uses of '-'
characters, the presence of a '-' as both the third character and the
fourth character is often recognized as a special case. Trying to
specify xn--strae-oqa.de directly when seeking a registration is very
different from trying to specify (for example) x--strae-oqa.de or
xn-strae-oqa.de.

Various other types of bugs (not necessarily security-relevant) have
been reported for this general concept, e.g., see:
