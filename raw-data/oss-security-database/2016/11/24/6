Subject: CVE request - itdb 1.23  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Hi:
itdb 1.23 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 

Procuct: IT Items DataBase

Vendor: ITDB http://www.sivann.gr/software/itdb/

Vunlerable Version: 1.23 and probably prior

Tested Version: 1.23

Author: Haojun Hou in ADLab of Venustech


Advisory Details:

Haojun Hou in ADLab of Venustech discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in itdb <>, which can be exploited to add,modify or delete information in application`s database and gain complete control over the application.



The vulnerability exists due to insufficientfiltration of user-supplied data in “value” HTTP POST parameter passed to “itdb-1.23/js/DataTables-1.8.2/examples/examples_support/editable_ajax.php” url. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a  pop-up messagebox:

POST value="><script>alert(1);</script><"

http://localhost/itdb-1.23/js/DataTables-1.8.2/examples/examples_support/editable_ajax.php <http://localhost/itdb-1.23/js/DataTables-1.8.2/examples/examples_support/editable_ajax.php>

Could you please help me assign a  CVE for this issue?
