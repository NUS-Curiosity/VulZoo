I tried to check out the sources to patch this for myself, following the
recipe from the webpage:

 [2+0]Downloads$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@...otesensing.org:/cvsroot
 [3+0]Downloads$ cvs login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@...otesensing.org:2401/cvsroot
CVS password: # use password "anonymous" 
cvs [login aborted]: connect to remotesensing.org(23.236.62.147):
2401 failed: Connection timed out

Is there another/better way?
