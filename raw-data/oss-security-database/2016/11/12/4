Subject: CVE request: Jenkins remote code execution vulnerability

Hello,

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in the
Jenkins continuous integration and continuous delivery automation server.
A serialized Java object transferred to the Jenkins CLI can make Jenkins
connect to an attacker-controlled LDAP server, which in turn can send a
serialized payload leading to code execution, bypassing existing protection
mechanisms.

The Jenkins project tracks this as SECURITY-360. Releases with the fix are
planned for Wednesday, November 16.

Please assign a CVE to this issue.
