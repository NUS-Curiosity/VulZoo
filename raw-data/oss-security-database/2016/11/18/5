Subject: [Bug Report] Vulnerability in libbpg

Hello,
    I'm a security researcher. And I find one vulnerability in libbpg, this is a double-free issue, which can lead to remote-code-execution.
    I have reported it to the author of libbpg, but no responding, so I report it to you.
    The PoC file is the attachment.
    
    Run the command ./bpgdec PoC.bpg, we wil get the crash log as follows.

    After reading the libbpg source code, I think it's a double-free issue.
    Double Free:
int bpg_decoder_decode(BPGDecoderContext *img, const uint8_t *buf, int buf_len)
//...
ret = hevc_decode_start(img, buf + idx, buf_len - idx,
width, height, img->format, bit_depth, has_alpha); 
|
|->ret = hevc_decode_frame_internal(s, abuf, cbuf, buf, buf_len, 1);
|
|->ret = hevc_write_frame(s->dec_ctx, s->frame, cbuf->buf, cbuf->len);
|
|->len = avcodec_decode_video2(avctx, frame, &got_frame, &avpkt);
|
|->av_frame_unref(picture); //the first free

av_frame_free(&img->frame); //the second free in int bpg_decoder_decode(BPGDecoderContext *img, const uint8_t *buf, int buf_len)

    Fix:
Avoid double free, choose one of the first and second free. Maybe remove the second one.
