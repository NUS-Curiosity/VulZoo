Subject: CVE request -- linux kernel: crypto: GPF in lrw_crypt caused by
 null-deref

Hello,

We would like to ask for a CVE-ID for the following security flaw.

The lrw_crypt() function in 'crypto/lrw.c' in the Linux kernel
before 4.5 allows local users to cause a system crash and a denial
of service by the NULL pointer dereference via accept(2) system call
for AF_ALG socket without calling setkey() first to set a cipher key.
