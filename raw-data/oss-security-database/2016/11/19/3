I wanted to point out that while it's good the buffer overflow gets
fixed, that's by far not the major issue here.

This is a very problematic design decision with the functionality of
tracker/GNOME that exposes all files on a system to who knows how many
decoders of probably overall very low quality.
Almost certainly there are countless other vulnerabilities of similar
kind in all kinds of gstreamer codecs. (and I haven't checked, but I
assume tracker also exposes other files to other equally problematic
decoders)

I think this is kinda a symptom of two goals clashing: We have projects
like gstreamer that attempt to parse every file format ever seen in
their are - which of course has some value, especially in terms of
preserving digital culture. But on the other hand exposing this code to
untrusted inputs is a security disaster.

I'm wondering if there is any statement or reaction from either gnome
or fedora on this.
