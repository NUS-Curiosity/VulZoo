Subject: Re: Re: CVE needed? / gnuchess 6.2.4 fixed user input
 buffer overflow

Thanks for pointing to -u / UCI mode.

I guess it does make sense to request/assign a CVE then.

The initial report seems to be by Antti Karjalainen at
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-chess/2015-10/msg00002.html .

Best, Sebastian
