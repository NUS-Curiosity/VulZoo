Subject: CVE request: libksba out-of-bouds read remote DOS issue fixed in
 1.3.4

libksba 1.3.4 was released with the following in NEWS:

> * Fixed two OOB read access bugs which could be used to force a DoS.

The first is http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=a7eed17a0b2a1c09ef986f3b4b323cd31cea2b64

> Fix possible read access beyond the buffer. > > * src/ber-help.c (_ksba_ber_parse_tl): Add extra sanity check. > *
src/cert.c (ksba_cert_get_cert_policies): Check TLV given length >
against buffer length. > (ksba_cert_get_ext_key_usages): Ditto. > *
src/ocsp.c (parse_asntime_into_isotime): Ditto. > -- > > The returned
length of the object from _ksba_ber_parse_tl (ti.length) > was not
always checked against the actual buffer length, thus leading > to a
read access after the end of the buffer and thus a segv. > >
