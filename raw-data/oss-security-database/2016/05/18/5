Use CVE-2016-4913.

This might have a threat model that is not often seen in vulnerability
reports. Is the issue somewhat similar to CVE-2014-9731, i.e., the
attacker only needs the ability to mount an isofs filesystem on an
already-running system -- either with physical removable media or
equivalent actions that may be relevant with virtualization -- and
then the attacker obtains the ability to read from some unintended
(but not arbitrary) kernel memory locations? Also, is the severity of
CVE-2016-4913 much greater than that of CVE-2014-9731, because the
amount of kernel memory is much larger and because CVE-2016-4913
affects essentially every Linux release (as long as CONFIG_ISO9660_FS
was used)?

Are there also plausible scenarios with a DoS impact, but they are of
less concern because the information leak is much more important in
almost all realistic cases? (For example: possibly someone has a
long-running root process that tries to maintain a searchable index of
all files on all user-mounted isofs filesystems, and that process
stops because the code sees invalid readdir results.)
