Subject: CVE requested: two stack exhaustation parsing xml files using mxml

Hi,

We found two stack exhustation conditions that can easily crash mxml
when parsing an xml. Both issues are affecting versions 2.7 and 2.9
(and probably others):

* Recursion using mxmlDelete at mxml-node.c:217 (stack-exhaustion-1.xml)
* Recursion using mxml_write_node at mxml-file.c:2739 (stack-exhaustion-2.xml)

Found using QuickFuzz + Radamsa. Reproducers are attached.

Regards,
Gustavo.
