Use CVE-2016-4565.

As far as we can tell, this statement does not imply that there is a
remaining known vulnerability after
e6bd18f57aad1a2d1ef40e646d03ed0f2515c9e3 - instead, this statement
only suggests a possible functionality problem, e.g., there might be
third-party code or in-development code that was attempting to rely on
write calls for a legitimate purpose, and this code has now stopped
working without an immediate workaround.
