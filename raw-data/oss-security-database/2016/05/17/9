Subject: RHSA-2016:1086 libndp: denial of service due to insufficient
 validation of source of NDP messages

Dear all,

An improper input validation check, and improper origin check flaw during
the reception of NDP message was discovered in libndp. An attacker in a
non local network could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, and
cause a denial of service attack, or act as a man in the middle.

The patches enforce that hop limit must be 255, to ensure that the NDP
message
has not been routed.

Patches can be found upsteam:

 -  libndp: validate the IPv6 hop limit
https://github.com/jpirko/libndp/commit/a4892df306e0532487f1634ba6d4c6d4bb381c7f

 -  libndb: reject redirect and router advertisements from non-link-local
https://github.com/jpirko/libndp/commit/2af9a55b38b55abbf05fd116ec097d4029115839

Known affected packages : NetworkManager >= 1.0

Thanks to Julien Bernard (ViagÃ©nie) for discovering the issue

Kind regards,
