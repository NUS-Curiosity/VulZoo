Subject: CVE Request: libpam-sshauth: local root privilege escalation

Hi

Due to a programming error, libpam-sshauth returned PAM_SUCCESS where
it should fail with PAM_AUTH_ERR. This was fixed in Debian in the last
upload to unstable with the attached patch.

Introduced with:
https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ltsp-upstream/ltsp/libpam-sshauth/revision/93/src/pam_sshauth.c
Fixed by:
https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ltsp-upstream/ltsp/libpam-sshauth/revision/114

Could you assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
