Subject: CVE Request: Jansson: stack exhaustion parsing a JSON file

Hi,

A crash caused by stack exhaustion parsing a JSON was found. It affects, at
least version 2.5 as well as the last git revision. Technical details and a
reproducer are available here:

https://github.com/akheron/jansson/issues/282

This crash was found by QuickFuzz working with Radamsa (again caused the
extreme mutation). It was manually minimized later.

Regards,
Gustavo.
