FWIW, it was actually me and Mathias Bauer in 2004 (which may also
pre-date DJB's development, I don't know - certainly we didn't get the
idea from him, it was Mathias'). We looked at the PGP keyserver data,
but we didn't find anything very interesting, which is probably why
most people don't know it.

To be entirely fair, we did pairwise GCDs, which comes to the same
thing, but less efficiently...
