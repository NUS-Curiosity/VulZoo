Subject: CVE Requests: Linux: use-after-free issue for ppp channel

Hi all,
    The ppp channel did not take reference on its network namespace when 
it was registered and unregistered, which causes a use-after-free issue. 
Details:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/17/569
Fixed via:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1f461dcdd296eecedaffffc6bae2bfa90bd7eb89 


Could you please assign a CVE for this issue? Thanks.

Best Regards,
Baozeng
