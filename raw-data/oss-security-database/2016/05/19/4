Subject: CVE-2016-4441 Qemu: scsi: esp: OOB write while writing to 's-cmdbuf'
 in get_cmd

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the ESP/NCR53C9x controller emulation support
is vulnerable to an OOB write access issue. The controller uses 16-byte FIFO
buffer for command and data transfer. The OOB write occurs while writing to
this command buffer in routine get_cmd().

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
resulting in DoS.
