Subject: Fwd: CVE for PHP 5.5.36 issues

Hi,

Please assign CVE for the following issues, expected to be part of PHP
5.5.36
Code at http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/PHP-5.5

#72227 is a backport from upstream, so we'd prefer to reuse their CVE (if
already exists).
#72135 and 72114 are PHP 5.x only bugs.

Thanks,

Kaplan
