Subject: CVE Request Qemu: scsi: megasas: stack information leakage while
 reading configuration

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter 
emulation support is vulnerable to an information leakage issue. It could 
occur while processing MegaRAID Firmware Interface(MFI) command to read device 
configuration in 'megasas_dcmd_cfg_read'.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to leak host memory bytes.
