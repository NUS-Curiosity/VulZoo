Subject: CVE Request Qemu: scsi: megasas: out-of-bounds read in megasas_lookup_frame()
 function

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to read invalid memory 
leading to crash the Qemu process on the host.
