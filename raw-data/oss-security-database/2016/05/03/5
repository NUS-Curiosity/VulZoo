Thanks for assigning the CVE identifier.

It might be right that revision 93 cannot be considred the introducing
revision for the problem. By following the example as given in the
README.

https://sources.debian.net/src/libpam-sshauth/0.3.1-1/README/#L75

$ cat /etc/pam.d/testservice 
auth    required        pam_sshauth.so host=127.0.0.1 nostrict # or wherever
auth    required        pam_exec.so expose_authtok /usr/bin/ltsp-session
session required        pam_exec.so /usr/bin/ltsp-session
$ pamtester -v testservice root authenticate open_session close_session
pamtester: invoking pam_start(testservice, root, ...)
pamtester: performing operation - authenticate
Password: <anypassword>
pamtester: successfully authenticated
pamtester: performing operation - open_session
pamtester: successfully opened a session
pamtester: performing operation - close_session
pamtester: session has successfully been closed.

I want though to add the Debian maintainer for libpam-sshauth to more
accurately answer the raised questions, Vagrant Cascadian
<vagrant@...ian.org>.
