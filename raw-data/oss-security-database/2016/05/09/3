Subject: CVE-2016-3710 Qemu: vga: out-of-bounds r/w access issue

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

    Hello,

An out-of-bounds r/w access issue was reported in the Qemu emulator's VGA 
module.

Qemu VGA module allows banked access to video memory using the window at 
0xa00000 and it supports different access modes with different address 
calculations. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to exceed the bank 
address window and write beyond the said memory area, potentially leading to 
arbitrary code execution with privileges of the Qemu process on a host. 
(Important)

'CVE-2016-3710' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc. Patch attached 
herein fixes this issue.

This issue was discovered and reported by "Wei Xiao and Qinghao Tang of 360 
Marvel Team" of 360.cn Inc.

They have named this issue as - "Dark Portal"

Thank you.
