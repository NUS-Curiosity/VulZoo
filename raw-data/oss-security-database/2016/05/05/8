Are you sure?  Got an example?

I think the fingerprint was always a hash, with key id being last 32+
bits from it.  I think it is compatible with PGP 2.x's from 1990s.

Did I possibly miss some very early versions of GPG where this was not
true, transitioning from PGP 2.x to later GPG (which I did) and thus not
noticing this aspect?  (Just trying to see how your statement could
possibly be correct and consistent with my experience using PGP/GPG.)
