"V3 keys are deprecated.  They contain three weaknesses.  First, it is
relatively easy to construct a V3 key that has the same Key ID as any
other key because the Key ID is simply the low 64 bits of the public
modulus."

I had forgotten about that, but it probably also explains the two
pre-2000 keys with small factors I found.
