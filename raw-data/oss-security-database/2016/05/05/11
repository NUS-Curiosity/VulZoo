Even if these keys had valid self-signatures, that wouldn't imply anything
about whether they were generated by the people or organizations named
in the uids; anyone could generate a PGP key right now that claimed
to be yours or mine or anyone else's. That's why we have the "web
of trust", along with competing identity-claiming mechanisms like
keybase.io - the generated key wouldn't have (reputable) third-party
signatures, unless its generator was able to do some social engineering
to obtain them.

I would have expected that an attacker trying for things like evil32 would
want to have a valid self-signature, and the self-signature isn't magic
(it's just an ordinary signature made with the private certification
key as far as I know), so I'm a bit confused by why these "mirrored"
keys would lack them?
