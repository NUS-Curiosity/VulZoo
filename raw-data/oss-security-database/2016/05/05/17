> OPENAFS-SA-2016-002 - various client functionality leak stack data
> onto the wire in the clear
> 
> Several structures used as RPC arguments contain a mask field that
> indicates which other fields should be processed by the server. In
> some cases, fields not not indicated in the mask were transmitted over
> the network without being written to, exposing the previous contents
> of that memory. Both kernel stack and userspace stack data can be
> leaked.
