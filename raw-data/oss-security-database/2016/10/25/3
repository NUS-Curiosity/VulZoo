Hi,

it seems that firejail was affected by the same vulnerability, which was fixed
in 0.9.44 with https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/commit/46dc2b34f1fbbc4597
b4ff9f6a3cb28b2d500d1b

The commit log reuses the CVE-2016-7545 number, but I guess a new one should
be assigned since they don't share the same codebase?

Regards,
