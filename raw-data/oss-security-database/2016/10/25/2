Subject: membership request  to the closed linux-distros 

Hi, 

I sent membership request to the list for a while ago (on behalf of Enea) 
and got feedback/improvement suggestions from some members .  
We have gained some experience and improved our security works 
and security updates. We have infrastructure to handle embargoed issues. 
I would appreciate if you could re-evaluate our membership request.

I am a member of OPNFV security team:

I have been running CII Best Practices Badge program for OPNFV project:
https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects?q=opnfv 

I am also a member of Yocto/OpenEmbedded security team:
