Subject: Re: CVE assignment for PHP 5.6.27 and 7.0.12

Hi Adam,

On behalf of the PHP security team, I intend to request only one CVE.
(in addition to #73003 that, as you mentioned, already had CVE assigned by
libgd)

The rest of the bugs weren't assessed as "CVE needed". You're welcome to
contact
the PHP security list for further discussion.
