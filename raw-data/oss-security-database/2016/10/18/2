16 bugs marked as 'security' were fixed in php 5.6.27 of which only one has CVE assigned.
Here you request CVE for another one issue (even the documentation says it's unsafe to use
unserialize on untrusted input).

Are you planning to obtain CVEs also for other security bugs or do you treat the rest as
CVE-unworthy? Or are reporters/community supposed to do it?

Thanks!
