Subject: jasper: two NULL pointer dereference in bmp_getdata (bmp_dec.c) (Incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8690)

Description:
jasper is an open-source initiative to provide a free software-based reference 
implementation of the codec specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard.

Another round of fuzzing on an updated version (1.900.5) revealed that the 
previous issues, reported as CVE-2016-8690, are unfixed.

The complete ASan output:
