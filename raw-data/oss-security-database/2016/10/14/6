Subject: CVE request Qemu: dma: rc4030 divide by zero error in
 set_next_tick

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the JAZZ RC4030 chipset emulation support is 
vulnerable to a divide by zero issue. It could occur while computing its 
periodic timer's next tick value.

A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process instance 
on the host resulting in DoS.
