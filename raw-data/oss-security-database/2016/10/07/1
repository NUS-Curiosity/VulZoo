Subject: Re: librsvg and cairo are causing libpng to write out-of-bounds

The bug is not specific to librsvg.  This instance happens in
write_png inside cairo-png.c, but the actual bug is elsewhere.  Other
exploits probably exist using things other than PNG and SVG.  I think
this needs to be CVE'ed immediately.
