This is in reference to this Debian bug:

  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=839051>

I assumed it was a Debian-specific backporting problem, affecting only
the LTS branch of the previous (non-current) stable release.  It did
not occur to me that this was an independent bugfix which happened
upstream some time ago, and that affected software versions are still
widely deployed.
