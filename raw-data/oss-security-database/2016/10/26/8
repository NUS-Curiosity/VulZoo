Subject: Re: Re: librsvg and cairo are causing libpng to write out-of-bounds

A patch was recently proposed:

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=127421

thanks to John Bowler and his detailed analysis of this issue:

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98165

Can we have a CVE, now that we know it was an integer overflow and we have
a patch?

Regards,
Gustavo.
