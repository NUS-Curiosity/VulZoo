Can you provide further information about whether each of these issues
could have been fixed independently?

We are aware of:

  https://core.spip.net/projects/spip/repository/revisions/23200
  https://core.spip.net/projects/spip/repository/revisions/23201
  https://core.spip.net/projects/spip/repository/revisions/23202

and these seem to indicate separate findings related to three
items on your list. Thus, we can initially assign these IDs:

> * Cross-Site Request Forgery

Use CVE-2016-7980.


> * Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

Use CVE-2016-7981.


> * File Enumeration / Path Traversal

Use CVE-2016-7982.


Is your reported Server Side Request Forgery a completely separate
problem? Is it resultant from an authorization issue, e.g., possibly
the wrong users have access to XML validation:

  -   if (!autoriser('sauvegarder')) {
  +   if (!autoriser('webmestre')) {

and also XML validation could be performed through CSRF? In other
words, is valider_xml.php supposed to block everyone from performing
an XML validation of an off-site document, or is it only supposed to
have access control for this functionality?


> * Template Compiler/Composer PHP Code Execution

Is there public information about this already on an spip.net web site
(such as a Redmine revision) or the https://sysdream.com/news/lab/ web
site? Is this unrelated to the valider_xml.php script?
