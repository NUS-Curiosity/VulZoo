Thanks for the reference.  The corrected patch attached to
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734238#53 agrees with
my analysis.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu LTS seem to be still carrying the
original patch.  Possibly others, but these are the only ones I've
identified.

Yes:  the use of comp0size under-allocates buffers for components 1..N,
which are then overflowed in later processing.
