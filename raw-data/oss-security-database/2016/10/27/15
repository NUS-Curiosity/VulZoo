Subject: CVE request Qemu: 9pfs: memory leakage when creating extended
 attribute

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 
File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to memory leakage issue. It could 
occur while creating extended attribute via 'Txattrcreate' message.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to leak host memory, thus 
affecting other services on the host and/or potentially crash the Qemu process 
on the host.
