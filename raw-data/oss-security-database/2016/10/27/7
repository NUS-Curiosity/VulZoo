 Resources

CVE-2016-6797 Apache Tomcat Unrestricted Access to Global Resources

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M9
Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.4
Apache Tomcat 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.36
Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.70
Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.45
Earlier, unsupported versions may also be affected.

Description
The ResourceLinkFactory did not limit web application access to global
JNDI resources to those resources explicitly linked to the web
application. Therefore, it was possible for a web application to access
any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been
configured or not.

Mitigation
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M10 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.5 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.37 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.72 or later
  (Apache Tomcat 7.0.71 has the fix but was not released)
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.47 or later
  (Apache Tomcat 6.0.46 has the fix but was not released)
