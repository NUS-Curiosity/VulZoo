Subject: CVE Request: libgd: Stack Buffer Overflow in GD dynamicGetbuf

Hi

On the PHP bug tracker Emmanuel Law reported a flaw in the libgd
library in dynamicGetbuf. The PHP bug report is at (cannot quote the
full report for the list archive, sinc a bit long):

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=73280

It has been reported upstream apparently (not via the issue tracker)
and fixed in upstream as with commit:

https://github.com/libgd/libgd/commit/53110871935244816bbb9d131da0bccff734bfe9

Debian has issued a DSA containing this fix as well in DSA-3693-1,
https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2016/msg00274.html

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
