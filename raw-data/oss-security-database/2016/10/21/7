Subject: Re: Requesting membership to linux-distros

It looks like CoreOS is shipping Linux and respecting the various licenses
in a volume sufficient to make sense for them being given access to the
Linux distros list, and shipping security updates (I would say they could
benefit from shipping advisories, but they put the CVE's in the ChangeLog
so I really can't complain). Assuming they can handle embargoed issues (do
you have private bug tracking/code repos/CI/whatever else you need to ship
an update?) I would have no objections to them joining the Linux distros
list. Can you confirm you have infrastructure to handle embargoed issues?
If yes I guess it's up to Solar to add you.
