We believe it is fine as is. The two issues could be fixed
independently, although it is unlikely that anyone would do that:

                        if (numcmpts == 3) {
                                jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[0], j, red);
                                jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[1], j, grn);
                                jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[2], j, blu);
                        } else {
                                jas_matrix_setv(cmpts[0], j, red);

394 is the first "red" line; 398 is the second.

In future cases, if you have additional analysis suggesting that two
findings are best represented with one CVE ID, then please include
that additional analysis in your first posting about the issue.
Otherwise, we often won't know, and there could be a perception that
the number of assigned IDs is inconsistent. Here, neither
https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/10/18/jasper-two-null-pointer-dereference-in-bmp_getdata-bmp_dec-c-incomplete-fix-for-cve-2016-8690
nor http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/10/18/5 explicitly
says that "two NULL pointer dereference" ought to have one CVE ID.
