Subject: CVE request Qemu: audio: intel-hda: infinite loop in processing dma
 buffer stream

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Intel HDA controller emulation support is 
vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing the DMA 
buffer stream while doing data transfer in 'intel_hda_xfer'.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to consume excessive CPU 
cycles on the host, resulting in DoS.
