Subject: CVE request -- linux kernel: nfs: kernel panic occurs at nfs client
 when nfsv4.2 migration is executed

Hello,
If possible, we would like to obtain a CVE-ID for the following issue which we
believe is a security one. I was not able to find an already-assigned CVE-ID
for this.

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the NFSv4.2 migration code that can cause
a panic of the NFS client due to improperly initialized kernel structure.
