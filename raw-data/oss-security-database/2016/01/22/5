Yes. At one time ECC looked good because it offered comparable strength with 
fewer operations so it was faster in the age of slower CPUs. Now, the threat 
has changed and people are looking over the not too distant future at how best 
to provide some resistance in the face of a very different landscape. Things 
that are computationally expensive start looking better. The slide on page 9 
kind of shows the concern. The leftover part of rectangle X not covered by 
rectangle Z means spilled secrets.

To my mind, one of the things that we as an open source community need to 
think hard about is how we are going to protect data in the Quantum computing 
age. If many of the new QR algorithms get patented, where does that leave us? 
Its kinda like ECC all over again except this time the consequences are much 
more dire because there may not be any IP unencumbered algorithm to jump to. I 
certainly hope that won't be the case.
