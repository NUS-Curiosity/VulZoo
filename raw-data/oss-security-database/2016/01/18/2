...What's, in your opinion ofcourse, the wrong thing about
implementing RSA in a decent web application? PHP is used for much,
much more than building simple frontpages without a backend (where
this might be a senseless complication). RSA is still the way to go
about implementing accessible asymmetrical crypography...

I do agree, wholeheartedly, that building your own cryptographic
primitives is just an expensive way of ultimately fooling yourself.

Just wondering...


All the best,


Bart

PS:
All this bashing on PHP really tires me - it's getting old and
redundant. And no - im not a PHP developer.
