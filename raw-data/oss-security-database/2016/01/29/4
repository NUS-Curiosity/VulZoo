I hope you'll forgive me making a modest proposal here, but it seems
to me that there might be an opportunity here for Linux distributions
that are upstream of IoT vendors to modify their default configuration
to address this.

My somewhat off-the-cuff suggestion would be to...

1. Add an *additional, secondary* IPv6 address to external interfaces that is:
-> a. generated in accordance with the IPv6 Privacy Extensions (i.e. RFC 4941)
-> b. firewalled by default against all traffic except NTP in either direction

2. Configure the NTP *client* to use this secondary address as the
source for outgoing NTP traffic, instead of the default address?

...thereby avoiding revealing the primary address of the host to
would-be scanners?

I realise that that is a rather drastic approach, and might be too
bold a change for Debian or RHEL, but perhaps in the case of
distributions like Raspbian which focus on IoT, it might be tenable?


Cheers,

Hazel
