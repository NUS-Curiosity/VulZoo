Subject: CVE Request: WordPress: cross-site scripting vulnerability fixed in
 new 4.4.1 release

Hi

On 6th of January 2016, a new release of WordPress was posted,
https://wordpress.org/news/2016/01/wordpress-4-4-1-security-and-maintenance-release/

> WordPress versions 4.4 and earlier are affected by a cross-site
> scripting vulnerability that could allow a site to be compromised.
> This was reported by Crtc4L.

There is no reference to the fix, but the change seems to be

https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/36185

Cf. as well https://twitter.com/brutelogic/status/685105483397619713

Can a CVE be assigned for this WordPress issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
