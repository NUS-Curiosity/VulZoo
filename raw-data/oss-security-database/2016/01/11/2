Subject: CVE request: Arbitrary search execution in ruby gems auto_select2
 <0.5.0 and auto_awesomeplete <=0.0.3

Another RubySec contributor noticed this --
https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/pull/227

The auto_select2 and auto_awesomeplete Gems for Ruby contain a flaw that is
triggered when handling the 'params[:default_class_name]' option. This
allows users to search any object of all given ActiveRecord classes.
