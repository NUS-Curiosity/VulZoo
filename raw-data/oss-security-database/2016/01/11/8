Subject: CVE Request: click


Hi MITRE, all,

A vulnerability was discovered in the click package system:
https://launchpad.net/bugs/1506467
http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2771-1/

It was fixed in 0.4.42 with:
https://code.launchpad.net/~cjwatson/click/audit-missing-dot-slash/+merge/274554

This is an input sanitization bug where click assumed leading paths were always
prefixed with './' which, for example, allows a crafted click to ship a '.click'
directory to manipulate the click install process.

Can we get a CVE for this?

Thanks!
