Subject: Linux kernel: use after free in keyring facility.

Gday,

It was reported that possible use-after-free vulnerability in keyring facility, possibly leading to local privilege escalation was found. The function join_session_keyring in security/keys/process_keys.c holds a reference to the requested keyring, but if that keyring is the same as the one being currently used by the process, the kernel wouldn't decrease keyring->usage before returning to userspace. The usage field can be overflowed causing use-after-free on the keyring object.

This was introduced in commit 3a50597de8635cd05133bd12c95681c82fe7b878.

Perception point reported this vulnerability to Red Hat and it has been assigned CVE-2016_0728.
