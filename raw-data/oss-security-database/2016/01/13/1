Tried it. Too much output to be of any use. With complaints like
I: [group_writable] /home/dave/home/dave/.gnupg/pubring.gpg is owned
  by user dave (group dave) and is group-writable (-rwxrwx---)
W: [setgid] /usr/lib64/kde4/libexec/kdesud is setgid (root, nogroup):
  -rwxr-sr-x
W: [setuid] /usr/bin/su is setuid (root, root): -rwsr-xr-x

With 152149 lines going to stdout on my system, a quick skim of the
output doesn't show anything useful. I don't see anything in the
output that it's complaining about, that isn't as it should be.
