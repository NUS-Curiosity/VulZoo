Why is version 5.3 not affected?

The change appears to have been introduced in

http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/clientloop.c.diff?r1=1.211&r2=1.212

https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/c5564e1c4c41ae9af96973e2996e2a4285acbae8#diff-de6290efbc1504e2b727aee24e88db02

on 2009-05-28.

OpenSSH 5.3 appears to have been named in
https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/cd6b1a27cbb9400565811f908ca536937d875b8f
on 2009-06-30.

I also see:

$ ssh -V
OpenSSH_5.3p1, OpenSSL 1.0.0-fips 29 Mar 2010
$ ssh -o UseSomeBogusOption=yes `hostname` date
command-line: line 0: Bad configuration option: UseSomeBogusOption
$ ssh -o UseRoaming=no `hostname` date
Thu Jan 14 09:27:24 PST 2016
$ 

which suggests that OpenSSH 5.3p1 at the very least _knows_ about the
UseRoaming option.
