Indeed. It's also assuming no other major breakthrough happens (whether
it's in maths, moore's law or anything else)...

but here we are talking about making recommendations towards replacing
legacy crypto we suspect^wknow to be broken, in practice, in the real
world, today.

I think that it's very important to keep the message simple: use bigger
(possibly standardized) groups, of at least X bits. The BSI thinks that
X should be greater than 2048 bits and so do I.
