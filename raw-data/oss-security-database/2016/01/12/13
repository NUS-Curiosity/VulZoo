====================================================================
OSSA-2016-002: Xen connection password leak in logs via StorageError
====================================================================

:Date: January 11, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2015-8749


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: >=2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, == 12.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Matt Riedemann from IBM reported an information disclosure
vulnerability in Nova. If a StorageError occurs when attempting to
connect a volume using the Xen API, the connection parameters will be
logged. These parameters may include credentials that are not masked.
An attacker with read access to Nova logs could use these credentials
with the Xen API directly. Only Nova deployments using the Xen backend
are affected by this flaw.
