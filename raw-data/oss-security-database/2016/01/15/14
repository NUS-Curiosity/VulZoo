FYI, this issue was announced as a security fix in 7.1p2 release notes:

https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2016-January/034680.html

However, as the fix was not actually included in 7.1p2, the
release-7.1p2 announcement as available on the url listed above was
modified to remove mention of that issue.
