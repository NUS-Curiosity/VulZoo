This will change in glibc 2.23, stdio will use regular malloc and free
for its buffers.  I did not expect this change to have security
implications.  Considering that the actual bug lies elsewhere, and stdio
usage is based on copying out of the buffer (so leaks can still happen
elsewhere), I do not wish to revert this change.
