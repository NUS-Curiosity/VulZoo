Subject: Security issues in GOsa

Hi,

GOsa is a framework written in PHP for LDAP-based management of  
intranet infrastructures.

As part of upstream (I joined the team recently) I would like to make  
you aware of (at least) two security issues +/- recently discovered:

(1) Possibility of code injection when setting passwords for Samba.  
Solved upstream:
https://github.com/gosa-project/gosa-core/commit/a67a047cba2cdae8bccb0f0e2bc6d3eb45cfcbc8

(2) XSS vulnerability during session log on. Solved upstream:
https://github.com/gosa-project/gosa-core/commit/e35b990464a2c2cf64d6833a217ed944876e7732

Please assign individual CVE Ids for both issues, if appropriate.

Thanks,
Mike
