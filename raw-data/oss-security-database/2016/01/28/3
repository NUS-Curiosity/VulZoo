If the issue is 'port scanning by the IPv6 NTP pool participant', why bother?

Any IPv6 NTP pool provider will naturally have peer IPv6 addresses to use and
record. It's one way that researchers at measurement organizations already
track IPv6 use and growth.

Others can, do, and will use popular public services like NTP to enumerate and
record active peer addresses as well. And some of those others will do things
with that data.

A policy that says "do not log peer addresses" would be nice for privacy
reasons, and bad for maintenance reasons. Practically speaking, violations
will be undetectable, and it'll be unenforceable.

Maybe a policy that says 'do not engage in DoS' instead?

Either way, when we don't want to be scanned, regardless of how the scanner
gets their target addresses, we tend to use perimeter firewalls.
