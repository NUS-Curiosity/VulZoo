Subject: CVE request Qemu: char: use after free issue in char backend

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the 'chardev' backend support is vulnerable to 
a use after free issue. It could occur while hotplug and unplugging the device 
in the guest.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash a Qemu process on the host 
resulting in DoS.
