Subject: CVE request: Linux panic on fragemented IPv6 traffic (icmp6_send)

Hi,

The linux kernel contains a bug where a fragmented IPv6 packet causes a
panic after a timeout (seems to be roughly 60 seconds). This can be
triggered remotely via the internet and results in a DoS (kernel panic).

Details: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189851

This is fixed by commit 79dc7e3f1cd323be4c81aa1a94faa1b3ed987fb2

    net: handle no dst on skb in icmp6_send

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=79dc7e3f1cd323be4c81aa1a94faa1b3ed987fb2

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue?

Florian
