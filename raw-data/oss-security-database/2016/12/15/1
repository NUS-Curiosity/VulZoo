Subject: CVE Request: Game Music Emulators: incorrect emulation of the SPC700
 audio co-processor of SNES: arbitrary code execution via malformed SPC music
 file

Hi

As reported by Chris Evans via

http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.de/2016/12/redux-compromising-linux-using-snes.html

Incorrect emulation of the SPC700 audio co-processor of the Super
Nintendo Entertainment System allows the execution of arbitrary code
if a malformed SPC music file is opened.

Debian released a DSA for this issue (in the qemu-music-emu source
package):

https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2016/msg00318.html

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue.

Regards,
Salvatore
