   The item in the next History.610 file should resemble:

 - In ZipInfo ("-Z", /ZIPINFO) short-format ("-s", /SHORT, default)
   reports, an unexpectedly large compression method value (>999) caused
   a (mostly harmless) buffer overflow, and spoiled the report format.
   Now, values less than 1000 are displayed as before, using a
   three-digit decimal format, "uDDD", but larger values are displayed
   using a four-digit (unlabled) hexadecimal format, "XXXX".

   No.  We've been thinking about it, though.

   Swell.  (One fewer thing I need to know.)

>  Thanks again!

   Same to you (plural).
