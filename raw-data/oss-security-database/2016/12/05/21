> had some findings (1 medium, 4 low)

Here are 4 CVE IDs; it is not a one-to-one mapping.

> Finding 1: Incompatible declarations for external linkage function deflate (Medium)
> Fix: https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/3fb251b363866417122fe54a158a1ac5a7837101

We feel that the scope of CVE should, ideally, omit unexploitable
code-quality issues. The PDF report has a number of comments about
Finding 1; however, one comment is "current compilers process this
code without issues." A finding can be important to the practice of
software development without being important for vulnerability
management. For now, the answer is that there is no CVE ID.


> Finding 2: Accessing a buffer of char via a pointer to unsigned int (Low)
> UNRESOLVED:This issue remains under discussion

There is no CVE ID. The PDF report mentions, for example, "There are several
possible fixes ... Do nothing."


> Finding 3: Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in inftrees.c (Low)

> https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/6a043145ca6e9c55184013841a67b2fef87e44c0

Use CVE-2016-9840.


> https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9aaec95e82117c1cb0f9624264c3618fc380cecb

Use CVE-2016-9841.


> Finding 4: Undefined left shift of negative number (Low)
> Fix: https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/e54e1299404101a5a9d0cf5e45512b543967f958

Use CVE-2016-9842.


> Finding 5: Big-endian out-of-bounds pointer (Low)
> Fix: https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/d1d577490c15a0c6862473d7576352a9f18ef811

Use CVE-2016-9843.
