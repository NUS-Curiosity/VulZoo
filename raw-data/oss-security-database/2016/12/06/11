Subject: CVE request Qemu: 9pfs: memory leakage via proxy/handle callbacks

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 
File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to memory leakage issue. It could 
occur via its '9p-handle' or '9p-proxy' backend drivers as they do not free 
their respective allocated data objects.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to leak host memory, thus 
affecting other services on the host and/or potentially crash the Qemu process 
on the host.
