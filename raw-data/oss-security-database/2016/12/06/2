Subject: CVE request Qemu: display: virtio-gpu-3d: information leakage in

Quick Emulator built with the Virtio GPU Device emulator support is vulnerable 
to an information leakage issue. It could occur while processing 
'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET' command.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak contents of the host memory 
bytes.
