> But cwd might be a part of an unrelated git repository

Can you clarify the threat model for this? Our understanding is
that .git/config is not really a part of a repository that is
controlled by a remote party, e.g., see the second paragraph of the
https://git-blame.blogspot.com/2014/12/git-1856-195-205-214-and-221-and.html
post.

Is either (or both) of these a valid interpretation of your report?

1. You are suggesting that there is a security problem in git because
the risks of an attacker-controlled config file are not documented
carefully enough. In other words, you want documentation such as
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html to
tell the user that they must not use a "repository specific
configuration file" that is writable by an untrusted local user.

2. You are suggesting that there is a security problem in tqdm because
the victim is not explicitly being told that they are executing a git
command, and thus they do not realize that there is a need to verify
that they have a safe cwd before proceeding.

If the latter, then do you mean that:

A. Anyone planning to explicitly enter "git log" from a shell prompt
is responsible for first verifying that the cwd is safe. It is a known
property of git that the cwd is critical to security.

B. No third-party product should ever be executing "git log" in an
unexpected context. Either the user must somehow be aware that a "git
log" may be executed, or else the product must somehow force the use
of a safe local directory. Otherwise, a CVE is needed for each such
product.
