Use CVE-2016-10060 for the issue fixed in 933e96f01a8c889c7bf5ffd30020e86a02a046e7.
Use CVE-2016-10061 for the issue fixed in 4e914bbe371433f0590cefdf3bd5f3a5710069f9.

Use CVE-2016-10062 for the fwrite issue in ReadGROUP4Image. This was
specifically noted at the beginning of issues/196, but not fixed in
either of these commits. It is not the same as the fputc issue in
ReadGROUP4Image.

If there is specific information about remaining vulnerabilities, then
more CVE IDs can be assigned.

We are not sure why a decision to suspend exception processing would,
by itself, fix a vulnerability. (There did not seem to be a fixed-size
data structure with storage demands that grew linearly with the number
of exceptions.) In bugs.debian.org/845213, the short problem
description at the beginning is "Avoid a DOS by better checking
overflow." We think this may be more closely related to the changes in
coders/viff.c and magick/memory.c.

Use CVE-2016-10066 for the issue in coders/viff.c.

Use CVE-2016-10067 for the issue in magick/memory.c.

At present there is no CVE ID for an issue in coders/label.c, because
we are unsure of whether 0474237508f39c4f783208123431815f1ededb76
fixes a vulnerability in that file.

Also, as suggested above, there is currently no CVE ID for an issue in
magick/exception.c.

There is currently no CVE ID for
f6e9d0d9955e85bdd7540b251cd50d598dacc5e6.

(There is no separate CVE ID for an issue in magick/memory-private.h,
although the magick/memory-private.h change is apparently needed in
conjunction with both the CVE-2016-10066 and CVE-2016-10067 changes.)

Use CVE-2016-10070 for b173a352397877775c51c9a0e9d59eb6ce24c455.

Use CVE-2016-10071 for f3b483e8b054c50149912523b4773687e18afe25.

We disagree. All of the CVE IDs for that were in the
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/06/02/13 post. In a
small number of the cases, Brian May made comments about "Not sure
if ... are security issues." We did not do any independent research to
ascertain whether there were vulnerabilities in those specific cases,
although anyone else is, of course, still welcome to do so. When all
we have is a "Not sure" statement from a reporter, we do not consider
it pending for CVE ID assignment.

Finally, there were three places in your post where an '=' in a URL
was apparently entered as '-' instead. We fixed those in the quoted
text above (bug-767240 and f-3&t-30797).
