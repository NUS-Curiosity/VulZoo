Subject: CVE Request - Exim 4.69-4.87 - disclosure of private information

Hello,

please assign a CVE ID

Product:    Exim
Versions:   4.69 -> 4.87
Impact:     Possible leak of private information to a remote attacker
Reference:  https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996 (placeholder currently)
Requester:  Heiko Schlittermann <hs@...littermann.de> (Exim Developer)

If several conditions are met, Exim leaks private information to
a remote attacker.

A patch exists and is under testing already.
Backports to older versions are under development.

As soon as the tests are passed we'll send an announcement
to the "Operating system distribution security contacts list" and
ask for packaging fixed versions.

    Best regards from Dresden/Germany
    Viele Grüße aus Dresden
