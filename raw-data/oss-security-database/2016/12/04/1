This has later on been reported upstream, as
https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-11483 . Upstream believes that
this is not a vulnerability, but a superadmin able to use a feature as
intended. Cf. 

https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-11483?focusedCommentId=202709&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-202709
and
https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-11483?focusedCommentId=202789&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-202789

As such this might be actually be REJECTed. Martin and CVE assigning
team from MITRE, does this look correct? Should the CVE be rejected
instead?
