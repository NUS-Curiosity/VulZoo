could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote attackers to achieve
remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and
remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the SwiftMailer class.

Despite the significant efforts in responsibly disclosing the vulnerability
to the vendor (since 2nd December).
The vulnerability remains unfixed as of 28 December.
