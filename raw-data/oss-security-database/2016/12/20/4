Subject: Nagios Core < 4.2.2 Curl Command Injection leading to Remote Code
 Execution [CVE-2016-9565]

Vulnerability:
Nagios Core < 4.2.2  Curl Command Injection / Remote Code Execution

CVE-2016-9565

Discovered by: Dawid Golunski (@dawid_golunski)
https://legalhackers.com

Severity: High

Nagios Core comes with a PHP/CGI front-end which allows to view status
of the monitored hosts.
This front-end contained a Command Injection vulnerability in a RSS feed reader
class that loads (via insecure clear-text HTTP or HTTPS accepting self-signed
certificates) the latest Nagios news from a remote RSS feed (located on the
vendor's server on the Internet) upon log-in to the Nagios front-end.
The vulnerability could potentially enable remote unauthenticated attackers who
 managed to impersonate the feed server (via DNS poisoning, domain
hijacking etc.), to provide a malicious response that injects
parameters to
curl command used by the affected RSS client class and effectively
read/write arbitrary files on the vulnerable Nagios server.
This could lead to Remote Code Execution in the context of www-data/nagios user
on default Nagios installs that follow the official setup guidelines.
