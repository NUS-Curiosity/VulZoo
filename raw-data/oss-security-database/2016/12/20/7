Subject: CVE request: ikiwiki: authorization bypass when reverting changes

Reference: http://ikiwiki.info/bugs/rcs_revert_can_bypass_authorization_if_affected_files_were_renamed/
Vulnerable versions: < 3.20161219
Fixed versions: >= 3.20161219
Fix: http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commitdiff;h=9cada49ed6ad24556dbe9861ad5b0a9f526167f9

ikiwiki is a static site generator with some dynamic features,
used for wikis, blogs and other websites.

intrigeri discovered that on sites with the git and recentchanges
plugins and the CGI interface enabled, the revert links on the
RecentChanges page could revert changes on a page the logged-in user
cannot legitimately edit, if the change being reverted was made before
the page was renamed from a location that the logged-in user *could*
legitimately edit.

Please allocate a CVE ID for this vulnerability.

Thanks,
