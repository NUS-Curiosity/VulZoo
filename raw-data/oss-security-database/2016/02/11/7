Subject: STARTTLS for this list?

Hi all,

Not sure if anyone saw, but gmail has been rolling out UI indicators for
MTAs which don't use TLS:

I was surprised to see this indicator on mail from oss-security. Does
anyone know who has the keys to `list.openwall.com` so they can turn on
STARTTLS for outbound email?
