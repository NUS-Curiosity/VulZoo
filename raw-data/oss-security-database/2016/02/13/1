Subject: Thoughts about security of Linux distributor collaboration platforms,
 bugtrackers for opensource software

Hello List,

As just written in a mail to another list, this might also be
interesting for discussion here.:

As it would be the most natural thing for e.g. NSA, China, ... (those
with capabilities to monitor large amount of network traffic) to just
record all mails from large-scale Linux distribution collaboration and
issue tracking systems containing the keyword "security", and as this is
very cheap way to get to near-zero day material, I would assume, that
this is already done. This is like serving them zero days on a golden
plate.

Hence really critical security material perhaps should not go to such
platforms, e.g. Ubuntu Launchpad, or the platform should be modified to
send security issues only in encrypted mails without talkative title,
members without mail public key registered should get only message "Bug
[Number]: Info changed" including the HTTPS link to the issue in the
platform.

What do you think?

Does someone have a link to anyone having access to the selector lists
leaked by Snowden to ask them, which of the distros are already in scope
or otherwise to discard this e-mail as pure paranoia?

Kind regards,
hd
