That is true, so the distros list can be proud to have adopted a
secure procedure already. But at least some of the issues going to be
communicated on distros list were handled in various bug tracking and
collaboration platforms up to the point, that severe security impact
is confirmed. I would guess that quite a number of issues stays in
that state for about 2-6 month before making it to distros list and
beginning of the maximum 2 weeks final embargo time.

Data communicated in the final 2 weeks is secured but I am worried
about the 6 month centralized, structured and unencrypted
communication before that, which might be not so hard to tap into.
