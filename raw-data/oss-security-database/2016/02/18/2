Is there a response from the author of the code indicating that this
is a vulnerability? Open redirects to http/https are not universally
considered vulnerabilities for all vendors and products, e.g.,

  https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/open-redirect

is probably the most well-known counterargument.


>     http://graphiteSite/account/update
>         POST: nextPage=https://www.google.com

What is the threat model for this open redirect issue that requires a
POST request? Often, an attacker's ability to make a client submit a
POST request with an attacker-controlled parameter means that the
client is executing JavaScript code from an attacker-controlled site,
and in that case the JavaScript can send the browser to an arbitrary
http/https URL without any realistic ability of the client user to
predict that that might occur. Is there a way in which the existence
of http://graphiteSite/account/update helps the attacker to accomplish
the redirect?

> Also, inside the logout and update functions, the session should be checked.

What vulnerability are you reporting here? Are /account/logout and
/account/update vulnerable to CSRF?
