We found this wording to be somewhat confusing, but we believe we
understand what was meant, so the CVE ID is included below.

Essentially, we think "attacker being able to present a certificate
chain with a certificate issued by one trusted certificate authority,
and additionally including the pinned certificate authority" was
intended to state "attacker being able to present a certificate chain
with a certificate issued by one trusted certificate authority, and
additionally include the pinned certificate." The use of "including"
instead of "include" in that sentence seemed to imply that "including
the pinned certificate authority" was a phrase describing the server
end-entity certificate: that would not make sense.

Use CVE-2016-2402.
