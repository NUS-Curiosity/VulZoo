That means, it causes effective DoS with "ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap"
(as it's called by Firefox) for approx. 60% of all sites.

In most cases, HTTPS is either misused or abused. But the ${subject}
does both misuse and abuse: it forces HTTPS even for unauthenticated
connections (are there any real reasons to use HTTPS instead of E2EE
for protecting the information which is publicly available?), while
not making any use of a clients' certificates.
