Subject: Re: CVE request -- linux kernel: visor: crash on invalid USB device descriptors in treo_attach() in visor driver

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> A local kernel crash on invalid USB device requiring the visor driver was reported.
> The treo_attach() function of the [visor] driver, which is called during the driver
> initialization process, was dereferencing the bulk-in and interrupt-in urbs without
> first making sure they had been allocated by the core. Due to an incomplete sanity
> check, the visor driver tries to dereference null-pointers, which results in crash.

We don't really understand "An upstream patch" here. We think you mean
the patch is
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cac9b50b0d75a1d50d6c056ff65c005f3224c8e0
instead. In any case, use CVE-2016-2782 for the reported treo_attach
vulnerability.

We're not going to change or expand the meaning of CVE-2015-7566
several weeks later.
