Subject: CVE Request: bash-completion: dequote command injection

Marcelo Echeverria and Fernando Muñoz discovered that the dequote
function included in bash-completion allows to execute arbitrary
commands since it uses the eval function to call printf and perform
the actual dequoting. bash-completion is included on Debian, Ubuntu
OpenSuse [1] and probably other distros.

# type dequote
dequote is a function
dequote()
{
    eval printf %s "$1" 2> /dev/null
}

# dequote ';id'
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

- Issue reported to maintainers on 24/02/2016 [2]

While researching we noted that this security problem was first
identified on 2014 [3] however nobody reported the issue to
bash-completion at that time.
