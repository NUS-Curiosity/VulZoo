(Just for simplicity, the following comments only mention PHP 7.x -
there may be analogous statements about PHP 5.x. This does not mean
that a PHP 5.x issue from 71488 has a different CVE ID.)

Use CVE-2016-2554 for the issue that was fixed in the 7.0.3 release.
We understand that this was in the:

  http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=07c7df68bd68bbe706371fccc77c814ebb335d9e

commit. This commit has most of the changes that were made in
ext/phar/tar.c between the 7.0.2 release and the 7.0.3 release. There
was also a change from "if (entry.filename_len == UINT_MAX)" to "if
(entry.filename_len == UINT_MAX || entry.filename_len == 0)" that may
be unrelated.

The "2016-02-01 15:01 UTC" comment in 71488 seems to discuss an
additional concern. If there is a remaining vulnerability that was not
fixed in 7.0.3, that vulnerability is not covered by the CVE-2016-2554
ID.
