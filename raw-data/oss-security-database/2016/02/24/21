Subject: Re: CVE Request: bash-completion: dequote command injection

Hello Eric,

I never mentioned privilege escalation.

This issue how ever could appear when a different application uses
user input and calls "dequote" function that not only dequotes, but
also executes it as a command. If mitre doesn't consider it CVE worth,
that's OK!

Regards.
