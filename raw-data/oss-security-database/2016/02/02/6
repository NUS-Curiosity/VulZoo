This was sent to the oss-security list as a published advisory, not as
a CVE ID request. We would expect that one or more parties (e.g.,
Linux distributions) are planning to re-announce this to a different
audience in a way that would make at least one CVE ID especially
useful. Our question is about whether anyone needs two CVE IDs.

A CVE ID must be for a specific vulnerability (although we realize
that the CVE ID may often be used to track the update). Here, there
can be a CVE ID for the "was not prime" finding in the sense that p is
supposed to be prime, and a non-prime value is an implementation error
regardless of any other details of the situation. With the currently
published information, we do not see a way to generate a second CVE ID
for something related to "no indication of how these parameters were
chosen" or "cannot be ruled out."
