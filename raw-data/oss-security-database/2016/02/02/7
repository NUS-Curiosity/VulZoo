This was sent to the oss-security list as a published advisory, not as
a CVE ID request. Is there anyone (e.g., a Linux distribution) who is
planning to re-announce this to a different audience in a way that
would make a CVE ID especially useful? Note that there will be a
CVE ID for the simultaneously released "security advisory 7."

At this point, the MITRE CVE team does not see a realistic
exploitation scenario (for security advisory 8) that would be best
categorized as a socat problem that requires a socat CVE ID. For
example, "a CGI script that reads data from clients and uses (parts
of) this data as hostname for a Socat invocation" might be better
categorized as an SSRF vulnerability in that CGI script (and
potentially site-specific unless such a CGI script already exists in
packaged code).
