Subject: CVE Request: graphite-web: open redirect

Hello,

I found and reported an open redirect vulnerability in graphite-web. 
Through this vulnerability an attacker could redirect to a legitimate user to a malicious website. 

https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/issues/1441

Can you assign a CVE for this issue?


Regards,
