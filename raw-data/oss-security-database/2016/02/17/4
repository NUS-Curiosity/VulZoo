 Source, Python)

Obviously you never read https://httpsonly.github.io/

1. The "Other Interesting Tools" section has tools to easily switch
proxy of your browser(FoxyProxy, etc). You want HTTPS-Only internet,
that's what this tool does; you want normal internet, just click that
FoxyProxy icon(yes, it's really easy).

2. The "What HTTPS Doesnâ€™t Do" section has very clear words about
HTTPS limitations. Even though it's from US government, it's actually
very clear words.

Best Wishes,
