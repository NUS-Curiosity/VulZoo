My immediate assumption was that an unprivileged user could leave
something lying around that root could complete on.

Within bash-completion, most of the uses of dequote are to find a config
file so there'd be a degree of social engineering to persuade root to
use a config file of your choice.   The other main use seems to be in
_parse_help() and _parse_usage() which parse gnu-style help and
bsd-style usage respectively and that might not need as much social
engineering to exploit.  I didn't investigate further.

Whether or not this turns out to be exploitable at all in
bash-completion, I do agree with Kurt though.
