Subject: Socat security advisory 7 - Created new 2048bit DH modulus

Socat security advisory 7 - Created new 2048bit DH modulus

Overview
  In the OpenSSL address implementation the hard coded 1024 bit DH p
  parameter was not prime. The effective cryptographic strength of a key
  exchange using these parameters was weaker than the one one could get by
  using a prime p. Moreover, since there is no indication of how these
  parameters were chosen, the existence of a trapdoor that makes possible
  for an eavesdropper to recover the shared secret from a key exchange that
  uses them cannot be ruled out.
  A new prime modulus p parameter has been generated by Socat developer
  using OpenSSL dhparam command.
  In addition the new parameter is 2048 bit long.
