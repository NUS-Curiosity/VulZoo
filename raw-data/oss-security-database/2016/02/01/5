Socat security advisory 8 - Stack overflow in parser

Overview
  A stack overflow vulnerability was found that can be triggered when
  command line arguments (complete address specifications, host names,
  file names) are longer than 512 bytes.
  Successful exploitation might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the socat process.
  This vulnerability can only be exploited when an attacker is able to
  inject data into socat's command line.
  A vulnerable scenario would be a CGI script that reads data from
  clients and uses (parts of) this data as hostname for a Socat
  invocation.
