Subject: CVE Request: Linux: ALSA: usb-audio: double-free triggered by
 invalid USB descriptor

Hi

There is a double-free flaw in the ALSA USB MIDI driver:

> The 'umidi' object will be free'd on the error path by snd_usbmidi_free()
> when tearing down the rawmidi interface. So we shouldn't try to free it
> in snd_usbmidi_create() after having registered the rawmidi interface.

This was fixed in https://git.kernel.org/linus/07d86ca93db7e5cdf4743564d98292042ec21af7

Could you assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
