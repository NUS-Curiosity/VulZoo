That's my current feeling, too - for this mailing list at this time.

You're right - as discussed before, it does not, because of DMARC.
(This applies to senders from google.com and some other Google domains,
but luckily not yet to senders from gmail.com.  However, recipients at
gmail.com are also affected whenever someone posts from google.com.
Also, Yahoo's free e-mail and a few others are affected.)

Working around this is actually planned (especially as Google intends to
extend this to Gmail senders).  STARTTLS currently is not.

It's a combination of scripting and manual message moderation.  There
are occasional mistakes (I posted about a badly delayed wrong-charset
message not so long ago), but they are few (at least that I'm aware of).
I think we manage pretty well, considering that most messages arrive to
the list within minutes.

Right.  And supporting TLS, even if only client-side, also adds to the
server's attack surface.  That said, we might be forced to, eventually.

I am actually in favor of opportunistic encryption in general.
