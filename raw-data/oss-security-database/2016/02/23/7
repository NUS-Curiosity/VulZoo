Just for the record, pt_chown is not enabled by default in upstream glibc
starting with glibc-2.18, one has to specify --enable-pt_chown configure
option explicitly to build pt_chown.

glibc documentation clearly states that "the use of pt_chown introduces
additional security risks to the system and you should enable it only
if you understand and accept those risks":
