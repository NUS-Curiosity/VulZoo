Thank you.  This public disclosure is very late, though.  I didn't
realize you were still holding some of your findings on this.

I think pt_chown is only needed for legacy BSD pty's, and no longer
needed for Unix 98 pty's that Linux systems use these days.  Perhaps it
should be dropped from upstream glibc by now.  e.g. on Owl we haven't
been installing it SUID ever (as it was already legacy 15 years ago),
and we haven't been packaging it at all since 2005.

I think the primary fixes should be different: disable unprivileged user
namespaces by default, and drop pt_chown.

Ouch.  As you're aware, everything you report to distros must be made
public in at most 2 weeks.  Unfortunately, I didn't keep track of this,
and I don't recall if your report to distros included the detail you're
disclosing just today.  I thought you had already disclosed whatever was
on distros here:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/01/19/17

Now I see you were asking for advice on further handling of these issues
in there, and got no replies. :-(

I think going forward, you shouldn't make any use of the distros list,
and should post to oss-security right away.

In [0], "LKML" points to:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/1/22/7

Unfortunately, that archive of LKML is currently broken (doesn't display
the actual message to me), so I don't know what exactly this was.

I did, however, watch the discussion CC'ed to kernel-hardening, where
Kees Cook proposed "sysctl: allow CLONE_NEWUSER to be disabled":

http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/01/22/19
http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/01/22/20
http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/01/22/21

Unfortunately, this was NAK'ed by the maintainer, Eric W. Biederman:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/01/23/4
http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/01/25/11
http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/01/26/7

Eric suggested "a per user limit on the number of user namespaces users
may create".  There was some further discussion after that point, but no
clear outcome.  Last message posted on January 28.

If there's no clear decision upstream, distros must do what they must -
disable unprivileged userns ASAP, in whatever way they can.
