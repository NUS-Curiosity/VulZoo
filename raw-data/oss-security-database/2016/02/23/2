Subject: CVE Request: Linux: unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending
 process user_struct sockets

Hi,

A new (denial-of-service) issue was fixed in Linux introduced by the
commit 712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593[1], which was part of
commits to address CVE-2013-4312.

David Herrmann reported that the original commit "incorrectly
accounted the number of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the
original opener of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to
arbitrary deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the
maximum of open files."

This was fixed in 415e3d3e90ce9e18727e8843ae343eda5a58fad6[2].

Can you please assign a CVE for this issue?
