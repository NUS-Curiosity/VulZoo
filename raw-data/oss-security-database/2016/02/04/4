Hi

A new security and maintanance release for WordPress was announced,
which addresses two security issues:

https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/wordpress-4-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/

According to the announcement:
> WordPress versions 4.4.1 and earlier are affected by two security
> issues: a possible SSRF for certain local URIs, reported by Ronni
> Skansing; and an open redirection attack, reported by Shailesh
> Suthar.

Could two CVEs be assigned for the repspective issues?
