Subject: CVE Request: Open Source Media Center insecure default config

Hey all,

Using several other CVEs as an example (such as
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6850), I am
requesting a CVE for "OSMC: Open Source Media Center" default config.

1) Default user is osmc/osmc
2) SSH, and FTP are enabled by default, which osmc has access to
3) The interface does not require or request a password change for the
default user
4) osmc has full sudoers access and can gain root access via sudo

Thanks!

Zach W.
