Whoever wants to. It's public. Can you give me a real world example of this
BTW, or are we just worrying about things that pretty much never happen in
real life, but make for fun email threads?

Not clear what your question is.

Vendors can submit them, to get your DWF # officially in the database you
also need to be willing to post the artifacts. So that's the big carrot for
a lot of researchers (official recognition which they can then use on their
resume/etc.).

Well with CVE we've already crossed that bridge for the ones that care,
they (like Red Hat) post CVEs, the vendors that don't care, well, they'll
continue to not care until customers speak up. One hope I have is that
getting more identifiers for issues that researchers find will give
customers the data they need to make informed decisions and maybe pressure
companies into behaving better.
