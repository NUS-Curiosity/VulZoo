There is a group called VRDX-SIG:

  https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vrdx

An approach we are taking is to develop a simple cross-reference
protocol, such that any vulnerability ID can be related to any other
(e.g., equivalent-to, superset, subset, similar-to, not-equivalent).
This approach was chosen intentionally to avoid creating yet another
CVE-like system, but to support the expected fracturing of vulnerability
ID systems.
