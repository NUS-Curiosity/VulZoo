Then the next level is to require not only e-mail validation but also to
solve a captcha for creating a new account.

Or even harder, to require any account with less than 10 comments to
solve a captcha for any new comment. That way the annoyance for legit
users is temporal (up to the 10th comment), meanwhile for spammers is
not, because their account is probably going to be blocked before they
reach the 10th comment and have to start again with a new account.

I'm not saying that some level of moderation is required. Of course it
is. But I think that if proper antispam measures are implemented, then
the level of moderation required is relatively low, and can be done by
the bugzilla admins without much effort.
