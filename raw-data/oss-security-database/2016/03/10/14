Right, this is my thinking as well.  If you create very high barriers
to automated spamming, and protect against DDoS, then the level of
manual spam should be low enough that minimal moderation would be
required.  Of course you could also start white listing people who
have posted more than N approved comments, etc.  And apply some
bayesian filters on new postings from unknown people.  It's all
doable, and likely less work than what the CVE moderators have to do
now.  The hard work is building the system initially and finding a way
to get enough volunteers involved for distributed hosting and
moderation.
