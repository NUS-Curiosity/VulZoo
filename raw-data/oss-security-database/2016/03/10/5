Subject: CVE Request: PHP last release security issues

Hi,

PHP released a round of security updates, but no CVEs have apparently been assigned.

from http://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.0.4

	https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71610	Type Confusion Vulnerability - SOAP / make_http_soap_request()

from http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.19
and http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.5.33

	https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71498	Out-of-Bound Read in phar_parse_zipfile()
	https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71587	Use-After-Free / Double-Free in WDDX Deserialize

There are more bugs in the release announcements with trigger words like
integer overflow or use-after-free, but several if not all of those need
specific PHP code, so basically self-exploitation.

Perhaps the PHP security team can fill in if I missed some or one of the above is not an issue.

Ciao, Marcus
