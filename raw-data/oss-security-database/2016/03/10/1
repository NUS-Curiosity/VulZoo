I don't think you need that level of moderation if you implement basic
measures against spammers like requiring the creation of an account with
e-mail verification.

Just look to all the public bugzillas out there that allow commenting
(mozilla, webkit, redhat, gnome, etc). I don't think they have a problem
with spam. But you have to create an account first to do any comment.

Of course any account used for spam is blocked by the moderators. So the
spammer has to create a new one, which is just not worth the effort.
