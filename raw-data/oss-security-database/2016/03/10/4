Subject: CVE Request: Linux Kernel: Linux netfilter IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE memory
 corruption

Hi,

>From the P0 team at Google:

https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=758

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE ioctl in the netfilter code for iptables support. This ioctl is can be triggered by an unprivileged user on PF_INET sockets when unprivileged user namespaces are available (CONFIG_USER_NS=y). Android does not enable this option, but desktop/server distributions and Chrome OS will commonly enable this to allow for containers support or sandboxing.
...

I think this needs a CVE.

Ciao, Marcus
