And that's not the end of the story:

Unfortunately the fix by Seth Jennings for RHEL, later applied to
stable branches, was still incorrect, leading to CVE-2016-0774. I hope
AOSP picks up the second fix as well."

It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 incorrectly kept buffer
offset and buffer length in sync on failed atomic read, potentially
resulting in pipe buffer state corruption.

A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or
leak kernel memory to user-space.

Upstream Linux kernel is not affected by this flaw as it was introduced
by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux only fix for CVE-2015-1805.

The security impact of this issue was discovered by Red Hat."
