Subject: CVE Request: pcre: Segmentation fault on certain input to regular
 expressions with nested alternatives when JIT is used

Hi

In Debian the following issue was reported (test case contained)

https://bugs.debian.org/819050


On certain input when processed for regular expressions with nested
alternatives and JIT is used, pcre3 can segfault, affecting in this
case suricata leading to at least a denial of service.

The problem was addressed upstream with commit:
http://vcs.pcre.org/pcre?view=revision&revision=1475

Can you assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
