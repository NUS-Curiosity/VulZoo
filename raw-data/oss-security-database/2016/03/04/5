I think it's been said on this list previously -- these are two separate
activities:

1. Assigning IDs

2. Analysis, deconfliction, write-up

Binding these together results in delay, because #2 takes considerably
more calendar time and effort.  Another result is a limited but fairly
high quality set of entries (once #2 is complete).

I share Kurt's concern that CVE is not meeting a researcher/disclosure
use case of having IDs for vulnerabilities, and that the community will
at some point stop bothering with CVE.

I'm not sure how bad such an outcome would be, or what impact that would
have on CVE.
