 impact to researchers/companies

I agree. I've been in the same boat as Hanno. In one case, I even sent a
request to both oss-sec and cve-assign about an open source platform
called OSMC, and got a response off-list that was just like the one seen
in Kurt's original email. I asked for clarification and for them to
address both me and the list and I never got a response. That was over a
month ago.

I'm sure Hanno and I are not the only ones. Thank you Kurt for bringing
this up.
