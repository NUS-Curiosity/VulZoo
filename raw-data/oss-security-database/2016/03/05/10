... or on any third-party doing it.  I expect that various existing
vulnerability databases will start listing OVE IDs along with other IDs
they're currently listing.  Whatever IDs are available for an issue.

Of course, the information will need to be available to those
third-party databases from somewhere - but this can be the researcher's
or the vendor's disclosure, as you say.  Until such disclosure, a
customer would not even be aware of the ID, let alone want to look it up.

I think there is such opportunity, it's just possibly more difficult.

This sounds similar to what Tim wanted.  Feel free to implement that.
I think if such a thing appears, there may still be interest in a
bare-bones solution, which OVE currently is.  I have no current plans to
expand OVE into a more complete solution.

A drawback is that such requests become somewhat security-sensitive, if
for yet unpublished issues.  This is already a major concern with CVE,
where information may be subject to unjustified risk for the purpose of
merely getting an ID assigned.

OVE currently side-steps the issue.
