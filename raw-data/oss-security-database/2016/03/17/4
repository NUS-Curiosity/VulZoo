Subject: [cairo] Out-of-bounds read in _fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans

Hi,

There is an out-of-bounds read in _fill_xrgb32_lerp_opaque_spans in cairo
(crashing software that parses and renderizes a svg, for instance).
Fortunately, this vulnerability was fixed in the 1.14.2 release (
https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2015-March/msg00047.html).
The patch is available here:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/cairo/patch/src/cairo-image-compositor.c?id=5c82d91a5e15d29b1489dcb413b24ee7fdf59934

Please assign a CVE to this issue.

Regards,
Gus.
