Subject: CVE Request: The minissdpd (v 1.2.20130907-3) is affected by an
 improper validation of array index weakness

Hi everyone,

A vulnerability in the minissdpd daemon has been found that affects
minissdpd version 1.2.20130907-3 available in Debian and Ubuntu.
The vulnerability can be exploited by a local unprivileged user
with write access to /var/run/minissdpd.sock to crash the minissdpd
daemon that runs with superuser privileges.

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=minissdpd;dist=unstable.

Is there a CVE for this? If not, could one be assigned, please?

Regards,
Salva Peiró
