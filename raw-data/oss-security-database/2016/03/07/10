Seems like it would be a very simple change, if Mitre were willing
to do it, to have vulnerability reporters include an OVE or OVI
tracking number with every report.  That way, there would be
a number to track from the initial report, and still have the
benefits of a significant review for CVE identifiers.

If Mitre were willing to make it mandatory, I think that might
be best.  But even if not, that wouldn't prohibit researchers
from doing this, though it would be more ad-hoc.

Enjoy!
