Thanks for clarifying this.  For some reason I expected this to be about
the same issue.

Good to hear that!

Even so, I think a warning would have been appropriate.  The text issue
is a bit more surprising, as one might certainly expect that to be safe,
though a quick inspection of the code should be enough to know what's
going on.

Considering that it's been "fixed", I thought a CVE might be useful to
trigger distros to include the patch.  Without a CVE, distros like
Debian and RedHat will keep using the unpatched version, which is a
shame if such an easy fix is available.

Cheers,
Peter
