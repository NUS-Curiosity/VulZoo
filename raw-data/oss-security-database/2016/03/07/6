Hi,

just in order to second that: We have had similar experience with delays
and with rejections that
seemed random. Especially regarding vulnerabilities that did not fit
into existing vulnerability
classes or would require some amount of work to validate.
It seems to me MITRE currently wants to improve CVE quality but does not
have the resources
to do a real and fair validation.
In my mind having a globally accepted enumeration systems and unique
vulnerability
identifiers is more important than a small curated but outdated list of
selected vulnerabilities.

Therefore I would appreciate to move back to the old process where you
would request a CVE,
get it assigned - but with the possibility of revocation later. Or move
to a fully automated process
like OVE as proposed here before.
