  While I suspect there is virtually no situation whereby a service
 would allow the upload/processing of arbitrary awk in the wild, I
 do believe that no (semi)valid program should terminate the intepreter
 with a segfault.

  That is the reason why I believe that that it is worthy of an
 identifier.  Though I will avoid making future requests for similar
 issues if I'm alone in that belief!
