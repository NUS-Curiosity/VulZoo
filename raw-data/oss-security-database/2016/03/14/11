I brought this to the openssl team and they claim it is not a security issue.

This has been fixed in commit 5f57abe2b15 (master version, similar
commits in other branches):

    Sanity check PVK file fields.

    PVK files with abnormally large length or salt fields can cause an
    integer overflow which can result in an OOB read and heap corruption.
    However this is an rarely used format and private key files do not
    normally come from untrusted sources the security implications not
    significant.

    Fix by limiting PVK length field to 100K and salt to 10K: these
should be
    more than enough to cover any files encountered in practice.

    Issue reported by Guido Vranken.

As per the notes in the commit we do not see the security implications
as significant and therefore we are treating this as a bug and will not
be issuing a CVE.
