I don't see a security issue here.  It is just a bug.  In order for it 
to be a security issue, it needs to be caused by external data input 
into the program (e.g data processed by the awk script).  This would 
also apply to a network service which has a bug and crashes due to 
something other than specific external input (e.g. resource leak).
