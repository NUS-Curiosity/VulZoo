When used correctly..  SSLv2 is not.

While you certainly won't see me defending SSLv2 (I think we were the
first to delete it outright)
there are many other things that currently fall into that category..
I'm agreeing with your sentiment
but if you are to consider usage of SSLv2 as CVE worthy, then you will
need to do the same for SSH version 1,
among other things.   So while I certainly appreciate and even agree
with your sentiment, it seems rather timed
politically based on a decision made by one implementaiton of SSL/TLS
that reflects a decision made by most other
implementations long ago.   So far from me to say what CVE's should
and shouldn't be used for and issued for, but
if this is the road we're going down can I please have permission to
use your above quoted paragraph
with s/SSLv2/SSH V1/g to request a CVE for *usage or support* of SSH
version 1? You said it perfectly.
