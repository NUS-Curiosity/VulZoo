That is a perfect example actually. Telnet makes no security claims,
explicit, implied or otherwise. It's a simple clear text protocol. In fact
if you want to secure it you can use SSL enabled Telnet (in fact I remember
fighting with it prior to the wide spread existence of SSH and then
OpenSSH).

SSL and TLS both makes explicit and implicit claims about security, most
notably at a minimum:

1) the SSL/TLS protocols encrypt the and the data cannot be read by an
attacker
2) the SSL/TLS protocols ensure the data is not altered in transit by an
attacker without detection

Additionally depending on how you configure the servers there are claims
that you are talking to the correct server/client (e.g. using certificates)
but that is not germane to this discussion.

SSLv2 is obviously NOT capable of ensuring claim #1 (that data is encrypted
and cannot be read by an attacker), due to a wide variety of issues, and I
have no doubt more will be found if people keep looking. Hence my thinking
is that ANY and ALL use of SSLv2 is CVE worthy, especially when considering
that many devices/manufacturers are less than transparent about their
configurations/security issues.
