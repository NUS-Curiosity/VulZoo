Apparently, this vulnerability is being used to root older Android
devices, and as a result it has just been fixed for older Android:

https://source.android.com/security/advisory/2016-03-18.html

"Google has become aware of a rooting application using an unpatched
local elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel on some Android
devices (CVE-2015-1805).  For this application to affect a device, the
user must first install it.  We already block installation of rooting
applications that use this vulnerability - both within Google Play and
outside of Google Play - using Verify Apps, and have updated our systems
to detect applications that use this specific vulnerability.

To provide a final layer of defense for this issue, partners were
provided with a patch for this issue on March 16, 2016.  Nexus updates
are being created and will be released within a few days.  Source code
patches for this issue have been released to the Android Open Source
Project (AOSP) repository."

The advisory above includes a bit more information, including links to
AOSP commits, but no information on how the vulnerability is exploited,
nor even the names of the "rooting applications".

I heard of this from a tweet by @DaveManouchehri, asking for "the APK
(or name) of the app that's exploiting CVE-2015-1805" - unfortunately, I
have no answer.

The primary reason I am posting this is so that other distros know the
vulnerability was apparently shown to be exploitable.
