Most new Android devices are also vulnerable to it. The Nexus 6, 9, 5X
and 6P use 3.10, while older devices like the Nexus 5 use 3.4. There
isn't a Nexus device with 3.18, only the Pixel C and very few third
party devices.

Google's kernels aren't based on the upstream stable branches and they
missed this fix. They've surely missed a lot more too.
