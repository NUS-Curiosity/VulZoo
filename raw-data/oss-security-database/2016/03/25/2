Subject: [CVE-2016-0784] ZIP file path traversal

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache OpenMeetings 1.9.x - 3.1.0

Description:
The Import/Export System Backups functionality in the OpenMeetings
Administration
menu (http://domain:5080/openmeetings/#admin/backup) is vulnerable to path
traversal via specially crafted file names within ZIP archives. By uploading an
archive containing a file named ../../../public/hello.txt will write
the file “hello.txt”
to the http://domain:5080/openmeetings/public/ directory. This could
be used to, for example,
overwrite the /usr/bin/convert file (or any other 3 rd party
integrated executable)
with a shell script, which would be executed the next time an image
file is uploaded
and imagemagick is invoked.

All users are recommended to upgrade to Apache OpenMeetings 3.1.1
