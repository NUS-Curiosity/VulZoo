Quite, as much as I appreciate the options presented over the last few days, I 
don't think any of them are the winning horse.

(To paraphase) if MITRE does not exist then it must be reinvented however the 
days of multiple competing indexes of vulns should be avoided if possible. We 
only have to look at the AV community to see how that degenerates. This one of 
the main reasons that when we open sourced out disclosure tool kit, we 
explicitly mandated the use of CVEs for tracking.

As would I however, even with pointers from SC about who to poke within MITRE 
we came up short tracking a warm body down for (~7) months (even one that was 
willing to say no). That being said, we have now located a new warm body at 
MITRE who has made themselves known to us, I am more than happy to approach 
them about the following:

Indeed, such a project requires a vendor neutral host. If OWASP are up for it, 
then I would gladly support them running with the above proposal, if not then 
a good faith alternative ought to be sought.
