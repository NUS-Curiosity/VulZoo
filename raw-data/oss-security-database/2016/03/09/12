Even if Mitre had unlimited funding there will be a need for the community
to be involved, especially if we're going to make sure that CVE/DWF cover
important flaws (of which there are thousands right now, and we haven't
even dealt with the IoT or non english software markets like China....).

Putting on my info security economics hat:

And I suspect the solution to this is the same as Open Source, we scale
out, build a community and process that works and change as needed. DWF is
one such effort. We aim to reduce the cost of vulnerability identification,
and vulnerability coordination so that there's more less negative incentive
(cost in time and effort) to do this right.

As I've repeatedly stated the DWF wants to work with CVE/Mitre if possible,
forking vulnerability identification will create additional costs
(retooling all the systems and process that rely on CVE) so I want to
minimize that as much as possible, the goal is to make things better and
easier, not to add another standard for the sake of itself.
