It's simple. The winning horse is CVE. Or something that is fully CVE
compatible, like DWF.

To put it bluntly DWF is as close to 100% CVE compatible as it can be:

Numerically DWF can generally be mapped directly to CVE with no conflict,
if you spot a conflict between CVE and DWF please notify us so we can fix
it.

If you already have a CVE identifier you can map it directly to DWF, e.g.
CVE-2000-1234 maps directly to DWF-2000-1234.

Also the SPLIT/MERGE and general process for numbering authorities are
similar, if not nearly identical. I can say this with some authority having
assigned close to 5,000 CVE's =).

So to put it bluntly: good luck. In my role as  a Red Hat employee I'm on
the CVE Editorial board and I can't get answers out of them. I'm now
posting things like:

It's been over a week now with no reply from Mitre on anything:

Or better yet a community led effort, like DWF that is also willing to work
with Mitre (whether or not Mitre returns the favor remains to be seen).
