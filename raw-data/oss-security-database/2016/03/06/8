Right.

Oh, you (would) use an actual database backend?  OVE currently uses a C
program with a tiny binary data file (to keep track of per-IP and
per-netblock consumption of IDs, as well as the current date and ID),
and the file is wiped clean (by this same program) on first access after
midnight.  I wrote this yesterday in response to the thread in here.

For random IDs, if we wanted those, there are shuffling algorithms that
don't require storage yet guarantee unique numbers (until the target
range is exhausted) - they're good e.g. for IP ID and DNS sequence
numbers - although checking against an array of 10k numbers is almost
instant anyway (as far as this application is concerned).

Anyway, this is getting off-topic.
