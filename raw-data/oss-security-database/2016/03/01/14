I guess my confusion is: what would be the downside to assigning a CVE in
such a case, such a "false positive" would be easily explained ("yes we
support SSLv2, but only for use on closed network"[1]) but more to the
point by drawing a line in the sand of "SSLv2 is worth a CVE" we'd be much
more easily able to track which products are using SSLv2 by default (and
thus putting us at risk). From your web page "CVE is a dictionary of
publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures."

Does SSLv2 not pretty much exactly fit this definition now?

[1] which begs the question why they're even using SSLv2 but I digress =)
