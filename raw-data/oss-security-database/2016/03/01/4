Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Django security releases issued: 1.9.3 and 1.8.10

Today the Django team issued 1.9.3 and 1.8.10 as part of our security 
process. This releases address two security issues, and we encourage all 
users to upgrade as soon as possible.

Details are available on the Django project weblog:

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/mar/01/security-releases/

As a reminder, we ask that potential security issues be reported via 
private email to security@...ngoproject.com and not via Django's Trac 
instance or the django-developers list. Please see 
https://www.djangoproject.com/security for further information.
