Subject: Re: CVE's for SSLv2 support

Link to RedHat announcement:
https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/drown

I am trying to follow the scope of this issue.  RedHat says "TLS servers
which support SSLv2 are vulnerable".  Can't tell if this means that
services with SSLv2 capabilities are vulnerable or only ones with it
enabled.
