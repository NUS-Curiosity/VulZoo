 impact to researchers/companies

Hello List,

I have started to create a wiki page to go deeper on the ideas from

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/03/06/4

posted in this thread, but it is yet in the earliest phase (a mess). I
would give anyone willing to contribute full access to the wiki on

https://github.com/halfdog/DistributedCryptoenhancedVulnerabilityEnumeration/wiki

(hope github supports that).
