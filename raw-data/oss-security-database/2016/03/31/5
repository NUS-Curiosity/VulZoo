Subject: ext4 data corruption due to punch hole races

Hello,

Jan Kara fixed some issues in the Linux kernel with security implications.

https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=972174

"When punching holes into a file races with the page fault of the same
area, it is possible that freed blocks remain referenced from page cache
pages mapped to process' address space. Thus modification of these blocks
can corrupt data someone else is now storing in those blocks (which
obviously has security implications if you can trick filesystem into
storing some important file in those blocks).

This affects all the kernels where we support ext4 for writing. Relevant
fixes upstream are commits ea3d7209ca01da209cda6f0dea8be9cc4b7a933b,
17048e8a083fec7ad841d88ef0812707fbc7e39f,
32ebffd3bbb4162da5ff88f9a35dd32d0a28ea70,
011278485ecc3cd2a3954b5d4c73101d919bf1fa."

Please assign CVE(s).

Johannes
