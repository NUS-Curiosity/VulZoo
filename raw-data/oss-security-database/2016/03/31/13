> Tomas Hoger asked if CVE-2015-3152 is appropriate for re-use with the php
> mysqlnd interface:

No, the PHP ext/mysqlnd/mysqlnd.c code seems to be completely
unrelated to the code shown in the
https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/3bd5589e1a5a93f9c224badf983cd65c45215390
commit (and the code available from the
http://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-c/?version=6.1.2&os=src web
page), and thus the CVE ID should be different. Use CVE-2015-8838 for
this https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=69669 issue.

Incidentally, there typically aren't CVE IDs for reports such as
"MySQL clients have long had a --ssl option. Casual users may think
specifying this option will cause clients to secure connections using
SSL. That is not the case ... This behavior is clearly explained in
the manual ... this option is not sufficient in itself to cause an SSL
connection to be used" in the
http://mysqlblog.fivefarmers.com/2014/04/02/redefining-ssl-option/
post. In other words, if the only problem were that the product
documented behavior that hardly anyone wants, and omitted behavior
that would be much more useful, then a CVE ID generally shouldn't
exist. This case was different because, as mentioned in the
https://duo.com/blog/backronym-mysql-vulnerability post, other
documentation stated "MYSQL_OPT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT ... This
feature can be used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks." This was
misleading because enabling the certificate-verification code didn't
prevent the man-in-the-middle attacker from using a
cleartext-downgrade attack. Also,
http://mysqlblog.fivefarmers.com/2015/04/29/ssltls-in-5-6-and-5-5-ocert-advisory/
is arguably a vendor confirmation that the behavior was a MySQL
vulnerability, even though it was not on an official vendor web site.
https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2015-3152 was posted by
the CNA for this CVE.

http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php has the three vendor confirmations of
CVE-2015-8838 (the entries that mention bug #69669). We don't know
whether the unpatched mysqlnd.c code ever included misleading
documentation about the relationship between certificate verification
and man-in-the-middle protection, but that's not needed for a CVE
because of the obvious confirmation on the vendor's official site.
