Subject: CVE Clarification: Mysqlnd / CVE-2015-3152

Hello MITRE, all,

Tomas Hoger asked if CVE-2015-3152 is appropriate for re-use with the php
mysqlnd interface:
https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=143750829604598
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/07/21/7
Message-ID: <20150721215101.5b7c0a96@...hat.com>

This association is already made at e.g.:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/php5/+bug/1564388

I never saw a response to his question.

Can we re-use this CVE for the different codbase? If not, can one please
be assigned?

Thanks
