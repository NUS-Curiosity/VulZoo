Subject: CVE-2016-4451, CVE-2016-4475: Foreman organizations/locations API/UI
 privilege escalations

1) CVE-2016-4451: organizations/locations privilege escalation in
Foreman API

When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization, if
users know other organization id and have unlimited filters they can
access/modify other organization data. They just have to set the id as
API parameter.

Affects Foreman 1.7 and higher
Fix released in Foreman 1.12.0 and 1.11.3


2) CVE-2016-4475: privilege escalation in organizations/locations API and UI

When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization or
location, these are not taken into account in the API or parts of the
UI. This allows a user to view, edit and delete organizations and
locations they are not associated with if they have the requisite
permissions.

Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
Fix released in Foreman 1.12.0 and 1.11.4


Mitigation for both vulnerabilities: make sure you have filters
restricted to organizations or locations when you limit user by
assigning them to particular organizations or locations.
