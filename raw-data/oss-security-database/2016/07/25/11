CVE-2016-4995: Foreman information disclosure through unauthorized
template previews

Users who are logged in with permissions to view some hosts are able to
preview provisioning templates for any host by specifying its hostname
in the URL, as the specific view_hosts permissions and filters arenâ€™t
checked.

If the organization or location features are enabled, the user will
still be restricted to their associated orgs/locs.

Affects Foreman 1.11.0 and higher
Fix released in Foreman 1.12.1 and 1.11.4
