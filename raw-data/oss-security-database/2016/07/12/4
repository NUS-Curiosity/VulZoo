Subject: CVE Request: libgd: Out-Of-Bounds Read in function read_image_tga of
 gd_tga.c

Hi

Another issue was reported in the libgd issue tracker, an
out-of-bounds reads in read_image_tga in gd_tga.c:

https://github.com/libgd/libgd/issues/248

Pull request: https://github.com/libgd/libgd/pull/251

Upstream issue contains a reproducer for the issue and Ondřej Surý
confirmed that this is not a duplicate of issue #247. Could you assign
a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
