This isuee affects the CHICKEN egg "spiffy-cgi-handlers", which is an
optional add-on to add CGI and FastCGI support to the Spiffy web server.
Could I have a CVE for this issue?

All versions before 0.5 are affected.  An announcement was made to
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2016-07/msg00000.html

The spiffy-cgi-handlers code was part of the spiffy web server before
version 5.0, so earlier versions of that egg were also affected.  Strictly
speaking, I think this deserves another CVE because it's a different
piece of software.

I believe this affects the CHICKEN egg "http-client", when used in a CGI
context when the calling server unsafely passes "Proxy" as "HTTP_PROXY".
Could I have a CVE for this issue as well?

It affects http-client versions before 0.10 (the very first version, 0.1,
is not affected because it had no proxy support).

An announcement for this is included in the message at the
aforementioned URL.
