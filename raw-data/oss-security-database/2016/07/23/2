Subject: XSS vulnerability in ILIAS before version 5.1.3, 5.0.11 and 4.4.14

A cross-site scripting vulnerability in ILIAS <http://www.ilias.de>
(Integrated Learning, Information and Work Cooperation System) version
5.1.2 has been found by Quadas.

Impact:

    This remotely accessible vulnerability is always reproducible and
    possibly works in any version before 5.1.3, 5.0.11 and 4.4.14.
    An attacker can supply java script code in the filename of an
    uploaded file, which will be executed in browsers of other users. It
    is not
    required to open this file. Browsing into the folder will trigger
    the code execution.

Exploit:

  * log in
  * open a folder you can upload a file to
  * select the "upload files"-dialog
  * drop a random file in
  * write code (e.g. JavaScript) in the filename
  * upload file

    From this moment the code will run on any user's web browser who
    opens the folder you uploaded the file in.


Patch:

    Vulnerability was fixed with version 5.1.3, 5.0.11 and 4.4.14.
    Ticket-ID was 0017977 but unfortunately the ticket was set on
    private view status. Link to the ticket
    <http://www.ilias.de/mantis/view.php?id=17977> (account is required)
    Surprisingly there are no commits on GitHub
    <https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS>.


Can a CVE-ID be assigned please?
