Subject: Re: cve request: systemd-machined: information
 exposure for docker containers

Actually this package oci-register-machine is called as a hook and could
be used by runc, or

as Jesse points out placed in
/usr/libexec/oci/hooks.d/oci-register-machine, Red Hats patched

version of docker will execute the hook and register with machinectl. 
This same  behaviour happens

with any container tool that registers with machinectl including
systemd-nspawn, libvirt-lxc and maybe

lxc tools.  The question is whether or not this is information that
should not be available to non privileged

users on a system or not.  The information is not available to processes
inside of a container unless they can

talk to systemd. 


Lennart is wrong when he states that this only effects "user"
containers, any container that registers with

machinectl, will have this information revealed to non privileged user
processes.
