Subject: CVE Request Qemu: virtio: infinite loop in virtqueue_pop

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio framework is vulnerable to an 
infinite loop issue. It could occur if the guest was to set the I/O descriptor 
buffer length to be zero. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw 
to potentially crash the Qemu instance on the host resulting in DoS.
