Let me quote Lennart Poettering:

---
machined is a system service and is for registering containers running
on the system. There's no concept of "user containers" with that, and
unprivileged users do not have the privileges to even register any
containers with machined.

If you ask me the CVE is complete and utter rubbish. At least against
systemd. If Docker knows a concept of user containers, then good for
them, but in that case they shouldn't register them with machined
really, if they are not supposed to be visible on the host.

Generally though I think the CVE is without merit entirely, after all
"ps" is generally unrestricted, and hence you can always see container
processes running on the host anyway.
---

In my opinion I would say you shouldn't use this call if you don't want
an information leak. Even if systemd would fix the output of 
`machinectl status ..`. The information leak would still be there
because you could still see informations about the container with `ps`
 or other tools. systemd is not designed for 'user containers'. 

If yo have further questions. I would say that you ask the
systemd-developers on their mailing list directly.
