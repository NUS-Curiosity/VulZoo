I do not know, there was no info on the discovery method in the report.

I looked at other projects to see what is being done to prevent this
particular loop from happening. Until now, tools I checked are protected
either by detecting the loop (i.e.: actively searching for a relative
offset of 0 for the next EBR, as done by this util-linux patch; partprobe
and fdisk are doing that), or enforcing a limit on the maximum number of
partitions for a device (Linux kernel, kpartx & other tools I currently
checked)
