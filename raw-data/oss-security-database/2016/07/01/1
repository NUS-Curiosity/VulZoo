>      Affected Vendor: SQLite/Hwaci
>      Affected Product: SQLite
>      Affected Version: All versions prior to 3.13.0
>      Platform: UNIX, GNU/Linux
>      CWE Classification: CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory
>                          with Incorrect Permissions
>      Impact: Data Leakage
>      Attack vector: Local

Release notes say:
> Change the temporary directory search algorithm
> <http://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html#tempdir> on Unix to allow
> directories with write and execute permission, but without read
> permission, to serve as temporary directories. Apply this same
> standard to the "." fallback directory. 


The covering commits seem to be:

http://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/67985761aa93fb61
Change the temporary directory search algorithm on unix so that directories with only -wx permission are allowed. And do not allow "." to be returned if it lacks -wx permission. 

http://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/b38fe522cfc971b3
Fix the fix to the temporary directory search algorithm so that it continues to return "." as a fallback if that directory has the correct permissions. 

http://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/614bb709d34e1148
Fix the temporary directory search algorithm for unix so that it fails gracefully even if all candidate directories are inaccessible. This fixes a bug that was introduced by check-in [9b8fec60d8e].


Can a CVE please be assigned for this issue?

Thanks,
Andreas
