Subject: Re: On anonymous CVE assignments

I'm hoping to make this better with the DWF by including more meta data in
the CVE data (e.g. affected products/versions) which will make it much
easier to automate notification in the future (e.g. "if affected product ==
php then email security@....net" or whatever). Part of the problem is that
for an org like MITRE or the DWF to do all the coordination around security
issues (as opposed to straight up CVE assignments) is highly labor
intensive and difficult to scale.

Also if projects don't like "Surprise" CVEs one way to deal with that is to
request the CVE's themselves when they know something is a security
vulnerability. Also making it easy to contact them helps, the harder you
make it for a security researcher to deal with you, the less likely they
are to.
