Subject: CVE request: Information leak in LibTIFF

Hello oss-security,

I would like to request a CVE number for an information leak in LibTIFF,
specifically in the file libtiff/tif_read.c.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a negative index into the
file-content buffer and copy data from that position until the end of the
buffer.

This will allow an attacker to crash the process by accessing unmapped
memory and (depending on how LibTIFF is used) might also allow an attacker
to leak sensitive information.

The issue is fixed in CVS HEAD with the commit:

revision 1.49
date: 2016-07-10 20:00:21 +0200;  author: erouault;  state: Exp;  lines: +6
-3;  commitid: YhOZoKv5OA9gNNdz;
* libtiff/tif_read.c: Fix out-of-bounds read on
memory-mapped files in TIFFReadRawStrip1() and TIFFReadRawTile1()
when stripoffset is beyond tmsize_t max value (reported by
Mathias Svensson)
