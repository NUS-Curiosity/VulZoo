Subject: CVE Request: openshift-node is logging private RSA keys to the
 systemd journal

Hi,

I stumbled on https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/3951 , which was found by Adam Miller,
but he didn't request a CVE id. The vendor (Red Hat) told me to request the 
CVE on oss-sec since the issue is public since a while.
