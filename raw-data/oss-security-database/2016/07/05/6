Subject: CVE Request: libgd: global out of bounds read when encoding gif from
 malformed input with gd2togif

Hi

The following (older) issue in libgd's issue tracker can be found,
with possible security impact for applications using the libgd
library. If I see it correctly this is not an issue in the gd2togif
utility but in the library. It was reported upstream as:

https://github.com/libgd/libgd/issues/209

with the fix

https://github.com/libgd/libgd/commit/82b80dcb70a7ca8986125ff412bceddafc896842 (gd-2.2.0)

Could you assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
