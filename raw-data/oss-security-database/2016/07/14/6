Subject: Re: Multiple Bugs in OpenBSD Kernel

It appears that me using HTML emails may have made the attachments unreadable on the web interface or for some users. Apologies. Here are the attachments again in a plaintext email.

I would also like to note (thanks to tj@...nbsd for pointing this out!) that with regard to the bugs requiring kern.usermount:

“these bugs are now root-only in -current since the kern.usermount option
was disabled and will be removed entirely. may be worth a mention on your
write-up. https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=146851081629533&w=2”
