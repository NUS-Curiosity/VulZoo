Subject: CVE request: Qemu: net: buffer overflow in stellaris_enet emulator

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the Luminary Micro Stellaris Ethernet Controller is 
vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue. It could occur while receiving network 
packets in stellaris_enet_receive(), if the guest NIC is configured to accept 
large(MTU) packets.

A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on a host, 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-04/msg01334.html

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1325884

This issue was discovered by Oleksandr Bazhaniuk of Advanced Threat Research 
team at Intel Inc.

Thank you.
