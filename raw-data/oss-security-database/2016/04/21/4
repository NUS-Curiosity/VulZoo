Before proceeding with CVE ID assignment, we have some questions. We
understand from your many reports of issues in other products that
there is a realistic attack scenario in which a Trojan horse
uxtheme.dll might already be present in the user's Downloads directory
before the user downloads/launches a GnuPG installer file (such as
gnupg-w32cli-1.4.20.exe or gnupg-w32-2.1.11_20160209.exe from the
https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/binary web site).

1. Is this a vulnerability in code that was developed specifically for
GnuPG, or is it a vulnerability in a third-party product that was used
to create the GnuPG executable installer files?

2. You refer to "the installers application directory" - this is
terminology that you have used in other reports about other products.
Can you confirm that this commonly means a Downloads directory or
%TEMP% -- and does not mean the %PROGRAMFILES%\GNU\GnuPG directory? In
other words, "installers application directory" seems potentially
ambiguous because %PROGRAMFILES%\GNU\GnuPG is the default application
directory that is created by the installer.

3. Would it be better to consider this a vulnerability in any web
browser, or other HTTP client, that defaults to saving all downloaded
executable files and DLL files into a single Downloads directory? At
least on Windows, if the user has chosen to download a .exe file,
perhaps the default behavior should make that .exe file the only file
in a directory, and that directory should be created in a safe
location and with safe permissions.
