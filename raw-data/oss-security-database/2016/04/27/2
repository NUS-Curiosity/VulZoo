Subject: CVE Request: Out-of-bands write issue found in qemu

Hi,

The qemu has an out-of-bands bug in uart_write() function.

In uart_write() function from hw/char/cadence_uart.c, the ‘offset’ isn’t checked and after it is divided by 4 and used to index the ‘r’ array, it will cause an out-of-bands memory write. The value can be controlled by guest and can cause the qemu crash or code execution on host.

The patch is here:

Thanks,
