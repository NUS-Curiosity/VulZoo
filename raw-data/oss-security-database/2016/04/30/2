Subject: CVE request - Quassel IRC denial of service

Hi,

It was found that quasselcore is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack by unauthenticated clients. The protocol negotiation did not
take into account lack of a match, in which case
PeerFactory::createPeer returns a nullptr, which is immediately
dereferenced [1].
This issue was introduced in commit d1bf207 [2] (version 0.10.0 and
later), and fixed in commit e678873 [3] (tagged as version 0.12.4).

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue?
