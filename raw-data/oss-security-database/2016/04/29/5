Subject: CVE request: three issues in libksba

Hi,

Can CVEs please be assigned to these three issues (unless they've
already been assigned and I failed to find them):

Denial of Service due to stack overflow in src/ber-decoder.c
http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=07116a314f4dcd4d96990bbd74db95a03a9f650a

Integer overflow in the BER decoder src/ber-decoder.c
http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=aea7b6032865740478ca4b706850a5217f1c3887

Integer overflow in the DN decoder src/dn.c

A Gentoo advisory lists them as being fixed in version 1.3.3 and higher:
