Subject: CVE Request: imlib2: integer overflow resulting in insufficient heap
 allocation

Hi

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered an integer overflow in imlib2, which
result in insufficient heap allocation. The upstream fix is in

https://git.enlightenment.org/legacy/imlib2.git/commit/?id=7eba2e4c8ac0e20838947f10f29d0efe1add8227

Can you assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
