We feel that this should not have a CVE ID because the removed curl
and wget options had been intentional behavior. In other words, the
vendor was not particularly interested in ensuring that the client was
communicating with the correct web site. That required relying on
third parties (maintainers of curl and wget) to maintain certificate
data. Instead, the vendor was interested in whether the client was
downloading the correct file. Achieving that can be independent.
