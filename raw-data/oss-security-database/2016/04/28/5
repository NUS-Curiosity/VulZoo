I imagine that the MITRE folks are busy with higher-priority requests.

I think you're confusing notifying the community and obtaining CVE IDs.
It does make perfect sense for you to be notifying the community even if
you're not receiving CVE IDs promptly (or at all).  If you need some IDs
for tracking, please feel free to obtain and self-assign OVE IDs, and
include those right in your initial notifications to oss-security:
