Subject: [CVE Requests] PHP issues

Hi folks,

There are flaws which are various type (heap corruption, heap
overflow, Uninitialized pointer)  in PHP from previous version we
might miss.

1. Heap corruption in tar/zip/phar parser
https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71354

2. Uninitialized pointer in phar_make_dirstream()
https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71331

3. Multiple Heap Overflow due to integer overflows | xml/filter_url/addcslashes
https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71637


Those 2nd, 3rd may let attackers with crafted PHAR file could
potentially remote code execute without specific PHP script.

Could we assign CVE for these ? :)
