Subject: CVE requests: DoS in librsvg parsing SVGs with circular definitions

Hello,

Two DoS in librsvg 2.40.2 parsing SVGs with circular definitions were found
(they will produce stack exhaustion). Other versions can be vulnerable too.
They affect the following functions:

* rsvg_cairo_pop_discrete_layer - rsvg_cairo_pop_render_stack -
rsvg_cairo_generate_mask: reproducible using circular-1.svg
* _rsvg_css_normalize_font_size: reproducible using circular-2.svg

Both reproducers are attached in a tar.gz to avoid a crash in my own
browser.  Fortunately, these issues are solved in the last git revision of
librsvg2.

Regards,
Gustavo.
