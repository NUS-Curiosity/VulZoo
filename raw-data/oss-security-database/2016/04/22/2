Right.  less has the -U option to prevent that.  And yes, it's too many
options to remember, unfortunately.  Safe(r) use of less was previously
discussed here:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/09/03/9

To view untrusted text files, use "less -nU".  Instead of "tail -f", use
"less -nUEX +F".  Setting up aliases may help.

This assumes that your distro didn't setup a script in LESSOPEN that
would do something dangerous for the given filename/suffix.
