Subject: CVE Request: jq: stack exhaustion using jv_dump_term() function

Hi,

A crash caused by stack exhaustion parsing a JSON was found. It affects, at
least version 1.5 as well as the last git revision. Technical details and a
reproducer are available here:

https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues/1136

This crash was found by QuickFuzz working with Radamsa (that caused the
extreme mutation)

Regards,
Gustavo.
