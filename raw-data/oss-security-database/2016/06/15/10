Is there something about this vulnerability that makes it a Nautilus
vulnerability? From the stack trace you quoted, this looks like a
generic libtiff vulnerability that would affect any user of libtiff
equally, with Nautilus' role in this vulnerability merely being a
convenient user of libtiff that's easy to point at potentially
untrusted files?
