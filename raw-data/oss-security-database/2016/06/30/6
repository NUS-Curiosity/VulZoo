Subject: CVE Request: A read out-of-bands was found in the parsing of TGA
 files using libgd

Hi,

A read out-of-bands was found in the parsing of TGA files using the
last revision of libgd (a6a0e7f) but older versions can be affected. A
reproducer and some technical details are available here:

Regards,
Gustavo.
