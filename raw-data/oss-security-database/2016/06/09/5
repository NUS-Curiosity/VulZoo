Subject: CVE Request: haproxy remote denial of service via reqdeny

Hi,

This is a remote denial of service against haproxy (uncontrollable crash).

http://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy-1.6.git;a=commit;h=60f01f8c89e4fb2723d5a9f2046286e699567e0b

The problem was apparently introduced in haproxy 1.6.0, and is fixed in git (which will become 1.6.6).

Ciao, Marcus
