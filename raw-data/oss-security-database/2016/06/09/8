What you are saying is all valid on paper. But when you move to the
uarch level, the techniques we are using are very specific --- rdtsc
and clflush instructions, paired with targeted malicious performance
degradation techniques. When you take away these tools, it really
complicates things for an attacker.

This is more of an interesting research question that would take maybe
six months to definitively answer.
