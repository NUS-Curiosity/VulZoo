Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Neutron

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Neutron IPTables firewall anti-spoof protection bypass
Reporter: Romain Aviolat (Nagravision) and
          Dustin Lundquist (Blue Box Group, Inc)
Products: Neutron
Affects: <=7.0.4, >=8.0.0 <=8.1.0

Description:
Romain Aviolat from Nagravision and Dustin Lundquist from
Blue Box Group, Inc independently reported vulnerabilities in Neutron
anti-spoof protection. By forging DHCP discovery messages or non-IP
traffic, such as ARP or ICMPv6, an instance may spoof IP or MAC source
addresses on attached networks resulting in denial of services and/or
traffic interception. Moreover when L2population isn't used, other
tenants attached to a shared network are also vulnerable. Neutron
setups using the IPTables firewall driver are affected.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1558658 (mac, dhcp)

Note:
The dhcp fix has been included in the 8.0.0 release and this
request probably needs more than one CVE.

Thanks in advance,
