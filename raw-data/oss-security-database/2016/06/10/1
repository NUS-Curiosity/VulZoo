Subject: CVE Request: IKEv1 protocol is vulnerable to DoS amplification attack

Hi,

I would like to request a CVE for the protocol flaw in IKEv1, details below:

https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/419128
https://blogs.akamai.com/2016/02/ikeikev2-ripe-for-ddos-abuse.html

While the reporter says that IKEv1 and IKEv2 both are affected, we have
reasons to believe that IKEv2 may not be affected:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1308508#c2

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this?

Thanks!
