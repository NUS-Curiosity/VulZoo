Note, testing with valgrind show that after the out-of-bounds reads,
there is an out-of-bounds write too.  The issue is triggered by a
file name length of zero in an internal data structure.  This cases
the code to do operations on a buffer returned by malloc(0), first a memory
access, then a memory write and finally a lstat().

I've send the valgrind output and a patch to fix it to
<URL: http://bugs.debian.org/815965 > and upstream.

I have no idea if the issue is a security issue, though.  I could not
come up with a way to use the unwanted reads and writes for anything
interesting.
