Then you should pull the CVE-2016-5361 which deals with retransmission amplification in IKEv1

 We are maintaining the
> CVE-2016-5361 ID assignment for the upstream announcement of "libreswan 3.16 vulnerable to DDOS attack. Please upgrade to 3.17"

That statement on the libreswan website is clearly referring to CVE-2016-3071 not CVE-2016-5361.

 and

Which again clearly refers to CVE-2016-5361 and not CVE-2016-3071

So again, please fix CVE-2016-5361 or drop it.
