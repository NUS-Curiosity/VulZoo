Subject: CVE Request: Dnsmasq denial of service

Hello,

I don't believe this issue has a CVE:

 Fix crash when an A or AAAA record is defined locally,
 in a hosts file, and an upstream server sends a reply
 that the same name is empty. Thanks to Edwin Török for
 the patch.

Could a CVE please be assigned to it?

Thanks,

Marc.
