Subject: Re: CVE-2016-2178: OpenSSL DSA follows a non-constant
 time codepath for certain operations

Whilst there is a commit in openssl and a CVE ID, I wonder why this hasn't
been announced yet by OpenSSL.org and why there are no official fix
releases (yet).
What made this issue different to the usual coordinated disclosures being
practiced with the OpenSSL team?
