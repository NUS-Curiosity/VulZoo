Yes, we confirm that. (They are unanticipated both because of
thread-safety concerns, and because it's possible for an application
to have an important dependency on srand being called exactly once.)

Use CVE-2016-5300 for the separate issue in which the original choices
of entropy source and RNG did not properly address the possibility of
a successful hash DoS attack. In other words, the code changes (in the
next release) to fix CVE-2016-5300 are needed because the original fix
for CVE-2012-0876 was insufficient. (We use separate CVE IDs when
follow-on work is needed to complete the solution to the same original
vulnerability finding.)
