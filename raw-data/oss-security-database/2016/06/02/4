Subject: CVE request: DoS in phantomjs 2.1.1 rasterizing websites

Hi,

A denegation of service vulnerability was found in phantomjs when it
is processing a particular svg file. This crash caused by a null
pointer derreference can be easily used by a malicious website to
avoid rasterizing when it is crawled using phantomjs 2.1.1. Previous
versions like 1.9.x are not affected. A reproducer is available here:

https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/14244

Please assign a CVE if suitable.

Regards,
Gustavo.
