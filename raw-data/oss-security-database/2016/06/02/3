Subject: CVE Request: bad USB host adapter implementation can corrupt
 memory/brick machine

Hi,

reported here:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=146480770532266&w=2

issue is that the Frescologic device id 1009 host controller apparently
has a broken XHCI STREAMS implementation which would lead to memory corruptions

Redhat might have already assigned a CVE.

I am not sure if this is controllable for code execution, but at least USB devices can be used
to brick a machine with the kernel running (local denial of service)?

Ciao, Marcus
