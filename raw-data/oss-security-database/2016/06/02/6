Red Hat hasn't assigned CVE. Overall, this has only minor security
implications. Bricking machine doesn't seem to be easily reproducible,
since on the second tested mobo it merely showed as a random memory
corruption and hard locked system. It requires specific class of
external usb devices getting plugged into machine with specific broken
xhci controller.
