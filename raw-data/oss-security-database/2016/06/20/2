Subject: CVE Request: 2015 squidguard reflected XSS

Hi,

Please assign a CVE for:

http://www.squidguard.org/Downloads/CHANGELOG
	2015-02-01	Fixed a cross site vulnerability in squidGuard.cgi

http://www.squidguard.org/Downloads/Patches/1.4/Readme.Patch-20150201

I have attached the diff against 1.4, the relevant part seem to be the two lines replacing tags
in $url.

Unsure why they added another \n to the headers, as there are already two \n.

Ciao, Marcus
