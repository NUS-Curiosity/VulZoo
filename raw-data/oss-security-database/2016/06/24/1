Subject: CVE Request: Linux: powerpc/tm: Always reclaim in start_thread()
 for exec() class syscalls

Hi,

We've found an issue in the handling of Transactional Memory on powerpc
systems. An unprivileged local user can crash the kernel by starting a
transaction, suspending it, and then calling any of the exec() class system
calls.

More info:
 https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/636776/
 https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/636774/ (test case)

Could you please allocate a CVE for this?

cheers
