Subject: CVE request: SQL injection in MovableType xml-rpc interface

Hi there,

SixApart just released new versions of MovableType 6.2 and 6.1 to fix an SQL
injection in the xml-rpc interface. The vulnerability also affects the older
GPLv2 licensed MovableType 5.2.13.

Could you please assign a CVE identifier for tracking this issue?
