What though is confusing is that the two commits are tagged
accordingly in the upstream git repository:

Tagged for CVE-2016-4483:
https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=c97750d11bb8b6f3303e7131fe526a61ac65bcfd

Tagged for CVE-2016-3627:
https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=bdd66182ef53fe1f7209ab6535fda56366bd7ac9

For the updates in Debian thus we have used both and referenced both
CVEs, think Ubuntu has done the same in USN 2994
(http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2994-1/)
