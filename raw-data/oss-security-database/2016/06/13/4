If you want us to keep honestly reporting security issues, I recommend you
not single out single implementations over RFC compliant protocol flaws.

I'm fine if you list the CVE with the 6 vulnerable implementations, then say
libreswan has fixed it.

I'm not okay with libreswan being listed as vulnerable and the other 5 vulnerable
implementations not being listed.

If you keep the CVE as-is, we will document it at libreswan.org/security/ as a
mis-issued CVE entry.

Related, I would _REALLY_ appreciate it if MITR talks to us before issuing CVE's
for our software. We've been at this long before MITR, we respond within days, we
are known to have coordinated CVE issues for IKE implementation issues across
various implementations. You can contact us at security@...reswan.org, PGP key
available at the usual places.
