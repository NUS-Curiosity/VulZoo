This (from CHANGES.md) seems notable and probably deserves a CVE:

-------------
##Side Channel Vulnerability on RSA Cipher Suites
A Bleichenbacher variant attack, where certain information is leaked
from the results of a RSA private key operation has been reported by a
security researcher. The code has been updated to error without
providing any information on the premaster contents.

> Note that other side channel attacks may still be possible as

This also:
-------------
##Access Violation on Malicious TLS Record
TLS cipher suites with CBC mode in TLS 1.1 and 1.2 could have an access
violation (read beyond memory) with a maliciously crafted message.
-------------

This is probably the same bug as described here:

OpenSSL is not alone. I found a similar problem in the MatrixSSL
library, see
https://github.com/matrixssl/matrixssl/blob/master/CHANGES.md. In that
case, unfortunately, a bad patch of Lucky 13 lead even to a buffer
overread vulnerability.
