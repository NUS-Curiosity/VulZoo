Subject: CVE Request: libgd: Invalid color index is not properly handled
 leading to denial of service (crash)

Hi

There is currently PHP upstream bug which is still marked as private:

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72494

But the libgd project references the following set of commits to this
bug report:

https://github.com/libgd/libgd/compare/3fe0a71...6ff72ae

indicating that libgd does not properly handle invalid color index,
which could lead to a denial of service against applications using the
libgd library (in particular thus PHP).

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue (in case it was not yet
requested by other channels?)

Regards,
Salvatore
