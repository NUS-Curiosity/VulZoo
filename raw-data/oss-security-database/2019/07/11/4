SECURITY-1010 / CVE-2019-10340 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10341 (permission check)
Docker Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing 
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to 
connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials 
IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, 
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.


SECURITY-1400 / CVE-2019-10342
Docker Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users 
configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user 
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those 
could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another 
vulnerability.


SECURITY-1419 / CVE-2019-10346
Embeddable Build Status Plugin did not sanitize arguments provided in the 
query string, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.


SECURITY-775 / CVE-2019-10347
Mashup Portlets Plugin stored SonarQube credentials unencrypted on the 
Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access to 
the master file system.


SECURITY-1438 / CVE-2019-10348
Gogs Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on the 
Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended 
Read permission, or access to the master file system.


SECURITY-1177 / CVE-2019-10349
Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin does not correctly escape the Display Name 
value for jobs in Jenkins, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting 
vulnerability.


SECURITY-1441 / CVE-2019-10350
Port Allocator Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml 
files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with 
Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.


SECURITY-1437 / CVE-2019-10351
Caliper CI Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on 
the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended 
Read permission, or access to the master file system.
