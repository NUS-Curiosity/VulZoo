I'm not sure what exactly breaks, just that it does, see e.g. [1] [2]
[3]. Since we're talking about root it's not a matter of technical
impossibility, but a decision not to write the code to make it work.

From a security perspective that seems like a great improvement. Even
if it should be the case that some programs don't follow best practices
re "least privileges", at least it's not the whole application running
as root.
