You have two entries for Exim CVE-2019-10149, which is wrong.  Also,
some of the dates are wrong (e.g., the date of Exim's pre-announcement
to oss-security is irrelevant).  Please combine this into one entry and
update the dates.  I guess the range of dates should be from 2019-05-28
(initial notification to distros) to 2019-06-05 (full publication).

Correcting this will probably affect the averages.

Thanks,

Alexander
