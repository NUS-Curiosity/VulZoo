Yes, this will be taken care of by Ubuntu Security Team members who
are already on the list, however if after some time we need to cycle
someone in or out I might come asking. I know you don't want to add
anyone so we will do our best to prevent this from happening.

For 3 we can be either primary or backup, just let me know your
preference and we'll do the work.

I will not personally be involved, I am the director of the Ubuntu
Security Team and as much as I would like to... I probably wouldn't
have time and I did not want to add another person to the list.  I am
subscribed to oss-security now.

Cheers,
