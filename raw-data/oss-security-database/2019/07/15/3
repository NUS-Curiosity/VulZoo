OK, I've just listed Ubuntu as primary for 3, 4, 5.  Amazon is now
backup for 3.

Please note that these items include "and inform the list of the work
done even if no issues were encountered" (item 3), "and inform the list
either way" (items 4, 5), so we'll expect replies to the list as per
these items for each and every issue reported to there.

Thanks!
