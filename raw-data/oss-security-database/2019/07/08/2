Just as young people today have forgotten the "crimes" (not
necessarily illegal, but widely regarded at unethical) of Microsoft
in the past, so most of the management responsible for those crimes
at Microsoft have moved on, and the company is changing.

On the same lines, do you believe Google continues to faithfully
follow its founding mandate of "Don't be Evil"?

The only thing you can count on staying the same is the profit motive,
it is required by law for a publicly owned corporation.  But profit can
be pursued ethically - or not.
