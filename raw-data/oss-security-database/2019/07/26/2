The "best known safe kernel" is the latest one we release from the
stable kernel series.  It has all of the fixes that that the kernel
developers possibly know about at that point in time.

There's no need to worry about being on linux-distros or anything else,
just keep updating your kernel, test in in your infrastructure to ensure
it all works properly, and then push it out to all of your other systems
and all is good.
