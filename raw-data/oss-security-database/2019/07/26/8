Thank you for the details.

Which color, the pony ? ;)

Regarding the a bug is a bug rationale you are referring to, I don't discuss it and think that much progress has been made to treat the subset of those which are also security bugs, including the enlightening participation of Mr. Torvalds himself to this list.
I wouldn't advocate cherry-picking bugfixes either, the Android examples you mention in your reference are a real nightmare indeed. My point is that we would have at any time the most secure available option. This would involve a system to switch among kernel versions when needed, eg when a "pure" security bug with high impact is identified and cannot be published yet, nor its fix, yet people could switch meanwhile to a safer, known kernel version.
I hope that makes it clearer.

Cheers,
Stiepan
