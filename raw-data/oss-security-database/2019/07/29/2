CVE-2018-11773: Apache VCL improper form validation in block allocation 
management

Severity: Medium

Versions Affected: 2.1 through 2.5

Description: Apache VCL versions 2.1 through 2.5 do not properly validate form 
input when processing a submitted block allocation. The form data is then used 
as an argument to the php built in function strtotime. This allows for an 
attack against the underlying implementation of that function. The 
implementation of strtotime at the time the issue was discovered appeared to 
be resistant to a malicious attack. However, all VCL systems running versions 
earlier than 2.5.1 should be upgraded or patched.

Mitigation: Upgrade to 2.5.1 or apply patches from https://vcl.apache.org/
security.html

Credit: This vulnerability was found and reported to the Apache VCL project by 
ADLab of Venustech.
