Sure, give me a day or two to get it out. I'll cross-post
LKML/ksummit-discuss/oss-security as I think it's one of those times it
actually makes sense.

Whatever list admins/members are comfortable with.

Yes, this is tricky. Maybe "Microsoft Linux Systems Group"? Thats our
group name within Microsoft. I guess that we can also add a short wiki
page with references to the products/distros we support as well as a
clarification that this has nothing to do with Windows and list MSRC's
contact information.

As I've indicated before, we intend to follow the list's policies.
Information obtained from the list will be used only for the purposes
listed in our original application, and any additional future use will
go through the list for approvals first.
