I missed the twitter poll but from my perspective as someone involved in 
making and releasing such updates for SUSE customers Monday disclosures 
tend to work for us but only due to timezones, generally disclosure 
times happen into the late afternoon evening, which means that if 
lengthy QA tests were left running over the weekend our QA team will 
have time to review the results during Monday and we will be ready to 
release. I am guessing that some other distro's wouldn't end up with 
this luxury. Having said that it will often depend on the amount of 
total time we have and the size of the test suite, having said that many 
of our automated tests will finish over night.

I guess for distro's who employ people to fix security issues, a Monday 
morning / lunch time disclosure is mostly going to mean that everyone 
will aim to have update's ready on the Friday night if possible which 
doesn't really help with keeping embargo times as short as practical. On 
the other hand it might give people patching issues in there spare time 
more of a chance.
