Subject: Statistics for distros lists updated for 2019Q3

Hi,

The statistics for the distros list have been updated for the 3rd
quarter of 2019 at
http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros/stats

Data rows not included in calculation due to negative embargos are now
marked in data with "ND" in the calculated columns.

Adding the median is not done at this point to make sure the updated
figures are available. It turns out to not be quite as easy as I first
projected given LibreOffice doesn't have a median counterpart to
[AVERAGEIFS] so I likely need to use some array formula instead, so I'll
do that as a separate update when I get around to it.
