Subject: Python-3.5.8.tar.xz does NOT contain the fix for bpo-38243

Hello,

Python 3.5.8 is supposed to contain a fix for bpo-38243, as mentioned
at 
https://docs.python.org/3.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-5-8-final

It turns out python.org has accidentally shipped 3.5.8 without that
fix, if you pick tar.xz instead of .tgz. Please find attached the email
I have sent them.

I'm reporting this to oss-security so that no downstream distributors
accidentally ship the wrong 3.5.8. I have also reported it directly to
FreeBSD at https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=241586 as
they are the only distribution I could think of that still actually
ship vanilla Python 3.5.

Kind regards,
