Subject: Re: Membership application for linux-distros - VMware

Hello Srivatsa,

I've reviewed your request and the external resources you referenced,
and more, and I find the request very reasonable and satisfying our
stated requirements.  I also gave others on oss-security time to comment
if they wanted to, and we've only seen comments in favor.

Please send me your PGP key off-list and I'll add you to linux-distros.

Please see below on contributing back:

This is a good choice, thanks!

I'd like you to pick a primary role for some task.  As an option, we can
make you primary for "5. Determine if the reported issues are
Linux-specific ...", moving SUSE to backup.

Please let me know of your final choice, as well as where you'd like to
be primary and where to join as a backup.

We also need a distro to volunteer for the only currently completely
unassigned task requiring list membership, Technical 6:

6. Produce and share well-reasoned estimates for the time required to
handle the issues under embargo (such as to (re)negotiate the public
disclosure date and/or to choose between the different ways to handle an
issue)

I mention this not only in response to you, but also in case any other
distro would take this opportunity to volunteer for this task.  I guess
that same distro could also be involved in Technical 1 and/or 2 since
the time estimates and schedules could reasonably come out of such work:

1. Propose (other) ways to fix, work around, or mitigate the reported
issues - primary: Red Hat, backup: vacant

2. Develop and share fixes, workarounds, or mitigations - primary: Red Hat,
backup: vacant

Any takers?

Alexander
