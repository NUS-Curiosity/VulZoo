Subject: Do distros want to see CVEs for Linux kernel USB bugs?

Hi!

As we keep getting more USB bugs reported by syzbot [1], I'd like to
figure out what to do with those in regards to CVEs. Last time I
requested a bunch of CVEs for USB bugs, there was a long discussion
about whether that is the right thing to do, see the full thread here
[2].

I don't want to argue now whether CVEs are useful for the upstream
Linux kernel. My question is: with CVEs as they work today, do Linux
distros want to see CVEs filed for Linux kernel bugs that are
triggerable by a malicious USB device?

Since not all USB bugs are the same, let's bucket them into:

1. Different kinds of DoS (e.g. null-ptr-deref).
2. Info / uninitialized memory leaks.
3. Bugs that lead to arbitrary code execution.
4. Non-triaged memory corruptions (UAF/OOB).

Points 1-3 refer to the bugs that have been assessed for the impact
that they cause, while point 4 refers to the bugs that haven't been
looked at closely.

Keep in mind that:

1. Most of the time physical access to the USB port is required to
trigger these bugs.
2. Sometimes, in cases of e.g. exposed USB/IP or USBAnywhere like
vulnerabilities [3] these bugs can be triggered remotely.

Thanks!
