Subject: Security fixes from Android 10 release which are relevant outside
 the Android ecosystem?

Android advisories used to contain commit references to AOSP change sets, but
that's not the case for https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/android-10.

Typically most of these issues are specific to Android, but there are a few which
per the CVE description are possibly affecting software packaged/used by Linux
distros as well, one example:

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9325:
"In libvpx, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check.
This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution
privileges needed. "

Similar for CVE-2019-9232, CVE-2019-9278, CVE-2019-9325, CVE-2019-9371, CVE-2019-9433,
CVE-2019-9423 (also libexif and opencv)

Is there anyone from Android/Google on the list, who can comment on this? Can these
references be added again for the benefit of non-Android distros?

Cheers,
        Moritz
