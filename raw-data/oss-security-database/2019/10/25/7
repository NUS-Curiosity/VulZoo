            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17348 / XSA-294
                              version 3

         x86 shadow: Insufficient TLB flushing when using PCID

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Use of Process Context Identifiers (PCID) was introduced into Xen in
order to improve performance after XSA-254 (and in particular its
Meltdown sub-issue).  This enablement implied changes to the TLB
flushing logic.  One aspect which was overlooked is the safety of
switching between shadow pagetables, which previously relied on the
unconditional flushing of a write to CR3.

With PCID enabled, a switch of shadow pagetable for a 64bit PV guest
fails to invalidate the linear mappings of the previous shadow
pagetable.  As a result, subsequent accesses to the shadow pagetables
may be deemed to be safe by the shadow logic (based on the old shadow
pagetable) but fault when made in practice.

IMPACT
======

Malicious 64bit PV guests may be able to cause a host crash (Denial of
Service).

Additionally, vulnerable configurations are unstable even in the absence
of an attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only systems running 64-bit x86 PV guests are vulnerable.  Systems running
only x86 HVM or PVH or 32bit PV guests are not vulnerable.

Only systems with at least one PCID-enabled PV guest are vulnerable.

Systems where PCID or INVPCID are unavailable or entirely disabled are
not vulnerable.

Note that PCID is enabled by default for both 64-bit dom0 and 64-bit
domU when hardware supports it.  PCID acceleration has been backported
to the following versions:
 - Xen 4.11.x,
 - Xen 4.10.2 and onwards,
 - Xen 4.9.3 and onwards,
 - Xen 4.8.4 and onwards,
 - Xen 4.7.6.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.

Disabling use of PCID entirely, by passing "pcid=0" or "invpcid=0" as a
command line option to the hypervisor, will also avoid this
vulnerability (albeit re-introducing the XPTI performance regression
use of PCID was intended to reduce).

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

==========

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
