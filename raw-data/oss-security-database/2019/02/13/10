Subject: Railroader: static analysis tool for Ruby on Rails (OSS fork of
 Brakeman)

All:

If you are developing or analyzing anything that uses the
Ruby on Rails framework, the odds are good that
you've been using the "Brakeman" static analyzer
<https://brakemanscanner.org/>.
However, the latest version of Brakeman (4.4.0)
has switched to a license that is not open source software (OSS):
<https://brakemanscanner.org/blog/2019/01/17/brakeman-4-dot-4-dot-0-released>

If you are interested in using a static analyzer that is OSS,
I've created a fork called "Railroader".  More info here:
https://railroader.org/
https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/railroader

Contributions welcome, under the MIT (code) or CC-BY (website) licenses.

Thanks for your attention.
