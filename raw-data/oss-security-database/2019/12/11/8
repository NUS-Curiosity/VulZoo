 users credentials (CVE-2019-19687)

OSSA-2019-006: Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all users
credentials
=====================================================================================

:Date: December 09, 2019
:CVE: CVE-2019-19687


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Keystone: ==15.0.0, ==16.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Daniel Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystone's list
credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any
credentials with the /v3/credentials API when [oslo_policy]
enforce_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to
view any other users credentials, which could leak sign-on information
for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments
running keystone with [oslo_policy] enforce_scope set to false are
affected. There will be a slight performance impact for the list
credentials API once this issue is fixed.
