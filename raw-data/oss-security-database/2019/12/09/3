That's not a technical fault. It's a fault on the human side.

If you call the above command in a typical Bourne shell, you should be
prepared to handle the trouble. Smart admins don't do that.

If an application calls the above command via system(), you should
file a bug against that application. Smart programmers know how to
avoid the shell for such invocations (or avoid such invocations in the
first place.)
