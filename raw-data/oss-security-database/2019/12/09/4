I'm sorry, but this has nothing to do with developers of PROGRAM to use or not
user "--", but rather with the user not properly sanitizing the input to the
PROGRAM and not understanding how shell works. Specifically, doing
PROGRAM *.tar is just asking for trouble for many reasons, not mentioned in the
original email. See [1] (and in general BashPitfalls) for a proper discussion...
