Wow, this is the new -froot.

I think this library issue isn't OpenBSD-specific.  A quick Google web
search for LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH finds that Mesa appears to have the same
issue, and it also finds that we should also search for GBM_DRIVERS_PATH
(apparently, for older Mesa) and maybe EGL_DRIVERS_PATH and EGL_DRIVER,
and LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH and LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME.  There are probably more.

Related discussion for X.Org, which ends with Alan Coopersmith saying:

"Yeah, I really would rather not have a setuid-root program dlopen and execute
code from a user supplied path.  Can we have something in there to prevent
disasters, such as issetugid() or secure_getenv()?"

[PATCH xserver] Search for DRI drivers at LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH environment variable.
https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-devel/2016-April/049336.html

It sounds like the patch adding the dangerous getenv() didn't get in,
but I didn't verify that.
