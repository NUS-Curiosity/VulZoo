Subject: CVE requests: three vulnerabilities in ImageMagick

Hi,
   I have found three vulnerabilities in ImageMagick and all this have
patched by ImageMagick developer team. However, I requested cve ids for
these vulveribilities and get no any response. How should I  request CVE
ids for vulnerilities I found in ImageMagick now? Which CNA should I
contact with to assign CVE ids for open source software such as imagemagick?
   The three vulnerabilities details as below.
    1. heap-buffer-overflow in WritePNGImage of png.c
[Suggested description]
In ImageMagick  7.0.8-43  and ImageMagick6  6.9.10-43, there is a
heap-buffer-overflow overflow in the function WritePNGImage of png.c ,
which allows remote attackers to cause  arbitrary code execution, denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image file
.
