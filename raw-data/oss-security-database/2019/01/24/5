Subject: CVE-2019-6778 QEMU: slirp: heap buffer overflow in tcp_emu()

   Hello,

A heap buffer overflow issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation 
of the QEMU emulator. It occurs in tcp_emu() routine while emulating 
Identification protocol and copying message data to a socket buffer.

A user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the host 
resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the 
QEMU process.

Upstream patch:
