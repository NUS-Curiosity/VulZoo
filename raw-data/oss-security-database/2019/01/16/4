SECURITY-868
Users with the Overall/RunScripts permission (typically administrators) 
were able to use the Jenkins script console to craft a 'Remember me' 
cookie that would never expire.

This allowed attackers access to a Jenkins instance while the 
corresponding user in the configured security realm exists, for example to 
persist access after another successful attack. 


SECURITY-901
When using an external security realm such as LDAP or Active Directory, 
deleting a user from the security realm does not result in the user losing 
access to Jenkins.

While deleting the user record from Jenkins did invalidate the 'Remember 
me' cookie, there was no way to invalidate active sessions besides 
restarting Jenkins or terminating sessions through other means, such as 
Monitoring Plugin.
