Subject: CVE-2018-16886 etcd: Improper Authentication in auth/store.go:AuthInfoFromTLS()
 via gRPC-gateway

Hello,

etcd versions 3.2.0 through 3.3.10 are vulnerable to an improper
authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and
client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server TLS certificate
contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a
remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted)
client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.
