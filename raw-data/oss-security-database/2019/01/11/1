Subject: [CVE-2018-17198] Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) and File
 Enumeration vulnerability in Apache Roller

Severity: Important

Vendor:
   The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
   Roller 5.2.1
   Roller 5.2
   The unsupported pre-Roller 5.1 versions may also be affected.

Description:

Roller relies on Java SAX Parser to implement its XML-RPC interface and by
default that parser supports external entities in XML DOCTYPE, which opens
Roller up to SSRF / File Enumeration vulnerability. Note that this
vulnerability exists even if Roller XML-RPC interface is disable via the
Roller web admin UI.

Mitigation:

   There are a couple of ways you can fix this vulnerability:

   1) Upgrade to the latest version of Roller, which is now 5.2.2

   2) Or, edit the Roller web.xml file and comment out the XML-RPC Servlet
mapping as shown below:

<!--
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>XmlRpcServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/roller-services/xmlrpc</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
-->
