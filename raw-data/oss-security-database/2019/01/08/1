SECURITY-1266
Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during the 
compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as @Grab
to source code elements.

Both the pipeline validation REST APIs and actual script/pipeline 
execution are affected.

This allowed users with Overall/Read permission, or able to control 
Jenkinsfile or sandboxed Pipeline shared library contents in SCM, to 
bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins 
master.
