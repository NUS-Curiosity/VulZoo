Subject: [OSSA-2019-001] Unsupported dport option prevents applying security
 groups in OpenStack Neutron (CVE-2019-9735)

=========================================================================
OSSA-2019-001: Unsupported dport option prevents applying security groups
=========================================================================

:Date: March 13, 2019
:CVE: CVE-2019-9735


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Neutron: <10.0.8, >=11.0.0 <11.0.7, >=12.0.0 <12.0.6, >=13.0.0 <13.0.3


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Erik Olof Gunnar Andersson with Blizzard Entertainment reported a
vulnerability in Neutron's iptables firewall module. By setting a
destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol which
doesn't support that option (for example, VRRP), an authenticated user
may block further application of security group rules for instances
from any project/tenant on the compute hosts to which it's applied.
Only deployments using the iptables security group driver are
affected.
