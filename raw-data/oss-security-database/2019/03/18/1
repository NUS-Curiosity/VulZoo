Subject: CVE-2019-9824 QEMU: Slirp: information leakage in tcp_emu() due to
 uninitialized stack variables

     Hello,

An information leakage issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation 
of the QEMU emulator. It occurs in tcp_emu() routine while emulating 
Identification protocol, when crafted messages are sent to make it return 
uninitialized variables.

A user/process could use this flaw to read uninitialised stack memory contents 
from the QEMU process resulting in information leakage.
