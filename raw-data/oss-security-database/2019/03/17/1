Subject: CVE-2019-9573 / CVE-2019-9574: WordPress plugin hrm missing server
 side authorization checks

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I found several vulnerabilities from WordPress plugin hrm (WP Human Resource
Management) where server side authorization checks are missing. Plugin URL
https://wordpress.org/plugins/hrm/. Affected 2.2.5 and possibly below. Fixed in
2.2.6 according to developer who didn't respond to me, but communicated with
WordPress.

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9574

When creating new leave as admin user there is user picker visible in the UI.
Using same queries as picker functionality any logged in user (e.g.
Subscriber) can use search_emp_leave_records action to print all WordPress
users credentials from database.

{"success":true,"data":[{"ID":"1","user_login":"henri","user_pass":"$P$Bho3..

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9573

Any user can create new leave and can change status of leave (approving,
canceling etc).

Recommendation for developers:

Authorize users using a whitelist of roles allowed to call specific actions.
Define roles for all actions with secure default e.g. admin only. Ensure that
password hashes are not printed to any user. Function
https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_users could be used to list
the users.

Timeline:

2019-01-22: Report to developer and WordPress plugins team
2019-02-23: Fix released
2019-03-05: CVEs assigned by MITRE
