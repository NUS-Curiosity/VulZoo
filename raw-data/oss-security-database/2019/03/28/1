Vulnerability type: CWE-120
Vulnerable version: 2.0.14 - 2.3.5
Vulnerable component: fts, pop3-uidl-plugin
Report confidence: Confirmed
Researcher credits: Found in internal testing
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor

Vendor notification: 2019-02-05
Solution date: 2019-03-21
Public disclosure: 2019-03-28
CVE reference: CVE-2019-7524
CVSS: 3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C (8.8)
 
Vulnerability Details:
When reading FTS or POP3-UIDL header from dovecot index, the input
buffer size is not bound, and data is copied to target structure causing
stack overflow.

Risk:
This can be used for local root privilege escalation or executing
arbitrary code in dovecot process context. This requires ability to
directly modify dovecot indexes.
Steps to reproduce:
Produce dovecot.index.log entry that creates an FTS header which has
more than 12 bytes of data.
Trigger dovecot indexer-worker or run doveadm index.
Dovecot will crash.

Mitigations:
Since 2.3.0 dovecot has been compiled with stack smash protection, ASLR,
read-only GOT tables and other techniques that make exploiting this bug
much harder.

Solution:
Operators should update to the latest Patch Release. The only workaround
is to disable FTS and pop3-uidl plugin.
