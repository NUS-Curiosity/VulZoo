Hi Joe, hi Anthony -

I'll over-quote a bit since it's an old thread:

I am not seeing this "inform the list either way" stuff actually
happening.  Without it, no other distro has a way to know the work is
actually being done.  Once I had pointed this need out a while before,
Amazon briefly started making those mandatory postings for task 3, until
they were replaced by Ubuntu as primary.  In fact, given the lack of
such postings by Ubuntu, I would still expect Amazon to take over for
task 3, which they're the backup for, and it looks like they did that
exactly once:

As far as I can see, the last time Amazon handled task 3 was on July 25,
which is 10 days after Ubuntu became primary for that task.  This was
much appreciated.  Unfortunately, as far as I can see, neither distro
(visibly) handled these tasks ever since, with one exception:

Ubuntu did point out that a patch didn't have a corresponding testsuite
change, and thus tests failed, in a posting on October 10.  So hopefully
they were doing the work, except for the "inform the list either way"
part - but that's an important part!

It is possible that I missed or don't recall some other occasions, but I
think I got the overall picture right.

Joe, Anthony - can you please have your distros start handling these
tasks fully, as described?

Thanks in advance,

Alexander
