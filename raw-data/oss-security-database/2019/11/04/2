Thank you very much for adding VMware Photon OS to linux-distros!

That sounds good to me!

I'd like to sign up as primary for Administrative 5: "Determine if the
reported issues are Linux-specific... ", and as backup for Technical 4.
"Check if related issues exist in the same piece of software...".
(I did consider the other task that you brought up, namely Technical
6, but I think we'd need more experience on the list before we can
sign up for that task).

Also, is there a write-up somewhere that defines exactly what primary
and backup means in this context? At the moment, I'm assuming that,
for a given task, the primary distro will take up that task for every
issue that gets posted onto linux-distros; and in case the primary is
unavailable (due to vacation/travel etc), then the backup will step up
for that task until the primary gets back. Is that how it works?  If
so, will we get to know the contact details of other distros so that
we can coordinate our schedules?

On a related note, would it be okay for me to request another member
of the Photon OS team (whom I can vouch for), to be added to the
linux-distros list, so that we can have at least one person from our
team always available to take action for our distro, in response to
the issues disclosed on the list?

Thank you very much!

Srivatsa
