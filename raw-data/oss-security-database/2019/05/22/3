Subject: [SECURITY ADVISORY] curl: TFTP receive buffer overflow

TFTP receive buffer overflow
============================

Project curl Security Advisory, May 22nd 2019 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-5436.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function
(`tftp_receive_packet()`) that recevives data from a TFTP server. It calls
`recvfrom()` with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size
that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap
memory is entirely controlled by the server.

The flaw exists if the user selects to use a "blksize" of 504 or smaller
(default is 512). The smaller size that is used, the larger the possible
overflow becomes.

Users chosing a smaller size than default should be rare as the primary use
case for changing the size is to make it larger.

It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most commonly used
within local networks.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

This bug was introduced in January 2009 in 
[commit 0516ce7786e95](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0516ce7786e95).
