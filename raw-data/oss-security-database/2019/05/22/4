Subject: CVE-2019-12247 QEMU: qemu-guest-agent: integer overflow while running
 guest-exec command

   Hello,

An integer overflow issue was found in the QEMU Guest Agent in QEMU, while 
reading argument list passed to the 'guest-exec' qmp command. An attacker 
could exploit this by sending a crafted QMP command to the agent via a 
listening socket to trigger the overflow. It may crash the QEMU guest agent, 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:

This issue was reported by Guoxiang Niu of huawei.com.

Thank you.
