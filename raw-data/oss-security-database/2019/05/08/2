Another argument: You leave your fingerprint on everything you touch. The glass you drank from at the bar on Saturday evening? That has your fingerprints. Your front door? It has those, too.
Fingerprints aren't sensitive information. The only entities attributing any sensitivity to them are the following: Court systems where fingerprints are allowed as evidence (although it's stupid because you can easily duplicate fingerprints) and companies/persons using fingerprints for authentication (which for the same reason as previously mentioned is not a good idea).
And as Roman mentioned already, you can't change your fingerprints easily (Sand paper and acids are your friends, but that's not comfortable at all and compromises your ability to hold things in your hands. So don't to that.).

If, for some reason, you still want to "securely" (at least with a higher level of security than plain text) store your fingerprint, you need to use a hardware backed kernel keyring that stores the encryption keys or use a hardware based security solution for storing the fingerprints in the first case. You likely won't find any such solution though that isn't broken already in some regard.

Kind regards

Noel
