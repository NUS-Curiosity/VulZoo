Subject: XSS via EXIF tag in Serendipity blog

Hi,

I reported some XSS issues via EXIF tags in the Serendipity blog
software:
https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/issues/598

These have now been fixed:
https://blog.s9y.org/archives/282-Serendipity-2.1.5-released.html

This is backend XSS and only relevant if you have multiple authors or
upload potentially untrusted image files.
