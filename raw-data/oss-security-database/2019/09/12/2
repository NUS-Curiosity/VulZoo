SECURITY-1534 / CVE-2019-10392
Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation 
of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the 
specified URL. This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the 
Jenkins master as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.


SECURITY-1538 / CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through 
any of the following:

- Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
- Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of 
  assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
- Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement 
  expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
- Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not 
  involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.


SECURITY-1476 / CVE-2019-10395
Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables 
shown on its views. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability 
exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment 
variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.


SECURITY-1489 / CVE-2019-10396
Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest 
Builds View. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability 
exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on 
that view.


SECURITY-1509 / CVE-2019-10397
Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job 
configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain 
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the 
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, 
and similar situations.


SECURITY-1545 / CVE-2019-10398
Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins 
master. This password could be viewed by users with access to the master 
file system.
