Just as a practical example - this happens automatically on my phone. I
have the nextcloud app set up to watch various directories for new images -
including the one that Whatsapp writes images into.

So if you send me an image and immediately use the delete functionality,
it's probably already too late. If it's reached my phone then Nextcloud
already has a file handle open on it and will be busily sending a copy up
to my server.

So there needn't be a deliberate per-image/file action by the receiver
either, nor need there necessarily be bad faith involved.

IMO, If Whatsapp/Telegram wanted to take this functionality more seriously,
they'd need to be writing the images to disk in an encrypted form from the
outset. It increases the overhead of display, and wouldn't necessarily stop
forensic recovery etc, but it would mean that other apps couldn't simply
watch the directory and upload anything which appears in it in a usable
form. That's a whole other can of worms though as it's another set of keys
to manage.
