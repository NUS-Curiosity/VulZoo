There's no way to take this functionality seriously - the feature is a
joke. A privacy feature centered around trusting another user's
node to delete a file you already sent them is silly. Unfortunately,
it seems like nobody gets this; even Matrix clients are supposed to
have message redaction soon.

The original email didn't contain a security vulnerability (remember
the name of this list?)  - it was blogspam. It didn't belong here for
the same reason that you don't see Snapchat bugs on this list.
