Subject: Re: MITRE response time

Heiko,

My usual response time from them is 2-5 business days (sometimes not too much longer if the team is short handed) requesting individual IDs. 

MITRE is the correct CNA for projects not already listed on that page covered by a different CNA. Make sure to use the web form at CVE.mitre.org
