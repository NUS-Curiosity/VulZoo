Subject: MITRE response time

Hello,

what is your experience with MITRE's response time to an CVE request?

Last thursday I requested a CVE on behalf of a project I'm involved in
(and which is not covered by any of the CNAs listed on
https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html.

Where do you request CVEs for projects not listed there?

    Best regards from Dresden/Germany
    Viele Grüße aus Dresden
    Heiko Schlittermann
