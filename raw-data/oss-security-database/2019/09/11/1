Subject: [CVE-2018-17200] Apache OFBiz unauthenticated remote code execution
 vulnerability in HttpEngine

Severity:
Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
OFBiz 16.11.01 to 16.11.05

Description:
The OFBiz HTTP engine (org.apache.ofbiz.service.engine.HttpEngine.java)
handles requests for HTTP services via the /webtools/control/httpService
endpoint.  This service takes the `serviceContent` parameter in the request
and
 deserializes it using XStream. This `XStream` instance is slightly guarded
by
 disabling the creation of `ProcessBuilder`.  However, this can be easily
 bypassed (and in multiple ways).

Mitigation:
Upgrade to 16.11.06
or manually apply the following commits on branch 16
r1850017+1850019
