Many oss-fuzz "security" issues are not CVE-worthy although they are 
bugs worthy to spend time fixing.

At least as pertains to the Debian project, I do feel that someone is 
looking at each security issue I fix and creating CVEs for serious 
issues.  A CVE summary page for GraphicsMagick is maintained at 
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/graphicsmagick.

Security bugs are often very hard to diagnose and fix.  The community 
has become much better at producing bug reports than with helping to 
solve the problems found.  Help with actually fixing issues is 
appreciated.  I think that the objective should be open source 
software which lacks bugs and still provides a useful purpose. 
Finding bugs is just part of the effort.
