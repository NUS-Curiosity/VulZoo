Subject: Re: Thousands of vulnerabilities, almost no CVEs:
 OSS-Fuzz

As one of the maintainers of a pile of packages included in pretty much every
Linux distro (the X.Org libraries, clients, servers, & drivers), which has had
a fair number of CVE's, I would love to do all of these - and we do what we can
now (mostly 1 & 3).   We're not ignoring the rest - we just don't have enough
contributors to do all that, and I know we're far from the only FOSS project
with this problem.

This is a lot of work, and when the people making money off the software aren't
using that money to pay for this work, they can't be surprised when it doesn't
get done.
