Subject: linux-distros membership application - Microsoft

> 1. Be an actively maintained Unix-like operating system distro with
> substantial use of Open Source components

Microsoft provides several distro-like builds which are not derivative
of an existing distribution that are based on open source components:

 - Azure Sphere
   (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/): This
   Linux-based IoT device provides, among various things, security
   updates to deployed IoT devices. As the project is about to step out
   of public preview into the GA stage, we expect millions of these
   devices to be publicly used.

 - Windows Subsystem for Linux v2
   (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/):
   A Linux based distro that runs as a virtual machine on top of Windows
   hosts. WSL2 is currently available for public preview and scheduled
   for GA early 2020.

 - Products such as Azure HDInsight
   (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/hdinsight) and the Azure
   Kubernetes Service
   (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)
   provide public access to a Linux based distribution.

> 2. Have a userbase not limited to your own organization

Microsoft customers have millions of cores running the various workloads
described above.

Microsoft has decades long history of addressing security issues via
MSRC (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc). While we are able to
quickly (<1-2 hours) create a build to address disclosed security
issues, we require extensive testing and validation before we make these
builds public. Being members of this mailing list would provide us the
additional time we need for extensive testing.

None of our builds are based on an existing distribution. For few of
these workloads we have a very custom kernel and userspace (such as for
Azure Sphere), while some share a more conventional kernel/userspace
configuration.

We follow closely public discussions with regards to security issues
that would affect us. While there was only a minor contribution back to
these lists mostly as we did not have any value to add back.

During past years I've reported multiple security issues which were
assigned CVEs.

We accept the list's policy.

We understand this need and will be contributing back. Looking at the
list of vacant positions I can suggest the following, but I suspect that
existing list members will have better suggestions.

Technical:

3. Review and/or test the proposed patches and point out potential
issues with them (such as incomplete fixes for the originally reported
issues, additional issues you might notice, and newly introduced bugs),
and inform the list of the work done even if no issues were encountered
- primary: Amazon, backup: vacant

Administrative:

3. Evaluate if the issue (or one of the issues) is effectively already
public (e.g., a fix is committed upstream with a descriptive message)
or/and is low severity and thus the report (or its portion pertaining to
the issue) should be made public right away for one or both of these
reasons, get a few other list members to confirm this understanding, and
if there are no objections then communicate this strong preference to
the reporter - primary: CloudLinux, backup: vacant

> 8. Be able and willing to handle PGP-encrypted e-mail

I am able and willing to handle PGP-encrypted e-mail.

Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@...uxfoundation.org> would vouch for me
(Sasha Levin <sashal@...nel.org>).
