I think the NEWS page of GraphicsMagick
(http://www.graphicsmagick.org/NEWS.html) speaks for itself: the
developers recognize contributions of Alex and do not blame him for
not fixing all the bugs he found in the project.
Setting up continuous fuzzing for an OSS project is an unhairy job,
too. There doesn't seem to be a continuous flow of people doing that,
despite fixing a bug with a clear reproducer and a readable error
message is a lot easier than chasing the same bug in the wild.
