Have you tried the gdb exploitable plugin yet?

https://github.com/jfoote/exploitable

Some of the tools written around AFL have included support for running
exploitable directly on the fuzzer results and helping to prioritize,
roughly, in what order the specimens should be worked on:

with a direct link to a pretty screenshot:

I assume like most such tools, this is another case of being a good start
but not nearly as reliable as a knowledgeable human. It's also probably
completely useless for issues that aren't memory-safety issues. But it's
something that exists today and may be helpful.

Thanks
