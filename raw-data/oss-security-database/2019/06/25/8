> Question: is fuzzing useful for languages like Java/python?

Fuzzing is used to show that a function is partial, when it is expected
to be total.  That can be useful with any language which has partial
functions.

If anything, it should be easier with Java and Python because these
languages have many more language-defined checks causing abnormal
function termination, while with C code, you have to inject such checks
with complicated instrumentation.

Thanks,
Florian
