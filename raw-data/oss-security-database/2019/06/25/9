I think that almost all bugs are issues worth addressing given 
sufficent resources available to address them.  The issue discussed is 
what proportion of bugs discovered via automated testing and claimed 
to be "security" issues based on computer analysis are exploitable 
vulnerabilities which deserve a CVE.

A good point has been made that Linux heap memory allocation behavior 
may be very different than other OSs and that behavior can also be 
hardware-specific.
