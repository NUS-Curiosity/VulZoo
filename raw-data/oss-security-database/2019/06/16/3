I guess this is a distinction between all open deadline-exceeded issues
(129) and only deemed security ones out of those (38).

Removing "Type=Bug-Security status:New", but keeping
"label:Deadline-exceeded" does show 129 issues for ImageMagick.

Also removing "label:Deadline-exceeded" still results in 129, perhaps
because I'm not authorized to see other open issues.

I am unfamiliar with OSS-Fuzz.  Please correct me if I got this wrong.
