Using the ordinary public access I have, I see that ImageMagick has 
129 open issues, and 1479 issues in total.  There are surely issues 
that I can not see yet since they are hidden for up to 90 days.

Taking the number 129, that would mean that there is a huge number of 
issues already fixed (1350) which are gradually making it out to 
users.  This is too many fixes to deal with via distribution-specific 
patches.

Using my privileged access for GraphicsMagick, I currently see 343 
issues in total, with 12 issues remaining to fix.  Some of those 12 
issues are open to the public for some time now. :-(
