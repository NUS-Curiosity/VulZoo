Subject: Re: Crash / fix in bzip2

Hi,

in Gentoo Linux we are shipping [1] for a while.

Please note that this change will break some bzip2 archives which were
created with lbzip2 because lbzip2 sometimes exceeded BZ_MAX_SELECTORS.

There's a patch for lbzip2 [2] (not yet published in a release) to avoid
that problem for new archives...
