There is nothing about languages like Java and Python which 
necessarily makes them safe.  Access outside of memory bounds is just 
one issue which often afflicts C/C++.  Java and Python can easily do 
something wrong such as use all available resources or never finish. 
In the case of Python, Python can easily make arbitrary calls into C 
code under control of the script.
