Nevertheless, it is a bug.  Fuzzers are amazing.  Going forward, the
best plan is for more projects to include fuzzing as part of the
build process testing.

Question: is fuzzing useful for languages like Java/python?  Obviously,
you eventually reach a native code module in both cases, but fuzzing 
the entire virtual machine is cumbersome.  Maybe native code libraries
for "safe" languages should include fuzzing as part of testing.
