To verify this, yes, I can vouch for Sasha.  He is a long-time kernel
developer and has been helping with the stable kernel releases for a few
years now, with full write permissions to the stable kernel trees.

I also suggested that Microsoft join linux-distros a year or so ago when
it became evident that they were becoming a Linux distro, and it is good
to see that they are now doing so.
