So it's a matter of "do I live with all of the bugs that everyone else
knows about and how to exploit, or do I live with a potential
regression?"  That sounds like an easy choice given that the reason you
should be updating is to resolve all of those known bugs :)

Regressions always happen, we are human, but there are ways to mitigate
them (testing, roll-back, preventing developers from not breaking things
on purpose, etc.)  And projects that do not do this type of work to
prevent regressions need to learn that they should change, or users will
go elsewhere.
