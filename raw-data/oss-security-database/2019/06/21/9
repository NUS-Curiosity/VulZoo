Exactly, other examples where Debian ships upstream stable branches
when updating a stable/oldstable release (via security.debian.org or
point releases) out of the top of my head are:

- ffmpeg
- Firefox ESR
- Linux (follows upstream LTS branches)
- MariaDB
- Mediawiki
- OpenJDK
- OpenSSL
- PHP
- Thunderbird ESR
- VLC
- Wireshark
- Xen

It has served us very well overall and it's considered on a case-by-case
basis; e.g. whether upstream releases in those long term branches are
sufficiently vetted/regression-tested.
