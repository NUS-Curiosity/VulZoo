Subject: DLL injection in Go < 1.12.2 [CVE-2019-9634]

Hey folks,

Golang before 1.12.2 linked against various DLLs that were
same-directory injectable and generally its library loading mechanism
did not use LoadLibraryEx, allowing the classic DLL injection attacks,
especially with regards to executables saved to the Downloads/ folder
[1]. It was assigned CVE-2019-9634 and fixed in [2] and [3]. It wasn't
mentioned in the 1.12.2 release notes, so I'm mentioning it here
instead.

Jason
