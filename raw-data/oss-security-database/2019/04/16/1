Subject: kernel address leak in drivers/media/dvb-frontends/ascot2e.c - linux
 4.14.111 LTS

In ascot2e_attach, dev_info will print the address of adapter to
dmesg, sensitive kernel information will be leaked to user space.
struct dvb_frontend *ascot2e_attach(struct dvb_frontend *fe,
  const struct ascot2e_config *config,
  struct i2c_adapter *i2c)
{
  ...
  dev_info(&priv->i2c->dev,
  "Sony ASCOT2E attached on addr=%x at I2C adapter %p\n",
  priv->i2c_address, priv->i2c);
  ...
}
