Subject: CVE-2019-3900 Kernel: vhost_net: infinite loop while receiving
 packets leads to DoS

   Hello,

An infinite loop issue was found in the vhost_net kernel module, while 
handling incoming packets in handle_rx(). It could occur if one end sends 
packets faster than the other end can process them.

A guest user, maybe remote one, could use this flaw to stall the vhost_net 
kernel thread, resulting in a DoS scenario.
