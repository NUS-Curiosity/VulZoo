Subject: CVE-2019-3882: Linux kernel: DoS through vfio/type1 DMA mappings

Heololo,

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits
violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver,
such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of
the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS).

CVE-2019-3882 was allocated for this flaw.
