Subject: CVE-2019-3893: Foreman: Compute resource credentials exposed during
 deletion on API

Hello,

An information disclosure vulnerability has been discovered in the Foreman API.

When deleting a compute resource via the API, the API responded with
details of the compute resource, including credentials in clear text.

Users not able to upgrade should ensure the `delete_compute_resource`
permission is not granted to users not trusted with the credentials.

This issue affects Foreman 1.1 and higher. The fix has been released
with Foreman 1.21.1.
Further details are available at https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26450.
