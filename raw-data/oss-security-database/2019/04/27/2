Yes, that was pointed out to me privatelyl. I am using it as well in
Buildroot:

https://git.buildroot.org/buildroot/commit/?id=fc8ace0938a0bcf2e9fa628a88853252eabc991d

Interesting enough, this fix is on the 9.11 branch:

https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9/commits/v9_11

But not part of the v9_11_6 tag:

https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9/commits/v9_11_6
