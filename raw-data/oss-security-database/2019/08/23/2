Yep, my behaviour with these things I'd say is quite unusual compared to 
  most people's. But I wouldn't say I'm particularly paranoid. By the 
way my reasons for not trusting wifi access points in general is not 
because I'm worried about wifi protocols. I'm worried about what might 
be running on the never-been-updated access point from 
doesnt-really-care-after-its-shipped manufacturer, that's been connected 
to the internet for a long time, with a root password of london1982 or 
such like, and a web interface listening on the wan port. Combined with 
the fact I don't fully trust my handset's ability to defend itself while 
connected to said access point, due to its difficult to keep up-to-date 
OS and heavily locked down firmware. I feel somewhat safer connecting 
with my laptop. But that's all veering far off topic.

What I do find very interesting is the question of what is CVE-worthy, 
particularly with regards to USB flaws in the kernel. The wider question 
of should the CVE process be driven, to whatever extent, by most 
people's behaviour, even if that behaviour is ill-advised for whatever 
reason (simply unaware of/don't care about the risks in most cases).

By the way, I'm not arguing that people should not put any effort into 
fixing these issues, I believe a flaw is always worth fixing, nothing is 
too trivial to submit a patch to a kernel mailing list for.

Rest my case :-)
