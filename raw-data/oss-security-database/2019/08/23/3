No one has said anything about not fixing these bugs.  The Linux USB
developers have been spending a lot of time in the past weeks doing just
that, so please do not think that is an issue here.

Now the "mount a purposfully corrupted filesystem image" issues, that's
another story :)  CERT has a long-running thread with a number of kernel
developers about issues they have found in that area over the past
years, which has not lead to many fixes for various reasons :(

thanks,
