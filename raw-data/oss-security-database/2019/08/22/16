I would also like to point out the availability of USB-over-Ethernet and
USB-over-IP [1] that exposes such endpoints to the network. Especially in data
centers where KVMs are virtualized, such systems seem to be commonly used.

Considering that USB can be routed over networks (with extensions/additional
hardware), these bugs should also be evaluated under a different angle.

Cheers,
Mathias
