Note, I am scraping the logs for anything that says it is fixed due do a
syzbot find or report and backporting them to the stable kernel
branches.  So those distros that do follow the LTS/stable kernel
releases do get these fixes.  Luckily most of the "sane" distros these
days do this.

Please don't abuse the CVE process just to try to get a fix backported
to a Linux kernel release.  There is at least one company today that
does this as it is a way to "route around" management, but really, that
shouldn't be needed, fix your management processes instead please :)

thanks,
