Sorry, a little too much marketing coming out of this camp these days, and
this one demands a response.

All of the fixes, Greg?  Who backports them?  Would you like to share with
the list what happens when an upstream fix doesn't apply cleanly to an
earlier kernel?  What happens when a volunteer doesn't show up to backport
the fix for you?

If security fixes are being tracked as your "everything is fine, nothing to
see here" reply suggests, we wouldn't be carrying hundreds of security fixes
your LTS kernels are missing.

You'd also need to explain very easy to find examples like this:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/stable/msg317698.html
of random LTS kernels not receiving security fixes.  This particular issue was
public since April (which is when we backported fixes for it to 4.4/4.14).
It's now 4 months later and your 4.4 6-year "supported" LTS kernel still
doesn't contain the fixes.

This list should be for informing people, not for spreading misinformation
and a sense of security that you must know is false.

Thanks,
-Brad
