You can argue anything you like. Power charging points have popped up
around the world, and you're not in a position to stop
them. Furthermore, I'll note that over the air exploitable bugs in
things like WiFi stacks and Bluetooth stacks have also appeared over
time; perhaps it's foolish to have your phone on at all, and yet
people will continue to turn their phones on, and even to use them.
