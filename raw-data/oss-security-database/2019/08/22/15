All of the ones that say they are found by the syzbot, yes.  If I have
missed any, please let me know, I am only human.

I don't track CVEs nor care about them at all, and rely on others who
depend on those older kernels to provide complex backports as they can
test them the best.  Nothing new at all, it's always been that way.

If you know of specific fixes that I have missed, I am glad to accept
backports.  Right now we are averaging about 22 patches a day in the
latest stable release, and 19 in the latest LTS release.  That's a tiny
5.5% of the number of patches that are being developed and merged
upstream, which means that we know we are missing stuff and we rely on
people to point out where we have done so.

We take patches from all distros and companies and users where they
notice that we have missed things, I would love to take anything that
you have noticed that I missed.

thanks!
