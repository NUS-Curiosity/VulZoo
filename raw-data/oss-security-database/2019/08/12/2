gnu/linux rediscovers macro malware

vim worm 2003:https://securiteam.com/unixfocus/5rp0l0a8us/

libreoffice macro bug July
2019:https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/30/libreoffice_macro_vulnerability/

expect problems with digitally signed vulnerable mobile code
like .jar or when linux includes ActiveX in the kernel
with signed ActiveX (2002):http://www.guninski.com/signedactivex2.html


we believe gnu/linux will lose the malware war like m$ did
since last century.
