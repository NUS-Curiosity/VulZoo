Subject: Apache OFBiz - Unauth Path Traversal with file corruption
 (CVE-2022-25371)

Severity:
High

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
OFBiz versions prior to 18.12.06

Description:
The Birt viewer version 4.5.0 has a security issue that allows this exploit.
We waited long for https://github.com/eclipse/birt/issues/625
to resolve but eventually decided to release OFBiz 18.12.06 without
the Birt component

Mitigation:
Upgrade to at least 18.12.06
or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-...
