I don't know the reason.

But I suspect it maybe has something to do how bugzilla works, since the
whole "Security" category on the WebKit bugzilla is private.
And I'm unsure if Bugzilla allows access to a private issue based on the
age and status (closed/open) of the issue.

We have considered using the same stable branches that them, but in the
end it didn't fit well our release process. We aim at a 6-month release
cadence for major stable releases in order to align with the GNOME
release process. And Apple has a differente release cadence than that.

We also monitor patches landing on master (main) that are tagged as
security releated and sometimes we backport them even when those don't
have (still) assigned a CVE.

In the case of this CVE (CVE-2022-32893) the patch fixing it was not
marked as security related.
