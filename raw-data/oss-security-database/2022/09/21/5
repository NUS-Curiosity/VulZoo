SECURITY-2886 / CVE-2022-41224
Jenkins 2.367 through 2.369 (both inclusive) does not escape tooltips of
the `l:helpIcon` UI component used for some help icons on the Jenkins web
UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control tooltips for this component.

NOTE: As of publication, the Jenkins security team is unaware of any
exploitable help icon/tooltip in Jenkins core or plugins published by the
Jenkins project. The vast majority of help icons use the `l:help` component
instead of `l:helpIcon`. The few known instances of `l:helpIcon` do not
have user-controllable contents.


SECURITY-2821 / CVE-2022-41225
Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin 1.0.24 and earlier does not escape
content provided by the Anchore engine API.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control API responses by Anchore engine.


SECURITY-2832 / CVE-2022-41226
Compuware Common Configuration Plugin 1.0.14 and earlier does not configure
its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to change the contents of the Topaz Workbench
CLI home directory on agents to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses
external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or
server-side request forgery.


SECURITY-2737 / CVE-2022-41227 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-41228 (missing permission check)
NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.129 and earlier does
not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified username and
password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-2858 / CVE-2022-41229
NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.134 and earlier does
not escape configuration options of the Execute NetStorm/NetCloud Test
build step.

build artifacts of a given job, if the optional Run/Artifacts permission is
enabled.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2169 / CVE-2022-41234
Rundeck Plugin 3.6.11 and earlier does not protect access to the
`/plugin/rundeck/webhook/` endpoint.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to trigger jobs that are
configured to be triggerable via Rundeck.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2645 / CVE-2022-41235
WildFly Deployer Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier implements functionality that
allows agent processes to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller
file system.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to read arbitrary
files on the Jenkins controller file system.

Security Inspector Plugin 117.v6eecc36919c2 and earlier does not require
POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to replace the generated report stored
in a per-session cache and displayed to authorized users at the
`.../report` URL with a report based on attacker-specified report
generation options. This could create confusion in users of the plugin who
are expecting to see a different result.

NOTE: A security hardening since Jenkins 2.287 and LTS 2.277.2 prevents
exploitation of this vulnerability for the "Single user, multiple jobs"
report. Other report types are still affected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-1737 / CVE-2022-41237
DotCi Plugin 2.40.00 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to
prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.

This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to modify `.ci.yml` files in SCM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2867 / CVE-2022-41238
DotCi Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/githook/` that can be used to
trigger builds of the job for a GitHub repository.

In DotCi Plugin 2.40.00 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed without
authentication.

This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs
corresponding to the attacker-specified repository for attacker-specified
commits.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2884 / CVE-2022-41239
DotCi Plugin 2.40.00 and earlier does not escape the GitHub user name
parameter provided to commit notifications when displaying them in a build
cause.
