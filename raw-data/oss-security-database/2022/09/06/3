I'm not familiar with sagemath, but is it intended to protect
against such cases? Note that even if all it does is pass
expressions into CPython's eval(), it's pretty much impossible to
guard against misuse without completely sandboxing the underlying
processes. Denial of service scenarios are really the least of
worries in that case. Many articles have been written over the years
about this, though one of the more recent and thorough ones is:
https://netsec.expert/posts/breaking-python3-eval-protections/

If it's not trying to prevent getting access to do all the things
the interpreter can do outside sagemath as well, then I hardly see
this as a vulnerability (any more than "CPython interpreter allows
execution of arbitrary Python code" would be, at any rate).
