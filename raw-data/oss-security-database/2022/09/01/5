We do have access to the tickets on WebKit bugzilla that are marked as
security-related and are hidden from other users by default.

However, we don't receive the information about which WebKit fixes will
be included in any Apple security update until those advisories are public.

It was. Fixes land in the master (main) branch. Those fixes don't
necessarely apply or work on the branch of the last webkitgtk-stable branch.

A new webkitgtk/stable branch is forked from master (main) each 6
months, and once forked it receives cherry-picks from the main branch,
but it is never rebased.

We release a new major stable version each 6 months (2.XX), and then we
backport fixes doing minor relases (2.XX.A) for 6 months until the next
major relaseis out (2.XY).
