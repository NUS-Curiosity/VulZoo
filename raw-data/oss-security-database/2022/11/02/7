I don't know rust, so serious question - if this same buggy punycode
routine had been written in rust, what would have happened?

- I assume you *could* write similar logic, but perhaps the argument is
  that idiomatic rust discourages it?
- Would rustc have been able to reason about the code well enough at
  compile time to error out?
- Just detect it at runtime and abort()?

If the answer is "error out", then I think that's a pretty convincing win.
