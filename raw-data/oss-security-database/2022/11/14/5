Subject: CVE-2022-45136: JDBC Deserialisation in Apache Jena SDB 

Severity: low

Description:

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Apache Jena SDB 3.17.0 and earlier is vulnerable to a JDBC Deserialisation attack if the attacker is able to control the JDBC URL used or cause the underlying database server to return malicious data.  The mySQL JDBC driver in particular is known to be vulnerable to this class of attack.  As a result an application using Apache Jena SDB can be subject to RCE when connected to a malicious database server.

Apache Jena SDB has been EOL since December 2020 and users should migrate to alternative options e.g. Apache Jena TDB 2.

Mitigation:

Apache Jena SDB has been EOL since December 2020, users should migrate to alternative options from the Apache Jena project e.g. Apache Jena TDB 2 or from 3rd party vendors.


Users utilising Apache Jena SDB with mySQL should ensure they explicitly set autoDeserialize=false on their JDBC connection strings.  It is also recommended that users ensure that any ability to set the JDBC connection string is limited to appropriate users.

Apache Jena would like to thank Crilwa & LaNyer640 for reporting this issue
