-fno-strict-aliasing is definitely the right call.  I use it pretty much
everywhere, as complying with the strict aliasing rules is often just
not worth the effort.  I suspect that wl_container_of (used in every C
program using libwayland) may violate strict aliasing, and I am nearly
certain X11 clients do.
