            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-42309 / XSA-414
                               version 2

                 Xenstore: Guests can crash xenstored

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Due to a bug in the fix of XSA-115 a malicious guest can cause xenstored
to use a wrong pointer during node creation in an error path, resulting
in a crash of xenstored or a memory corruption in xenstored causing
further damage.

Entering the error path can be controlled by the guest e.g. by exceeding
the quota value of maximum nodes per domain.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest can cause xenstored to crash, resulting in the inability
to create new guests or to change the configuration of running guests.

Memory corruption in xenstored or privilege escalation of a guest can't
be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions with the fix for XSA-115 running the C variant of Xenstore
(xenstored or xenstore-stubdom) are vulnerable.

Systems using the Ocaml variant of Xenstore (oxenstored) are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Using oxenstored instead of xenstored will avoid the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
