I can also add that at least this member of the OpenSSL Technical
Committee is following the discussion, and I believe I am not the only
one.

The feedback shared here on oss-security is read and carefully
considered, and I know it will be discussed within OTC to continue the
ongoing process of improving the OpenSSL project and its procedures.

I totally concur with Tavis Ormandy:
> this is active prolific opensource security researchers discussing their opensource security work on the opensource security mailing list :)

Personally, I'd like to thank you all for the feedback so far, as it
is in itself a contribution to the project, even when it is harsh and
reminds us of our mistakes.
As long as it is kept polite and constructive, as it has been so far
here, all feedback is very welcome and valuable.

Cheers,

Nicola Tuveri
