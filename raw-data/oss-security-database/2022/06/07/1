Subject: CVE-2022-31030: containerd CRI plugin: Host memory exhaustion through ExecSync

A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where programs
inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory
without bound during invocation of the ExecSync API. This can cause
containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying
service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both
be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; ExecSync may be
used when running probes or when executing processes via an "exec"
facility.

Patches
This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should
update to these versions to resolve the issue.

Workarounds
Ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.
