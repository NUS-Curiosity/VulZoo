 Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-21123,CVE-2022-21125,CVE-2022-21166 / XSA-404
                                   version 2

                 x86: MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Correct one CVE.  The title for version 1 gave CVE-2022-21124 which was
incorrect and should have been CVE-2022-21125.

Patches are now reviewed.  Backports are available.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

This issue is related to the SRBDS, TAA and MDS vulnerabilities.  Please
see:

  https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-320.html (SRBDS)
  https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html (TAA)
  https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-297.html (MDS)

Please see Intel's whitepaper:

  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/processor-mmio-stale-data-vulnerabilities.html

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to directly read or infer data from other
security contexts in the system.  This can include data belonging to
other VMs, or to Xen itself.  The degree to which an attacker can obtain
data depends on the CPU, and the system configuration.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 processors are vulnerable.  Processors from other manufacturers
(e.g. ARM) are not believed to be vulnerable.

Only Intel based processors are affected.  Processors from other x86
manufacturers (e.g. AMD) are not believed to be vulnerable.

Please consult the Intel Security Advisory for details on the affected
processors and configurations.

Per Xen's support statement, PCI passthrough should be to trusted
domains because the overall system security depends on factors outside
of Xen's control.

As such, Xen, in a supported configuration, is not vulnerable to
DRPW/SBDR.

MITIGATION
==========

All mitigations depend on functionality added in the IPU 2022.1 (May
2022) microcode release from Intel.  Consult your dom0 OS vendor.

To the best of the security team's understanding, the summary is as
follows:

Server CPUs (Xeon EP/EX, Scalable, and some Atom servers), excluding
Xeon E3 (which use the client CPU design), are potentially vulnerable to
DRPW (CVE-2022-21166).

Client CPUs (inc Xeon E3) are, furthermore, potentially vulnerable to
SBDR (CVE-2022-21123) and SBDS (CVE-2022-21125).

SBDS only affects CPUs vulnerable to MDS.  On these CPUs, there are
previously undiscovered leakage channels.  There is no change to the
existing MDS mitigations.

DRPW and SBDR only affects configurations where less privileged domains
have MMIO mappings of buggy endpoints.  Consult your hardware vendor.

In configurations where less privileged domains have MMIO access to
buggy endpoints, `spec-ctrl=unpriv-mmio` can be enabled which will cause
Xen to mitigate cross-domain fill buffer leakage, and extend SRBDS
protections to protect RNG data from leakage.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches and enabling the newly
introduced command line option, if appropriate, mitigates these issues.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

NOTE CONCERNING CVE-2022-21127 / Update to SRBDS
================================================

An issue was discovered with the SRBDS microcode mitigation.  A
microcode update was released as part of Intel's IPU 2022.1 in May 2022.

Updating microcode is sufficient to fix the issue, with no extra actions
required on Xen's behalf.  Consult your dom0 OS vendor or OEM for
updated microcode.

NOTE CONCERNING CVE-2022-21180 / Undefined MMIO Hang
====================================================

A related issue was discovered.  See:

  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/undefined-mmio-hang.html

Xen is not vulnerable to UMH in supported configurations.

The only mitigation is to avoid passing impacted devices through to
untrusted guests.

NOTE CONCERNING LACK OF EMBARGO
===============================

The discoverer did not authorise us to predisclose.
