     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-42328,CVE-2022-42329 / XSA-424

          Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in
a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to
the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328).

Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same
deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface
the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest could cause Denial of Service (DoS) of the host via
the paravirtualized network interface.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems using the Linux kernel based network backend xen-netback
are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Using another PV network backend (e.g. the qemu based "qnic" backend)
will mitigate the problem.

Using a dedicated network driver domain per guest will mitigate the
problem.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This issue was discussed in public already.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.
