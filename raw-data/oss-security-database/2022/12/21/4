Following CVE identifiers have been allocated for the issue (one per
TLV type since they can have a slightly different effect):

 - CVE-2022-4337 for Out-of-Bounds Read in Organization Specific TLV
 - CVE-2022-4338 for Integer Underflow in Organization Specific TLV

The fix referenced in this advisory covers both issues.
