Hi folks,

tldr: I requested 5 CVEs for the new ZDI issues Josh and Jan referenced.

long form:

Nice surprise 1 day before Christmas.

We know.

Not sure why they do not like you, but to be very clear anyone else can
requests CVEs for the kernel, (except the blacklisted drivers/staging/ area).

The whole software industry operates with CVEs as primary identifiers at
this time, so it is not just some "internal engineering processes".

Perhaps this or any of the other ID spaces / databases will be taking
off in the near future, but the main industry index is CVEs at this time.


That said, I have just filed 5 CVE requests for the 5 ZDI issues cross-
referencing the Linux kernel mainline commits.

FWIW, they were fixed in mainline in July and no one had spotted them,
which of course underlines Gregs point and that there are not enough
watchers.

Ciao, Marcus
