And who is doing this "blacklisting" of staging drivers from CVEs?  Why
are they special when many distros do enable and rely on them?

In my talks with MITRE, they have said they don't want to make public
statments about the CVE issues and Linux, which is sad, but they never
mentioned anything about "we will ignore this portion of the kernel
source tree".  Is that in a public statement anywhere that I can point
to when people ask the kernel security team for CVEs?
