Every CNA has to follow its set CVE assignment rules.

The SUSE CNA is only allowed to assign CVEs for issues in SUSE products
/ SUSE specific code patches, preferably only non-public ones to avoid
dups. See:

	https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/suse

There is one fallback OSS CNA, which is the Red Hat CNA.
It is allowed to assign CVEs for OSS issues, and also is a root on its own:

Yes, I agree, it is a bit intransparent.

Lets see how this all changes, as this manual CVE requesting
should be done way less in the future, as most requests will be more via the CVE 
automation APIs in the future (FWIW CNAs already submit via github pull requests).
