I personally find it highly beneficial to grasp informations meant
for human consumption with UNIX text tools.
..And still blinded by Pike's "just make it a string".

If you have an FS="\0" compatible awk(1) (not nawk, not busybox
awk (yet)) it is very easy to parse such text files.

P.S.: CBOR .. if you want JSON.  (The NetBSD folks got that long
before it was hip, where i saw it first.)
