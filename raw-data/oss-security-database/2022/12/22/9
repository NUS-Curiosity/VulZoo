Agreed.

The advisories link to a changelog in
https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.15.61
but it's unclear (to me) whether that implies v6.x
kernels are not affected?

Note also that this disclosure is accompanied by a few
others:

Authenticated remote information disclosure:
https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-1691/

Unauthenticated remote DoS:
https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-1687/

Authenticated RCE:
https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-1688/

Authenticated DoS:
https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-1689/

Lastly, given that this is a coordinated disclosure,
I don't know why there are no CVE IDs reserved for
these.
