 pkexec (CVE-2021-4034)

Hi,

And many other binaries also do things incorrectly:
- https://grep.app/search?q=%3D%201%3B%20n%20%3C%20argc
- https://grep.app/search?q=%3D%201%3B%20.%20%3C%20argc&regexp=true

But most of them are not suid binaries and also do not perform a write into
argv[].

Cheers,
Disconnect3d
