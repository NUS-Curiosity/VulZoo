Why not? History shows that this assumption will almost always be
correct for WebKit.

I'm sure that Red Hat's package maintainers know what a WebKit update
means. Presumably they are busy and their KPIs prioritize fixing CVEs,
so they don't act as proactively as one might prefer.

In general, it seems that WebKit is handling these issues like Linux.
Observers know that important bugs are fixed constantly in software of
this size and complexity. Relying only on CVEs is too reactive and
limited in scope to provide a meaningful security stance, increasingly
so since the CVE assignment system stopped working in the last few
years.
