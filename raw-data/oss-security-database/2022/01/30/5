This isn't an argument against WebKit Doing The Right Thing (TM).

There's no need for us to rehash the standard arguments for/against
bothering with CVEs at all.

The point is that CVE notifications are useful for some of us and
it _seems_ (obviously I can't know) that they're intentionally not
published at the same time as release notes, often a week or more later.

I, and John, are just saying that if possible, it'd be a big help for
them to do so.

Best,
