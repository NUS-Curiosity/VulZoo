Subject: xterm buffer overflow via crafted sixel

howdy! in the hopes of further distributing my computing into
your terminal emulators, i this morning learned that i can
control writes to memory from XTerm's context via the method of
crafted sixel. en garde, i'll let you try my wu-tang style.

this was discovered while working on Notcurses bug #2573:

 https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/issues/2573

an error of mine own led to emission of a corrupted sixel [0], and
spectacular gyrations from XTerm:

==1426124== Invalid write of size 2

I reported this to Mr. Thomas Dickey, the Archfather, and
offered to put a patch together this evening. I also told him I
probably wouldn't bother with a CVE, regarding which I clearly
changed my mind pretty much immediately. Sorry, my good man =\.

This requires that XTerm was built with Sixel support, and that
the XTerm configuration interprets Sixels.
