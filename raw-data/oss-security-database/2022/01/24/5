I don't think it makes much sense for every downstream to make these
kinds of assumptions. Besides, this doesn't seem to be what's
happening in practice. For example, WSA-2021-0006 was released on
October 26, 2021 with vulnerabilities addressed in 2.34.0, released on
September 22, but RedHat's bugs for it were only opened in the days
after the *security advisory's* release, not the software release. It
doesn't help that most most distribution security tooling seems to be
oriented around CVEs, which aren't released for WebKit until after the
associated advisory.

It probably also doesn't help that a lot of WebKit vulnerabilities
also affect Apple products, given many times WebKit advisories are
delayed until after the associated CVEs are made public by Apple
security advisories.
