Subject: CVE-2022-23648: containerd CRI plugin: Insecure handling of image
 volumes

A bug was found in containerd where containers launched through
containerd's CRI implementation with a specially-crafted image
configuration could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files
and directories on the host. This may bypass any policy-based
enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security
Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and
crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation.

Patches
This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10 and 1.4.13. Users
should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

Workarounds
Ensure that only trusted images are used.
