Hello Roxana, thank you, yes, I did hear from Snowflake, perhaps via the
efforts of list readers who helped make connections.

Snowflake has their HackerOne relationship published on:
https://www.snowflake.com/product/security-and-trust-center/
(which I swear I looked for, but was unable to find when looking for it
myself).

HackerOne feels a bit formal for me: not everyone reporting issues is out
for bug bounties and so on -- but having seen more than my fair share of
"all your source code is public" reports, I'm also sympathetic.

Thanks
