Actually I was wrong, this doesn't crash Chromium! But it still crashes 
with a heap buffer overflow in GNOME file explorer and GNOME image 
viewers (anything using gdk-pixbuf really) as said in the previous email 
though.

Here's the CVE number that was attributed by MITRE: CVE-2021-46829.
I've put a copy of the PoC and bug report at 
https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/fuzzing/CVE-2021-46829/CVE-2021-46829.md

Pedro
