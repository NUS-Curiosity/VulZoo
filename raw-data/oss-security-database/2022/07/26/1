Direct contact is usually banned by
https://www.hackerone.com/policies/code-of-conduct

"Only contact security teams through approved channels

Only use approved communication channels. Unless the program has
intentionally provided a contact method to the Finder, contacting
security teams “out-of-band” is a violation of this CoC. Approved
communication channels will be outlined within the program policy page
or otherwise notified by the customer, should nothing be specifically
mentioned, all Finders must assume that the HackerOne platform is the
only approved channel."
