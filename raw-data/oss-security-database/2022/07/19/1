Hello, if anyone has friends or acquaintances at snowflakedb, please
direct their attention to:

https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/issues/619
"Please add a SECURITY.md file and security policy"

I don't know if what I found is actually an issue but I'd like to give
them a chance to see it privately before telling the whole world. I've
not had much luck with the Usual Methods so far.

Everyone else: *please* take five minutes to write down how you'd like
people to report security issues. Some people subscribe to the "security
bugs are just bugs, report them like any other" philosophy. Some people
want a chance to look at potential security issues privately, first.

Whatever you'd like, please just write it down someplace obvious.

Thanks
