 an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets

Hi,

it appears the underlying bug is in Apache Commons bcel and not in Apache Xalan
itself. See

https://bugs.debian.org/1015860

and

https://github.com/apache/commons-bcel/pull/147

https://github.com/apache/commons-bcel/commit/f3267cbcc900f80851d561bdd16b239d936947f5
