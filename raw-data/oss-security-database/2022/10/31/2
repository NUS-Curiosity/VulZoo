Subject: OPEN SOURCE NTFS-3G SECURITY ADVISORY NTFS3G-SA-2022-0003

A security vulnerability was identified in the open source NTFS-3G and
NTFSPROGS software. The vulnerability was confirmed and resolved. To
our knowledge, this vulnerability has not been exploited.

This vulnerability may allow an attacker using a maliciously crafted
NTFS-formatted image file or external storage to potentially execute
arbitrary privileged code, if the attacker has either local access and
the ntfs-3g binary is setuid root, or if the attacker has physical
access to an external port to a computer which is configured to run
the ntfs-3g binary or one of the ntfsprogs tools when the external
storage is plugged into the computer. This vulnerability results from
incorrect validation of some of the NTFS metadata that could
potentially cause buffer overflow, which could be exploited by an
attacker. Common ways for attackers to gain physical access to a
machine is through social engineering or an evil maid attack on an
unattended computer.

We recommend installing and applying the update with the security
fixes, and advise to follow security guidance and frameworks such as
NIST for assessing and improving an organizationâ€™s abilities to
prevent, detect, and respond to security threats and cyber attacks.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS: All previous versions of open source NTFS-3G
and NTFSPROGS.

This release code is available on :
