Hey, Jason.

Lots of good discussion points there, but let me focus on these last ones, as I
think I am able to address them better than the others. Thanks.

Notice this is my personal opinion, having been a linux-distros member list for
around a year or a bit less.

I think you are taking this backwards. The linux-distros policy is not that the
fix should be kept private until there is a security disclosure, but that the
security implications (that were disclosed to linux-distros) be made public as
soon as the fix is public.

It is about communication, but not only communication. It is also about process
and balancing stability and security.

If distros are supposed to include many different fixes in a very short time
frame, just in order to hide the security implications of a fix, there are
chances of other things breaking because: 1) there are many changes; 2) there
was a short time to get them tested. Don't get this wrong. I also agree that a
good strategy is to release as many fixes as are identified to go to stable@ as
often as possible. But doing it weekly is not feasible for everyone out there.

And if distros ship a new kernel release with a single fix without mentioning
any security implications, honestly, we are already shouting out to attackers:
"hey, we decided this was important enough to include this single fix, look at
that!". And it looks like distros are breaking an embargo that was requested.

I may be wrong on this, but I have the impression that disclosures are on the
hands of the researchers/reporters. They are doing the work you described,
going through fixes, syzkaller and other bug reports, and evaluating their
security implications. Then, they go to security@...nel.org and the policy, as
we mentioned, is that the security implications are not disclosed unless the
reporter does it. Then, linux-distros/distros has the policy that whatever is
posted there must be disclosed to oss-sec after up to 14 days. But it is still
the reporter that does it. I think it is important that we are aware of that in
order to find out how we could get this better or discuss if we should do it at
all.

And the status quo today is this: the reporter is the one who does the
disclosure, distros won't ship a single fix after they have been told about a
security vulnerability (and asked to not communicate its security implications)
without a Coordinated Release Date, and distros won't ship hundreds or
thousands of fixes in a short time frame just in order to release a security
fix and yet hide the security implications.

As I read your last question, and recall the initial message that started this
discussion, I think people were being true to distros@ security policy ideals
when it was asked that reports be made public as fixes were already public.

Cascardo.
