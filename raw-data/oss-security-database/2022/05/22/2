For issues commonly brought to (linux-)distros, we currently only
encounter this sort of conflicting preferences with the Linux kernel
community.  I guess some other projects also release silent fixes that
are only later documented to have known security relevance.  Maybe our
policy plays a role in non-reporting of such issues to distros, or maybe
not.  For example, we generally do not receive reports of
vulnerabilities in Firefox and Chrome/ium to the distros list, but I
don't recall anyone ever expressing any unhappiness about that - neither
those projects nor the distros.  So it's kind of fine?

A bit tired, yes, but that's in part because of us fighting each other's
windmills.
