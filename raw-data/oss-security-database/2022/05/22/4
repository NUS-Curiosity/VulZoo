I've been watching as I was hesitant to muddy the waters as we've
had this discussion many times before and didn't want to be noisy, but
my support is for Greg's suggestion.

We're trying to get the best possible outcome within practical means
and I think it'll serve that aim.

What I ask is that the kernel folks are proactive in reaching out to us if they
think people start to suspect, too.

I'd also like to ask that the final commit messages please reference any
relevant CVEs or at least the security impact. There've been a fair number
of incidents where such information is stripped and it makes tracking
issues *really* hard.

This would make a big difference to us in distributions. I hope this can
be considered.
