I (and ajak) have expressed some frustration with how WebKit handles
their disclosures but that's not something you (or *-distros) is able
to control.

From what I understand of Firefox and Chromium, they both have
sufficient CI abilities and internal review to not have the same kind
of problem the kernel has (with its open development model).
