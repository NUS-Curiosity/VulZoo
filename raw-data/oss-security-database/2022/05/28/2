Luckily, this is mostly not the case with (linux-)distros since all
messages relayed by the list are encrypted to their recipients' keys.

I say "mostly" because of possible two-stage attacks - where someone got
only temporary access to a subscriber's computer to compromise the
private key, but then targets their provider(s) for continued access to
encrypted messages.

Yes, I recall you had suggested that, and it's within consideration.
