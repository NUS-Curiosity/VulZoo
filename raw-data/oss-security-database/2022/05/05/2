Subject: DPDK CVE-2022-0669 Release Notice

A vulnerability was fixed in DPDK.
Some downstream stakeholders were warned in advance
in order to coordinate the release of fixes
and reduce the vulnerability window.

It's an issue in the handling of vhost-user inflight type messages. A malicious vhost-user master can attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master could exhaust available fd in the vhost-user slave process and lead to a DoS.
