Subject: DPDK CVE-2021-3839 Release Notice

A vulnerability was fixed in DPDK.
Some downstream stakeholders were warned in advance
in order to coordinate the release of fixes
and reduce the vulnerability window.

In DPDK Vhost communication, we didn't test if msg->payload.inflight.num_queues is out of bounds in function 'vhost_user_set_inflight_fd()', and could cause the program to write OOB.
