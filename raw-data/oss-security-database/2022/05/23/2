Hi all

Regarding keeping the security relevance of the patch secret.

Something we are working on now (as the Google CNA) is to automatically
generate CVEs for Syzkaller findings that meet some criteria (unique, with
reproducer, and with some heuristics to determine the type of crash, eg
KASAN+uaf). We would also monitor advisories from distros to catch
duplicate CVEs and not issue them in those cases.

The reason I mention it in this list is because a CVE would be issued (and
maybe communicated to oss-security@ to avoid duplicate CVEs), which might
also automatically break embargos. That said, I hope that's OK, as
Syzkaller is just a subset of security vulnerabilities being disclosed on
the Kernel.

If you have feedback about the overall concept, please send it off-list (or
start a new thread) as to avoid derailing the topic, but I wanted to bring
it up because it might appear as willing violations of Embargo on the new
linux-distros@ process being proposed.

Regards
