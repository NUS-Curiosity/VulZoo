According to Apple's security advisories for this (e.g. [1]), this
issue is tracked on the Webkit Bugzilla as 243557 [2] which was opened
on 2022-08-04. A few minutes after that bug was opened, a pull request
on GitHub was linked [3] with a patch which also seems to add unit
tests. So, it appears to me that this issue was public since at least
August 4th, and even more widely publicized with Apple's security
advisories on August 17.

WebKit-2.36.6 was released shortly after the first bug report, on
2022-08-07, and WebKit-2.36.7 was released yesterday, on 2022-08-25.

With this bug seemingly being publicly known to be an actively
exploited code execution issue, why did it take several weeks and 2
WebKit releases to get this issue fixed and a WSA released?
