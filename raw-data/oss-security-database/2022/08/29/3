Subject: CVE-2022-28199: DPDK mlx5 driver error recovery handling vulnerability

A vulnerability was fixed in DPDK.
Some downstream stakeholders were warned in advance
in order to coordinate the release of fixes
and reduce the vulnerability window.

When having a failure with the mlx5 driver,
the error recovery was not handled properly,
which can allow a remote attacker to cause denial of service
and some impact to data integrity and confidentiality.
