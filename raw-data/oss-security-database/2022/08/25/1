While the message above included PoC code, there's now also a blog post
and GitHub repo with a full exploit:

https://blog.theori.io/research/CVE-2022-32250-linux-kernel-lpe-2022/
https://github.com/theori-io/CVE-2022-32250-exploit

"In this post, we have shown the process of exploiting CVE-2022-32250.
We were able to leak KASLR and overwrite modprobe_path by utilizing the
mqueue functions, and as a result, we successfully gained root
privileges in Ubuntu 22.04."
