Hi, please keep in mind the list content guidelines:

"At least the most essential part of your message (e.g., vulnerability detail and/or exploit) should be directly included in the message itself (and in plain text), rather than only included by reference to an external resource. Posting links to relevant external resources as well is acceptable, but posting only links is not. Your message should remain valuable even with all of the external resources gone."

Do you have any upstream references or commits of the fix?
