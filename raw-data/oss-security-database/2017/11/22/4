 exponentiation result (Exp() in math/big pkg)

Peter,

It is available: https://github.com/guidovranken/bignum-fuzzer

It has a modular set-up, meaning individual bignum libraries can
easily be added, removed, enabled or disabled.
I'll write some documentation soon, but you can probably figure out
the module layout from looking at the existing ones.
Compiling your code must result in a static archive that can be linked
to the other objects. If that really is not possible, you must come up
with some sort of inter-process communication.
Feel free to create a PR for your own module and I'll add it.

Thanks

Guido
