The main difference in my mind is that when you "cp" a file, you expect
it to create a new file. Likewise with patch it tells you that the
rejects were saved in a new file.

Editing a file in-place should not create *another* file in the current
directory with a different name/suffix. I realize that's subjective, but
a lot of (even long time) users will tell you that no way in hell did
they expect that to happen. (What's the argument against using a
subdirectory of $HOME to store these temporary files?)
