The argument is knee-capped by CVE being slowly and incrementally assigned.

The cost of incremental change is nowhere near as visible to vendors. 
They just patch issues one by one equally as slowly then blame the end 
users for not upgrading/patching firmware. When the firmware upgrade 
process itself is shrouded by lots of scary warnings and technical 
actions that prevent home users doing it.


The stick doesn't work too well with vendors and distributors. Too much 
greed these days. And that means the carrot works better - we just have 
to figure out what the best carrot looks like.
