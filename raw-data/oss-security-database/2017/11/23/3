I read this thread thinking this was still from June, so I thought I
would just go ahead and report this upstream already:

https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/174

I should also mention that I haven't been able to reproduce with
valgrind, in Debian Wheezy, which uses exiv 0.23. I wasn't able to
compile exiv2 with ASAN there either, so that could be why I can't
reproduce.
