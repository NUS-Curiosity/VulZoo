This is actually interesting:
nvi saves recovery files to /var/tmp/vi.recover and creates them with
600 permissions.
So all the problems discussed don't really apply here.
However the dir itself gets created by the first user using nvi. Not
sure if that causes any other problems (permissions are rwx for all and
sticky bit).
