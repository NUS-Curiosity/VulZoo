By default[1], when vim wants to overwrite the file "foo", it does:

   rename("foo", "foo~")                   = 0
   open("foo", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE, 0600) = 3

There's a race window between the two syscalls when the attacker could 
re-create "foo", and then vim would happily write to it.

Is this the attack you meant?

NB, vim disables this behavior for files in /tmp (but not /var/tmp)[2].
