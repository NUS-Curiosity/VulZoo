Hello again list,

Here's a video on how I bypassed KASLR and got root using only  
CVE-2017-5123, a non-controlled arbitrary write (though 0's are  
written), without a single read.

"This exploit uses solely CVE-2017-5123, a Linux kernel vulnerability  
for 4.12-4.13, which gives an attacker a write-not-what-only-where  
primitive, or in other words, the ability to write non-controlled user  
data to arbitrary kernel memory.
KASLR is bypassed using memory probing and root obtained via cred  
struct spraying and location predictability.

I may write a more detailed write-up if people seem interested. :)

Thanks,
Federico Bento.
