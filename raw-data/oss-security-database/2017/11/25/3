bugs.exim.org/2199 :
  Use-after-free remote-code-execution
  CVE-2017-16943

bugs.exim.org/2201 :
  stack-exhaustion remote DoS
  CVE-2017-16944

Fix for the former has been confirmed by the reporter and is in git.

The `exim-4_89+fixes` branch used by various OS packagers for major
bug-fixes on top of the 4.89 release has the UAF fix backported.  Work
on the DoS is under way.

Jeremy has created a `4.next` branch with work for 4.91, which includes
re-working the API for the allocator which allowed the use-after-free to
creep in.
