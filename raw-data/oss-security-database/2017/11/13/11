Tracked down the -7533 issue as well, it was a fat-finger in the data.
The wiki page is updated with correct info. But the new table is:

Date	All
Number of reports	24
Average embargo time (first public)	5.84
Average embargo time (oss-security)	6.95

2017-06	2017-07	2017-08	2017-09	2017-10
1	3	6	9	5
10.84	4.69	6.39	5.83	4.90
14.16	5.03	6.39	5.84	9.31
