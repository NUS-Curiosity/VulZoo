Subject: CVE-2017-15095:  further deserialisation attacks against
 jackson-databind (follow-up to CVE-2017-7525)

In July, deserialisation vulnerabilities were disclosed affecting
jackson-databind [1], assigned CVE-2017-7525.  These were patched
upstream by blacklisting vulnerable classes, resulting in release 2.8.9
and the issue was closed.  Various downstreams including Red Hat issued
a fix at this point.

But blacklists being what they are, a further set of dangerous classes
have been added since (all included in release 2.9.1).  The further
patches reference the original ticket, but given that security releases
have already been issued for CVE-2017-7525 based on 2.8.9, we thought it
prudent to issue a new CVE ID covering the additional classes:
CVE-2017-15095.


This issue and CVE-2017-7525 were reported by Liao Xinxi of NSFOCUS.


Note that there is a mitigation addressing both of these CVEs described
at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462702#c12
