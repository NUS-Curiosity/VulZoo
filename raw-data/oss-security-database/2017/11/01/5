We've been spending decades fixing filesystem races that arise from
cases where people use temporary files in world-writable directories.
You have to get a half dozen things exactly correct in order to use
/tmp.  Why take the risk?  Doesn't every normal (human) user account
have a home directory that is already protected?

Glad to hear at least some implementations are safe.  But that is just
one of several potential issues.

I hope they got the TOCTOU correct...

And as Alexander pointed out, /tmp is a bad place to put recovery
files because everything is often wiped from /tmp at reboot.  


What's wrong with ~/.vim/ ??  You've argued that /tmp is OK, but
haven't given a reason why ~/.vim/ is bad.  I suppose you could argue
that ~/.vim/{full-system-path-of-file} could get too long for the
underlying filesystem.  Fine, then store these files as
~/.vim/{hmac-sha-256-of-full-system-path} and call it a day.
