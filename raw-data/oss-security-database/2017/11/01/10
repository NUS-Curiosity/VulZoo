Some installs don't allow users to write to /tmp. For example, some
machines on GCC's compile farm do not allow it. I seem to recall the
error was a RO mount. Also see https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm.

Code and scripts certainly need to check TMPDIR and then have a
fallback strategy if it is missing.
