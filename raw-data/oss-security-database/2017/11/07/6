I've reported this to the Debian bug tracking system,
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=881097

In Ubuntu, libnet-ping-external is in the unsupported 'universe' archive
area, making it unlikely to be fixed there regardless of its status in
Debian.

For what it's worth, Debian's archive maintenance software says nothing
in unstable, stable or oldstable depends on this package, so there is no
particular barrier to removing it (and bugs in it hopefully only affect
locally-installed scripts, not anything else in Debian).
