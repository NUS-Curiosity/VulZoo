I hate to ask, but why are you getting CVEs for bugs fixed over a year
ago, and are already in all stable kernel releases a year ago?  Why does
it matter?

Unless you happen to have a product that doesn't ever do kernel updates
from the stable trees, and well, then you know what you are doing and
don't need CVEs assigned either, right?  :)
