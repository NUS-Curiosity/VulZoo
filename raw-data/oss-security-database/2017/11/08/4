SECURITY-499
Jenkins stores metadata related to "people", which encompasses actual user 
accounts, as well as users appearing in SCM, in directories corresponding 
to the user ID on disk. These directories used the user ID for their name 
without additional escaping. This potentially resulted in a number of 
problems, such as the following:
1. User names consisting of a single forward slash would have their user 
record stored in the parent directory; deleting this user deleted all user 
records.
2. User names containing character sequences such as .. could be used to 
clobber other configuration files in Jenkins.
3. User names could consist of reserved names such as COM (on Windows).

SECURITY-641
Autocompletion suggestions for text fields were not escaped, resulting in a 
persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability if the source for the 
suggestions allowed specifying text that includes HTML metacharacters like 
less-than and greater-than characters.
