Subject: [SECURITY] [CVE-2017-15701] Apache Qpid Broker-J Denial of Service Vulnerability

CVE-2017-15701: Apache Qpid Broker-J denial of service vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.1.3, and 6.1.4

Description:

The broker does not properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0
frames.  A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause
the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate.
Older AMQP protocols are not affected.

Resolution:

Users who have AMQP 1.0 support enabled (default) should upgrade their
Qpid Broker-J to version 6.1.5 or later.

Mitigation:

If upgrading the broker is not possible, users can choose to disable
AMQP 1.0 by either setting the system property
"qpid.plugin.disabled:protocolenginecreator.AMQP_1_0" to "true",
excluding "AMQP_1_0" from the supported protocol list on all AMQP
ports, or by removing the AMQP 1.0 related jar files from the Java
classpath.
