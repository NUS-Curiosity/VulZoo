Subject: Stored XSS vulnerability in Tine 2.0 Community Edition <= 2017.08.3

Hi,

there are security issues in Tine 2.0 Community Edition <= 2017.08.3
(https://github.com/tine20/Tine-2.0-Open-Source-Groupware-and-CRM/)


Stored XSS vulnerability via IMG tag at "History" of Profile, Calendar,
Tasks and CRM allows an authenticated user to inject JavaScript which is
triggered by the application administrator and other users.

Stored XSS vulnerability via IMG tag at "Leadname" of CRM allows an
authenticated user to inject JavaScript which is triggered by the
application administrator and other users.

Stored XSS vulnerability via IMG tag at "Filename" of Filemanager allows
an authenticated user to inject JavaScript which is triggered by the

The issues are fixed in Tine Community Edition 2017.08.4.


Until now vendor has not marked the new version as security update and
also not mentioned the security issues.

I've requested CVE IDs (MITRE), but I have not received any yet.
