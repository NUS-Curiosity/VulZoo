Sorry for the delay, I was away for the last few weeks.

Thanks! I've added a paragraph about reporting the bug to these mailing lists.

Added a note on this.

See Greg's reply below.

I assumed they assign CVEs from their own pool and then can make it
public on request. I'm not sure whether they share it with MITRE and
ask to keep it private or not share it at all. Perhaps someone else
can clarify this.

FYI, The last CVE I requested from linux-distros (CVE-2017-1000112)
can't be found in MITRE database:
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000112

Added a note to read all of the lists guidelines carefully before
reporting anything.

Thanks! I added a paragraph for those who just want to report the bug
and forget about it.

So at this point it's OK to report network bugs to security@k.o and
ask for embargo? It would be nice to not having to handle network bugs
in some special way.

I've updated the document, more comments are welcome:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/linux_kernel_reporting_bugs.md

Thanks!
