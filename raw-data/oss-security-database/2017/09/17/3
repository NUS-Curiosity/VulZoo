I was under impression that having a CVE ID speeds up processes in 
distros, and fixes are released quicker. That's why for my previous (and 
first ever) vulnerability I first got an ID and only then released the 
details and the patch. The assignment took just a day.

Was my impression wrong? I just want to do things "right", so that 
attackers have as little time as possible to exploit users. (I do 
realize this all is best-effort and distros might still take time to 
release, and then users might take ages to upgrade.)

Now that I had an experience of waiting for three weeks, I'll also 
re-consider if I want to become a CNA for my project. Previously it 
seemed like a hassle; I'm not so sure now.
