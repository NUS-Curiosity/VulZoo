I think that's not a reason to delay disclosing an issue to everyone
else until there's a CVE ID.  If those orgs have such poor, limited, or
maybe cost-saving processes (saving on not needing to bother with issues
lacking CVE IDs, no matter how serious), it's their problem and their
users'.  They deliberately put themselves at a competitive disadvantage.
So be it.  This only reaffirms me in my suggested approach: public
disclosure first, CVE next.  So those big corps will have a reason to
fix the issues anyway, just with their self-imposed delay.
