Subject: Re: Podbeuter podcast fetcher: remote code execution

I never spoke or advocated about delaying things or timelines and CVEs except in the sense I'd like to make it easier and get CVEs attached to things fast so that issues can be disclosed ASAP, ideally with a CVE. I want to have my cake, and eat it, and share it with everyone else.
