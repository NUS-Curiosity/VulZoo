While this should not be the case, it often is. And TBH this is one of the
reasons I'm trying to make CVE easier.

This is also not true, many orgs (probably not open source distros run by
volunteers, but more big corps) literally do have a clock start ticking
when a CVE comes to light, I know for Red Hat it doesn't matter if the
issue has a CVE or not (we obviously prefer to have one as it makes talking
about it and coordinating a response easier), but I can't speak for others
obviously.

Yup.
