Hi Hanno,
The detail of your report was good quality and I'm sure appreciated by
everyone who needed to review it. I know that for Red Hat the
pre-disclosure was useful.

During analysis, like SUSE, we rated it as having a security impact of
Moderate (https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification);
and not highly impacting that required expedited preparation of packages
for the embargo date. Additional information is contained within the
bugzilla linked off our CVE page
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490344).

We look forward to working with you again in the future.

Regards,
Cliff
