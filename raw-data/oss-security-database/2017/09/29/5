I'm surprised by this. When I saw the ibb-data bounty I immediately
wondered whether ffmpeg should be in there.

Is there a reason libav is in and ffmpeg is not? Were there concerns by
the ffmpeg devs? (I'm not taking a side in the libav/ffmpeg wars, but
my impression is that many distros who had used libav for some time
have switched back and ffmpeg is clearly the more widely used of the
forks.)

Given that imagemagick+graphicsmagick are already in there I assume
there's no general problem for IBB to support competing forks.

At the very least I'd recommend that you make sure all ibb-reports for
libav get tested against ffmpeg.
