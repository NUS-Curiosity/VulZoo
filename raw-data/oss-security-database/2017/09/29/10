Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2017-9797 Apache Geode client/server authentication vulnerability

CVE-2017-9797 Apache Geode client/server authentication vulnerability

Severity: Medium
CVSS Base Score 6.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H)

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Geode 1.0.0 through 1.2.0

Description:
When a cluster is operating in secure mode, an unauthenticated client
can enter multi-user authentication mode and send metadata messages.
These metadata operations could leak information about application
data types.  In addition, an attacker could perform a denial of
service attack on the cluster.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.2.1 or later.

Credit:
This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Geode Security Team
by Dan Smith from Pivotal.
