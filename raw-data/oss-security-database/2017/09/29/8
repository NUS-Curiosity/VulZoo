The simple reason being is it gets rid of all the chaff and time wasters.
Anyone can run a fuzzer and find a crash case. That's not what we need, we
need a root cause analysis that identifies where in the code it failed, or
a reliable exploit that causes code exec so we can do the research and
actually figure out if this is exploitable or not. Their money, their rules.

I think you're forgetting about the cost of analyzing a lot of false
positives. This is why I push back and ask for more information on a lot of
CVE requests now.
