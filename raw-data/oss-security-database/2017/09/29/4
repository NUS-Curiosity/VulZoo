Subject: clamav: Out of bounds read and segfault in xar parser

Hi,

A malformed xar file can cause an out of bounds heap read in clamav (as
usual detectable with asan). If run against a non-asan build clamscan
will still segfault in my tests. Found with afl.

The bug happens in the function xar_hash_check. Despite it being
reported more than a year ago there's still no release with the fix
(however it's been fixed in git).

I fuzzed clamav according to the instructions in this blog post:
https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/06/13/finding-pearls-fuzzing-clamav/

Upstream fix:
https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-devel/commit/d96a6b8bcc7439fa7e3876207aa0a8e79c8451b6

2016-06-15 reported bug
2016-06-21 fix in git
2017-09-29 public disclosure due to lack of upstream action

fear of crashing people's mail scanners. On the other hand I'm sure
there are mail scanners that'll try to decode the base64...):

Meta-level comment:
It seems to me clamav development has mostly stalled. Detection rates
are very low and I'm considering to stop using it for mail filtering.
(also there's of course the whole AV debate, however I never saw
clamav as a security tool, more as something like a spam filter that
prevents crap in my inbox. Still of course it needs to have secure
parsers.)
