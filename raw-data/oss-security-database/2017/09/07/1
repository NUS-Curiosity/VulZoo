Subject: [ANN] Apache Struts 2.3.34 General Availability with Security Fixes Release

The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.3.34 is
available as a “General Availability” release. The GA designation is
our highest quality grade.

This release addresses these potential security vulnerabilities:
- S2-050 A regular expression Denial of Service when using
URLValidator (similar to S2-044 & S2-047)
- S2-051 A remote attacker may create a DoS attack by sending crafted
xml request when using the Struts REST plugin
- S2-052 Possible Remote Code Execution attack when using the Struts
REST plugin with XStream handler to handle XML payloads
- S2-053 A possible Remote Code Execution attack when using an
unintentional expression in Freemarker tag instead of string literals

This release contains several minor improvements just to mention few of them:
 - Struts2 JSON Plugin: Send Map with Strings as Key to JSON Action is
ignored, Numeric Keys will work and mapped
 - Threads get blocked due to unnecessary synchronization in OgnlRuntime
 - Upgrade to OGNL 3.0.21
 - Upgrade to struts-master 11
 - Improve RegEx used to validate URLs

More details in version notes
http://struts.apache.org/docs/version-notes-2334.html

All developers are strongly advised to perform this action.

The 2.3.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum
requirement of the following specification versions: Servlet API 2.4,
JSP API 2.0, and Java 6.
Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts
framework, please post your comments to the user list, and, if
appropriate, file a tracking ticket.

You can download this version from our download page.
