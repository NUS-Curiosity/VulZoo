It is incredibly difficult for most non-commercial upstreams to do 
this since they have limited manpower, they are not informed of all 
the applicable CVEs, and the CVE information received is essentially 
hearsay, received from unknown/unverifiable sources.  I am thinking 
that it is best for most non-commercial upstreams to not mention CVEs 
at all.

If someone (e.g. with identity 'bugmeister@...d.cn') informs me (an 
upsteam maintainer) that some particular bug has been assigned a 
particular CVE then how can I know that to be a fact?
