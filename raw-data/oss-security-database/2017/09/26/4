https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/linux is
probably not comprehensive either, but should include all the
non-embargoed CVEs and other vulnerabilities that the Debian security team
is aware of, including vulnerabilities that were assessed as too minor
to justify a Debian security advisory.

(The same works for any other Debian source package, e.g.
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/ioquake3 is
a less extreme case.)
