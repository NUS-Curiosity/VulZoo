Subject: CVE-2017-12154 Kernel: kvm: nVMX: L2 guest could access hardware(L0)
 CR8 register

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the KVM virtualisation support(CONFIG_KVM), with 
nested virtualisation(nVMX) feature enabled(nested=1), is vulnerable to a 
crash due to disabled external interrupts. As L2 guest could access(r/w) 
hardware CR8 register of the host(L0).

In a nested virtualisation setup, L2 guest user could use this flaw to 
potentially crash the host(L0) resulting in DoS.
