Uhm. Where to begin. Ok, well for one thing just because we can't have 100%
perfect coverage doesn't mean we should simply give up. Also CVE's aren't
"hearsay", they are claims based, with evidence being needed (the stronger
the claim, the more likely you are to get a CVE), especially in the open
source world where I typically require a link to either the vuln code, or
the code patch in order to give a CVE to something (if you can't tell me
what code is vuln, in open source, then chances are you need to understand
the vuln more before we CVE it up, exceptions of course can be made, e.g.
when someone has a reproducer that works reliably).

This is also why I've been pushing for a JSON format so we have better meta
data in CVE, for things like affected projects/product so people can much
more easily monitor what they do care about. It's not done yet but we are
making progress.

You can check the CVE Database? There is the official MITRE one:
cve.mitre.org and the DWF for Open Source (and yes, I lag in submissions to
MITRE) at https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Database/ in
both cases the CVEs will have reference link(s) that ideally point to the
upstream making it easy to match up.
