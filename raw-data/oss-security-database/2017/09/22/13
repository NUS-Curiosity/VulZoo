Subject: CVE-2017-14489: Linux kernel: scsi: nlmsg is not properly parsed in
 iscsi_if_rx()

Heololo,

It was found that the iscsi_if_rx() function in 'drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c'
in the Linux kernel since v2.6.24-rc1 through 4.13.2 allows local users to cause
a denial of service (a system panic) by making a number of certain syscalls by
leveraging incorrect length validation in the kernel code.

Our tests show that indeed an unprivileged local user can easily cause (i.e. run a binary)
a system panic or a compete lock up. A wide range of kernel versions is affected, from
v2.6.24-rc1 till the latest ones.
