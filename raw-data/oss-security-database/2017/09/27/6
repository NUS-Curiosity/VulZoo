Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2017-12621 Apache Commons Jelly connects to URL with
 custom doctype definitions.

CVE-2017-12621: Apache Commons Jelly connects to URL with custom doctype definitions.

Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
commons-jelly-1.0 (core), namely commons-jelly-1.0.jar

Description:
During Jelly (xml) file parsing with Apache Xerces, if a custom doctype entity is declared with a “SYSTEM” entity with a URL and that entity is used in the body of the Jelly file, during parser instantiation the parser will attempt to connect to said URL. This could lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The Open Web Application Security Project suggests that the fix be https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#XMLReader

Mitigation:
1.0 users should migrate to 1.0.1.

Example:

example.jelly
