This is standard operating procedure for Red Hat, at least.  Generally
days or even weeks pass before patches are released.   If you're an
"Extended Update Support" customer you can expect months to go by.  If
you're super lucky you'll get a systemtap script to play with, but that
generally requires a kernel RCE.
