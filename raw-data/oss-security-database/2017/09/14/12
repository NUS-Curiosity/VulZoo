I disagree. I am considering cleaning up mp3gain and omitting nearly
all of the vulnerabilities by removing the decoder fork. Reason: rgain
does not do what mp3gain did. Mp3gain can directly modify the MPEG
frames so that the gain is changed also for decoders that do not
support the added metadata (it additionally stores metadata to be able
to revert the changes).

While I am not regularily using this myself, I do think that it's a
nifty hack that should not disappear. Maybe it can re-enter distros if
it does not rely on an outdated internal decoder … 

This is becoming a bit off-topic … but I just wanted to note that the
bug reports do serve a purpose in alerting me to that other copy of
mpg123 code in the wild.


Alrighty then,

Thomas
