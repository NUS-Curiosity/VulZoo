Subject: mp3gain: memcpy-param-overlap in set_pointer (mpglibDBL/common.c)

Additionally to the previous discovered bugs there a memcpy-param-overlap. Under a non-asan build the crash does not occur, so there is no CVE, but you may want to have it fixed in your repository.


Description:
mp3gain is a program to analyze and adjust MP3 files to same volume.

The fuzz was done via the aacgain command-line tool which uses mp3gain which bundles an old-modified version of mpg123 called mpglibDBL.
The upstream project seems to be dead, so the issue wasnâ€™t communicated to them.

The complete ASan output of the issue:
