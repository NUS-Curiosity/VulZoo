Subject: Re: mp3gain: NULL pointer dereference in sync_buffer
 (mpglibDBL/interface.c)

Hi Agostino,

thanks for pointing out that mp3gain is yet another user of an outdated
fork of mpg123 code. But this time with a twist: This again seems to be
a lifted version of the modified mpg123 code from Lame! A forked fork.

I'll have a look if I can rip that mpglib out of mp3gain and provide a
patch that uses an up-to-date libmpg123 for parsing instead. This would
perhaps be a better path forward for distros than to remove the
vulnerable mp3gain altogether.

An impressive list of vulnerabilities you have there … perhaps some
specific to mp3gain's modifications, but I guess the overflows in
layer3.c are well-known already from mpg123 and Lame.


Alrighty then,

Thomas
