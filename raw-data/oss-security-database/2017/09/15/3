I agree. And I wish all vendors had such short time frames for releasing
patches.
Unfortunately this is not the case.

On top of this, it was unclear to us whether the linux-distros mailing list
would be able to coordinate the kernel patch, so we chose to contact both
lists, which required the 7 day embargo period.

In any case, we respect the need for a short embargo period, and in this
case we disclosed the issues 7 days prior to publication.
