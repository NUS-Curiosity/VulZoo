It is important to keep in mind that CVEs are issued against 
"products".  There might be a CVE issued against a software version 
distributed by Red Hat or Debian which is not applicable to the 
upstream version.  Since each distribution patches their version it is 
difficult to know the "product" that a particular CVE is applicable 
to.

I agree that in my personal experience upstream maintainers are rarely 
involved in the CVE process.
