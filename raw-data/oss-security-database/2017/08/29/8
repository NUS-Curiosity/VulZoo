I'm currently fuzzing LAME with help from Robert Hegemann who is upstream. I
understand that the latest LAME release in the web page is from 2012, but
hopefully we will get a new release after the fuzzing is finished. If there are
any outstanding issues from your fuzzing feel free to contact me and I can
verify that those are fixed in the CVS version of it (link below). I can check
your blog for related issues at least. Robert has been fixing the issues very
quickly after reports. I also plan to fuzz other argument combinations. Maybe
we can even include LAME to oss-fuzz later on if upstream agrees.

All feedback is welcome regarding my fuzzing activities. You can also contact
me via IRC in e.g. #afl-users in Freenode if you want to participate in CVS
build fuzzing. If not I can also notify you after the next release.

Maybe giving them a link for documentation how to avoid this in the future.
