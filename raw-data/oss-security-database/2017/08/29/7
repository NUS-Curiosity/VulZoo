Actually no, that is incorrect. Please see the CVE counting rules, it's a
LOT more nuanced than "CVEs are issued against products". THe docs are at

https://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/counting_rules.html

TL;DR: CNT1 comes into play and you get situations like libxml/gzip being
embedded all over the place, but only a single CVE because 1) it's a single
code based that's copied everywhere and 2) pragmatism.

Something I am trying to change. If you are an upstream and you want to
become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for your project(s) please contact
me.
