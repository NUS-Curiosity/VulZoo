Hi.

Since you mentioned some issues reported by me, let me answer directly.
For the first, it is an undefined behavior, so actually you don't see the 
crash.
Nowadays, the undefined behavior issues do not get anymore a CVE.


For the second, ASAN reports that the program want to use more that 64GB of 
ram to execute the process so ASAN hangs the process. In this case is up to 
the maintainer check whether there is a problem in the code or not, or it is 
expected. The better double-check would be verify what happens without ASAN.

I'd like also to mention that MITRE assigns CVE after they analyze the 
reported issue, so if an issue does not deserve a CVE, MITRE probably won't 
assign accompanied by an explanation.
