Subject: Cve issue discussion

Hello,


I am curious about issuing CVEs.

I can see that a "NULL pointer dereference" or a bug where the exploit has not been verified also get a CVE.


heap-overflows may or may not be exploitable.


It takes a lot of time to analyze the exploit and create the exploit code.


Is it right to be assigned a CVE only if it is exploitable?


Or do you think all bugs need to get a CVE?


Thanks.
