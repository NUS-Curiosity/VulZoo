Somehow we almost didn't have this sort of messages - someone seeking an
open source security tool - sent in here so far.  Do we want them in
here going forward?  The current list content guidelines do not address
this possibility, as it certainly wasn't the purpose of the oss-security
list so far.  Is there another mailing list where the above message
would have been more appropriate?

Meanwhile, please feel free to address the actual question about the
tool.  (I don't know of such a tool.)
