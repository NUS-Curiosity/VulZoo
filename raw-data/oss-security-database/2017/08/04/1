Subject: Reporting and disclosing Linux kernel vulnerabilities

Hi!

It's not completely clear to me how to properly report and disclose
Linux kernel security issues. There are a few different parties [1, 2,
3] that need to be informed and coordinated. I couldn't find a
publicly available actionable list of steps, so I've outlined it as I
see it here:

https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/linux_kernel_reporting_bugs.md#reporting-security-bugs

Thoughts? Comments?

Thanks!
