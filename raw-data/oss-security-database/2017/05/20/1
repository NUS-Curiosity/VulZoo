Subject: ImageMagick: CVE-2017-9098: use of uninitialized memory in RLE
 decoder

Hi

Chris Evans discovered that ImageMagick uses unitialized memory in the
RLE decoder, allowing an attacker to leak sensitive information from
process memory space. There is missing initialization in the
ReadRLEImage function.

Upstream fix:

For reference and for list archivng purpose I'm attaching the text
part of the finding.

Regards,
Salvatore
