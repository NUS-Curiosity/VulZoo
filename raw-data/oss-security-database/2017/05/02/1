  The mention of vte reminded me of a security issue I reported a while 
 back in the evilvte emulator - shell execution via improper quotation
 handling in hyperlinks:

    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=854585

  I didn't ask for a CVE ID because the process seems a bit more
 complicated these days, but perhaps topical.
