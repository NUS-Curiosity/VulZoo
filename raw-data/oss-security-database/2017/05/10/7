Subject: Re: Numerous FreeTDS crashes fixed on master

I was asked what software this affects.

Perl DBI - http://www.peppler.org/freeware/dbd-sybase.html <http://www.peppler.org/freeware/dbd-sybase.html>
Ruby DBI w/ Sybase - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/721960/connecting-to-sql-server-with-activerecord <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/721960/connecting-to-sql-server-with-activerecord>
Python-Sybase - http://python-sybase.sourceforge.net/index.html <http://python-sybase.sourceforge.net/index.html>

Other languages have less-official bindings.

Also, obviously the tsql binary if used to connect to an untrusted MSSQL/Sybase server.
