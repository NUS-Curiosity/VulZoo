Subject: Re: Linux kernel: stack buffer overflow with
 controlled payload in get_options() function

init=/bin/bash -- arguments for bash running as real root

If a memory corruption bug via a kernel line option is a vulnerability,
so is this. It's a vulnerability in the verified boot implementation if
there's attacker control over the kernel line to this extent.

Even if we're going to treat memory corruption specially, you can
corrupt memory simply via crazy configuration on the kernel command
line... that is parsed properly, but then breaks at runtime. You can
also happily disable features like rodata to make your life easier,
since... you control the kernel line. I can't understand what kind of
threat model considers these valid CVEs.
