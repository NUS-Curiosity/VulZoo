Also not sure what you mean by patches. Secure boot doesn't require
applying patches. The kernel has to be verified by an early boot chain
and dm-verity is in mainline for verifying the rest of the OS as Android
and ChromeOS do. Android does have some tweaks for dm-verity but they're
workarounds for bureaucracy rather than true technical requirements.
