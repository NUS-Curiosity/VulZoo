It's a potential Secure Boot bypass, so it matters in some theoretical
sense to some downstreams which carry those Secure Boot patches.

(Although I have yet to see anyone to revoke a signature on a kernel
with known root-to-ring-0 escalations, so the practical impact isn't
large because an attack could still downgrade to a kernel with an
exploitable vulnerability.)
