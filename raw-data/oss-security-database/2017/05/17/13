--- snip ---

Here is a small update to our security advisory.

An additional CVE ID got assigned for the password change finding:
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8879


Meanwhile the Dolibarr developers fixed more possible SQL injection bugs
in this git commit:
https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/commit/fa290c34fad108ec7c0751c0372ae9c4b4f63b06

They still didn't release a fixed version of the Dolibarr software.



For CVE-2017-7886 I don't agree with the CVSS v2 scoring from the NIST.
They rated "Confidentiality Impact" as partial while I think it is
complete as we have full access to all tables.


Regards,
Stefan
