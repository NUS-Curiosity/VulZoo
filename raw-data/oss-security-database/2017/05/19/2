Browsing through the commands rxvt supports, I noticed you can set arbitrary
X11 properties. That seems like the kind of thing some wm or de might trust
for soemthing important (like gtk modules, etc).

e.g.

$ printf "\e]3;%s=TEST\a" TEST_PROPERTY
$ xprop -id $WINDOWID TEST_PROPERTY
TEST_PROPERTY(UTF8_STRING) = "TEST"

The properties Gnome looks at are listed here, maybe you could cause some
confusion this way. Do other environments (Xfce, KDE, etc) support more
interesting properties?
