I think you mean on distros.

OK.

For now, I'll resume NetBSD subscription with you as the only
representative, since we still haven't heard from the other two persons
who were subscribed for NetBSD (no need for them to post to oss-security
now, but at least they can reply on the distros thread if they read it,
or to me personally).  You were on vacation, but they could respond - in
fact, that's an often cited reason to have multiple people subscribed.

I'll e-mail you off-list to figure this out.

Thanks,
