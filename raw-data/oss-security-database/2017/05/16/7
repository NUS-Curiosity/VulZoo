Yup.

It hit my inbox when I'd just come back from 2 weeks vacation.

When it finally got my attention, the mail itself did little to make
me think it was legit, since I saw an attachment and a subject line
that was generic in the extreme. Mentally, I filed it as spam.
Virtually, too.

I saw more traction on oss-security with the same subject, and
realised (too late, I fear) that it wasn't yet another phishing
attempt. I also heard from other channels that people were trying to
contact me.

My fault. Sorry.

The security team at NetBSD have done an analysis, and have our own
comments to make. I'll do that in due course.

I used to be on oss-security. Don't know what happened if I've been thrown off.
