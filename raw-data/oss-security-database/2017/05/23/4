It might be worth noting that in the README file on the documentation
repo.  It wouldn't take long and may prevent confusion in the meantime.

Primarily, freeform discussion of the sort that occurred on this list as
a natural outcropping of the CVE request process led to people linking
to verification code, temporary mitigations, highlighting of incomplete
fixes, and the sort of information that was requested earlier in this
thread.  This ability to easily chip in to ongoing situations wasn't
just useful for mitre staff doing CVE work, it was also useful for the
"community of practice" looking for the latest information regarding
self-defense.  I've prevented more than one attack thanks to a one-off
reply from someone in response to a CVE request.  

The CVE assignment process was more than just a collaborative
database-population effort.  With the shift to webforms and javascript
the natural environment which promoted that discourse is being removed.

Again, I strongly suggest you note on the README that this is the case.
As matters stand the documentation represents itself as accurate.
