The primary goals of the DWF are:

1) Creating CVE Mentors that can do CVE assignments, train other CVE
Mentors, and help create CNAs
2) Creating CNAs for OpenSource so CVE assignments happen as close to
the vulnerability as possible
3) "retail" CVE assignments (e.g. people using iwantacve.org)
4) Publishing that data to MITRE quickly as per the CNA guidelines, and
the community in general (so at a minimum you can just monitor github,
there may be more options moving forwards)

And that's basically it. If people want to monitor the CVEs the DWF
assigns and run a git to email gateway essentially they are welcome to
assuming they get Solar's approval (it's his list so his rules), but
it's out of scope for the DWF at this point.

If people want the cat to have a nice bell they may have to step up and
actually put a bell on the cat.
