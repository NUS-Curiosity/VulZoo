Nobody said that, and I haven't said anything that wasn't said when this
change was first dropped on us.  The difference you're talking around is
that vulnerabilities used to appear on this list of necessity, and now
we either have to hope reporters cross-post or else monitor some number
of different databases and post everything ourselves.  If you'll recall,
this is why it was suggested that non-embargoed webforum submissions
automatically post here.  

But it's clear nobody was interested in making that happen, and now we
get a pile of infrastructure instead.  Que sera sera, but I stand by 
the opinion that the new processes have lost something along the way.

I've submitted a pull request, since that seems to be the primary form
of human communication now.
