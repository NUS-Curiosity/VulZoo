Subject: Re: How to request a CVE for open source projects

Hi,

You can request CVEs for opensource projects via the Mitre webform.

For e.g. the Linux Kernel I just used "Linux" as vendor, for Xen "Xen" and similar.

(and in general:)
Please everyone do the distributors a favour and link to GIT commits with fixes for
the requested CVE or at least explicit single reproducers, as we have increasing trouble
of associating CVEs with the correct place in code.

Ciao, Marcus
