Please report the issues first to their respective developers and
provide the crashing files to them.

tcpdump has a contact address for security issues:
http://www.tcpdump.org/#security

I think radare2 has no specific security reporting process, you can
report it through their github tracker:
https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues

When the bugs are fixed you can post details to this list.
