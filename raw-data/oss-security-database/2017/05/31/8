Subject: Information on recent sqlite3 issues?

Hi,
one of the latest Apple advisories mentions several vulnerabilities in sqlite:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207798

CVE-2017-2513: found by OSS-Fuzz
CVE-2017-2518: found by OSS-Fuzz
CVE-2017-2520: found by OSS-Fuzz
CVE-2017-2519: found by OSS-Fuzz
CVE-2017-6983: Chaitin Security Research Lab (@ChaitinTech) working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative
CVE-2017-6991: Chaitin Security Research Lab (@ChaitinTech) working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative

Does anyone have additional information on those and whether that
applies to the standard sqlite releases or Apple-specific changes?

Cheers,
        Moritz
