Subject: [white-paper] Pwning PHP mail() function For Fun And RCE (ver 1.0)

Here's a paper I wrote back in December.  It was originally meant to go
into Phrack but the team wanted a more general article on parameter injection
as mail() was supposedly an outdated technique.
Meanwhile, the RCE-chain continues :) So I decided to post it as it is without
changing it as mail() injection deserves a separate article imho.

I reveal some exim code-execution vectors in there that should change
the whole game slightly :)

See my exploit for WordPress Core that is based on it:

I'll attach copies of the white-paper here in the next revision as I
haven't slept for 3 nights and need to double check on everything
before it goes into the archive forever :)
