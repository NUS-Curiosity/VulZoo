Subject: CVE-2017-8933 libmenu-cache: socket may be blocked by another user

The socket placed in /tmp is predictable and public-writable. Therefore
if one user placed a symlink to another socket instead of socket for
another use then said another user will either be unable to get menu, or
will receive menu of some other user.

This bug has been assigned to CVE-2017-8933 [1].  A fix has been
committed to menu-cache's git repository [2].  LXDE developers are
working on a release which fixes the problem.
