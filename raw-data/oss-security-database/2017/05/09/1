Subject: lxterminal: insecurely uses /tmp for a socket file

A vulnerability has been found that unixsocket.c in lxterminal insecurely uses
/tmp for a socket file, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
(preventing terminal launch) or possibly have other impact.

This bug has been assigned to CVE-2016-10369 [1], and has been publicly
discussed in Stackexchange website [2].

A bug fix has been committed to the lxterminal's git repository [3], and LXDE
developers are working on a release.
