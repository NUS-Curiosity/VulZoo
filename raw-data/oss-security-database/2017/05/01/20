On a slightly different note; memory corruption/abort() problems might
end up as RCE with some effort, but what *is* RCE is ability to push
back characters into terminal's input buffer. There are some
well-known vectors, like setting title of the current terminal and
printing it back with ESC codes, and hopefully it's something that is
mitigated in all modern terminal emulator software packages for many
years now.

But, it's not something that can be discovered simply by waiting for
SEGV and similar signals. Hence, I'd like to encourage everyone
looking for bugs in terminal emulators to add some form of
instrumentation to their fuzz setups aimed at finding such problems
too.

A harmless example from rxvt - pushing back the new-line character:

$ echo -ne "\eGQ;"
;$ 0
bash: 0: command not found
