It is perhaps worth noting that guided fuzzing has been used in this
space with good results, too. For example, AFL was credited on at
least the following in rxvt, tmux, screen, and mosh:

https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/667

Especially if what's highlighted in this thread can be found with a
simple script, I'm betting there's far more beneath the surface.
Guided fuzzers have the advantage of being able to discover features
that may be undocumented or hard to spot, so a more comprehensive dive
into all the terminal emulators in use today would probably be quite
fruitful.
