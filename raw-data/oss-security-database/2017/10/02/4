Subject: CVE-2017-9807: e2openplugin-OpenWebif: Remote code execution through
 HTTP GET parameter manipulation

Hello all,

e2openplugin-OpenWebif is an open source web interface plugin for IP TVs
and media centers. It is found in several IP TV software images and
hardware products including the commercial Dreambox devices.


A remote code injection vulnerability was found in the "key" HTTP GET
parameter of the "/api/saveconfig" API call.

Further analysis of the vulnerability can be found here:
https://census-labs.com/news/2017/10/02/e2openplugin-openwebif-saveconfig-remote-code-execution/

The vulnerability allows remote code execution on hosts running the
aforementioned plugin. Some devices affected also run the plugin under
root privileges (e.g: Dreambox DM800 HD se), allowing for complete
remote takeover of the host.

This defect has been patched by the vendor with the git commit:
09a050c8f04afd3bb4a14af98994be255aae10d9
(https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/commit/09a050c8f04afd3bb4a14af98994be255aae10d9).

Administrators of affected devices are strongly advised to update their
running instance of e2openplugin-OpenWebif to the latest version of the
code. An official release containing the fix has not been released yet.
