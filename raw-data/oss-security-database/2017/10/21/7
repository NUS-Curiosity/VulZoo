Subject: LAME 3.100 released with security fixes

Hello,

LAME 3.100 has been released including fixes to security vulnerabilities.
Coy-paste from history:

Rog√©rio Brito

- Don't include the debian directory as one that is needed during builds. Patch
taken from Debian's packaging of lame.

- Resurrect Owen Taylor's code dated from 97-11-3 to properly deal with GTK1.
This was transplanted back from aclocal.m4 with a patch provided by Andres
Mejia. This change makes it easy to regenerate autotools' files with a simple
invocation of autoconf -vfi.

- Fix possible race condition causing build failures in libmp3lame. Discovered
in automated builds by the Debian project with patch provided by Andres Mejia.
