Almost none of the so called script languages are interpreted.  They
include a compiler, usually compile the input to some form of byte-code
and executed it within a VM.  But that's just definition.

Raising awareness was one reason why I asked for a CVE id instead of
just fixing it.  rsync, even if the protocol is really bad, is widly
used to mirror all sorts of software.  It is also a generic tool, so the
defaults are there to replicate the input as much as possible, not to be
safe from problematic things.
