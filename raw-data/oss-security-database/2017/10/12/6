Subject: Re: Privilege escalation with kill(-1, SIGKILL) in XNU kernel of macOS High Sierra


One follow-up for the discussion on if this is a DoS or privilege
escalation, in the logs we saw:

    Service exited due to signal: Killed: 9 sent by nix-daemon[54108]

and were able to (inconsistently) reproduce this with other unprivileged
users.

This indicated to us that we hadnâ€™t tripped just a crashing bug, but
actually escalated beyond the normal access control protections of kill.
