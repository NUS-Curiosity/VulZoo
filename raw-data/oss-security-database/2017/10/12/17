Subject: CVE-2017-12188 Kernel: KVM: MMU potential stack buffer overrun during
 page walks

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the KVM virtualisation support(CONFIG_KVM), with 
nested virtualisation(nVMX) feature enabled(nested=1), is vulnerable to a 
stack buffer overflow issue. It could occur while traversing guest page table 
entries to resolve guest virtual address(gva).

A L1 guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS. OR 
potentially execute arbitrary code on the host to gain access to the host 
system.
