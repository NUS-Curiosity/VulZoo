Subject: Re: Fw: Security risk of vim swap files

There's another problem with vim swapfiles.

If you edit a file directly in /tmp, vim will happily read a swapfile 
that were planted there by somebody else. Local users could exploit this 
for denial of service (or maybe worse if there are any swapfile parsing 
bugs...).

Is that a bug in vim? Or is it a user error to edit file directly in 
/tmp?

In the latter case, we should fix at least vipe(1) and vidir(1) from 
moreutils; and run-mailcap(1).
