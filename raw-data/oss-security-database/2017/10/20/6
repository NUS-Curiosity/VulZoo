Whether you think it applies to the current example is obviously a
different debate, but the simple principle is that the script is (arguably)
using the underlying tool unsafely. The tool (rsync in this case) provides
an argument to prevent the "risky" behaviour, but the calling script isn't
using it, potentially opening a vector for misuse.

So if there should be a CVE, it shouldn't be against rsync (as it provides
the means to avoid, and in other cases you may even find the calling script
is overriding the "safe" behaviour) but against the calling script.

To give a fairly limited example, both of these scripts rely on the same
functionality, but one is riskier (albeit not from a security perspective)
- in neither case is the tool at risk

fname=$1
rm -rf "/$1"

...

fname=$1
rm -rf --no-preserve-root "/$1"


Obviously it's quite easy for there to be more severe connotations to other
scripts (for example, think about some of the things you might pass
adduser) which may well be worthy of a CVE by nature of them effectively
misusing a tool.

Back on topic, I can see potential for abuse, though I'm also not convinced
whether it's CVE worthy.

The problem there is setting the threshold. It's not unheard of for a "just
in case" fix to later have proved to have mitigated a more severe (and at
the time, unknown) issue. But gain, whether it needs a CVE is something
else.
