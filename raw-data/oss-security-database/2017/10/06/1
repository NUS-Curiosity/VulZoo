Subject: CVE-2017-15038 Qemu: 9p: virtfs: information disclosure when reading
 extended attributes

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 
File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue. 
It could occur while accessing extended attributes of a file due to a race 
condition.

A user inside guest could use this flaw to disclose uninitialised heap memory 
contents on the host.
