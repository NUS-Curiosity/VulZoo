As you seem to be "shouting" a lot lately, I just like to point out
that using the MITRE(!) form requires the execution of non-free and
unsigned software from various sources.

Some people don't consider this a problem, others do.

... trust your browser's "sandbox" to work as advertised for a change
and ignore the fact that you're running proprietary software that may
or may not be customised just for your system and can't be easily
audited in advance.

TL;DR: Not everyone wants to allow remote code execution just to
request a CVE. Some people are sufficiently satisfied when security
issues are found and fixed in time. While CVE number are sometimes
nice to have, other identifiers work just as well (for some).
