Hi,

I was forwarded by:
Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@...cle.com>

To you regarding obtaining a CVE for the mentioned (in the title)
vulnerability

I know a patch is being created and placed into mainstream code of the
Kernel

I would like also to get a CVE for it, so that we can put that in the
advisory we will release

Do we need to give you the full technical writeup of the vulnerability?
