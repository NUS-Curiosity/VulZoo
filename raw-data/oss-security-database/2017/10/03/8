Hello — My name is Joel Esler, I’m the Open Source lead here for ClamAV at Cisco.  A few comments here on list inline below:

Something we were working on.  To be honest, shipping detection in the method that we currently ship detection is not going to scale.  We are thinking about ways to change this.

But what has stalled is stable releases; the last one being 0.99.2 on 22nd April 2016, so something is not quite right. But I've seen many open source/free software projects stalled over the years and definitely Clamav does not, IMO, fit that description (at least not yet).



It’s not dead.  At all.  99.2 as a stable release was released in 2016, yes.  We have been working on 99.3 since, and are planning 99.4 and 99.5 now.  99.3 has been in beta for a couple months now, and the fix for this issue has been in git since the date mentioned earlier in the thread.  It’s also obviously in 99.3.
