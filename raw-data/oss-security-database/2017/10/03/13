When working on an advisory and update for Debian, I usually scheme through
oss-sec in order to see if the vulnerability has already been discussed here,
or if the package I'm working on has been discussed recently.

I'll try to send a brief summary mail to this list if it happens that the
package and/or vulnerability is not on the oss-sec radar. Something along the
line of â€œWe've just fixed / We're currently in the process of fixing
$vulnerability in $package (CVE-XXXX).
