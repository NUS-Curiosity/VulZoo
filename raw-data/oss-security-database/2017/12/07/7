Can you elaborate on this, please?

I think the benefit is being on a version upstream intends to maintain
to a greater extent and for a longer time.  For example, when yet
another side-channel leak was reported against GnuPG 1 & 2 recently,
upstream officially patched it for GnuPG 2 only and said that GnuPG 1
probably contains many other side-channel leaks anyway:

http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/07/06/8

Of course, it's best to use GnuPG in an environment where side-channels
within the same host would not matter anyway.

Personally, I intend to stay with GnuPG 1 for now.

Fun fact: it never actually specified the number of rounds (including
not in RFC 4880), but rather the number of bytes passed through SHA-1:

As I wrote there:

"I think GnuPG documentation is wrong, and should be revised.  Both
texinfo and man.  Would you care to report this to GnuPG, perhaps along
with a documentation patch?"

but I think we never reported it to GnuPG.  So please feel free.  Also,
I think the man page is generated from the texinfo source, so would not
need to be revised separately.

Are you saying "--s2k-count" option to "gpg2" is ignored, and moreover
that this is documented?  gnupg-2.1.23/doc/gpg.texi says (formatted):

`--s2k-count `n''
     Specify how many times the passphrase mangling is repeated.  This
     value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive.  The default
     is inquired from gpg-agent.  Note that not all values in the
     1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected,
     GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal value.  This option is
     only meaningful if `--s2k-mode' is 3.

This doesn't say the option is ignored - only that "the default is
inquired from gpg-agent."  Is the option in fact ignored?  That would be
a bug in either code or documentation.

I see no problem with gpg-agent providing a calibrated default, if that
default can be overridden.  If it can't be, and especially if that's in
conflict with the documentation, that's problematic.

You may process the private key file with gpg2john, then try to crack it
with john.  This will output the actual value, as well as show you the
speed at which passphrases can be tested against that key on your system
and with that version of JtR.  To use a GPU, add "--format=gpg-opencl".
Please use latest bleeding-jumbo off GitHub for all of this.

There's also asignify:
