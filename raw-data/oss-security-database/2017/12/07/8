As for free GPG-compatible alternatives, I happened to remember that
years ago, NetBSD was working on their own BSD-licensed PGP
implementation as a GSoC project, but it never really went anywhere.
Looks like that finally exists now:
http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?netpgp++NetBSD-current

I don't know if it's any good or if it can be easily ported to Linux
but it could be worth investigating if you really want to avoid GPG,
and it should probably be a lot simpler.

Cheers,
Peter
