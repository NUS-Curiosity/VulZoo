It's actually the same documentation - just a different place in it,
which I didn't notice until you pointed it out.  So this option is
documented differently in different places in the documentation.  Some
of those refer to different ones of the tools, but others might be just
repeats of what's supposed to be the same info yet is not?  Confusing.

Weird.  Was this discussion with "GPG developer" anywhere public?

Did you test this yourself?  You don't need to determine the exact
s2k-count to see if the option has effect or not - you can instead set
the value to the highest supported and measure whether this increases
the delay compared to the default.

I think this description is ambiguous: "symmetric" might refer only to
cases when GnuPG as a whole is invoked for symmetric encryption, or it
might also include cases when GnuPG symmetrically en/decrypts its keys.

I tried asking a JtR jumbo contributor to look into this, but
unfortunately I got no response yet, and I had no time to look into it
myself.  This is something we ought to have an answer to, but I
currently don't.

Sure.  Releases made prior to the switch to the new key are signed with
the old key.  The "no longer used" comment applies to new signatures.
Maybe we need to clarify that or/and re-sign some releases from prior to
the key switch with the new key.
