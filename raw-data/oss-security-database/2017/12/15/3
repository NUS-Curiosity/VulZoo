That's an interesting setup. For special signing purposes, where
I do not want to transfer the key, nor give the gpg-agent unrestricted
remote access to the key material via forwarding, I use the dirty
workaround from [0]. But you specific solution sounds much more
advanced.

Yes, the TTP/WoT is another topic. The mailing usecase is similar,
only for signing - if I care to do so - I use [0] together with
some tools from the "nmh" (new mail handler) community.
