You are talking about policies here, not technical issues. Gnupg is perfectly
scriptable, see pacman-key(1) tool in Arch Linux. Moreover, gpg-agent is easily
usable on a headless machine. At least, I mostly use it this way when checking
email... You will lose nothing if you just pkill(1) gpg-agent though. So I
don't understand why you claim that gpg is moving towards desktop.

pkill -hup gpg-agent. Please read the manpages.
