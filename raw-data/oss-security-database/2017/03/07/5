Subject: Re: CVE Request: Wordpress: 6 security issues in
 Wordpress 4.7 2

So this CVE request raises a good example:

Wordpress needs CVEs for its security flaws. This is a simple fact.

Now ideally the Wordpress team would become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)
and cover it themselves, if they would like to do this then they need to
reach out to me as the DWF guy and I can make that happen.

If that doesn't happen then the good news is we have another option now.
Someone can become a CVEMentor and CNA and take over the Wordpress
assignments (well until Wordpress becomes a CNA). So if someone wants to
step up and do this, please contact me as the DWF guy and I can make that
happen.

This is also true for other projects/open source products. We need better
CVE coverage. Ideally these projects/products step up and become CNA's, but
if they cannot (lack of resources/time/etc) that's ok, because now people
with an interest can come forwards and do it.
