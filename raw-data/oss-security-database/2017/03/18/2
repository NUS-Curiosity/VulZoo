I am not sure the software version helps that much. It can lead to
incorrect decision. For example, for security flaw B upstream might say
versions before Y.Y.Y are not applicable - lets say version X.X.X <
Y.Y.Y and as such as OK, because the do not contain the vulnerable
code. In fact, somebody could check the code and mark this security flaw
as not applicable.

Meanwhile, somebody else gets around to adding another (earlier)
security patch for A to Y.Y.Y. This security adds the vulnerable code
for B. Anybody making a quick inspection would not notice now that Y.Y.Y
patched for A is now vulnerable to B. In fact B was already marked as
not vulnerable, so there may not even be need to look at it again (not
sure how to solve this problem).

While a "fixed in version" is useful, a pointer to a commit that fixed
the problem would be even better - and means less speculation on which
commit actually fixes the issue. In fact some upstreams won't even
answer bug reports asking if security issues has been fixed or not.
