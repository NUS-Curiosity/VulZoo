Subject: CVE-2017-7308: Linux kernel: integer overflow in packet_set_ring

Hi,

CVE-2017-7308 [1] was assigned to the following issue:

The packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux
kernel through 4.10.6 does not properly validate certain block-size
data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (overflow)
or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls.

The fix is sent upstream [2].
