Subject: libpcre: invalid memory read in phar (pcretest.c)

Description:
libpcre is a perl-compatible regular expression library.

A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed an invalid read in the utility itself. For the nature of the crash, it is not security relevant because the library is not affected but if you 
have a web application that calls directly the pcretest utility to parse untrusted data, then you are affected.
Also, it is important share the details because some distros/packagers may want to take the patch in their repository.

The complete ASan output:

# pcretest -16 -d $FILE

==28444==The signal is caused by a READ memory access.
