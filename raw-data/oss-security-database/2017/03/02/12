header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
require_once('function.php');

if ($_FILES['file']['name']) {
if (!$_FILES['file']['error']) {
$name = md5(rand(100, 200));
$ext = explode('.', $_FILES['file']['name']);
$filename = $name . '.' . $ext[1];
$destination = 'images/' . $filename;
$location = $_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"];
move_uploaded_file($location, $destination);
echo $plugin_url.'/server/images/' . $filename;
}
else {
echo $message = 'Ooops! Your upload triggered the following error: '.$_FILES['file']['error'];
}
}
