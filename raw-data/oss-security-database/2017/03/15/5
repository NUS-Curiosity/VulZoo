"No fix is currently available" would be difficult to accurately describe.
Sometimes the software is abaondware, and no fix will ever be available.
Sometimes the software is a hobby and only fun features get implemented
but difficult fixes do not. Sometimes the fix will be in the next release.

I know some submitters who would probably have to invest in new /dev/null
procmail entries if we mailed them once for every CVE they've been issued. :)

I suspect the solution is for people who rely upon these scanning tools to
do the leg work themselves on the packages they care about. (i.e., the
packages that annoy them the most.)

Thanks
