Subject: LXC: CVE-2017-5985: lxc-user-nic didn't verify network namespace
 ownership

Jann Horn discovered that the lxc-user-nic program could be tricked into
operating on a network namespace over which the caller did not hold
privilege.

The behavior didn't follow what was documented in the lxc-user-nic(1)
man page:

 It ensures that the calling user is privileged over the network
 namespace to which the interface will be attached.

This issue is CVE-2017-5985.
