Hello,

The security patch was deployed 3 days ago in the official git repository
of linux, after the fix was reviewed and approved by me.
Therefore, CVE 2016-8636 can now be publicly disclosed.

Commit id of the mainline merge:
   647bf3d8a8e5777319da92af672289b2a6c4dc66

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/647bf3d8a8e5777319da92af672289b2a6c4dc66

Public disclosure details in my security blog:

P.S. The CVE id was received from the security team of ubuntu, which
directed me to publicly disclose it with the oss-security mailing list.

Thanks for your help,
Eyal Itkin.
