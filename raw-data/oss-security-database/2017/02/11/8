For me the value of the oss-security mailing list to have a public
mailing list which is read by all the relevant open source security
stakeholders. Thats's why we're bringing all non-critical vulnerabilities
reported privately to the Debian security team to the attention of
this mailing list.

Having CVEs assigned is of lesser importance, this was never primarily
why we posted security vulnerabilities here. Obtaining CVE IDs caused
little overhead on our side, but if that changes (and the announced
changes sound like that), then there will simply be less CVE coverage
I'm afraid.
