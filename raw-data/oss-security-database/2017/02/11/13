Not a requirement, but you should expect to miss replies if you're not
subscribed, especially if you didn't state so in your posting.

Another issue is that now that you brought the reply back to the list,
you almost broke the thread.  I fixed that by manually editing the
headers on your message before approving it (as a list admin).
Sometimes I do that, although I don't consider it to be part of my
"job".  If a co-moderator were to approve your message first, then your
message would have started a new thread rather than being added to the
existing thread.  That's not great.

So we'd appreciate it if you do subscribe to the list for the duration
of discussions you participate in, or at least explicitly state when
you're posting without being subscribed (ask to be CC'ed on replies).
