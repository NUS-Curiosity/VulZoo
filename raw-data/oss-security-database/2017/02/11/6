Thanks for the update on where that is going.  I'm cautiously hopeful
that this will be what open source folks need in the future.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who is frustrated with this.  I too have
given up on putting my effort into getting CVEs for most things.  If
someone else gets it assigned in a timely manner and I happen to
notice, fine I'll put it in an advisory, but I'm no longer requesting
CVEs for vulns in commercial software.  (Were this resignation to be
widespread, it should be a huge red flag for MITRE.)

Corporate vendor vuln assignment does seem like this is a completely
different animal than open source assignment now, based on how MITRE
is (and has been) structuring things.  The fact that the two are
treated differently is a big source of my loss of faith in their
ability to run the program.
