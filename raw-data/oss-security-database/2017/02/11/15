I think this is no longer of sufficient relevance to oss-security
subscribers for us to continue this sub-thread CC'ing the list, so it's
probably/hopefully the last message one of us sends on this in here.

There are several issues here (besides those you mention):

1. Threads get broken when someone forwards an e-mail, rather than
replies.  In a sense, I am at fault for forwarding you Simon's reply,
instead of "replying" to his reply, over-quoting it, and CC'ing you on
that.  I'd introduce an extra layer of quoting (unless I were to undo
it prior to sending), but at least the References headers could have a
chance of maintaining the thread.

2. The blists software we use for the official oss-security archives
currently only uses In-Reply-To or one entry from References; it does
not fully parse the References.  And fixing this in the code amounts to
more than just parsing that header more fully.

What this means is that to maintain the thread I should have probably
CC'ed you _and_ the list on that "reply" to Simon's message, where I'd
merely quote the entire message for you.  That's not great indeed, but
since Simon's message was such that I could reasonably have expected you
wanting to reply to the list, maybe I should have done that.
