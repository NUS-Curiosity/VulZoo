Subject: Re: Re: MITRE is adding data intake to its CVE ID process

so longer term (like starting now) the master database for DWF:

https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Master-CVE-Database

will have a list of blocks (generally 1000) and the url they are at (git
link to clone), I want to shard the database otherwise a git repo with 100k
cve's being updated will get unwieldy, and this also makes life a bit
simpler for larger CNAs.

As for the old tyle CSV representation of the data we'll probably do that
as well since it is what people are used to consuming, but ideally we'll
get the DWF data being imported into MITRE and processed fast enough that
people can just consume MITRE's CSV feed (and resulting NVD feed and
whatnot).

So for now I'm focusing on some back end things like the CVE Mentor
process/CNA training, the JSON data format so MITRE can consume data and so
on.
