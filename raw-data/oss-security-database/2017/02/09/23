Agreed, having tried to figure out the form it seems geared toward
requesting CVE IDs for vulnerabilities you've found in someone
else's software, and not for maintainers of software to request CVE
IDs for vulnerabilities which have been disclosed to them. The
little detail callout icons for the vendor and product fields link
to the CNA coverage list[0] which in turn instructs, "For open
source software products not listed below, request a CVE ID through
the Distributed Weakness Filing Project[1] CNA." So I guess that's
what our project will be using in the future, or maybe just stop
bothering to obtain CVEs on our own and let the various downstream
redistributors of our software who are themselves CNAs issue them as
needed and then fight over whose is the correct one.
