Subject: zziplib: NULL pointer dereference in main (unzzipcat.c)

Description:
zziplib is an intentionally lightweight library that offers the ability to 
easily extract data from files archived in a single zip file.

A fuzz on it discovered an a NULL pointer access.

The complete ASan output:

# unzzipcat $FILE
