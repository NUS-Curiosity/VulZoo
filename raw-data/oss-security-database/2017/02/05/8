Subject: Irssi 1.0.0 minor remote memory leak

Hi,

Joseph Bisch has detected a remote memory leak in some cases where a
hostile server would send certain incomplete SASL replies. According to
his calculations, the server would need to send 13 times the amount of
memory it wants to leak. The issue is a missing free of the base64
data. Please advise whether that issue needs a CVE?

Furthermore, Hanno Böck found the issue of a missing NULL sentinel when
initialising Perl, which crashes under ASan. Since this happens only on
boot and is not exposed to the net, we have no reason to believe that
there is any issue here. Also, that bug has been around since the
inception of Perl scripting module.

Patch: https://github.com/irssi/irssi/pull/619/commits/677fb1f55ca52d0e

In any case, those issues have been addressed in Irssi 1.0.1

Thanks for your attention,
