Subject: Local DoS: Linux Kernel EXT4 Memory Corruption / SLAB-Out-of-Bounds Read

Gday,

I'd like to ask for a CVE for the flaw the EXT4 filesystem as described as:

Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to a memory corruption and
SLAB-Out-of-Bounds Reads (according to KASAN).  Since the mounting
procedure is a privileged operation, an attacker is probably not able
to trigger this vulnerability on the commandline.
Instead the automatic mounting feature of the GUI via a crafted
USB-device is required.

If it has been assigned elsewhere, I am unable to see it.

Thanks,
