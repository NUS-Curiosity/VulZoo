Debian uses shadow, but is discussing a switch to util-linux:
https://packages.debian.org/sid/login
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=833256

GuixSD is using shadow:
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/system.scm#n579

I'm also interested to learn the pros and cons of the two
implementations.
