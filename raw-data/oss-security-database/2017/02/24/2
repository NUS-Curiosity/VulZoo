Please note that the fix for this issue opens a memory leak, because it
forgets to free the 've' structure from this line:

  ve = calloc(num_elements, sizeof(struct pipe_vertex_element));

A possible follow-up patch is attached.

I've already informed the reporter of this issue but there seems to be
no upstream fix yet.

Regards

Matthias
