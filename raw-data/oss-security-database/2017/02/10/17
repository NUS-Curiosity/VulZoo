It's pretty clear that MITRE's interest is increasingly aligned with
commercial software vendors and not the open source community at
large.  I wouldn't hold your breath on improvements to how The MITRE
Corporation deals with our community.  If you want something better,
we'll have to build it ourselves.  Note that I'm just the messenger.
