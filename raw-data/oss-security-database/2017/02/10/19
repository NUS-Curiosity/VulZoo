One significant advantage of monitoring this list was that requests
were immediately visible and there are sometimes significant
delays between a CVE request and the response from MITRE. Or in some
cases requests were rejected with a rationale or did not receive a
response at all -- with the web form such cases will now just
disappear in a black hole.
