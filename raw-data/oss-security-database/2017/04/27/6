Subject: Re: CVE Request: Two memory corruption vulnerabilities
 ldns 1.7

Hello Stephan,

Unfortunately, CVE assignments are not done through this list anymore.
You need to visit [1] and request a CVE by filing out the form. Could
you please look at it and let the list know about the assigned CVE?

Thanks!
