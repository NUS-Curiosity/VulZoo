Subject: CVE-2017-8288: gnome-shell may leave extensions enabled in the lock
 screen

Hi,

The following CVE was assigned to gnome-shell. Note this may affect earlier
versions than 3.22, but I didn't check them.

[Suggested description]
gnome-shell 3.22 through 3.24.1 mishandles extensions that fail to reload,
which can lead to leaving extensions enabled in the lock screen.
With these extensions, a bystander could
launch applications (but not interact with them), see information from
the extensions (e.g., what applications you have opened or what music
you were playing), or even execute arbitrary commands. It all
depends on what extensions a user has enabled. The problem is caused by lack of
exception handling in
js/ui/extensionSystem.js.
