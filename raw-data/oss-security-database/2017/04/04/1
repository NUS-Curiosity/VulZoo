Subject: CVE-2017-2667: Hammer CLI SSL certificate verification disabled

CVE-2017-2667: SSL/HTTPS server certificates are not verified by default
in Hammer CLI

Hammer CLI, a REST API-based CLI for Foreman, initiated HTTPS
connections via the apipie-bindings and rest-client libraries without
verifying the SSL certificate presented by the server. This could allow
for man-in-the-middle attack.

This issue was reported by Tomas Strachota.

Affects all known Hammer CLI versions
Fix released in Hammer CLI 0.10.0

Patch:
https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli/commit/74b926ae24f47f1d93b778e06b64935e57b60e33
