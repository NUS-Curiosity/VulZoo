Subject: Re: CVE request: remote heap overflow in linux
 networking stack

Hello Alexander, Jason,

This is the issue that I referenced in [1]. We have internally decided
that it's worth to assign a CVE even though it's public and there is a
risk of duplication because the issue looks serious. I sent a CVE update
to Mitre, we'll see if they catch it and stop possible duplication
assignment.

All credits for this discovery go to Jason.
