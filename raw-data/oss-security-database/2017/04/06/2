Subject: libxslt math.random issue

Hi,

CVE-2015-9019 has been assigned to use of libexslt (in libxslt) usage of "math.random" 
without initializing the randomseed.

Surely, one can argue that the calling program should do srand() or similar, but its
too easy to forget.


FWIW, why is glibc not doing srand(RANDOMVECTOR) during startup... :/

Ciao, Marcus
