Stuart,

Your suggested mitigation is good and was in fact already mentioned in
my advisory, see
'VIII. SOLUTION' section of:
https://legalhackers.com/advisories/SquirrelMail-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2017-7692-Vuln.html


As for the utility I just wrote my own C tool that loops through
argv[] and saves it into a file.
If you need something more advanced / already available you can try
auditd rules.
