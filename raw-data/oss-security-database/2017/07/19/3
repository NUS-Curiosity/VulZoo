Subject: gnome-exe-thumbnailer: CVE-2017-11421: VBScript script injection
 when generating thumbnails for MSI files

Hi

MITRE has assigned CVE-2017-11421 for the following issue in
gnome-exe-thumbnailer, a Wine .exe and other executable thumbnailer
for GNOME:

gnome-exe-thumbnailer before 0.9.5 is prone to a VBScript Injection
when generating thumbnails for MSI files. There is a local attack if
the victim uses the GNOME Files file manager, and navigates to a
directory containing a .msi file with VBScript code in its filename.

Upstream fix:
