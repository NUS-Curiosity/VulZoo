 CloudLinux

Hey all!

I run two businesses, one of which hosts other hosting providers, and we are heavy users of CloudLinux. They work very hard to contribute to fixing issues whether the upstream has fixed it or not, and I see tremendous value in that. I think they should be added.

Thanks!

Bobby

Hi all,

I am inclined to add CloudLinux to the linux-distros list unless there are well-reasoned objections.  I'd appreciate any comments.

Thank you for posting this, Igor.

So are you saying that you'll release fixes sooner (once you're on the linux-distros list) only for this subset of packages that are modified or packaged by you?  What about the rest?

OK.  You'll likely need to choose additional/other tasks very soon since these trivial ones will likely transfer to another new distro joining, if one requests membership and meets the criteria shortly after you.

Thanks.  Out of the people you listed, you and Konstantin appear to have been on oss-security for a long while, but Leonid doesn't appear to be subscribed - or is he?  If not, he probably needs to subscribe now.
