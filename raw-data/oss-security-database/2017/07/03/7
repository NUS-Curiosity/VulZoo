I think "might as well be public" is an exaggeration, but this would in
fact be against distros list policy.

You're right.  I'm not sure.  This isn't the only thing we could call
out explicitly.  If we start listing examples of what's allowed and
what's not, then another one or two would be about testing/QA of fixes,
which Gentoo's internal "Pre-Release Disclosure of Vulnerability
Information" policy mentions explicitly:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Security/Pre-Release-Disclosure

I added a link to it to the distros list wiki page yesterday, referring
to it as an example.

If we include such examples directly in the list policy specification,
it'd become lengthy and redundant, and I don't want it to be.  Maybe
this should be a set of examples clarifying yet separate from the list
policy specification.

Thanks.  Please let us know at which specific tasks you'll try harder.
