It wouldn't take much to have a tool that does, mainly what I outline in
the previous post to ensure OpenPGP keyblock management for the
individual users, and as an extension of the scope for that perhaps a
[MemoryHole] implementation to ensure confidentiality / integrity
verification of the RFC822 headers such as Subject. Enigmail users
should already have such support read-only[Note:A]

Notes:
[Note:A] to toggle it on encrypted subjects on sending you'd use
extensions.enigmail.protectHeaders
