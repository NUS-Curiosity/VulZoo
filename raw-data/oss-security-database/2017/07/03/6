Subject: Re: accepting new members to (linux-)distros lists

Solar,

I think (linux-)distros is working quite well but part of that is
regularly looking at the processes etc to refine them.

In our case we do put relevant issues into our bug tracking behemoth...

... and I agree that only tracking issues that are relevant is highly
desirable.  Sometimes, of course, it only becomes apparent that it's not
relevant after some work has been done.

What I would say though is that embargoed issues that go on a bug
tracker should be not be visible to anyone that doesn't have an actual
need to know.  If an internal bug tracker is generally open to anyone
internal then for the purposes of embargo it might as well be public.

It _should_ be self-evident that "need to know" includes making sure
entries in internal bug trackers need to be similarly restricted but I
do wonder if it's worth calling that out explicitly?
