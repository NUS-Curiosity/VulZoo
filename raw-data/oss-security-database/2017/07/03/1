Sorry I wasn't clear.  "time or ability to do it all ourselves" is what I meant
to write.

Between timezones, vacation schedules, etc.  I can't promise immediate responses
or even a specific response time to the list.

So really what I'm saying is even for something trivial, there will be times
where I can not promise immediate response.

We effectively have one person monitoring the list, with two backup in case of
vacations.  Occasionally all people are out at the same time (usually national
holidays.)  I'm happy to offer our help, but as long as my limitations are
understood then I think this will be beneficial.  (I doubt we are unique in
this.  If we could subscribe all of our developers then the limitations go away
-- but that would be a terrible idea for informational security.)  :)

Reply that a report made it to the list would certainly be an easy original
task.  I've not done it so far, only because others usually beat me to it.

Unfortunately I'm on vacation through the end of this week (as are many of us
that are located in North America.)  So I can get back with what we can help
with next week.  (If tasks are gone, that is fine.)

Thank you for organizing this.  I do think it is important.
