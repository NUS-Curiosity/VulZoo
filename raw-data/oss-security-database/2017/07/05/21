1) However, not all distributions enforce such a rule, and a has been
noted, such a rule doesn't exist in POSIX. Indeed, a quick check on a
PDP-11 simulator demonstrates that Unix at least back to v7 handled
such names without trouble.

2) The lack of fail safety is disturbing. It is probably important for
systems code like this to always fail safely, rather than unsafely.

I've long since come to the conclusion that systemd is not safe to run
on a security critical machine. The developers are simply too lax
about safety.

If you're going to write a piece of systems code that has to run on
essentially every Linux box on earth and which runs much of the time
as root, extreme care has to be taken. You need to program defensively.

Instead, what we seem to have is a set of highly interdependent
shotgun parsers written without much regard to the rules people have
developed (of necessity) for writing code that must run with high
privileges. In other words, the code is _not_ written defensively.

(For those not familiar with the term "shotgun parser", which the
LangSec community introduced, do learn about it. It's a useful
concept.)

+1

I don't care much if the developers deny that this is a problem. It is
a problem.
