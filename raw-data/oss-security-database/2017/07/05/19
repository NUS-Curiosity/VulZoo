The worst is that fact that discussion about this problem was locked in
upstream bugtracker. Therefore there is no other option as continue
discussion about this, which I think security issue, here at
oss-security list. But problem is that upstream do not have to monitor
this list and therefore they would ignore any results.

assigning CVE should be really done as more downstream distributions
do not follow systemd's "allowed" characters in username and needs to
handle this problem somehow. Either patching systemd or change
validation for adding new user names into system...

Is somebody going to ask Mitre for CVE? Or should it be done by Red Hat?
Because upstream bug is locked, it is not possible to ask in upstream...
