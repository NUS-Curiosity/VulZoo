Subject: LKML thread "mm: larger stack guard gap, between vmas" partially CC'ed to linux-distros

Hi,

In the Stack Clash disclosure aftermath, there's a thread "[PATCH] mm:
larger stack guard gap, between vmas" still going on LKML, which is
attempted to be CC'ed to linux-distros (as linux-distros was among the
recipients on similar threads with security@k.o involved prior to the
public disclosure).  Some of these messages get through (those that
include [vs-plain] in the Subject), the rest don't.  (It might as well
be several threads now.)

This makes little sense to me, and it also creates the situation that if
any new security issues are disclosed in that thread (which might or
might not be the case with LibreOffice and Java trying and failing to
install their own stack guard pages after the kernel has been patched,
if I read this right) then per linux-distros list policy we'd need to
bring them specifically to oss-security (but it's tough to do when the
thread doesn't make the issue reports explicit - rather, people are just
discussing things).

On one hand, this is our continuing reminder of just how very wrong we
were with the embargo.  (Of course, some of us will continue to disagree
with this assessment.)  On the other hand, perhaps we should forcibly
kill those CC's now - ask people to stop, or just filter on the server.
I am going to start by asking.  Once again, that content is public on
LKML anyway.

Alexander
