Subject: Re: CoreOS membership to linux-distros (updated)

Back to CoreOS, I think that the practical answer is https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/selinux.html .
Now is it good / acceptable to rely on it (over classical Unix privileges, or another MAC) is actually an interesting, relatively unexplored research subject...
What makes no doubt is that it is in line with the use made by Google of Linux, including in Android and therefore, very probably makes sense for Google.
We lack some literature to back this choice for general-purpose use by the public at large, however.
http://www.cse.psu.edu/~trj1/cse544-s13/slides/cse544-selinux.pdf and https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-selinux/ * provide good starting points for such research; (public) research seems to have stopped since then (= more or less in 2009 apparently)†.
*With pointers to some alternatives in Linux and other operating systems, likewise many references
†The first presentation cites www.isoc.org/isoc/conferences/ndss/09/pdf/16.pdf, which provides an analysis of MAC mechanisms' (remote) attack surface.
A more recent, Android-centered presentation (http://kernsec.org/files/lss2015/vanderstoep.pdf) cites Wikipedia, stating that "[...] the security of an SELinux system depends primarily on the correctness of the kernel and its security-policy configuration", further highlighting the lack of in-depth research.
(the emphasis / bold typeface on the second part of the sentence was left as in the original quote)
I guess the question now is - do we trust Wikipedia articles on such matters? - and if we do, was the correctness in question attained in CoreOS's case?
Likewise, could we somehow measure / quantify a level of this correctness using a formal method? (and if so, what about generalizing it to other OS + xAC pairs so as to evaluate their suitability for specific use cases, target demographics, likewise threat models?)

P.S.: Full disclosure - I have an interest in finding a secure, yet broadly compatible enough OS. CC-ing Martin Decky, who was 1st to propose a formal approach to it.
