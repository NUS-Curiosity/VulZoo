Both messages sohu0106 posted initially had the Subject of "CVE request:
kernel stack infoleaks", which I changed to the two more specific
Subjects before approving the messages.  (I do that to especially
non-descriptive Subjects from time to time, as long as the messages were
not CC'ed to elsewhere.  I leave message bodies entirely intact.)

Thus, sohu0106 wanted to request the CVEs from this list, and apparently
didn't request them elsewhere.  sohu0106, this list is no longer a place
to request CVEs from, but we appreciate the vulnerability notifications.
You may request the CVEs from https://cveform.mitre.org and then post
them in here, "replying" to your own messages on the list.

sohu0106, have you also reported these issues upstream?  For the
net/irda/af_irda.c issue, from the MAINTAINERS file:

For the driver/video/fbdev/aty/atyfb_base.c issue I guess it's
linux-fbdev@...r.kernel.org, although there's no perfect match for that
filename.  In both cases, CC the messages to LKML.
