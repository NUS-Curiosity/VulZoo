Still in the middle of the house move and it's all generally chaos and
sorry for not getting back sooner.

However, put me down as backup for "1. Promptly review new issue reports
for meeting the list's requirements and confirm receipt..."

I do expect that we (I) will become more active on linux-distros as
well.   Speaking of which, has it been unusually quiet or do I need to
beat up the mail admin people again?   I haven't seen anything since
Bastille Day (14 July).
