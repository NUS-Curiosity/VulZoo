> CVE-2017-7506 spice: Possible buffer overflow via invalid monitor
configurations

CVSSv3:  9.1/CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H

The vulnerability is exposed to authenticated clients.  Malicious SPICE
protocol messages can cause memory exhaustion, leak host memory to the
guest or cause OOB writes.  The writes seem difficult to control, but a
sufficiently crafty attacker could potentially use these to compromise
the host.

This was reported by SPICE maintainers Frediano Ziglio and Christophe
Fergeau, who also provided the attached patchset against the current
stable branch (0.12).
