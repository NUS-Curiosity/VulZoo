To be clear we won't be working on random third party stuff that has
minimal value and we have no expertise in. It's the things like StackGuard
or OpenSSL issues that matter and where a major amount of work is needed
that we tend to work on (we're not going to work on random php apps, we're
going to work on the stuff that matters, not all security issues are
equal).  I would argue if people can't be bothered to care about committing
resources to fixing  a security issue than that security issue doesn't
really matter (in other words, the market has spoken).
