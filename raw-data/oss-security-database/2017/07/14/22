Great.  I've just listed Red Hat for those.

I didn't collect statistics, but my impression is that Red Hat generally
works on fixes for issues that Red Hat itself brings to distros, which
is a great contribution (doubly so).  Red Hat also worked on glibc fixes
for Stack Clash.  Other than that, for issues brought to distros by
third-parties I think Red Hat's contributions of fixes do not stand out
compared to some other distros'.  Maybe that will now improve. :-)

And I am not complaining.  Maybe this means those other distros are
doing their part too, which is great.
