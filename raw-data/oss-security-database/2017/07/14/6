 in large linux distro?

Something like this?

https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/51/Ubuntu.html
https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/7838/Red-Hat.html
https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html

The churn is pretty constant with new vulnerabilities being exposed daily,
and fixes being committed at varying rates compared to being found.
