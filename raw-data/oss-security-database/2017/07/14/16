This works.  I've just listed Amazon for those tasks as you suggested.
Thank you!

This leaves administrative task 10 with no primary yet, though:

10. Monitor relevant public channels (mailing lists, code repositories,
etc.) and inform the reporter and the list in case an issue is made
public prematurely (that is, leaks or is independently rediscovered) -
primary: vacant, backup: Amazon

Does this mean Amazon will be taking care of it until we find a primary?
Or only in cases when no other distro (visibly) does?

Ideally, a distro should volunteer to be primary for that task now, so
that Amazon wouldn't have to volunteer for more than they offered.
