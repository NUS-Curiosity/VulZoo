I've listed Debian as backup for the two CVE tasks above.  I've also
listed Red Hat as primary for these two tasks, based on Red Hat's
contributions so far.  And I've listed Cloud Linux and Gentoo beside
the tasks they kindly volunteered for in postings in here.

I see that Gentoo is already active at their tasks, including reminding
reporters to post to oss-security and taking care of the SPICE posting
(when the reporter wasn't available to make it on time):

as well as collecting statistics.  Thanks!

Thank you!

However, many tasks remain vacant, with no distro responsible for them.
This doesn't mean they're not getting done - just that no particular
distro is responsible - yet that's something I'd like to see change.

Specifically, all 6 of the technical tasks and 5 of 13 administrative
tasks are now fully vacant.  Additionally, 11 of the administrative
tasks have no backup.

These distros have no task assigned: ALT Linux, Amazon Linux AMI, Arch
Linux, Chrome OS, Openwall, Oracle, Slackware, SUSE, Ubuntu, Wind River,
FreeBSD, NetBSD/pkgsrc.

Openwall might be exempt for now for us running the lists and being the
last resort fallback for most tasks. ;-)  The rest should volunteer for
some tasks now!

Red Hat almost made this list, except that I listed them for the two CVE
tasks on my own.
