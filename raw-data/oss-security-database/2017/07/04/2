Subject: Re: linux-distros list membership application - CloudLinux

I've just added CloudLinux to linux-distros.  Some comments below:

This may be a reason for you to harden your distro's userland against
local privilege escalations as well, such as by adopting the
owl-alt-sanitize-env glibc hardening patch maintained by ALT Linux:

http://git.altlinux.org/gears/g/..git?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=496059f2

and getting rid of most or all world-accessible SUID programs, which is
do-able like we have demonstrated with Owl.  This shouldn't be
unreasonably hard to implement and maintain in a fork of RHEL, although
obviously you'll end up with more packages (including some core ones)
that would no longer be mere rebuilds of RHEL's.

This is by no means a condition for your linux-distros list membership -
I just happen to mention it here in response to your explanation of your
distro's threat model.  If you do go this route, it will re-enforce your
reasoning for being a linux-distros member, though.

You got impressive timing on these!

I subscribed only Leonid and Igor so far, since Konstantin's key doesn't
appear to be available at that URL (I am getting "No Public Key found
for kolshanov@...udlinux.com").  As a minor annoyance, these URLs appear
to require JavaScript.
