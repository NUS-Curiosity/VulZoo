Subject: CVE-2016-6798 : Apache Sling XXE vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Sling XSS Protection API 1.0.0

Description:
The method XSS.getValidXML() uses an insecure SAX parser to validate
the input string, which allows for XXE [0] attacks in all scripts
which use this method to validate user input, potentially allowing an
attacker to read sensitive data on the filesystem, perform
same-site-request-forgery (SSRF), port-scanning behind the firewall or
DoS the application.

Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to version 1.0.12 or later of the XSS Protection
API module.
