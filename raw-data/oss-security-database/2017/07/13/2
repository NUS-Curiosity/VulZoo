Subject: [ANN] Apache Struts 2.5.12 GA with Security Fixes Release

The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.5.12 is

Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating
enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to
streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to
maintaining applications over time.

This release contains fixes for the following potential security
vulnerabilities:
