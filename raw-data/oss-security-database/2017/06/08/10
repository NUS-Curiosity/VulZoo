Ok so I tested it, no crash/huge memory thing, but the CPU got maxed and
even when I closed the tab for the image Firefox kept eating CPU, I
wasn't able to close Firefox, had to use the kill command (which worked
fine) so this clearly falls into the DoS camp and may need a CVE, has
Mozilla commented on why they have elected to NOT give it a CVE?
