Memory allocation failures are normal since there are always finite 
memory resources and requests may be based on the amount of work to be 
performed.  If a memory allocation failure can be unreasonably induced 
(e.g. a 100 byte input file consumes 100 GB of memory) and the 
impacted software (or whole system) is expected to remain running 
continually in order to provide service for many users, then there 
would be a denial of service opportunity, which could be serious.
