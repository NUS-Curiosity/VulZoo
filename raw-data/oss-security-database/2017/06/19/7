AFAIK, the main efficiency issue (reserving a register) was fixed for
GCC 6. I might be missing something but it seems very cheap now, at
least for x86_64. It definitely doesn't really work though.

Is there an example of it changing program semantics? I haven't seen
anything since the generic arch stuff was fixed.
