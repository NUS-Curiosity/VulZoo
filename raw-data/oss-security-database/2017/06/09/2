There is no "bugzilla site". Bugzilla is a bug tracker. Many projects
use it. There's litterally hundreds of "Bugzilla sites" and nobody of us
has a clue which one you're referring to. And even if we did, probably
only the admin of that site could help you.

Here's an idea: Try to log in to an account with the appropriate
permissions.

If your bug reports are as fuzzy and confused as your posting on this
mailing list, it's no wonder your requests got ignored. You really could
try to be more specific and/or precise. A real name would also increase
chances of not being mistaken for a troll.
