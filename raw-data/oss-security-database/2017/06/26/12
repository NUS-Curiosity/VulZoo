So as per the private email thread we had previously I'm not going to be
interacting with you beyond what is strictly neccesary for CVE and other
professional purposes.

One the CVE REJECT side, CVE-2017-1000377 looks legitimate, although I'm
inclined to agree with Qualys and REJECT it so that you stop emailing. I
did contact MITRE, I haven't had time to reply to them yet (they are
also wondering why the CVE needs REJECT'ing), as such I think it may be
best to recuse myself from this specific CVE and let you handle this
with MITRE. I have also previously told you how to go about doing this.

I will say that CVE identifiers doesn't just cover full code execution
flaws, but also covers situations where for example a security property
is claimed but is not as effective as we thought (e.g. the stackguard
page size in this case). Many CVE's are not fully exploitable on their
own but are part of an exploit chain.
