Thanks! That also goes beyond sqlite, BTW. There's also a number of
CVE IDs issued by Apple for libxml/libxslt which are in the same 
position.

libxml:
CVE-2016-4619 CVE-2016-4616 CVE-2016-4615 CVE-2016-4614 CVE-2015-7116
CVE-2015-7115

libxslt:
CVE-2017-2477 CVE-2016-4612 CVE-2016-4610 CVE-2016-4609 CVE-2016-4608
CVE-2016-4607

Cheers,
