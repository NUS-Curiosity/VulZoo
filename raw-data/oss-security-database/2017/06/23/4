OpenBSD made changes to the then known qsort() issue, and implemented
what was then thought to be the solution to the stack guard issue, the 1
megabyte guard pages. Subsequent discussion (without OpenBSD present,
due to them breaking the embargo) took place and as you know we ended up
with some pretty significant changes to glibc (I don't know if OpenBSD
has picked this group of fixes up or not).
