Subject: Remotely exploitable crash in dhcpcd

Hi Roy,

I found that by sending the same exact DHCP response to two different
DHCP requests on different interfaces, I was able to segfault dhcpcd.
The attached patch fixes the problem, though you might want to
investigate a bit further precisely why this is necessary.

Regards,
Jason
