Subject: CVE-2017-7669: Apache Hadoop privilege escalation

CVE-2017-7669: Apache Hadoop privilege escalation

Severity: Critical

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions affected: Hadoop 2.8.0, Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha1 and Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha2

Description:
The LinuxContainerExecutor runs docker commands as root with
insufficient input validation. When the docker feature is enabled,
authenticated users can run commands as root

Mitigation:
Users of Apache Hadoop 2.8.0 should leave Docker functionality disabled until Hadoop 2.8.1 is released.
Users of Apache Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha1 and Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha2 should upgrade to Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha3 or later.
