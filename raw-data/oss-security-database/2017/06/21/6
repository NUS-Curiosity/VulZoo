That's very cool, but we have a policy here to include actual
vulnerability detail in the list postings.  Your blog might be gone in
some years, but hopefully some oss-security archives will stay around.

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines

"At least the most essential part of your message (e.g., vulnerability
detail and/or exploit) should be directly included in the message itself
(and in plain text), rather than only included by reference to an
external resource.  Posting links to relevant external resources as well
is acceptable, but posting only links is not.  Your message should remain
valuable even with all of the external resources gone."

I've attached a text/plain export of your blog post to this message.
