We have discussed this internally, and we will first publish the Stack
Clash exploits and proofs-of-concepts that we sent to the distros@ and
linux-distros@ lists, plus our Linux ld.so exploit for amd64, and our
Solaris rsh exploit.

We will do so next Tuesday, but we will publish our Linux exploits and
proofs-of-concept if and only if Fedora updates are ready by then, our
NetBSD proof-of-concept if and only if NetBSD patches are ready by then,
and our FreeBSD proofs-of-concept if and only if FreeBSD patches are
ready by then.

If someone happens to know of another major distribution that has not
published patches and updates yet, please let us all know by replying
here to oss-security. Thank you very much!

With best regards,
