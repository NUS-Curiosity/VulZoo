I completely agree with you but then I can't explain why you chose to insult
our projects last week and still have not remedied it (both the CVE and your
insulting tweet are still up). I find it curious how you can preach about
professionalism after being the very instigator of the recent splat (heck,
instead of answering, you called it a conspiracy theory when I asked you in
private why you issued the CVE to begin with which then forced us to take
the issue public).

cheers,
