Subject: Re: malicious hypervisor threat was ignored but it is real

Hi Mikhail,

The concern is legitimate and there are relevant PoC's (perhaps starting
with Joanna Rutkowska's Blue Pill), but as a moderator for oss-security
I find your message inappropriate for this list: no focus on Open Source
(relevance yes, focus no), effectively no substance (only references to
others' work and general reasoning about how the attacks are possible),
promotion of your company and resource, a couple of instances of "patent
pending" on your recent slides, and a cross-post (you also brought this
at least to full-disclosure, where it is in fact more on topic).

It's been a long while, but if you're referring to the same thing I read
in Russian back then (and it looks so), I can say that IMO it lacked
substance too.  From the text, I couldn't discern whether the author
wrote a fine piece of science fiction (with sufficiently good knowledge
of the underlying "science") or a documentary, but either way there were
no specifics that would enable anyone else to reproduce the findings.

Unless anyone has anything on-topic (focus on Open Source) and specific
(ideally, reproducible) to add, let's end this oss-security thread here.
