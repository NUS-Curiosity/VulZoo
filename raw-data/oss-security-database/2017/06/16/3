Subject: Re: Do I have to inform someone about CVE?

When you have a CVE the simple rule is:

If you got it publicly the CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) you got it from
should have published it to their upstream (e.g. MITRE).

If you got it embargoed and it's now public you should tell the CNA you
got it from that it is public, and ideally also tell MITRE
(https://cveform.mitre.org/).

Rule of thumb is: when it goes public, tell the issuer, and/or MITRE so
they can publish it.
