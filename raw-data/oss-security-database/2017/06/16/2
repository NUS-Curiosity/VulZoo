Subject: Re: Do I have to inform someone about CVE?

Hi Qhdwns123,

As a list moderator, this is most likely the very last message I've
accepted from you, until and unless you finally report a security issue
in here.  So maybe now is the time. ;-)

Please inform this very mailing list about actual security issues you
find, whether you have CVE IDs for them or not.  Now that you say you do
have a CVE ID, please include it in your notification indeed.  But not
having a CVE ID was never a reason to delay notifying us of the issue.

Of course, the issue must be in Open Source software.  (If not, then
post it to the full-disclosure mailing list instead.)

Also, let me repeat publicly what I wrote to you off-list last week:

You're still not subscribed.  Apparently, you tried to, but you never
confirmed the subscription.  Please correct that.

Thanks,

Alexander
