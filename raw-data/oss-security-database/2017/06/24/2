Quite frankly, I'd much rather see *you* actually send in patches that
are acceptable for inclusion, something you've never done.

As it is, other people have tried to clean up parts of the grsecurity
patches, and tried to make them acceptable.

Wouldn't it be nice if you actually tried to make the baseline actually better?

Please.
