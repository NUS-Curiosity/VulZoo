There shouldn't be anything sensitive in old archives, such as in your
example.  Technically, we can easily extract and make public the message
Subjects.  For full messages, we need a way to mass-decrypt an mbox
containing PGP/MIME messages.  Maybe I should list implementing a
program that would do that(*) as one of the options that a new distros
list member could choose as their contribution back to the community.

(*) Mutt hack maybe?  Mutt processes those messages great, so having it
output them in decrypted form into another mbox and automatically loop
over all messages in the input mbox might do the trick.
