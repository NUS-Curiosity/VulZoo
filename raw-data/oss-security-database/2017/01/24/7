Subject: CVE request: rubygem minitar: directory traversal vulnerability

Rubygem minitar allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files during
archive extraction via a .. (dot dot) in an extracted filename.

Issue:
https://github.com/halostatue/minitar/issues/16

Upstream patch:
https://github.com/halostatue/minitar/commit/e25205ecbb6277ae8a3df1e6a306d7ed4458b6e4

The same issue exists in rubygem archive-tar-minitar

I believe they're based on the same codebase, and minitar is the officially
supported fork, so I'm not sure if this warrants two CVEs or just one.

Thanks,
