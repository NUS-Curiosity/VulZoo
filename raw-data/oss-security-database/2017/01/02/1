Subject: Multiple issues in OpenH264 1.5.1

Recently, Firefox updated their OpenH264 plugin to 1.6. Earlier this year, I reported multiple crashes I had found while fuzzing version 1.5.1 of the decoder (which was what was shipped at the time).

While these issues have been resolved on the 1.6 branch of the openh264 codebase for some time (a year?), it doesn’t seem like Firefox got the update until recently (correct me if I’m wrong), which is why I am releasing my fuzz results. I initially reported these to Mozilla, but collided with Tyler Smith, one of their security engineers who had also been fuzzing the decoder. I am not sure if these issues got CVEs or not, but I don’t see any.

Attached is the README for the linked GitHub repo, which shows the three distinct bugs and their stack traces. There might be another bug or two that I missed during triage. None of the crashes work on 1.6, which is now shipped with up-to-date Firefox installs.

Happy New Year!
