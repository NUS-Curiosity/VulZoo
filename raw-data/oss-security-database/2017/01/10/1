Subject: ark vulnerability: need CVE

Hi, Albert from KDE, can we get a CVE assigned for ark (archive handling 
tool)?

The problem is that the "Open" functionality of ark would run shell scripts, 
this is quite unexpected.

The title for the advisory we're preparing is
  Ark: unintended execution of scripts and executable files

The fix is already available at
https://cgit.kde.org/ark.git/commit/?
id=82fdfd24d46966a117fa625b68784735a40f9065

Thanks,
  Albert
