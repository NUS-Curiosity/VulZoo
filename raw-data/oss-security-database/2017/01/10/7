Subject: CVE request: two advisories for GnuTLS GNUTLS-SA-2017-1,
 GNUTLS-SA-2017-2, fixed in 3.3.26, 3.5.8

Hello,

GnuTLS 3.3.26 and 3.5.8 were released, with the following:

https://gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2017-1

It was found using the OSS-FUZZ fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a
specially crafted X.509 certificate with Proxy Certificate Information
extension present could lead to a double free. This issue was fixed in
GnuTLS 3.3.26 and 3.5.8.

https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/c5aaa488a3d6df712dc8dff23a049133cab5ec1b



https://gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2017-2

It was found using the OSS-FUZZ fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a specially crafted OpenPGP certificate could lead to heap and stack overflows. 

The support of OpenPGP certificates in GnuTLS is considered obsolete. As
such, it is not recommended to use OpenPGP certificates with GnuTLS.

Could CVEs please be assigned for these issues?

Thanks,
Andreas
