Subject: Re: Firejail local root exploit

Hello,
The first fix for CVE-2017-5180 in Firejail version 0.9.44.4 and 0.9.38.8 (LTS) was incomplete. Changing .Xauthority to .bashrc in the exploit code, the problem is still there - credit Sebastian Krahmer.
New releases are out: 0.9.44.8 and 0.9.38.10 (LTS). Please assign a new CVE.
Thank you,
Ion Ionescu

Hi

Please find attached PoC for firejail, which seems to be quite
popular sandboxing tool.
