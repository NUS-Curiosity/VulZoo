Subject: Duplicates of CVE-2015-8789 CVE-2015-8790 for libebml from TALOS
 reports?

Hi

CVE-2015-8789: following some downstream reports, this leads to commit
https://github.com/Matroska-Org/libebml/commit/88409e2a94dd3b40ff81d08bf6d92f486d036b24
which mentions Cisco TALOS-CAN-0037 report. Looking at
http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0037/ . That
mentions CVE-2016-1515. So I guess CVE-2016-1515 is a duplicate of the
CVE-2015-8789 assignment.

Similarly:

CVE-2015-8790: leads to
https://github.com/Matroska-Org/libebml/commit/ababb64e0c792ad2a314245233db0833ba12036b
referring to Cisco TALOS-CAN-0036,
http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0036/ which in
turns has the CVE-2016-1514 mentioned. 

Regards,
Salvatore
