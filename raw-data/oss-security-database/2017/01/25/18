Maven and Git are noteworthy here.

Maven was infamous for outdated packages. Confer, "The Vulnerability
Dataset of a Large Software Ecosystem",
http://bkarak.wizhut.com/www/pubs/pdfs/badgers2014.pdf.

Git took it to the next level and made it distributed. Instead of one
outdated repo like Maven, we now have hundreds or thousands of
outdated followers who don't pulll from master.
