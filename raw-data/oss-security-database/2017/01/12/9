Subject: CVE Request: MUJS null pointer dereference and Heap buffer overflow write

Hi,

The details of the two bugs found in MUJS (https://github.com/ccxvii/mujs)
are as follows :

1. Null pointer dereference in regexp.c

    The return value from malloc is not properly checked before
dereferencing it which can result in a crash.

     More details on the bug in the bug report at:
     https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697381

     This has been fixed by the MUJS team in the commit:
http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mujs.git;h=fd003eceda531e13fbdd1aeb6e9c73
156496e569

2. Heap buffer overflow write in jsrun.c: js_stackoverflow()

    There was a logical error in the code which can be used to trigger a
heap overflow write.
