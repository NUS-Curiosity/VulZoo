Subject: CVE request Qemu: sd: sdhci OOB access during multi block SDMA
 transfer

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the SDHCI device emulation support is 
vulnerable to an OOB heap access issue. It could occur while doing a multi 
block SDMA transfer via 'sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks' routine.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the 
Qemu process on the host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-01/msg06191.html

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1417559

This issue was reported by Jiang Xin of Huawei PSIR team.

Thank you.
