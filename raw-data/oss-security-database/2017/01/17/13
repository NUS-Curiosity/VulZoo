Subject: CVE request -- linux kernel: crash by spawning mcrypt(alg) with
 incompatible algorithm

Hello,

Algorithms not compatible with mcryptd could be spawned by mcryptd with a direct
crypto_alloc_tfm invocation using a "mcryptd(alg)" name construct. This causes
mcryptd to crash the kernel if an arbitrary "alg" is incompatible and not intended
to be used with mcryptd.

This could be a potential attack to crash the kernel by user program using AF_ALG
to request an invalid algorithm such as mcryptd(md5).
