Subject: CVE-2017-2596 Kernel: kvm: page reference leakage in handle_vmon

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the KVM virtualisation support(CONFIG_KVM), with 
nested virtualisation(nVMX) feature enabled(nested=1), is vulnerable to host 
memory leakage issue. It could occur while emulating VMXON instruction in 
'handle_vmon'.

A L1 guest user could use this flaw to leak host memory potentially resulting 
in DoS.
