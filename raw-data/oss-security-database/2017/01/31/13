I can confirm that the exploit is working on a vanilla 4.1.6 kernel
with openssh 6.8. I was a bit puzzled because wrong modes on ttys by itself
should no longer be exploitable on Linux.

Here are my 2ct:

1) Exploit evades the controlling-tty entry-check inside kernels tiocsti()
   that was introduced to cope with hijacking of tty's based on wrong
   modes. Obviously that 'hardening' failed here. Why?
2) Because of glibc's openpty() as called by openssh opens
   the slave device with O_NOCTTY (it has to do so). This leaves
   tiocsti() with pants down, since there is no "controlling owner"
   for this tty yet and the attacker is free to catch on it.
3) The wrong mode (0622) is set, and later openssh calls ioctl(TIOCSCTTY)
   to claim it as the controlling tty for the shell.
   -> The race happens in between them and its just a few syscalls

So the race that needs to be won is actually against the kernels
tiocsti() check, as the wrong mode stays much longer. If the race is
lost, its likely that the open still succeeds, but the injection of
commands is no longer possible. That might explain why the bug was
flagged as "local DoS".

If the race fails, the exploit loop could be tightened to close any fd's in the child,
so the open() automatically gets it as controlling tty and the race
is easier to win.

Kudos to the exploit dev who has PoC||GTFO'ed us.
