Subject: CVE request Qemu: watchdog: memory leakage in virtual hardware
 watchdog wdt_i6300esb

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the virtual hardware watchdog 'wdt_i6300esb' 
support is vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while doing a 
device unplug operation; Doing so repeatedly would result in leaking host 
memory, affecting other services on the host.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause a DoS and/or 
potentially crash the Qemu process on the host.
