Subject:  CVE Request: PHP PECL module APC vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow


As this ticket demonstrates, the popular PHP PECL extension APC
(Alternative PHP Cache: http://pecl.php.net/package/APC), which is
slated for inclusion in PHP core in PHP6, is vulnerable to a stack-based
buffer overflow attack due to no bounds checking, which can lead to a
privilege escalation.

The vulnerable code appeared in the APC CVS on June 30th, so APC 3.0.11
and newer are vulnerable.

Thanks,
Micah
