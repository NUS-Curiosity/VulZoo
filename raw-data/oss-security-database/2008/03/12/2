This was one of those complex issues where, if you looked at the original
changelog, you couldn't tell how many CVEs to assign.  Thus the delay,
though the bug report definitely helps.

CVEs will be filled in later today.


CVE-2008-1290 - list CVS or SVN commits on "all-forbidden"
files

CVE-2008-1291 - directly access hidden CVSROOT folders

CVE-2008-1292 - expose restricted content via the revision
view, the log history, or the diff view
