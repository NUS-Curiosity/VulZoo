Subject: was: SA29489 CenterIM URL handling flaw

Hi,

That's partly true. While centerim has no special URL 
handler to handle incoming urls it does provide the ability 
to list urls in a message by pressing F2. If you press enter 
on one of these urls it tries to open it in an external 
browser and executes the other commands as well.

You see the commands in the URL however so I think the 
impact of this is like sending someone a message with 
"please type rm -rf ~ in your shell" so the secunia rating 
is a bit beyond the actual impact.

Kind regards
Nico
