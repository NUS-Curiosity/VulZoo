I've taken care of this.  Next time, please look at the message headers
for the mailing list manager's unsubscribe/subscribe/help addresses.

In case this sort of requests become common, we'll have to add message
trailers with instructions in them and/or pre-moderate the list even for
postings from subscribers.  The john-users mailing list that we run on
this same server currently has both of these things, so it's a matter of
changing the settings.
