Subject: CVE request: policyd-weight insecure temporary file creation

Hey all,

quoting DSA-1531-1:
Chris Howells discovered that policyd-weight, a policy daemon for the 
Postfix mail transport agent, created its socket in an insecure way, 
which may be exploited to overwrite or remove arbitary files from the 
local system.

Please note that the 0.1.14.15 release and the patch introduced in the 
Debian package do not properly fix this vulnerability, it still 
contains a race condition. See the Gentoo bug for details.
