Subject: request CVE id: insecure handling of DISPLAY in rxvt

Hi all,
Steve, can I get a CVE id for the following issue in rxvt?

"If the DISPLAY environment is not set, rxvt opens an xterm 
on :0, which on some headless login-server means anyone can setup 
an fake X server waiting for someone loggin in without X 
forwarding to start rxvt by some mistake or by some program (thus 
without even noticing) and getting full shell access to that other 
account."

This is Debian bug 469296[0].

It should be a good idea to check other terminal emulators 
as well.

Cheers
Nico
