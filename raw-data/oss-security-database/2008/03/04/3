  It seems like an issue which I'd almost be tempted to say isn't
 a security one.

  The idea is that if you typically connect to a host with display
 forwarding you'll be used to running rxvt and having the resulting
 application display locally.

  However if you forget to enable display forwarding then run
 RXVT it will connect to :1, rather than complain there is no
 DISPLAY set and abort.  That *could* allow a malicious local
 server to steal keyboard, & etc.

  However I have a hard time seeing this in practise.  It would
 mean that locally you couldn't trust root - since it would take
 a local root user to setup the fake X11 server on :1..

  This attack is like saying that if you forget to open your
 eyes you might accidentally walk into the wrong house and
 have people see what you're doing..
