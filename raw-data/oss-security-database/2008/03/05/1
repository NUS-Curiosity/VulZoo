I don't understand how that's an issue with rxvt. If you "fix" the 
terminal emulator not to that, yo can still run rxvt -display :0 or env 
DISPLAY=:0 rxvt.

But then  I also don't understant what you mean by "setup an fake X 
server waiting for someone loggin in..."

Could you describe the attack scenario in  a bit more details?
