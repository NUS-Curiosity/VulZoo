I don't think you need root privileges to take advantage of this...

Let's assume shared box where users ssh -X and run some X programs,
e.g. rxvt.  Let's assume unprivileged user can start local X session
which will be DISPLAY=:0 and do xhost + to allow connections from other
users to her display (maybe Xvnc can be used instead of local X session
too).  Now she just have to wait for some other user to ssh without X
forwarding and start rxvt on her display.

Yes, many assumptions and ifs, but still silently assuming DISPLAY=:0
when no DISPLAY is set does not sound like a safe default.

Just my 2c.
