  Agreed.

  This should be a matter of running 'startx' appropriately.  I was
 under the misapprehension that only root could startup X, but that
 seems not to be the case.

  Providing the host wasn't already running X then it might be possible
 for local users to launch a copy they control.

  I'd look forward to that too.
