Subject: CVE request: ruby information disclosure

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Gentoo has an open bug [1] indicating a minor information disclosure
issue in ruby. They also sortof indicate that there has been a CVE
request, but I can't find it anywhere. So either consider this a request
or a ping on an existing request :)

rPath also has an issue [2] if you need references.
