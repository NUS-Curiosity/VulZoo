Subject: CVE request: bzip2 CERT-FI: 20469

Hey,

CERT-FI: 20469 [1] was released yesterday, and with it a new bzip2 
release, quoting their CHANGES:

1.0.5 (10 Dec 07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Security fix only.  Fixes CERT-FI 20469 as it applies to bzip2.


Reading the patch [2], it's missing a boundary check that can lead to an 
over-read on the tt/ll heap-buffer. I'd call this a DoS, did anyone 
else review?

Thanks,
Robert
