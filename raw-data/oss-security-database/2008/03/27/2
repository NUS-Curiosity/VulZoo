The same issue also exists in:
aterm, tested 1.0.1
eterm, tested 0.9.4
mrxvt, tested 0.5.3
multi-aterm, tested 0.2.1
rxvt-unicode, tested 8.3 and 8.9
wterm, tested with 6.2.9

This is almost half of the terminal emulators I tried. There are 
probably tons of other X applications doing this, not all with the 
impact of a shell, but many allow starting other programs one way or 
another.

Reading the attack vector, I would consider it a vulnerability, but 
looking at the amount of programs that fall into this category, I'm 
worried how many programs do this and if the low impact is really worth 
fixing all of them.
