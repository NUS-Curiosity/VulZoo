As has been pointed out elsewhere, the runtime (netrw.vim being part
of it) updates are independently of the patches -- at the time of the
release of the first advisory, the contemporary runtime had some of
the vulnerabilities fixed, for example.  I'm not sure if the changes
are kept track of outside of the point releases.  Since distributions
generally pick whatever is current at the time of the release, is it
meaningful to say x.y is vulnerable, and x.z isn't?  The runtime files
are versioned and dated, so for example the first version of ftp.vim
not vulnerable is version 21 of 2008-07-12.

You people are obviously more versed in assigning CVEs, so let me
submit very humbly:  The overall issue is that up until recently Vim
script did not provide any means of quoting metacharacters.  At the
time of the first advisory, there were close to a thousand ``execute''
statements.   The particular vulnerabilities detailed in the
advisories are examples of a more widespread tendency in the Vim code.
 Should there be a separate CVE for the overall issue, alongside CVEs
for the particular vulnerabilities?

From what I could find on the web this morning, I'm not sure whether
this is the way CVEs are supposed to work.  There will surely be more
confirmed vulnerabilities, and it would be nice to be able to point to
a CVE number and say: ``This is one of the vulnerabilities under
CVE-2008-xxxx''?

I hope I've helped the discussion a bit.

Jan Minar.

PS: The buffer overflow is interesting -- thanks!
