"This version addresses a few security issues and fixes some small bugs."

These sound like security issues:
* Sanitation of $topic wasn't always done right.
* Fixed a vulnerability with the use of the html-tag - issue reported by 
Jessica Hope.

Though they don't list which issues are security relevant.

They also don't mention if CVE-2007-5943 is fixed.
