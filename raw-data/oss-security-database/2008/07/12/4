Subject: CVE id request: op

Hi,
op, a replacement for sudo that is used to grant access to 
certain root operations to users suffers of a stack based 
buffer overflow because of missing bounds check of the 
XAUTHORITY variable used if op is configured with 
--enable-xauth and op.conf uses the xauth configuration 
option. Under a normal installation this tool runs with an 
effective user id 0 so it is possible to exploit this and 
get more privileges or execute arbitrary code with root 
privileges.

Fixed upstream changeset:

Steve, could you assign a CVE id to this?

Kind regards
Nico
