As far as I see, they wanted to fix the session fixation issue in 5.8,
but the fix did not solve the problem, as you say.

I asked for a CVE because we already released an advisory for 5.8 with
the old CVE, we released a new one for 5.9 and I thought it's better if
there is a common id for the new "session fixation in 5.8" issue.
