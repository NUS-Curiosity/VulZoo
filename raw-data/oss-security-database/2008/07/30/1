Subject: CVE request: condor < 7.0.4

Needs CVE name

https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-world/2008q2/msg00003.shtml
leading to:
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.0/8_3Stable_Release.html

 	This release fixes a problem causing possible incorrect handling of wild
 	cards in authorization lists. Examples of the configuration variables that
 	specify authorization lists are

 	  ALLOW_WRITE
 	  DENY_WRITE
 	  HOSTALLOW_WRITE
 	  HOSTDENY_WRITE

 	If a configuration variable uses the asterisk character (*) in
 	configuration variables that specify the authorization policy, it is
 	advisable to upgrade. This is especially true for the use of wild cards in
 	any DENY list, since this problem could result in access being allowed,
 	when it should have been denied. This issue affects all previous versions
 	of Condor.

Thanks, Mark
