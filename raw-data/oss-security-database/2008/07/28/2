Why does this mention Turba?  Affected script does not seem to be part
of Turba, at least not part of Fedora packages.

Btw, this seems to be an issue fixed by upstream mid-June in horde
3.1.8 and 3.2.1 (and other Horde suites that include Horde Framework +
some other components in all-in-one suite), see following bug for
further references:
