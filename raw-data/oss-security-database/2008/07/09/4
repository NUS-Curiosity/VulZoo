Subject: DNS vulnerability: other relevant software

Hi,

looking at some of the DNS related software in our tree, I thought it 
might be nice to keep track of any findings of affected and unaffected 
packages...
So here is a start:

- posadis [1]:
	has not seen an update since dec 2004; I could not find 	any info on 
port randomization etc., but considering the age it might probably have 
other issues too.

- dnsmasq [2]:
	no port randomization [3]

- pdnsd [4]:
	no info yet

- MaraDNS [5]:
	"MaraDNS uses a strong secure RNG for both the query (16 bits of 
entropy) and the source port of the query (12 bits of entropy). This 
makes spoofing replies to a MaraDNS server more difficult, since the 
attacker has only a one in 250 million chance that a given spoofed reply 
will be considered valid." [6]

- MyDNS [7]:
	"MyDNS does not include recursive name service, nor a resolver library."
	also this thread [8]

- DNRD [9]: "Uses random source port and random query ID's to prevent 
cache poisoning."
