Subject: CVE id request: projectl

Hi,
the projectl game seems to be vulnerable to a symlink 
attack. It writes its preferences file to the current 
working directory to a hardcoded file name and following 
symlinks when doing this.

http://bugs.debian.org/489988

Can I get a CVE identifier for this?

Thanks!
Nico
