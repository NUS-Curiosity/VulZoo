Note that GNU libc stub resolver when used with a recent kernel (2.6.24+) 
will give you random UDP source ports on each request because of this 
Linux commit:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=32c1da70810017a98aa6c431a5494a302b6b9a30

Vendors may with to consider backporting that kernel patch as an effective 
mitigation without requiring glibc changes (and with the advantage of 
being able to be have a customized range using ip_local_port_range etc)

Cheers, Mark
