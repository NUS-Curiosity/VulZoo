Version 109 is probably too old.  There has been a lot of
functionality added since, and I presume a lot of refactoring done
too.  According to the [0]Netrw version history, marking files (used
by netrw.v2 & netrw.v3) was introduced in version 111.

On the other hand, these vulnerabilities should not depend on the Vim
version; the TIOCSTI method used in netrw.v4 ``test'' target may not
be very portable outside Un*x though.

Hope that helps.
