I'm not sure I fully understand Thierry Carrez' comment about the security
implications of this issue.  It seems like an exploit would require a
malicious DHCP server, in which case isn't DHCP service already
compromised?  If so, then a crash of dnsmasq (null dereference?) doesn't
seem to be any worse than the loss of DHCP itself.
