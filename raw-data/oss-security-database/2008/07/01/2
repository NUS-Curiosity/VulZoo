So It seems from my testing, this flaw does not trigger the assertion on
OpenLDAP version 2.0.27, but does on at least 2.2.13.

As upstream suggested this was added in version 1.88 of the io.c file, that
would suggest this flaw should affect OpenLDAP versions after 2.1.20 (don't
quote me on this, as I'm not completely sure, it could affect a few older
versions around 2.1.20).

Thanks.
