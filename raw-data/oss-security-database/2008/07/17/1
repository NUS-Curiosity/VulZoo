As I understand RH released patch to fix problem with deny_file
statement (not hosts) -- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=174764

But introduce memory leak (CVE-2007-5962) and release package with
fixed version of their patch.

Please correct me if I make mistake, but seems this is a typo and
You mean deny_file, not deny_hosts.
