This might be a straightforward bug - maybe the topic is always
"sanitized" to 0 and prevents legitimate display of pages.

Use CVE-2008-3073, see below.

There's also this:

  Improved the random generator seeding for PHP < 4.2.0 - issue reported
  by Jessica Hope

Since Jessica has a track record for reporting SMF vulns, I think there's
a high probability that this issue is also security-related.

So, use CVE-2008-3072 for this.

They also fixed CVE-2008-2019: "Increased the randomness of the Captcha
sound."  This, in conjunction with the original researcher's claim of
vendor notification, seems like sufficient acknowledgement.

... also CVE-2008-0284, CVE-2008-0775, and others.
