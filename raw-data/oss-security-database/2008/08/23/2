If it can be triggered by a SWF on the website, I would perhaps
call it a security issue.

If it crashes the SWF mozilla plugin and so the browser, it is
a denial of service in my eyes.

More importantly if code execution is possible.


I have however not researched those further (just saw the changelog as
packager of swfdec), and currently swfdec itself is probably not yet
fully production ready anyway.

Yeah.

Not really investigated and no time :/ Since swfdec is beta and not yet
wildy iin use we could let it rest.
