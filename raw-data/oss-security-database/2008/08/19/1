Subject: wordpress 2.6.1

Just had a look at the wp 2.6.1 changelog.

Two security relevant bugs are listed as fixed.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7359
I'd consider this worth a CVE. It's good that this ssl stuff got some 
attention lately (I think this is a similar issue to the recently reported 
cookie / secureflag issues, as it can undermine the sniffing-safety of 
ssl-enabled pages).

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6871

AFAICS this enables one to hide malicious plugins but is no real vuln. Not 
sure if it deserves a CVE.
