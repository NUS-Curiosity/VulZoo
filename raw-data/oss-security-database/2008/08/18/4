I disagree because mktemp offers the functionality of just 
creating the file name and instantly unlinking it thus only 
providing the generation of a random name. While I don't 
think that many scripts rely on this it can be the case.

--with-libc is not used by some vendors because it limits 
the template used for the file name. mktemp from coreutils 
should be a better choice any way...

Cheers
Nico
