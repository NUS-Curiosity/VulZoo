Subject: opensc 0.11.6 with fixed security update

Hi,

this is a copy of a new security announcement we had to make, already public.
our last security update with OpenSC 0.11.5 had a small glitch, so this 
version fixes that glitch. Please everyone update the opensc packages in your
distribution.

Those who don't want to update, but only apply the changes necessary:
keep the patch I posted last time, but add this change:

Security update for OpenSC
==========================

OpenSC Security Advisory [27-Aug-2008]
--------------------------------------

OpenSC initializes CardOS cards with improper access rights

This is an update to our security advisory 31-Jul-2008. 

Chaskiel M Grundman found a security vulnerability in OpenSC. The 
vulnerability has been fixed in OpenSC 0.11.6. In Mitre's CVE dictionary this 
issue is filed under CVE-2008-2235. Users will need to 
run "pkcs15-tool -T -U" to test (-T) and update (-U) the security settings on 
their card. 
 
All versions of OpenSC prior to 0.11.5 initialized smart cards with Siemens 
CardOS M4 card operating system without proper access right: the ADMIN file 
control information in the 5015 directory on the smart card was left to 00 
(all access allowed). 

OpenSC 0.11.5 released July 30th 2008 was found to contain only a partial fix. 
The new tool for testing and updating smart cards ("pkcs15-tool -T") 
contained a too strict check - including the Card label to match "OpenSC". 
Jean-Pierre Szikora found this problem: a card can be initialized with 
setting any label (use "pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15 --label foobar" for 
example), thus this check was too strict and had to be removed. 

With this bug anyone can change a user PIN without having the PIN or PUK or 
the superusers PIN or PUK. However it can not be used to figure out the PIN. 
Thus if the PIN on your card is still the same you always had, then you can 
be sure, that noone exploited this vulnerability. 

This vulnerability affects only smart cards and usb crypto tokens based on 
Siemens CardOS M4, and within that group only those that were initialized 
with OpenSC. 

Users of other smart cards and usb crypto tokens are not affected. Users of 
Siemens CardOS M4 based smart cards and crypto tokens are not affected, if 
the card was initialized with some software other than OpenSC. 

The new version of OpenSC implements a simple way to verify if a card is 
affected or not: 
	pkcs15-tool
has now two new options: 
        --test-update, -T             Test if the card needs a security update
        --update, -U                  Update the card with a security update

Running 
	pkcs15-tool -T
 will either show 
        fci is up-to-date, card is fine
 or 
        fci is out-of-date, card is vulnerable

If the card is vulnerable, please update the security setting using: 
	pkcs15-tool -T -U
this will show: 
        fci is out-of-date, card is vulnerable
        security update applied with success.

Our Mac OS X Installer Package "SCA" is also affected by this vulnerability: 
Version 0.2.2 and earlier are vulnerable and version 0.2.3 included the 
partial fix with OpenSC 0.11.5 only. A new version 0.2.4 including OpenSC 
0.11.6 will be soon available. 

Our old Windows Installer Package "SCB" is also affected by this 
vulnerability: All versions are affected. We don't have any windows developer 
left, so right now noone can update this package. But new windows binaries 
build using mingw are now available in the "Build" project. Version 001 
includes OpenSC 0.11.5 with the partial fix, a new version 002 with OpenSC 
0.11.6 will be soon available.
