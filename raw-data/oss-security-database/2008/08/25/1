Subject: CVE request: kernel: sctp: fix potential panics in the SCTP-AUTH
 API

This was committed in upstream kernel recently.

"[PATCH] sctp: fix potential panics in the SCTP-AUTH API.

All of the SCTP-AUTH socket options could cause a panic if the extension
is disabled and the API is envoked.

Additionally, there were some additional assumptions that certain
pointers would always be valid which may not always be the case."

Upstream commit:
