Hey Pınar,

I noticed Pardus is not yet listed on the 'How to steal hard work and 
patches from others' page, aka:
  http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/distro-patches

If you host your patches somewhere, please add a pointer there.
Also, are you managing security bugs with Bugzilla, or somewhere else 
where one can look up the status of an issue?

Thanks,
Robert
