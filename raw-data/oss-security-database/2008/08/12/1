Subject: CVE request: tikiwiki < 2.0

From the release notes:
    *  Joshua Morin reported several issues
    * Jesús Olmos at Internet Security Auditors (external link) reported a 
leak which could be used to disclose path and PHP configuration.
    * Special thanks to Philippe Gamache (external link) & Damien Seguy 
(external link) for their advice 

(though that doesn't tell much...) At least the second one is specific enough 
to deserve a cve.
