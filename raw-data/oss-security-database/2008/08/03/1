Subject: CVE request: OpenVPN (client) 2.1-beta14 through 2.1-rc8

OpenVPN 2.1_rc9 changelog contains following:

* Security Fix -- affects non-Windows OpenVPN clients running
  OpenVPN 2.1-beta14 through 2.1-rc8 (OpenVPN 2.0.x clients are NOT
  vulnerable nor are any versions of the OpenVPN server vulnerable).
  An OpenVPN client connecting to a malicious or compromised
  server could potentially receive an "lladdr" or "iproute" configuration
  directive from the server which could cause arbitrary code execution on
  the client. A successful attack requires that (a) the client has agreed
  to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by including
  "pull" or the macro "client" in its configuration file, (b) the client
  succesfully authenticates the server, (c) the server is malicious or has
  been compromised and is under the control of the attacker, and (d) the
  client is running a non-Windows OS.  Credit: David Wagner.
