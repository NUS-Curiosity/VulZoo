Subject: amarok temp file vuln

One of the Mandriva developers pointed out the following to me:

http://websvn.kde.org/?view=rev&revision=846626

Looks like a temporary file vulnerability.

More references here:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=494765

Doesn't look like it has a CVE assigned to it.
