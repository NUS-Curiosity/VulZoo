======================================================
Name: CVE-2008-3652
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3652
Reference: MLIST:[ipsec-tools-devel] 20080811 [PATCH] Track and delete orphaned ph1s
Reference: URL:http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=48a0c7a0.qPeWZAE0PY8bDDq%2B%25olel%40ans.pl&forum_name=ipsec-tools-devel

src/racoon/handler.c in racoon in ipsec-tools does not remove an
"orphaned ph1" (phase 1) handle when it has been initiated remotely,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption).
