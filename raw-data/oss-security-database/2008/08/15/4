Subject: CVE request for neon

I haven't had any luck contacting either the Debian maintainer or the 
Debian BTS to update details of this issue.

Hi, can you assign a CVE number for an issue in neon:

A NULL pointer deference in the Digest authentication support in neon 
versions 0.28.0 through 0.28.2 inclusive allows a malicious server to 
crash a client application, resulting in possible denial of service.

Reference: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=476571

Regards, Joe
