Hi,

Even if it's probably easy to guess with or without a translator, the
ticket description says:

In advisor mode, users's e-mails are masked with the address
"advisor.mode@...ite"
But if the advisor clicks to edit the user's profile, he can access
his real address.

For those wondering what the "advisor mode" is, since it seems to be
documented only in french
(http://phpwebgallery.net/doc/doku.php/fr:fonctionnalites:conseiller),
this is actually a read-only access to the admin interface, for helping
out a user to configure the gallery. So this issue is basically an
information disclosure.

HTH,
