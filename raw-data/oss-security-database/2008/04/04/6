As I see it, the list is for members of the open-source community. Thus,
to be admitted to the list, you either have to demonstrate that you're a
developer of a (at least marginally notable) open source project, that
you're a vendor who redistributes oss, or that you're a security
researcher who audits or otherwise interacts with oss.

This is, of course, only my opinion and may not reflect the rest of the
group's ideas.
