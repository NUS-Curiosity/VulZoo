Subject: CVE id request: squid

Hi!

Squid developers recently updated their Squid security advisory
SQUID-2007_2 released few months back.  It was modified to list another
patch that fixes a problem introduced in previous patch.

An attacker can cause squid to hit assert in the child process, causing
it to exit.  This is a temporary DoS, breaking existing connections and
making squid unavailable for a while.  New child is spawned by squid
parent process.  Easy to perform if attacker has control over the
server, but I guess it may be possible in reverse proxy setups as well.
