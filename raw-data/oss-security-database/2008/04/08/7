Josh,

Thank you for the prompt response.

OK, that's up to you indeed, and I appreciate your work on the wiki a
lot.  I just thought that we could proceed with these tasks in parallel
to have something ready sooner rather than later.  And it does not have
to be a "big" public announcement right away - but having some
announcement text that this group is comfortable with would be helpful.

That's not how I see it.  We had an opportunity here, which we could use
if we wanted to - but we chose not to.  That's all.

We can trivially turn message moderation on for everyone - which is what
I will do as soon as we start getting undesirable postings.  So I am not
afraid of this list being announced on Bugtraq & f-d right now.

We can also implement your desired setup, but possibly not right away.

It looks like everyone is fine with it, and I have just responded to
that message.

Thanks again,

Alexander
