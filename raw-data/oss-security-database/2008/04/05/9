I am not so sure.  On our wiki, we have a separation between distro
vendors and individual Open Source projects - and I like it.  I haven't
found a way to extract a list of distro vendors only from osvdb.org.

Also, some vendors and projects may have relevant info that just does
not fit into pre-defined fields on osvdb.org - yet it may be specified
in entries on the wiki.

It is a good idea to update the info at osvdb.org with whatever we have.
For example, I was not able to find rPath in the osvdb.org database.
Then the vendors/projects themselves would need to remember to keep
those entries up to date as well...

Also, we should definitely link to osvdb.org.
