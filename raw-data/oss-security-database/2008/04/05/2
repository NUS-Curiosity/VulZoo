I think at this point, just mentioning it should suffice until we figure
out the basics (unless Andrea waits until next week and we have a
consensus in place).

No, not for oCERT, for sure.  But I think I'd like to see some of the
ground-rules laid out first, now, before we have to re-think or change
things later (in terms of basics), and end up ticking people off.

I think maybe a moderated subscription, and unmoderated postings (for
members, moderated non-subscriber postings mandatory) would be a good
way to do it.

I think the wiki content is ok... we could delay this for months just
getting the wiki content straightened out and flushed out.  I don't
think we want to do that.  Tightening up who can edit the wiki is a good
idea tho.

I agree.

No, I don't think we need to moderate member postings.  I think we
should do it this way:

- members can post at will
- subscribers are read-only [1]
- non-members have posts moderated
- membership is moderated

[1] the distinction between member and subscriber is a member being
someone who can post, and a subscriber is someone who gets it read-only
