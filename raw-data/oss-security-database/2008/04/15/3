Subject: CVE id request: cecilia insecure temporary file usage

Hi,
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=476321
cecilia[0] writes data into a predictable temporary file not 
opening with O_EXCL and opens this up for a symlink attack.

Can I get a CVE id please for this one?

[0] http://cecilia.sourceforge.net/

Kind regards
Nico
