Subject: web archives


The archives as stored at
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/04/ etc. only list posts
using sequence numbers.  Would it be easy to list these by subject line,
author, and/or in a threaded basis?  I find it hard to navigate when I'm
looking for a particular post.

Thanks for the consideration,
Steve
