Well, it turns out that Lars was wrong (and he already confirmed it) -
the messages have expired.  Unfortunately, according to Lars, to get the
messages re-imported I'd have to mangle their Message-IDs.  I'm afraid
that there's no way to do this correctly - even if I identify just the
missing messages, change Message-IDs on them, and change In-Reply-To and
References on messages in my local archive accordingly, that won't help
to get the missing messages properly threaded with those that are still
seen at Gmane (and are not to be re-imported).  Perhaps the only
solution would be to drop and re-import the entire list into Gmane.

I don't think we care about those missing messages from February that
much (and they're seen just fine on other archives of the list), so I am
not going to do anything about this (and bother Lars with it again).

Sorry about that.
