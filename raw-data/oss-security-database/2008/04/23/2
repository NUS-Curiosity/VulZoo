Spiffy. Thanks for taking the time to set this up.

So, this means that anyone from this point on who subscribes to the list
does so effectively as read-only, and messages they send will be held
for moderation. Similarly, folks who aren't subscribed at all will be
held for moderation, but not rejected automatically. Folks in the white
list (whether or not they are subscribed) can post with no delay, and
everyone who has posted a message prior to today is in the white list.
Right?
