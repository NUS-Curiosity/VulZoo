Exactly.  Thank you for summarizing it so nicely.

On a related note, now that this list has been CC'ed on some Bugtraq
postings, we're receiving a lot more spam to it.  Unfortunately, some of
this spam gets through the filters and takes up the time of the
moderators.  Yet we obviously couldn't have avoided this happening,
sooner or later - and it makes some sense to have the list CC'ed like
that.  It also serves to advertise the list to subscribers of other
related lists, such as Bugtraq.

Josh - now that the list setup has been restricted like you wanted, are
you going to work on an announcement suitable for posting to Bugtraq?
