Subject: [oCERT-2008-003] libpng zero-length chunks incorrect handling


2008/04/12 #2008-003 libpng zero-length chunks incorrect handling

Description:

Applications using libpng that install unknown chunk handlers, or copy
unknown chunks, may be vulnerable to a security issue which may result in
incorrect output, information leaks, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.

The issue involves libpng incorrectly handling zero length chunks which
results in uninitialized memory affecting the control flow of the
application.

Affected version:

The libpng project indicates libpng-1.0.6 through 1.0.32, libpng-1.2.0
through 1.2.26, and libpng-1.4.0beta01 through libpng-1.4.0beta19 built with
PNG_READ_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED or PNG_READ_USER_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED (default
configuration) are affected.

Fixed version:

libpng version 1.2.27 and 1.0.33 are in beta and will be released on or about
April 26, 2008 according to libpng maintainer

libpng-1.2.27beta01
