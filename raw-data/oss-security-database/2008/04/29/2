eGroupWare 1.4.004 FCKeditor update & security release
Eingetragen von Ralf Becker am 2008/04/15 - 17:46

UPDATE: the first 1.4.004 packages contained two bugs:
- felamimail gave an error "no egw_simple toolbar set"
- the spellchecker / aspell did not work (it need to be configured and enabled 
in Admin >> Site configuration)

The 1.4.004-2 tar.bz2, tar.gz and zip packages and the 1.4.005-15 rpm packages 
are fixing the above errors.

==> WE RECOMMEND EVERYONE UPDATES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

The update includes all previous 1.4 updates and requires no schema update (if 
you upgrade within the 1.4 release).

The fixed security problems are grave, if you have directories writable by the 
webserver in you docroot (in most windows server the complete docroot 
writable by default, but many linux servers are also set up that way).
