This works for me.

I agree.  My solution was perhaps a little too convoluted and/or
paranoid... take your pick.  =)

I can deal with this too.  There's, what, a half-dozen of us that are
getting notices of changes to the wiki so any problems should be picked
up and corrected pretty quickly.

It's fine with me, and I see Solar is ok with it as well so I say do it
(I don't see anyone else having spoken up one way or the other, and it's
taken me a few days to get to this... release week always causes time
shortages).
