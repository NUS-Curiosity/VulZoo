Subject: Re: CVE Id request: vim


In a perfect world, we'd know which Vim scripts were vulnerable in which
version, but I don't see an easy way of determining that.  So, only one
CVE is being assigned for them, pending any additional details.

Vim 7.1.314, 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that do not
properly sanitize inputs before invoking the execute or system
functions, as demonstrated using (1) filetype.vim, (2) zipplugin, (3)
xpm.vim, (4) gzip_vim, and (5) netrw.
