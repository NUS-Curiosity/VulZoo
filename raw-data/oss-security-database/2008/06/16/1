You're right, but I'm sorry to say there is no estimated release date -
it's "as soon as it's ready", and the official patches are part of the
advisories, taken from the SVN repository - and beyond that are what
distributors usually ask for. fetchmail is, in spite of its widespread
use, effectively a one-man spare-time show.

Impeding the 6.3.9 release, there are some nasty bugs that aren't
security relevant which are pending the fix, but are hard to debug.
