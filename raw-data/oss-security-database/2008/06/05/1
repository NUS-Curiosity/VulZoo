As I also pointed out in our bug [1], this only happens in two cases:
(1) The interactive shell is used to run python code.
(2) A python script resides inside an untrusted directory.

What I expect to be the most common use case, running python code 
from /usr, or /home, is safe. Since all out-of-the-box software would 
be installed in directories that are not world-writable, I am tempted 
call (2) an error on the user side. Changing the behaviour of python in 
this manner would also break existing programs.
