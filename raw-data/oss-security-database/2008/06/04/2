Subject: CVE id request: slash

Hi

I am not sure, if anyone asked for a CVE id for slash yet, if so please point 
to it and disregard this request.

The Slashdote (also just known as Slash) vulnerability was an SQL injection. 
Its effect was to allow a user with no special authorization to read any 
information from any table the Slash site's mysql user was authorized to read 
(which may include other databases, including information_schema).

Upstream announcement:
http://www.slashcode.com/article.pl?sid=08/01/07/2314232

Upstream patch:
http://slashcode.cvs.sourceforge.net/slashcode/slash/Slash/Utility/Environment/Environment.pm?r1=1.223&r2=1.225

Debian Bug report:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=484499



Cheers
Steffen
