rPath also auto-generates keys using the initscript found in the openssh
source. In the unpacked tarball, it is called contrib/redhat/sshd.init.
So, presumably, Red Hat does the same. Key generation pulls random bits
from /dev/random, though, and thus blocks until enough randomness is
available. That actually caused me some problems once when the machine
hung on first-boot until it got enough disk interrupts or whatever.
