Not to be argumentative, but have you installed OpenBSD lately
(effectively the reference platform for OpenSSH development)? For
years, its base install has run sshd by default, generated host keys
at first boot, and not prompted at the console for human interaction
to augment entropy for this process. I find it hard to blame this
*particular* behavior on Debian (unless you're suggesting that they
strong-armed OpenSSH upstream to integrate these changes on their
behalf?).
