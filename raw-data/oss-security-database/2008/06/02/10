I wholeheartedly agree. Announcements of this kind belong on bugtraq/FD
or per-software announce lists like nmap-announce. I think this list is,
or should be, for discussion only. If the post isn't designed to spark
discussion (other than "does this belong here" discussion :-) it should
be somewhere else.

Announcements are intended either for existing end-users or as a PR
ploy. Existing users are probably subscribed to the project-specific
list (or don't care) and this isn't the place for PR.

So, was this message, and "SQL_injection detection tool released" held
for moderation? If so, why were they approved? Presumably whoever did so
has some reason not-yet-mentioned, since the SQL_injection one didn't
contain a query about testing and code review.

If they were not held for moderation, why not? I thought everything not
coming from a limited whitelist of people was held...
