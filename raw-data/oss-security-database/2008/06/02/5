I personally think that open code reviews are a very good idea, and it's
something OSS projects would greatly benefit from.

That's why oCERT was also started for helping in security audits and code
review requests (we are already doing some). But if requestor doesn't mind a
public scrutiny oss-security sure feels like the good place for it.

So I wouldn't mind and I'd actually see this as a benefit for this list.

Cheers
