With all due respect, how exactly do you know that? :)

We will expand man power accordingly to load, we are here for organizing and
handling, otherwise we wouldn't have started oCERT in the first place.

Also not everyone might like a public review as they might want embargoes for
potential issues and so on.

Sure we might be in scenarios where we can't cope, if so we will declare so.
Still that didn't happened yet and any speculation about it shouldn't suggest
that people should not send us reports if they want to.

Cheers!
