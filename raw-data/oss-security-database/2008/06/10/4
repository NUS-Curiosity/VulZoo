After looking at the iDefense advisory, and through the Freetype changelog,
it looks like this is the changeset we need to fix this:

2008-06-08  Werner Lemberg

        * src/type1/t1parse.h (T1_ParserRec): Make `base_len' and
        `private_len' unsigned.

        * src/type1/t1parse.c (read_pfb_tag): Make `asize' unsigned and
        * read
        it as such.
        (T1_New_Parser, T1_Get_Private_Dict): Make `size' unsigned.


        * src/base/ftstream.c (FT_Stream_Skip): Reject negative values.


        * src/type1/t1load.c (parse_blend_design_positions): Check `n_axis'
        for sane value.
        Fix typo.


        * src/psaux/psobjs.c (ps_table_add): Check `idx' correctly.


        * src/truetype/ttinterp (Ins_SHC): Use BOUNDS() to check
        `last_point'.


        * src/sfnt/ttload.c (tt_face_load_max_profile): Limit
        `maxTwilightPoints'.

I'll attach the patch (with comment changes stripped).
