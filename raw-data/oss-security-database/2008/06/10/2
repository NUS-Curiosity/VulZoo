Subject: FreeType 2.3.6

So it seems FreeType 2.3.6 fixes some security issues:

    - A  bunch of  potential security  problems have  been found.  All
      users should update.

Does anyone have a freetype contact who we can try to convince to work with
the community in the future (or give us patches for these)?

Thanks.
