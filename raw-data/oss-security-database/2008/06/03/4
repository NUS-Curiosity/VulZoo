OK, but as I've just tried to explain, this is not always possible or
feasible for a list moderator to figure out.

Also, there are not that many security tool announcements on Bugtraq.
I think that people are often too shy to announce on Bugtraq.  This is
another reason why I think there's room for a new list, but before one
is created, we could simply let the announcements to be sent in here,
regardless of whether they're cross-posted or not.  If this works, then
create the list.
