Until oss-security, these CVE requests were typically made either by one
distro and included in their bug report, or through vendor-sec even if the
issue was technically public.  When we assigned the CVE, it would often
become the first place where the issue was more widely announced.
Amongst the other benefits of this list, I think it provides a function
for wider, quicker dissemination of these types of issues.  The CVE
requests just happen to be part of the coordination function that the
distros used to perform in less visible ways.
