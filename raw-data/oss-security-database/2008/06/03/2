  I setup the Debian security audit project with the intention that
 people would volunteer to do this.  I guess I found 20-50 issues of
 pretty low severity in my stint, and had hoped to find more.

  The specific problem at the time the audit was started was that
 very few people had the time, the skills, and the motivation to
 join in and help.

  Optimistically if there were people volunteering here I'd be willing
 to spend more of my time on that kind of work myself.  Pessimistically
 people find the work time-consuming and difficult.  Without a few big
 holes found early on many many people lose interest.

  (Me personally I found my time was taken up with other issues, and
 from memory the most prolific auditors that I managed to hook up with
 managed to get jobs in the security field and so they started auditing
 behind closed doors - at least one person told me he was no longer
 allowed to take part in public audits.  Understandable, but
 frustrating.)

  Indeed.

  My initial aim was to divide the Debian archive into "high" and "low"
 risk packages and then only look at the high-risk ones.  (Where
 high-risk meant setuid/setgid or network accessible.)

  Random programs that people point me at aren't terribly interesting
 *unless* I happen to use them myself! ;)

  Yes!

  One interesting recent development I was watching was the google
 audits. I know nothing of the details, but I do recall that several
 issues were reported to vendor sec with a "google audit" "ownership".
