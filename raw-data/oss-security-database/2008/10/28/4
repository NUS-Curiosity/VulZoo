I'd think this is okay as a policy for a distribution and agree that it's a 
very bad idea to enable register_globals these days (afaik it should go away 
in php6 anyway). But anyway a register_globals issue most likely leads to at 
least some bad programming practise (using uninitalized variables), I think 
it's okay to still track them.

And beside, would be worth a check but I am pretty sure there are still lot's 
of webhosters out there having it enabled.
