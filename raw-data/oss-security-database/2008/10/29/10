Subject: CVE Request (dovecot)

I'm not sure if this is a Red Hat specific issue, but I figured I'd mention it here:
It seems dovecot can have an SSL key file password disclosure issue:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=436287

Basically, if your dovecot.conf file is world readable and you have your SSL key
password in it, anyone can see it.
