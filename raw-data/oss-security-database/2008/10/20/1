There's actually at least one issue fixed in 1.1.3 that probably
deserves a CVE:

- 0009321: [security] Users can get title and status of issues that
they don't have access to. (vboctor) - closed.
  http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=9321

Additionally, Gentoo bug:
  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=241940

points out another fix in 1.1.3:

- 0009664: [authentication] Logout without unsetting session cookie
(jreese) - closed.
  http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=9664

Which seems to be on the edge between security fix and security
enhancement, not sure if this kind of fixes get CVE ids assigned.

Thanks!
