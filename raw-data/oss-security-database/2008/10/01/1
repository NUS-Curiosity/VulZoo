Subject: CVE id request: sabre

        Hello!

 There is a tmp file symlink attack pattern in the sabre run scripts
introduced by a Debian patch to them. Given that one of the binaries has
to be run as root due to svgalib requirements this might lead to
overwriting root-owned files in certain use cases.

Debian Bugreport: <http://bugs.debian.org/433996>

Patch is currently in the works so I can't offer it yet.

 Could I please get a CVE id for it?

 Thanks in advance,
Rhonda
