Subject: Not a security issue: htpdate "buffer overflow"

Hi,

a user reported[1] an apparant security issue to use regarding htpdate, 
which states in their changelog[2]:
" - Fixed a buffer overflow when time offset gets to large
    https://dev.openwrt.org/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi/ticket/3940 "

However, the diff upstream applied shows this only is an integer 
overflow, which they also confirmed via mail:
'Sorry for the wrong wordings, but it is indeed "only" an integer 
overflow.'

Since other distros also seem to ship htpdate, hopefully this helps to 
save some time.


Robert
