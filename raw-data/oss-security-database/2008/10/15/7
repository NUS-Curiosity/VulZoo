Here's the current writeup for CVE-2008-4575.

Jamie and John - don't feel forced to publish more specific details, just
knowing the bug types (and whether upstream fixed *all* the overflows in
2.84, or just some) is enough.

Buffer overflow in the DoCommand function in jhead before 2.84 might
allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
via (1) a long -cmd argument and (2) possibly other unspecified
vectors.
