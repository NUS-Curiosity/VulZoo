Subject: CVE Request (netpbm)

I've not seen this assigned yet, it is a bit old, sorry for the delay.

We noticed this via a Fedora update:
https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F9/FEDORA-2008-6999

    update to 10.35.48, fixes buffer overrun in pamperspective and pngtopnm output
    format

The patch is here:
http://netpbm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/netpbm/trunk/editor/pamperspective.c?r1=492&r2=683

Thanks.
