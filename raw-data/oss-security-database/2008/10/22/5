Subject: Re: CVE Request: Opera 9.60 with security fixes


to be filled in later...

fixed in Opera 9.6:

 CVE-2008-4694 code execution using redirects to crafted addresses
 CVE-2008-4695  Java applets cache file read

fixed in 9.6.1:

 CVE-2008-4696 History Search infoleak by insufficient escaping
 CVE-2008-4697 Fast Forward XSS
 CVE-2008-4698 improper script blocking for unrelated news feeds


Arguably some of the 9.6.1 script issues could have been combined...
