I did a little more investigation into IE 7, since that's what the
original report was for.  Its behavior is different than Firefox.  It
quickly ran through most of the code, expanding up to 600 Meg or so,
before generating an "out of memory" alert (but not crashing) while
processing the escape(x4) statement.  So IE goes further, with less of an
impact on my Windows session than the noticeable slowdown using Firefox
(2.x), but IE still doesn't reach the alert(wildboy) statement.

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/496926/100/0/threaded suggests a
relationship with ActiveX content being enabled, but I don't see how that
could apply in the given source (though I only extracted the relevant
code, skipping the image and l33t-sp33k).
