is this possible an issue just for *BSD systems?

I've installed the vulnerable proftpd version from source on a linux system
and was doing the following to reproduce the bug:

$ echo "open ftp://thomasbl@....0.0.1:21" > script; python -c 'for i in range(1,5200): print "%ssyst" % ("A"*i)' >> script
$ lftp -f script &> out
$ grep -iv "Unknown command \`[A]*syst'." out | wc -l
0

Furthermore, I didn't found the vulnerable lines of code in the source
where the patch for the issue is based on. As well as in the actually proftpd
source package the vulnerable source isn't existing.

So, I was wondering that the issue is still a *BSD issue and the
description is wrong.

I am right? Or did I do a mistake?

The same problem I have for CVE-2008-4247. Is it also still a BSD issue?

Kind regards,
Thomas.
