Subject: regarding CVE-2008-4382 & CVE-2008-4381

Hi,
I just had a look at CVE-2008-4382 which is the same issue 
as CVE-2008-4381 but just for conqueror should not get its 
own CVE id in my opinion.

We at Debian don't handle browser 
issues like this as security issues anyway but in this case 
looking at the PoC this would work in every browser 
supporting JavaScript as this is just a trivial memory 
consumption issue by passing a very large string too the 
alert function and thus eating memory, a simple 
while(true){} would be equally effective for eating cpu 
cycles which I wouldn't consider as a vulnerability 
either...

I verified this at least with firefox and opera.

Cheers
Nico
