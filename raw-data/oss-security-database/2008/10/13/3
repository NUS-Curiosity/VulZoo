Please mention both fence_apc and fence_apc_snmp in the CVE
description, as both agents do the same kind of logging.  Description
may also mention cman package, as those fencing agents may be bundled
in fence or cman package, based on the version used.

Note: CVE-2008-4192 was recently assigned to fence_egenera having
similar flaw.

Additionally, fence_manual / fence_ack_manual communicate via FIFO
socket created in /tmp.  fence_manual creates
fifo /tmp/fence_manual.fifo and waits for fence_ack_manual to write to
it.  This can possibly result in the overwrite of arbitrary file.
