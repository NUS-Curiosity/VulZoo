Subject: CVE-2008-3528 Linux kernel ext[234] directory corruption DoS

The ext[234] filesystem code fails to properly handle corrupted data
structures. With a mounted filesystem image or partition that have
corrupted dir->i_size and dir->i_blocks, a user performing either a read
or write operation on the mounted image or partition can lead to a
possible denial of service.
