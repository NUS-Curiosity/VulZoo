Subject: CVE Request (xen)

Hello,

This xen issue was just brought to our attention:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=464817
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=464818

http://lists.xensource.com/archives/html/xen-devel/2008-09/msg00992.html

It seems that a xen guest can write some data into the xenstore that is
later read by libvirt (and possibly other things), which could cause
troubles for the Xen admin.

Thanks.
