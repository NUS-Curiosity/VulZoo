Subject: CVE request: pdnsd <1.2.7 Denial of Service

Hey,

we'd like a CVE for issue (2) of SA31847:
An error exists within the "p_exec_query()" function in src/dns_query.c 
when processing long replies with many answer sections. This can be 
exploited to e.g. crash the service by sending a specially crafted 
reply.
