Subject: CVE request: pam_mount < 0.47 missing security checks

About the security issue
========================

During code refactoring approximately 3 years ago, are affected), some 
sanity/security checks for user-defined volumes were, probably 
accidentally, removed. This allowed users to mount arbitrary sources 
onto arbitrary directories; normally, they can only do so when they own 
the mountpoint, and own the source, or the source is a non-local mount.

Versions 0.10 through 0.45 are affected. The correct behavior enforcing 
these restrictions has been restored in 0.47. By default, user-defined 
configuration files are disabled in pam_mount.conf.xml anyway, and it is 
believed that luserconf-enabled systems are not numerous, so this is 
only a minor issue. It is advised to upgrade the affected systems, or as 
a workaround, disable user-defined volumes by commenting out the 
<luserconf ...> configuration item.
