That's an early version.  The latest from me was the version 3 (three)
of the patch -- attachment of this message:

http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/msg/9290f26f9bc11b33

The whole thread is illustrative.

Also, patch 7.2.010 [0] addresses the issue (I'm not aware of anybody
having analyzing it properly, as to what extent it really eradicates
the vulnerability.  If anybody is going to do that, please keep me
CC'd.).
