Stefan Esser recently warned developers of the dangers of SQL Column 
Truncation and the weakness of mt_rand().  With his help we worked around 
these problems and are now releasing WordPress 2.6.2.  If you allow open 
registration on your blog, you should definitely upgrade.  With open 
registration enabled, it is possible in WordPress versions 2.6.1 and earlier 
to craft a username such that it will allow resetting another user’s password 
to a randomly generated password.  The randomly generated password is not 
disclosed to the attacker, so this problem by itself is annoying but not a 
security exploit.  However, this attack coupled with a weakness in the random 
number seeding in mt_rand() could be used to predict the randomly generated 
password.  Stefan Esser will release details of the complete attack shortly.  
The attack is difficult to accomplish,  but its mere possibility means we 
recommend upgrading to 2.6.2.
