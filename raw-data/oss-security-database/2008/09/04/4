Subject: CVE request: kernel: nfsd: fix buffer overrun decoding NFSv4 acl

This was committed in upstream kernel recently.

"[PATCH] nfsd: fix buffer overrun decoding NFSv4 acl

The array we kmalloc() here is not large enough."

Upstream commit:
91b80969ba466ba4b915a4a1d03add8c297add3f

The array allocated in init_state() is not large enough. It is possible
to write past the end of the allocated memory. This requires NFSv4 to be
enabled.
