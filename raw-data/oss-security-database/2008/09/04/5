Subject: Re: OpenSSH key blacklisting

As a quick follow up to my comments a couple of months ago about SSH and how 
to better handle the requirement to revoke keys, it seems that some folk had 
similar thoughts.  Behold http://monkeysphere.info which promises to "extend 
OpenPGP's web of trust to new areas of the Internet to help us securely 
identify each other while we work online".  Looking forward to taking it for 
a spin.

Cheers,
Tim
