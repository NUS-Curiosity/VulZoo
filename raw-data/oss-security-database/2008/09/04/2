Subject: CVE request: kernel: sunrpc: fix possible overrun on read of /proc/sys/sunrpc/transports

Interesting bug.

This was committed in upstream kernel recently to address a regression
introduced in commit dc9a16e49dbba3dd042e6aec5d9a7929e099a89b.

Summary:
proc_do_xprt() does not check for user-side buffer size. The stack can
be overwritten by reading /proc/sys/sunrpc/transports even when the
length given to read() is a small value, i.e. < 38 bytes.

Upstream commit:
27df6f25ff218072e0e879a96beeb398a79cdbc8

It probably needs a CVE name. Agree?

Thanks, Eugene
