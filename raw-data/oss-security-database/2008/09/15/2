Subject: phpMyAdmin code execution (CVE request)

Hi all,

"- (2.11.9.1)  [security] Code execution vulnerability"

http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php?relnotes=1

"Welcome to this security update for phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.
Details will follow on http://phpmyadmin.net."

http://www.nabble.com/phpMyAdmin-2.11.9.1-is-released-td19497113.html

Attached patch is the fix from upstream. Judging from that (no other 
information is available yet), an authenticated user can supply a crafted 
sort_by parameter to server_databases.php, which will be turned in to 
executed PHP code because it is passed into create_function(). It is present 
at least since 2.9.1.

I would like to have a CVE id to refer to this issue.

Thijs
