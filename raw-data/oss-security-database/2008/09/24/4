CVEs to be filled in later.

CVE-2008-4195 Sites can change framed content on other sites
CVE-2008-4196 cross-site scripting
CVE-2008-4197 Custom shortcuts
CVE-2008-4198 insecure pages show incorrect security information
CVE-2008-4199 Feed links can link to local files
CVE-2008-4200 feed subscription can cause the wrong page address to be displayed

Can anyone parse this statement: "Fixed a problem with the CRL
override for certificates that do not have a CRL specified: Override
was not checked."  Is this a security issue, or just a bug in a
security mechanism?
