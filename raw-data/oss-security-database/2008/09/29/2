There have been two CVEs assigned, one for proftpd and one for 
netkit-ftpd:

CVE-2008-4242 (http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4242):
  ProFTPD 1.3.1 interprets long commands from an FTP client as multiple
  commands, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attacks and execute arbitrary FTP commands via a long
  ftp:// URI that leverages an existing session from the FTP client
  implementation in a web browser.

CVE-2008-4247 (http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4247):
  ftpd in OpenBSD 4.3, FreeBSD 7.0, and NetBSD 4.0 interprets long
  commands from an FTP client as multiple commands, which allows remote
  attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and
  execute arbitrary FTP commands via a long ftp:// URI that leverages
  an existing session from the FTP client implementation in a web
  browser.
