I share your opinion here, I'd rather see the COMMANDS thing 
as an application bug as a user who doesn't read the 
configuration but just uses it could also get owned with a 
valid command. The only difference I see is that as far as I 
understood the command is only executed after user action 
while the configuration value is read without. The manpage 
utf-8 conversion is the real vulnerability as it is possible 
to exploit a victim by opening a crafted manpage in 
gmanedit.

Cheers
Nico
