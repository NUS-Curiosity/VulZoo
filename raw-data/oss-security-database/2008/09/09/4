Subject: CVE request: MySQL empty bit-string literal server crash

Hi,

we consider the following bug a security issue. I'm not sure whether 
MySQL upstream feels so as well. Quoting the ChangeLog:

  An empty bit-string literal (b'') caused a server crash. Now the value  
  is parsed as an empty bit value (which is treated as an empty string
  in string context or 0 in numeric context). (Bug#35658)
