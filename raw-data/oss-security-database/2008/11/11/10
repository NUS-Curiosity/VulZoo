I'm sorry, I did not mean to sound critical of you or anybody on the
oss-security mailing list.  Many consumers probably don't care if bug 1
affects a slightly different set of versions than bug 2.  It just happens
to be something that's important for CVE, and (indirectly) people who rely
on it.

I was using the vlc case as an example of a general challenge that we're
facing in CVE that's arisen as a result of the creation of the
oss-security list, which I fully support.  We certainly don't want to
interfere with the way that open source developers handle security issues.
