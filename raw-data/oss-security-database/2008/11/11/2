Subject: CVE request: kernel: libertas: fix buffer overrun

Hi,

We need a CVE name for this issue. This was committed in upstream
kernel recently.

"If somebody sends an invalid beacon/probe response, that can trash
the whole BSS descriptor. The descriptor is, luckily, large enough so
that it cannot scribble past the end of it; it's well above 400 bytes
long.

Upstream commit: 48735d8d8bd701b1e0cd3d49c21e5e385ddcb077
