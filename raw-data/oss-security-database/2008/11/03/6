Subject: CVE Request (libsamplerate)

>From libsamplerate's changelog [1] (2008-07-02):

    * src/src_sinc.c
    Fix buffer overrrun bug at extreme low conversion ratios. Thanks to Russell
    O'Connor for the report.

I couldn't find any CVE number or request for it. If it's so, can you assign a CVE for it?
