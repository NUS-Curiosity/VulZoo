Eygene - Thanks for the post! Btw. this CHANGES-1.3.txt files also
mentions another security flaw, i.e incomplete fix for CVE-2008-1722:

<cite>

- SECURITY: The PNG image reading code did not validate the
	  image size properly, leading to a potential buffer overflow
	  (STR #2974)

</cite>

The relevant upstream cups BTS post together with patch attached is
here:

Advisory: http://www.cups.org/str.php?L2974
Patch: http://www.cups.org/strfiles/2974/str2974.patch

This issue seems to be introduced by the fix for CVE-2008-1722, i.e:
Advisory: http://www.cups.org/str.php?L2790
Patch: http://www.cups.org/strfiles/2790/str2790.patch

Steve, could you please allocate a new CVE identifier for this one?

Thanks, Jan.
