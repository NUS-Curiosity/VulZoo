No, that sounds fine to me, but I don't think it was there when I
initially replied (or at least, not when I had looked at it last prior
to that reply).

For Mandriva, I can say yes.  We currently send to bugtraq, FD, our own
announcements list (which includes the bugfix advisories, and would
likely remain the only source of bugfix/enhancement advisory
notification), and I believe to CERT.  We would drop the sending to
bugtraq and FD if such a list existed.

I don't think there is currently anything with the same goals/content as
what we'll be seeing on oss-security.

With my Annvix vendor hat on, I'd say no, but it's largely due to the
small userbase and my not wanting to expend needless energy on writing
advisories (for the Annvix userbase, the changelogs are sufficient).
