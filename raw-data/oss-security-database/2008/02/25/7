So this raises a point I was wondering about the other day.  I think it
could be useful to have a namespace called terms, or definitions, or
something similar, where we could provide some definitions of the various
security related terminology (things like buffer overflow, and double free
mean very little to most people).

The problem I see though, is keeping track of all these terms.  Is there a
way I could create a page called "terms:buffer_overflow", that would then
be magically added to an index at "terms"?

Thanks.
