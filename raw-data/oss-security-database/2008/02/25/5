For Red Hat products since we stopped supporting Red Hat Linux 9 we don't 
send to public mailing lists; customers using our products would be signed 
up to Red Hat Network which gives them customised alerts based on what 
they've got installed, and other interested folks who are not customers 
can subscribe to our announcement mailing list.

LWN already capture advisories from all vendors and try to collate it 
(with moderate degrees of sucess): http://lwn.net/Alerts/   so I'm not 
convinced of the value of another list.

Thanks, Mark
