FYI, I'm not on oss-security or vendor-sec.  I don't necessarily see a
need to be subscribed to them either, although it would be convenient.

I'd think that if it's a technically-public issue that probably hasn't
made it into the "mainstream" yet, then some CNA who gets our "CVENEW"
notifications could possibly assign ID's.  I'm thinking things like
updates to upstream packages that aren't in a lot of distros, or a bug ID
that isn't marked clearly as having security implications.  However, we
would also need to be notified if a CVE was assigned, to further reduce
the risk of duplication.
