Ouch, sorry, I know it but somehow my fingers recalled the former name :).

One thing you might want to see is a spell-checker (this would require
aspell libraries on the server).  Nowadays, many browsers provide their
own spell-checking functionality for text fields.  This is why I didn't
bother to install aspell initially, but we might want to provide our
authors with a spell-checker regardless of their browser (there is one
requirement though: to be able to use the online spell-checker their
browsers should support AJAX).

All in all, we can always install it later :), and extending wiki's
feature list could be a never ending process :)).
