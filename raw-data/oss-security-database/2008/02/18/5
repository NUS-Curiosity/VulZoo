Hmmm... so where's the Openwall vendor info, eh?  <wink wink>  =)

Well, there's maybe a dozen in there and Lord knows the Mandriva
security contact gets more spam than I care to admit.  Those addresses
are pretty public to begin with, so we should either figure out how to
obfuscate the old revisions or do it manually.  I think the dozen or so
addresses that would show up in the old revisions shouldn't be a big
deal (provided we figure/implement something now before it really starts
to get populated).

Oh good, thanks.

These sound like good ideas to me.  Particularly the bit on vendor-sec.
I think for this to become effective, we need to expose it more and at
the same time we can expose vendor-sec a little bit more too.

You'll always have a smaller subset of people on IRC than on the list
(i.e. right now it's just Josh and I).  I don't think it will replace
the list, but supplement it.  I know for Mandriva, it's good to discuss
things on IRC but more often than not a summary of sorts is sent to the
pertinent ml to let the others (who aren't on IRC, or aren't there at a
particular time, etc.) know what's going on, or wha has been discussed,
etc.

I think a medium like IRC is invaluable for "rapid-response" or
brainstorming.  There's nothing to stop a summation of discussion from
going back to the list for further discussion, but it's really useful
for discussing things to get a quick(er) resolution in some cases.  Or
even just bouncing ideas around.
