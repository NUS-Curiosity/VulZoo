I just created the namespace "disclosure" and added an outline I have to
them.  I also added a note that the things in "whattodo" should be merged
into the namespace.

For the moment it's just my outlines, I've not gotten around to filling it
out yet.  I did this, as I think it's important we have some amount of
organized information up, as this:

Was just picked up by linuxsecurity.com

We will only get one look from a lot of people, and if they don't see
anything of value, they will likely never look again.
