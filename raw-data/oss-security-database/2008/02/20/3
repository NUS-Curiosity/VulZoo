Subject: message Subjects (was: subscription-request procedure?)

Kees, Galaxy, everyone else -

Can you please try to ensure that message Subjects on your postings
reflect their content?  When a thread's topic deviates, don't break the
thread (that is, continue to "reply" to messages, which results in the
proper In-Reply-To and References headers), but change the Subject.  The
old one may be preserved in parentheses, like I did now - to be dropped
in subsequent replies.

On the other hand, when posting something on an entirely new topic,
please do so by sending your message to the list address - do not use
the "reply" function on an unrelated message.

Thanks to both of you!

Of course, the Subjects don't matter as much as the fact that we're
making good progress on setting up a useful community resource.
