Hmmm... I'm not sure I'm completely following you here.

I like the patch idea, however.  A "vendor patch" database of sorts
would be nice (would save me from hunting from, say, ubuntu packages for
a patch for something they already fixed, or looking at ubuntu for one,
and SUSE for another because of version differences).

That doesn't really concentrate on *auditing* however, but I could see
how the two could work well together under one common implementation.
