Subject: CVE request: vlc

Hi Steve,
can I get a CVE id for vlc because of the following issue?

The mp4 demuxer of vlc is missing validation of array 
boundaries and thus allows overwriting arbitrary memory.

For more details see:

Patch:
http://www.videolan.org/patches/vlc-0.8.6-CORE-2008-0130.patch

Cheers
Nico
