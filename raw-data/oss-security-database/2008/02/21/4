We give the full path in our emailed advisories (except for the cases 
where we are shipping something not open source like java/acroread) but 
the paths are not in the web based versions.  So 
http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhsa-announce/ since Nov 2007, or for older 
stuff http://www.redhat.com/archives/enterprise-watch-list/

Once you get a rpm then unpacking it without installing it is easy:
rpm2cpio fn.rpm | cpio --make-directories --extract

And we nearly always ship the pristine upstream tarball along with each 
patch separately (exception being things like OpenSSL).

This is definately material for a 'how to find out how the vendor fixed 
this' page.

Thanks, Mark
