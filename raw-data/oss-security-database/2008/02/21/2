hahah... as Mark can attest, you're not the only one.  I've had to email
him a few times looking for some obscure src.rpm.

Usually I look at vendor advisories and grab from there; Debian and
Ubuntu are the best for that although I sometimes find working with your
massive diff's a bit of a pain, but that's neither here nor there.
FWIW, yours are probably the easiest to find.

The other RPM-based distros are usually pretty easy to find.  Mandriva
also has a public svn where all our updates are committed, so standalone
patches can be found there too.

http://svn.mandriva.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/packages/updates_releases/

Although that may change to just /updates/ in the future.  You'll find
everything for our currently supported products in there.

I think having a "patch page" on the wiki with this info might be useful
too... others may have repositories or other means of getting patches
without resorting to downloading diff's and src.rpm's.

And I'd *love* to see what the Gentoo folks will link to.. =)  They have
to be the biggest head-scratcher for me.
