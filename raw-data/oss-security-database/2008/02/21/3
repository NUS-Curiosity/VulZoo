It's true that we currently don't have a centralized place for patches,
maybe we should work something out. For now, I'd say that the best option
is to use:

http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/<category>/<pkg>/
Then all patches should be in the "files" directory.

e.g. you want the last patch for an integer overflow in tcpdump, you'll
find it in:
http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/net-analyzer/tcpdump/files/

But FYI, we generally use the patches from Debian :)
