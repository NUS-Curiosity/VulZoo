We don't yet have such a CVS (or similar) repository - and it is not
obvious whether one is needed - but maybe you (and others) could start
by using a namespace on the wiki for this?  The wiki includes support
for file uploads - it's the "Add Images and other files" icon (picture
in a frame) on top of the page edit area.  We have not yet tested this
functionality, though (might need to add a chmod as we're running the
wiki scripts under a dedicated UID and with umask 077).

Obviously, you shouldn't upload entire source trees (tarballs?) in this
way, but remarks, patches, and testcases may be uploaded.  Actually,
the remarks are better edited on the wiki, which provides a structure
(namespaces) and revision control.

That way, we'll see if anyone actually contributes their audit results
in this way.  Then, if there's specific demand for a CVS repository or
whatever, that can be added as well.

Thanks,

Alexander
