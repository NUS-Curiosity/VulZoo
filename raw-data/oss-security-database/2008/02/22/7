Yes - the way I have enabled it now, subscribers can still post
unmoderated, as long as they post from their subscribed envelope-from
addresses.

Josh and Vincent are now list moderators (thank you!), along with me.
You will receive moderation requests whenever a message arrives to the
list address from a non-subscribed address (that is also not on the
"allow" list).  Please approve messages that are desirable for this
list, according to the charter and common sense.  In other cases, you
can either reject a message (if posted by a human being), optionally
with a comment (reject reason), or do nothing (there's no need to bother
rejecting spam - it will expire on its own - in fact, it is better to
not reject spam for a couple of reasons).

There's no need to see if a message has possibly been approved by
another moderator - duplicate approvals don't result in duplicate
postings.

Jonathan - thank you for offering to help as well.  I had already added
Josh and Vincent as moderators when your message arrived, and I thought
that three moderators (including me) should be enough.  However, if you
really want to be receiving some more spam - please let me know! ;-)

Thanks,

Alexander
