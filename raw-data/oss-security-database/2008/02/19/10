Yeah, I noticed this as well.  I think advisories should be kept off the
list, for the same "signal-to-noise ratio" principal as bugtraq and FD.

It may be a better idea, if desired, to make a separate list that is a
fully moderated (or possibly a reject-all with exceptions) list specific
to carrying vendor advisories.
