Just a note in case you think this should be fixed, but the
envelope "from" being generated by the wiki is undeliverable:
w_osssec@...-osssec.brazil.openwall.com

This is causing my end to trigger greylisting when getting email from
the wiki (i.e. registration email), and may cause other paranoid MTAs
to get annoyed too.  :)
