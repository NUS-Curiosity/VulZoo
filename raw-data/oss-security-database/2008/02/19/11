Fair enough, makes sense.

Ahhh... ok, gotchya.  It's not bad, you just need to hunt around a lot
to get anything useful out of it.

Ok.  So leave things open for the time being so we don't hassle the
folks that should be here from the get-go, then clamp down on things

I think when we "open the doors" more, we should disallow wiki editing
for new users and moderate who gets to edit, etc.
