I've just applied many minor edits to this page, as well as two
important changes:

1. Added the text "... and promptly notify your users of the
availability and importance of this new release."  This will need to be
made more verbose later on - perhaps it deserves its own paragraph (what
communication channels may or should exist, etc.)

2. Replaced the suggestion to "... publish it during the embargo with
no mention of any security-related impact" with a paragraph that allows
such an action if it is absolutely necessary, but discourages it.

Well, that does not apply to me, so I've only fixed the mailing lists
link to be an internal one so far.

We could also want to rename this web page to something containing the
likely search keywords - and possibly move it to a namespace, which
would give a keyword too, once we have a suitable one.  "whattodo" is
not a likely keyword (or not a closely relevant one).
