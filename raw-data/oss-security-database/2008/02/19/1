I am not sure if a cvs or something like a -AUDITED

which older versions were reviewed too if new versions are commited.
Maybe a wiki with patch subdir and link to the reviewed
CVS version/branch will suffice. Need to play around :)
On the other hand if such a project grows you can have a complete distro
you can check out and you always see which parts of a distro or larger project
are reviewed such as apache w/o certain modules. problem is that
such partial reviews may stop to compile upon checkout.
