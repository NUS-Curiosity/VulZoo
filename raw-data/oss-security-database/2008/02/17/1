Hi,

Dmitry D. Khlebnikov aka (GalaxyMaster) <galaxy at openwall.com> has
setup a wiki for this project at:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/

I think that you should be able to register for accounts at:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/welcome?do=register

and start working on the content.

If there are any issues or questions on the wiki, please post in here -
Dmitry is subscribed, so I expect that he will provide the necessary
support for this service.
