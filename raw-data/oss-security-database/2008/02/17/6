I like the reply-to-list.  I usually forget to do a reply-to-all and end
up losing the list.  Bad habits on my part, and I don't think I'm alone
(either that or I'm a complete idiot).

I don't see the point of a read-only list when we have public archives.
It seems overly complex to me to do a read-only list subscribed to the
other list *and* have public archives.

I also think subscriptions should be moderated, and postings from
non-members should be moderated as well.  I think the last thing anyone
wants is to see spam on the list, or someone going on an off-topic
tirade or some other idiocy (if we wanted that, we'd all be chatting on
fd).
