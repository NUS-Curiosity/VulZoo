Josh and all,

I am sorry for not commenting on this earlier.

It looks good, and I fully agree with the update to the third paragraph
based on Steve's feedback.

This sounds great.  I think that we'll need to announce on mailing lists
as well, though.

Perhaps there should be a comma or a dash before "an ongoing ..."

I think that it'd be nice to make the company/project names into
hyperlinks in an HTML (or similar) version of the announcement, if one
is to be created - however, introducing those URLs into a text version,
where the URLs would occupy visible space and distract from the actual
announcement text, is probably undesirable.

Similarly, it'd be nice to make "Open Source Software Security community
(oss-security)" a hyperlink.

This could have hyperlinks, too - "wiki", "mailing list".

We could want to include this URL near the beginning of the announcement
text as well - in the hyperlink I suggested or otherwise.

Also, maybe we should put this announcement text somewhere on our own
wiki, where others who might want to refer to oss-security later (e.g.,
announce it to their local community) could pick it up?  BTW, we'll be
able to have all of the hyperlinks in that version.

Thanks,

Alexander
