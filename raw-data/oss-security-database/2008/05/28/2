Subject: Re: OpenSSH key blacklisting

All,

Maybe I've missed something, in which case, shoot me down, but why unlike 
other services that make use of public key cryptography, does OpenSSH not 
have use a model which supports proper authorisation and revocation 
mechanisms?  Would this not be an ideal opportunity to implement this?  
Whilst I think there was a reasonable case for such features prior to the 
Debian OpenSSL vulnerability being identified, I would argue that this issue 
highlights the case.  Comercial SSH already has such functionality - can 
anyone offer a view on how [well] it works?
