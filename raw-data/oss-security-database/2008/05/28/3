Subject: Re: OpenSSH key blacklisting

Hi,

Last time I looked at the drafts (now RFC) there was no
spec for revoking user-keys. However it allows x509
certificates for hostkeys.
Its all about the RFCs. OpenSSH folks shouldnt implement
proprietary stuff :)
At the end of the day SSH is not really a PKI system. The focus
has been on different issues.
