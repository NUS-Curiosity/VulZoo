Yes -- in the tests I did, RSA1 and RSA keys shared the same modulus,
so RSA1 is covered by the same blacklists.  RSA1024 is in the
openssh-blacklist-extra binary package in debian.

As for other corner-cases, DSA2048 weren't generate-able[1] with a broken
version of ssh-keygen, so I've been considering publishing an _empty_
DSA2048 blacklist, just so that ssh-vulnkey will report DSA2048 as "safe"
instead of "unknown".

[1] dsa was forced to be 1024 for a while now:
$ ssh-keygen -f /tmp/foo -t dsa -b 2048
DSA keys must be 1024 bits
