Actually, v2.2.4 did fix the security issue.

However, the code to detect and print a debug message about the attack
was buggy and was triggered for normal connections under some conditions
(conditions which, alas, the self-tests did not exercise).

Still, the 2.2.5 announcement is what you want to read to get the full
picture.  Note that gmane garbles OpenPGP signed cleartext patches.  Try
