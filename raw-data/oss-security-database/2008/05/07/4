Subject: Re: CVE request: Bugzilla (Unauthorized Bug Change, XSS, Account
 Impersonation)


Note - CVE-2008-2105 assumes "before 3.0" because of the target fix for
the bug report; Bugzilla's advisory saying "2.23.4 and later" is kind of
hard to parse, especially since I don't think they mean this will be a bug
in all future versions as well :)

users without canconfirm privileges to create NEW or ASSIGNED bug
entries via a request to the XML-RPC interface, which bypasses the
canconfirm check.

email_in.pl in Bugzilla 2.23.4, and later versions before 3.0, allows
remote authenticated users to more easily spoof the changer of a bug
via a @reporter command in the body of an e-mail message, which
overrides the e-mail address as normally obtained from the From e-mail
header.  NOTE: since From headers are easily spoofed, this only crosses
privilege boundaries in environments that provide additional
verification of e-mail addresses.
