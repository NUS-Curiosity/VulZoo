Not that I know of. I just imagined somewhere could have a policy like "all
keys must have X bits" or ".. X or larger" X being a non-default size. So
even if the database would be customized to have the extra keys,
auto-upgrading it (which would be desirable) could be a problem. Not a big
deal to me, personally.
