I agree that this might be desirable functionality, but unfortunately it
has a price - we'd have to maintain two file parsers and lookup
algorithms (perhaps binary and indexed, and text and sequential) or an
additional program to update the binary file.  (If we only create the
binary file ourselves, then that program can be a quick hack - maybe
even a Perl script.)

Has there been any demand for such blacklists, prior to the Debian issue
coming up?  If not, then this additional feature is probably not worth
implementing right away.
