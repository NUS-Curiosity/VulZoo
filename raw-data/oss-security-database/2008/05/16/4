We (Mandriva) have kinda sat back to see what other vendors are going to
do.  A few people have asked us to incorporate the Ubuntu patch, but the
stance I've taken so far is that if upstream openssh is going to do it,
then we will too.  Otherwise I don't think we will, unless a number of
other vendors are going to do so.

We did send an announcement with more info to our security-announce
mailing list to give our users a head's up, but didn't think we needed
to push this on our users since very few will likely be affected.
