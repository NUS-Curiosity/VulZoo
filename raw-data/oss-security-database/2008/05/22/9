I can't speak for them.  Why does one run a root server?  I don't know.

A period of six months is relatively short, compared to previous
transitions and software release cycles.

No, this is not the case.  They didn't even control fully the old L root
prefix, which partly motivated the migration.

They don't own the IP addresses.  AFAIK, only one root operator has
entered into an agreement with ICANN.  DNS root operations are totally
self-regulated, and as we can see, this works (sort of).
