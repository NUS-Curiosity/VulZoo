Oh. I didn't understand that from the articles I've read.

So, why are they running a DNS server on that IP?

I think the transition period began in late 2007, but this is the first
I've (and, I think, many others) heard about it.

I was under the impression that ICANN "owned" or at least "was in charge
of" the allocation of IPs for the root name servers. So why couldn't
they just bar (via policy, not via technical means) whoever owns the
rest of the prefix that IP is in from using it?

Anyway, if the IP is in the hands of a trusted party, I'm much less
concerned. That just wasn't the impression I had.
