Subject: CVE id request: vlc local privilege escalation

Hi,
can I get a CVE id for vlc?
https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/1578:

"At startup, VLC recursively scans the modules/ and plugins/ subdirectories
from the current working directory, and tries to execute the vlc_entry__0_8_6
(or another in other VLC versions) symbol from any file matching the
"lib*_plugin.so" pattern."

Patch: http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commit;h=c7cef4fdd8dd72ce0a45be3cda8ba98df5e83181

Kind regards
Nico
