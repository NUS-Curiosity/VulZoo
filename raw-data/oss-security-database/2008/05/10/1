Subject: CVE request: Linux vfs: fix permission checking in sys_utimensat

This patch has been released in Linux 2.6.25.3:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.25.y.git;a=commit;h=f9dfda1ad0637a89a64d001cf81478bd8d9b6306
> If utimensat() is called with both times set to UTIME_NOW or one of them 
> to UTIME_NOW and the other to UTIME_OMIT, then it will update the file 
> time without any permission checking.
>
> I don't think this can be used for anything other than a local DoS, but
> could be quite bewildering at that (e.g.  "Why was that large source tree
> rebuilt when I didn't modify anything???")
