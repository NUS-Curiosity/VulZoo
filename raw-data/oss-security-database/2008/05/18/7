Ah, I haven't been separating it by arch, but I can certainly do that.
I've been including the "full" hashes in the Debian openssh-blacklist
source package and reducing them for the final files.  I can easily
split up the source blacklist files by arch and combine them during the
"build".

I will probably also keep the file in PID order, and sort it during the
build.  I've been interested in the pid origin just to see where in the
pid list keys tend to land.
