Subject: CVE id request: xscreensaver

Hi

Pierre Habouzit discovered that resizing with the xrandr tool can crash 
xscreensaver.

Debian Bug report:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482385

The tested version of xscreensaver is 5.05-1, but at the moment there is no 
reason to assume that the bug did not exist in previous versions.

Could I please have a CVE id for this issue?

Cheers
Steffen
