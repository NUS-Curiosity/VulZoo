Subject: versions affected by CVE-2008-1675 - update

Hi,
the description of CVE-2008-1675 states that the linux 
kernel versions before 2.6.25 are vulnerable. This is wrong, 
this should be kernel versions before 2.6.25.1.

See: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.25.1.bz2

Cheers
Nico
