Hi,

 one of our users reported a buffer overflow in Wordnet:

https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211491

After further research it appears that there might be a lot more.
I tried to contact upstream (in CC) but didn't get any response
so far. It seems at least Debian is packaging it too, and probably
others distros. Don't know how to proceed from here, but in any case
we don't have enough manpower to do upstream's job and perform a code
audit / write a patch.
