Subject: CVE for SE-2008-06 in PHP 5.2.7 (ZipArchive)

http://www.sektioneins.de/advisories/SE-2008-06.txt

PHP 5.2.7 addresses several CVEs that are listed in the NEWS file.  
Apparently, it also addresses the above bug, but no CVE has been  
assigned:

- Fixed extraction of zip files or directories when the entry name is a
   relative path. (Pierre)

The advisory from Stefan also does not contain a CVE.

Steve, please assign

/ Regards, David
