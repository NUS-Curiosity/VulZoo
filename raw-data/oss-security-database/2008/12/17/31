Thanks for the reference.

Not quite, the s///e operator uses a compile-time transformation for
the replacement expression, so it shouldn't be affected by this very
issue.

\Q \E pairs are an issue in the pattern, not the replacement.
Mistakes in this area increase the attack surface by exposing the
regular expression compiler to potentially hostile input, and it may
lead to denial-of-service vulnerabilities because some implementations
do not cope well with certain patterns.  Perhaps CWE-624 should be
split to reflect this?
