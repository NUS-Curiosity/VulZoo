IMHO the docs are lacking a very important bit of information.

Of course, no different fix was planned (on roundcube).
We were actually looking for something in PHP itself that could be treated as
the origin of all those security issues. We have been thinking about disabling
support for the e modifier, but that requires collaboration with upstreams (PHP
and script writers) and looking for incompatibilities in existing software.
Maybe it could be dropped from PHP6, now that register_globals, safe_mode,
magic_quotes_gpc, and friends are being dropped as well.
