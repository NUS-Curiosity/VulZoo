Ah, right. Yes, that's true. however, it's not a vulnerability as it's
doing read-only access, and it can't cause DoS as it's only the CGI
that's affected.

Yes, that's true. Most people didn't notice due to the fact that Nagios
reads the command-pipe input when it finds anything there instead of
waiting for a newline to appear in it. It was reported that user-commands
that cause more than one command to be written to the pipe were broken,
so it's not a huge issue.

In short; I see no vulnerability here, and thus no need for a CVE.
