Subject: CVE request: vinagre

vinagre upstream released new upstream versions 0.5.2 and 2.24.2 fixing format
string issue in vinagre_utils_show_error() in src/vinagre-utils.c.

Upstream commits:
Gnome 2.22 branch (0.5.x):
  http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/vinagre?view=revision&revision=528
Gnome 2.24 branch (2.24.x):
  http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/vinagre?view=revision&revision=525

I did not have an opportunity what attack vectors exist for this flaw.
Upstream seems to treat is as a security flaw, so probably deserves CVE
name.

Thank you!
