Subject: CVE request: kernel: soft lockup occurs when network load is very
 high

Steve, can you please assign a CVE name for the following issue:

"[NET]: Add preemption point in qdisc_run

The qdisc_run loop is currently unbounded and runs entirely in a
softirq.  This is bad as it may create an unbounded softirq run.

This patch fixes this by calling need_resched and breaking out if
necessary.

It also adds a break out if the jiffies value changes since that would
indicate we've been transmitting for too long which starves other
softirqs."

Problem is fixed upstream since 2ba2506ca7ca62c56edaa334b0fe61eb5eab6ab0

This can be triggered by an unprivileged user.

Thanks, Eugene
