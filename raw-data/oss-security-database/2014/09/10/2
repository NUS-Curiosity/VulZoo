Subject: CVE Request: MySQL: MyISAM temporary file issue

Hi

The changes for MySQL 5.5.39[1] and 5.6.20[2] contain a reference to
the following issue, which could be exploited by a local user to run
arbitrary code in context of the mysqld server.

MyISAM temporary files could be used to mount a code-execution attack.
(Bug #18045646).

This is also tracked in[3] and [4] mentioning as relevant fix [5].

Was a CVE already requested for this issue? If not, could one be
assigned?

Regards,
Salvatore
