C.O. to the rescue: temporary file.

If one shell instance needs to pass some functions to another, it
could dump those functions to a temporary file and pass the --load
(or, better, --load-functions) options with a filename parameter.

The functions file name may also be passed through environment, but
that could open another set of security holes (like reading files).
