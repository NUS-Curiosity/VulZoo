In general, I suspect that the "is it necessary" part is somewhat
moot. Very few things in bash are "necessary". But it's been there for
a long time and it's clear that a small fraction of users have come to
depend on the behavior.

If we need to break that existing code to eliminate the risk, so be
it; the feature is fairly obscure, so the damage will be limited.

But if the prefix approach works fine, and nobody can come up with any
compelling security-relevant reasons why it's a bad outcome... then
what's the point of breaking existing scripts?

I mean, all the arguments against the prefix approach boil down to
"but if the attacker can set arbitrarily named variables to arbitrary
values, then..." - and if that's something you allow across a security
boundary, you're almost certainly in trouble no matter what.
