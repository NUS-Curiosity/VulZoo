Regarding php, isn't it quite common to run it through mod_fcgid with a
(bash) wrapper script? At least that's what apache wiki documents:
https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/php-fcgid

So that'd mean many php installations are affected even if they don't
use subprocesses.

I'm not sure if this wrapper can be avoided.
