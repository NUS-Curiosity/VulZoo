Hello Chet et al.

While taking a closer look at this issue on Bash 4.2, I noticed a
potential NULL deref. i.e.

  $ FOO='() { :;}; blah4242' bash -c "echo bleh"

This occurs in bgp_prune() where, because bgpids.npid=0 and
js_c_childmax=-1, the code in the loop executes but bgpids.list=NULL.

I didn't look closely enough to know if this situation is only reachable
via the recently-fixed vulnerable code-path or not.
