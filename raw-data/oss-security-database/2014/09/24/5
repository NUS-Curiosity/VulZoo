            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-7156 / XSA-106
                              version 3

    Missing privilege level checks in x86 emulation of software interrupts

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

This issue has been assigned CVE-2014-7156.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The emulation of instructions which generate software interrupts fails
to perform supervisor mode permission checks.

However these instructions are not usually handled by the emulator.
Exceptions to this are
- - when a memory operand (implicit for the affected instructions) lives
  in (emulated or passed through) memory mapped IO space,
- - in the case of guests running in 32-bit PAE mode, when such an
  instruction is (in execution flow) within four instructions of one
  doing a page table update,
- - when an Invalid Opcode exception gets raised by a guest instruction,
  and the guest then (likely maliciously) alters the instruction to
  become one of the affected ones,
- - when the guest is in real mode (in which case there are no privilege
  checks anyway).

IMPACT
======

Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the guest.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions from 3.3 onwards are vulnerable.

Only user processes in HVM guests can take advantage of this
vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.

There is no mitigation available for HVM guests.
