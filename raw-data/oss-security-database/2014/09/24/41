Subject: Re: nss RSA forgery (CVE-2014-1568)

The commits are available in the mercurial repo:

https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/fb7208e91ae8
https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/ad411fb64046
https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/4e90910ad2f9

Offhand, it looks like an issue with the encoding of DigestInfo.
