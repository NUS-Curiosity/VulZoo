Subject: headintheclouds tmp vulns - also request for referees decision on
 tmp vulns in deployment tools

So in theory this is software is used for docker provisioning thing, so
there shouldn't be any users on the docker image while it's being
deployed (or indeed any software pretty much at all), so part of me
wants to say this shouldn't qualify for a CVE if used normally, however
it is a pretty blatant tmp vuln. So for the sake of starting a
conversation about tmp vulns on systems that shouldn't have any users or
ways to exploit the tmp vuln I'm posting this one. Basically if a tree
falls in the forest but no beavers were present does anyone care that a
lumber jack might get squashed?

        run('source %s' % remote_script)
