Many times these tools are executed in normal shell environments with lots of
users and not in safe/clean server (even robotfw). In my opinion these issues
should be fixed in code and get CVE assigned even the risk is minimal. 

Code audits for PyPi packages are more than welcome thought some level of
coordination is required to avoid confusion. These are often easy to report and
fix, but I understand if reporter has lack of time. Kurt if you need
coordination help you can contact me off-list.
