Subject: CVE-Request: squid snmp off-by-one

Hi

There is an off-by-one in squid when receiving UDP SNMP
requests. The overwrite happens before any ACL/community checks.
There just needs an SNMP port to be configured.

The off-by-one happens on the heap, as buf is declared static.
So depending on your compiler organizing the .bss this might
be better or worse than being placed on the stack. :)

More info and a patch is here:
