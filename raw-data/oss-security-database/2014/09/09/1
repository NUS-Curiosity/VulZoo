Subject: Confusion around gksu & CVE-2014-2943

Several sites identify CVE-2014-2943 as being a vulnerability in gksu:

https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2014/07/07/virtualbox-filename-command-execution-via-gksu
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/68427

But the Mitre & NVD databases use that CVE id for a different issue:

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2943
https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2943

Anyone know what the right CVE is for the gksu bug?
