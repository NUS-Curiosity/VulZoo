The MITRE CVE team obviously has no objection to your use of the
oss-security list for raising new discussion topics such as the
likelihood that a '../tmp/ substring represents a security problem.
The comments below are only about obtaining CVE assignments from
MITRE.

A CVE isn't going to be possible without further analysis explaining
why a vulnerability exists in the specific case. There can't be an
expectation that someone at MITRE is already familiar with the
product, or will read and understand the complete source code as part
of processing an oss-security message.

Items that seem to be missing from the original message include:

1, Is the "merge('../tmp/passing.xml', '../tmp/failing.xml')"
   debugging code, or is this code realistically used because a
   different piece of software has created passing.xml and failing.xml
   files?

2. If there is a realistic situation in which the
   "merge('../tmp/passing.xml', '../tmp/failing.xml')" executes, would
   the cwd realistically be a first-level directory such as the /root
   or /tmp directory?

3. For purposes of risk analysis, is unconstrained use of a ../tmp/
   pathname always equivalent to unconstrained use of a /tmp/ pathname?

A possible CVE assignment decision might be:

A. If a different product came with a test suite containing:

   test_program > /tmp/merged.xml

then it could have a CVE because /tmp/merged.xml might be a symlink to
an important file.

B. If the test suite were changed to:

   test_program > ../tmp/merged.xml

with no constraints, then it could still have a CVE, because some
people run test suites as root with a cwd of the /root directory.

C. If ../tmp/ is used in "debugging code" that is intended to be run
by a developer who understands the appropriate cwd, and this
"debugging code" is not a "test suite" for users, then there is no CVE
assignment. Admittedly, there might be cases where the distinction
between "debugging code" and "test suite" is completely ambiguous.
