 uninitialised FIFO-based event channel control blocks

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-6268 / XSA-107
                              version 2

    Mishandling of uninitialised FIFO-based event channel control blocks

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When using the FIFO-based event channels, there are no checks for the
existence of a control block when binding an event or moving it to a
different VCPU.  This is because events may be bound when the ABI is
in 2-level mode (e.g., by the toolstack before the domain is started).

The guest may trigger a Xen crash in evtchn_fifo_set_pending() if:

  a) the event is bound to a VCPU without a control block; or
  b) VCPU 0 does not have a control block.

In case (a), Xen will crash when looking up the current queue.  In
(b), Xen will crash when looking up the old queue (which defaults to a
queue on VCPU 0).

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious guest can crash the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.4 and onward are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

None.
