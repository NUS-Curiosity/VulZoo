Too many digits for bugs.mysql.com bug ids, those tends to have no more
than 5 digits.  As the error message you got suggests - it's likely an
id in some internal bug tracking system.  Don't expect it to be useful
for anything else than matching release notes entry to bzr commit.

Also note that security fixes are not mentioned in release notes for
some time - inclusion of this one is likely an omission rather than
intention.
