http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-extensions/typo3-ext-sa-2014-006/
http://osvdb.org/105758

Release Date: April 10, 2014
Affected Versions: powermail: Version 2.0.0 - 2.0.10
Vulnerability Type: Captcha Bypass
Severity: Low
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: The extension powermail offers the use of a captch
validation to secure forms. It was possible to bypass the captcha validation and
submit forms.
Important Note: Other field validators weren't involved so any other validation
worked as expected.
Solution: Updated version 2.0.11 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager
and at http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/powermail/2.0.11/t3x/.
Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible
as long as they use captchas in their forms.
Credits: Credits go to Jigal van Hemert who discovered and reported this issue.
