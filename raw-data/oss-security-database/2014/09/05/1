Yes, the email subject. "<problem> in <package>" seems reasonable,
but when <package> is also the name of the main program in <package>,
and the actual vuln is in a secondary program included with it, I
think it's confusing. I'm not sure what percentage of procmail users
also use formail along with it, but in general, there will be cases
where <package> is extremely widely used but the program with the
actual vulnerability of is obscure and mostly unused.
