Can I get 2014 CVE for TYPO3-EXT-SA-2014-005, thanks. If I am correct one CVEs

http://osvdb.org/103260

Release Date: February 12, 2014
Affected Versions: yag: Version 3.0.0 and below, pt_extbase: Version 1.5.0 and below
Vulnerability Type: Access Bypass
Severity: High
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C

Problem Description: The extension pt_extbase comes with an Ajax dispatcher for
Extbase. Using this dispatcher it is possible to call every action in every
controller of every Extbase extension installed on the system. The dispatcher
failes to do access checks, thus it is possible to bypass access checks for
Extbase Backend Modules like the backend user administration module. The
extension yag also delivered an Ajax dispatcher, which was unused but
vulnerable.

Important Note: The unused Ajax Dispatcher code in extension yag has been
removed. If any other installed extensions made use of this dispatcher, it will
stop working. Additionally the Ajax dispatcher in pt_extbase was modified to do
access checks. Third party extensions using this dispatcher need to be added to
the list of allowed actions.

Solution: Updated versions 3.0.1 and 1.5.1 are available from the TYPO3
extension manager and at
http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/yag/3.0.1/t3x/ and
http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/pt_extbase/1.5.1/t3x/. Users of
the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

Credits: Credits go to Andrea Schmuttermair who discovered and reported this
issue.
