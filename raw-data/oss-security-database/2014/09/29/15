I changed the subject because I'm sure this parenthetical comment got lost.

Fortunately, in bash 4.3 (patchlevel 25), you cannot just -DARRAY_EXPORT 
and get array variable import/export.  The code doesn't compile, and if 
you fix that, it does not link, and if you fix that, well, you end up 
with the following issue.  But I doubt anybody has done this, so it's 
not a vulnerability (yet) and does not need CVE assignment etc.

The array import/export feature allows one to export and import 
variables while preserving their array status.  Unfortunately, it 
enables this:

$ env -i 'FOO=([$(echo broken > /dev/tty)]=a)' ./bash -c true
broken
./bash: []=a: bad array subscript

As I said, it is currently not an issue, but it's probably best not to 
enable this in the future at all, or use it with another form of mangling.
