At the very least, at should use the "export foo=bar" form which
will allow it to fail closed in the presence of environment variables
that are not valid shell identifiers.  I've just committed such a
change to OpenBSD's at(1) which shares a common lineage.  However,
the atrun file format should really be changed to be more robust
and not simply be fed to /bin/sh.
