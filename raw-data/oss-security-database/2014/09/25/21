The first patch closes the immediate RCE loophole. Many people have
expressed concerns that the patch is dangerous because in many
real-world situations, it still permits bash to parse function
definitions originating from attackers, and the security of the scheme
hinges on the parser not having the usual range of low-level C
language bugs that normally plague such code; and, on top of that, the
parsing process having absolutely no side effects on the subsequently
executed scripts.

Both of these assumptions have been shown to be incorrect, although
not to directly execute code in the most likely scenarios that would
be vulnerable without the original patch; so, you're probably OK, but
relying on thing staying this way is fragile. There's an unofficial
patch from Florian that limits the exposure:

You have to use your own judgment to decide whether to stick to the
original patch, also use Florian's one in the interim, or do something
else.
