Correcing me: There are not lots of, but exactly 6.

Camerfirma_Global_Chambersign_Root.pem: 3 (0x3)
Digital_Signature_Trust_Co._Global_CA_1.pem: 3 (0x3)

Starfield_Class_2_CA.pem: 3 (0x3)


Some background: having very small exponents for RSA isn't a problem if
you do everything right, but it vastly increases the likelyhood of
issues like this popping up. It'd seem like a good safeguard to get rid
of all e=3 keys.
