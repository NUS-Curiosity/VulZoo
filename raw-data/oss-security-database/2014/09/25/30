I expected your code to be irrelevant, because the shell gets invoked
first (to invoke your code).  I tested this with "env -".

Huh?  I thought OpenSSH always invokes the command via the shell.

Oh, so you're saying that your sshd does not use the shell when you
specify no-pty?  This isn't the case here.  What version/package of
OpenSSH are you using?

I do have a habit to specify no-pty whenever I use "command=", but I
also have a habit to start the actual command with "exec ..."
specifically because the shell is invoked anyway (the "exec" then saves
some memory on not keeping that shell around while the actual program
runs).  I've tried specifying /full/path/to/program, like you do, but
this does not prevent invocation going via the shell here.  My OpenSSH
is rather old, though (with lots of patches).
