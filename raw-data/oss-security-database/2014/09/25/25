There's obviously a trade-off here.  I agree that keeping the error
messages is the right thing if we can keep them contained to local usage
(and local attack) scenarios under typical setups.  I think applying
Florian's prefix-suffix patch will achieve that (besides its main goal
of actually mitigating most attacks).

What do you think of distros' going with Florian's prefix-suffix patch
right now?  I think it breaks function imports/exports between
pre-patch and post-patch bash versions, but keeps them intact for
patched versions.  Right?  If so, this sounds acceptable for immediate
use by distros.  Do you agree?
