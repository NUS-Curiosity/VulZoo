Kurt,

That's actually an unsafe assumption, which has introduced a vulnerability into your logic.  There are counter-examples by two different CVE CNA team members in this thread alone.

For additional evidence that counters your assumption, here are a handful of recent oss-security posts by cve-assign between midnight (Eastern time) and 4 AM.  This list is far from complete.

When an issue has been made widely public to the security industry, CNAs are expected to attempt to coordinate more closely with MITRE before assigning a CVE ID themselves.  This helps to reduce confusion and duplicates.  Anything posted to oss-security is considered "widely public."
