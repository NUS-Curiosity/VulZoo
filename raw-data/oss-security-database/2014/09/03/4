It's been my experience working with Open Source projects that as others
have said, there are a lot of licenses that don't quite match an OSI
or FSF approved license but are very close and would reasonably warrant
the software being discussed here.  But the "or something close" is kind
of the current state of affairs which puts the onus on the moderators,
which isn't ideal.

I'd be inclined to suggest that the moderators use their own judgement
without worrying too much about list look-ups and feel free to err on
the side of letting through too much rather than too little and members
are free to ask a topic be taken off-list, citing either the above (or
SPDX or the FSF list, if they like, though honestly I think the FSF goes
a bit far in their definition of non-free, I think PERL is perfectly
fair game for this list) as the reason why it isn't relevant.

Or, of course, as below.  Because you're perfectly correct, lots of
closed-source vendors either don't care or don't want their errors
discussed openly.  Either has no place here, Full Disclosure is a
perfectly fine venue for that.

Just my thoughts.
