Subject: CVE request: V8 Memory Corruption and Stack Overflow

Hi!

The following node.js blog post points out a flaw in V8, which is
bundled with node.js:

http://blog.nodejs.org/2014/07/31/v8-memory-corruption-stack-overflow/

It does not seem this got CVE assigned by Google, or in response to the
node.js update.
