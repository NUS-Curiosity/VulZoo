In certain circumstances, a particularly deep recursive workload that may trigger a GC and receive an interrupt may overflow the stack and result in a segmentation fault. For instance, if your work load involves successive JSON.parse calls and the parsed objects are significantly deep, you may experience the process aborting while parsing.

"CVE request: V8 Memory Corruption and Stack Overflow"

They're the same thing.
