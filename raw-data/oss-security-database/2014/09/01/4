Hi.

Isn't it the opposite? Were key servers fully trusted I'd agree
"expected behavior" would be to blindly import the server's reply.

However, the lack of trustworthiness of keyservers is precisely why the
check is relevant.

Note: it is not being suggested this check be considered a replacement
for full key verification. But, it is not unreasonable for a user to
expect when instructing gpg to import a key with FP 0xf00 that the gpg
binary is indeed importing a key with FP 0xf00.
