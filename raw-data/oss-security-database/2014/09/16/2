The bug is publicly disclosed.  The exploit isn't (and I believe list rules
dictate that I can't post exploits here).

I don't care who assigns the CVE, but it would be nice to be able to link
the tickets for this together somehow.

An experimental branch of librsync that uses blake2 is available here:
https://github.com/therealmik/librsync/tree/blake2

Dropbox have responded that they have fixed this bug independently, but
have not pushed anything out to their forked librsync github repo.

I have not heard further from the rsync maintainer.  I will publicly release
colliding blocks and construction details soon, so if you use rsync on
untrusted files, consider using the -W option to avoid a DoS.

Regards,
  Michael
