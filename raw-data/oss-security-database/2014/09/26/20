I strongly believe that it should have been implemented this way from the
start.
Can anyone argument why making the import of functions explicit might be
unwanted in any use case?

Importing implicitly looks to me like buying powdered drugs from anonymous
shady street dealers - there's a slim chance you might get what you wanted,
but the odds (& esp. implications) of getting something toxic "from your
environment" are most probably higher.
