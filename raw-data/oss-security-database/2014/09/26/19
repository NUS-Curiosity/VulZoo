Yes, what I'm saying is that in that situation, we should blame the
"some process", not bash. It is the "some process" that opted to act as
a privilege boundary (by being setuid or whatever), so it should be
responsible for taking extra care when it executes non-trivial code
(e.g. bash) with its elevated privileges.
