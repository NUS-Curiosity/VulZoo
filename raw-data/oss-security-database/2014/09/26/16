Subject: CVE Request: Go crypto/tls vulnerability

Hello,

>From the Go 1.3.2 release announcement:

"The crpyto/tls fix addresses a security bug that affects programs that use
crypto/tls to implement a TLS server from Go 1.1 onwards. If the server enables
TLS client authentication using certificates (this is rare) and explicitly sets
SessionTicketsDisabled to true in the tls.Config, then a malicious client can
falsely assert ownership of any client certificate it wishes."

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Thanks,

Marc.
