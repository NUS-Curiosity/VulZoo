Subject: CVE request: Mediawiki before 1.19.19, 1.22.11 and 1.23.4
 insufficient CSS filtering of SVGs

Hi,

I know, I know, this is not a "the internet is on fire"-style vuln :-)

However, can we please get a CVE for this:
https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2014-September/000161.html

* (bug 69008) SECURITY: Enhance CSS filtering in SVG files. Filter
  <style> elements; normalize style elements and attributes before
  filtering; add checks for attributes that contain css; add unit tests
  for html5sec and reported bugs.

If anyone wants to discuss if this is a real vulnerability, I think it
is: Including malicious CSS by less-privileged users could lead to UI
manipulation which could cause a more-privileged user to do actions
like giving the less-prived user more privs.
