Since these patches look final and are updating the bash patchlevel
number, is it OK for distros to use them as-is, with the patchlevel
number update already?

They are not yet on ftp.gnu.org.  BTW, I notice that your earlier
bash 2.05b patch isn't there, either.

And while I am at it - thank you for providing detached signatures for
bash patches!  This is something the VIM project fails at, whereas you
do it right.  Appreciated!
