An RBG implemented in POSIX C has been placed on GitHub:

https://github.com/mknight-tag/MKRAND

It has been under test since late 2013 but we would like feedback from the
wider community. Please use the issue tracker for your feedback.

At this time the code quality can be considered alpha, but is stable enough
to be evaluated as a possible candidate for replacement of previous RBGs.
