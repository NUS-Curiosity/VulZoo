We already make function names and variable names different, so there's
no going back -- variable names have the usual restrictions, but with
function names it's essentially anything goes.

Since we would be going from essentially anything goes to a very small
set of acceptable exceptions, I can see a steady stream of "I used to
be able to use character X in my function names and can't now."  Frankly,
the really dangerous one is `/', since it allows you to circumvent scripts
that attempt to use full pathnames to bypass shell function lookups.  I
am more interested in other dangerous characters, the existential debate
between whitelists and blacklists notwithstanding.
