MITRE has been working on this for a few days but unfortunately hasn't
received a definitive reply about the gksu CVE ID. For now, all we can
say is that CVE-2014-2943 is currently a correct CVE ID for a Cobham
Aviator satellite terminal issue. The correct CVE ID for the gksu
issue is not CVE-2014-2943. We hope to resolve this by early next
week.
