Comment 1 in 573 says "Willem Toorop ... Good catch! ... a patch would
be apprectiated." Willem Toorop would be considered the "vendor"
according to the http://git.nlnetlabs.nl/ldns/tree/README and
http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/speaker/173326 pages.

Use CVE-2014-3209.

> Same argument as GPG I suppose, so probably deserves a CVE.

A user may have no choice other than to run GPG on a multi-user system
that always has untrusted users logged in. The documentation might
imply that ldns-keygen is typically run on a DNS server. The vendor
could have decided to assert that the permissions were intentional.
