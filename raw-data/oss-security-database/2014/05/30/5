I very much disagree with this.  We don't advertise that we scrub all data and neuter your report of all potentially sensitive things.  In fact, we pretty much say the opposite when you run sosreport.  It was never intended or advertised that we removed anything (we just happen to remove stuff that we very obviously don't want, like keytabs and obvious places for password storage).

I did see MITRE's response and they did assign a CVE to RHEL5's implementation precisely because it does not have this warning (like RHEL6 and Fedora do).  I can't disagree with their rationale for the assignment for RHEL5's version of sosreport.
