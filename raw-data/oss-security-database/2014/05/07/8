So this issue is security hardening, and not a security vulnerability.
There appears to be no meaningful way to exploit this at this time.
That could change in the future, if it's still unfixed by then, then
it would get a CVE, so hopefully this does get hardened prior to then,
so if it ever happens then it won't be a problem =).

Hence why I posted this =)
