I'm also looking at our code and other people's code. The pattern of
*action doesn't seem to popular, in fact searching github shows _0_
occurrence of "*action" in ruby code (lots of occurrences in non ruby
code). So either this pattern is never used or GitHub is blocking that
specific search term for Ruby, which doesn't seem to be the case, or
it's incredibly rare.

So yeah knowing the other vectors would be good! Thanks.
