Subject: A number of EncFS issues

Hi,

https://defuse.ca/audits/encfs.htm discusses a number of issues in EncFS:

"Same Key Used for Encryption and Authentication"

"Stream Cipher Used to Encrypt Last File Block"

"Generating Block IV by XORing Block Number"

"File Holes are Not Authenticated"

"MACs Not Compared in Constant Time"

"64-bit MACs"

"Editing Configuration File Disables MACs"

There are currently no patches.

I am not familiar enough with cryptography to know if they need CVEs, or 
are considered hardening (the last one sounds CVE worthy though)

Cheers,
