Here, it appears that the only security fix to
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=hw/usb/bus.c;h=e48b19fc29bd9f831cc05990be73ddf49936d6a9;hb=HEAD
is the insertion of the "dev->setup_index > dev->setup_len" test. In
other words, although the patch corresponds to two bug discoverers,
only one discoverer found a security problem.

To clarify: we are currently interpreting "dev->setup_len ==
sizeof(dev->data_buf) seems fine, no need to fail migration" to mean
that "dev->setup_len >= sizeof(dev->data_buf)" is too strict a test,
and "dev->setup_len > sizeof(dev->data_buf)" is sufficient. It does
not imply that an attacker can cross privilege boundaries and cause a
denial of service (i.e., a failed migration) by triggering the
"dev->setup_len == sizeof(dev->data_buf)" condition.

The "dev->setup_index >= sizeof(dev->data_buf)" test was also removed.
Similarly, we are interpreting this to mean that that test is
superfluous. We are not interpreting this to mean that that test had
allowed a denial of service attack.

Use CVE-2014-3461 for the "When state is DATA, passing index > len
will cause memcpy with negative length, resulting in heap overflow"
issue.

Note that a related recent commit:

  http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=9f8e9895c504149d7048e9fc5eb5cbb34b16e49a

has a CVE-2013-4541 assignment from Red Hat. See

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1066384

The http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/272322 patch
represents additional changes needed after that CVE-2013-4541 fix.
