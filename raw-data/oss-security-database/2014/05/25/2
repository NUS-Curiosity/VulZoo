Subject: CVE request: another path traversal in dpkg-source during unpack

Hi,

Another path traversal was discovered[1] in dpkg-source, related to the 
unpacking of source packages with specially-crafted patches.
While waiting for the original reporter's PoC/more information, Guillem 
Jover (dpkg maintainer) independently re-discovered the issue, and a second 
one.
This second issue has now been publicly reported as [2] to ease the 
assignment of CVE id(s) given the combination of private and not-very-
specific public information.

Both issues are independent of the version of the patch tool.

While figuring out whether one or two ids should be requested (at least from 
our POV), it appears that we can say that [2] is a superset of [1] - this is 
based on the minimal fixes needed to fix either vulnerability: the fix for [1] 
does not fix [2], but the fix for [2] does fix [1].

Could a CVE id be assigned please?

CC'ing Guillem for any complimentary information.

Thanks in advance.
