I believed in error, it seems.  Sorry, hectic; it had been raised as
possibly a good idea, but not acted upon.  Process improvement
forthcoming, we'll try to include linux-distros@ in future.

Todd's investigation has not discovered any Linux distribution other
than Gentoo which even made EXPERIMENTAL_DMARC an available build
option, and for Gentoo it was a use-flag.

Nor do FreeBSD, OpenBSD or DragonFlyBSD (DPorts checked), although
PkgSrc in NetBSD also exposed DMARC as a build option.
