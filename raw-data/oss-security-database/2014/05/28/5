Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel DoS with syscall auditing

Issuing a system call with a random large number will OOPS, depending
on configuration.  A configuration that will enable this bug is:

# auditctl -a exit,always -S open

No privilege whatsoever is required to trigger the OOPS.

It's possible that this can be extended to more than just a DoS --
with some care and willingness to exploit timing attacks, this is a
read of arbitrary single bits in kernel memory.
