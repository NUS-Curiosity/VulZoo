Subject: Re: OpenFiler - Arbitrary Code Execution & Stored XSS

Yes,

OpenFiler uses the 'openfiler' user account for its' web user interface,
and port 446 is open for the UI administration.

in general, logged on user doesn't have direct shell access and the
OpenFiler appliance does not provide with an interface

to interact directly with the shell. this makes the command execution
problematic in terms of security as it allows an attacker to run

system commands and read arbitrary system files via the host name change
box.

Regarding the XSS vulnerability; OpenFiler allows LDAP authentication and
not just local user accounts, this may cause privilege escalations once a
regular user adds a malicious shared device..
