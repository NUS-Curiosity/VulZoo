The new issue is very similar to the one fixed by:

https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=4629ee02ac649c27f9c0cf98ba017c6b5526070f

which is linked to the infamous CVE-2013-0339.  4629ee0 fixed the issue
for general entities, while the 9cd1c3c fixes the same type of problem
for parameter entities.  Even when parsing without NOENT, external
parameter entities are fetched.
