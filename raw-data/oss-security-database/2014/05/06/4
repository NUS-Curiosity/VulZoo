Subject: CVE-2014-0191 libxml2: external parameter entity loaded when entity
 substitution is disabled

Hi,

It was discovered that libxml2, a library providing support to read,
modify and write XML files, incorrectly performs entity substituton in
the doctype prolog, even if the application using libxml2 disabled any
entity substitution. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to the
exhaustion of CPU and memory resources or file descriptors.

This issue was discovered by Daniel Berrange of Red Hat.
