The short answer is that bug 746498 is CVE-2014-3864, and bug 749183
is CVE-2014-3865. We can also, first, review the status of the CVEs
related to our 1 May 2014 message. The proposed CVE mappings for all
four of these CVEs are indicated below; these would potentially start
to be processed for the cve.mitre.org web site as early as today.


CVE-2014-3127 (revised CVE description to be published at
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3127 soon):

dpkg 1.15.9 on Debian squeeze introduces support for the "C-style
encoded filenames" feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch
program lacks this feature, which triggers an interaction error that
allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and
modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source
package. NOTE: this can be considered a release engineering problem in
the effort to fix CVE-2014-0471.



CVE-2014-3227 (new CVE to be published at
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3227 and
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3227 soon):

dpkg 1.15.9, 1.16.x before 1.16.14, and 1.17.x before 1.17.9 expect
the patch program to be compliant with a need for the "C-style encoded
filenames" feature, but is supported in environments with noncompliant
patch programs, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote
attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files
outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of reliance on unrealistic
constraints on the behavior of an external program.



CVE-2014-3864 (new CVE to be published at
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3864 and
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3864 soon):

(reference is
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=746498)

Directory traversal vulnerability in dpkg-source 1.3.0 allows remote
attackers to modify files outside of the intended directories via a
crafted source package that lacks a --- header line.



CVE-2014-3865 (new CVE to be published at
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3865 and
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3865 soon):

(reference is
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749183)

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in dpkg-source 1.3.0
allow remote attackers to modify files outside of the intended
directories via a source package with a crafted Index: pseudo-header
in conjunction with (1) missing --- and +++ header lines or (2) a +++
header line with a blank pathname.
