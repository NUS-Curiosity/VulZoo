Subject: CVE Request: OpenSSL NULL pointer dereference in do_ssl3_write

Hello,

A null pointer dereference bug was discovered in so_ssl3_write(). An attacker
could possibly use this to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/5.5/common/005_openssl.patch.sig

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Thanks,

Marc.
