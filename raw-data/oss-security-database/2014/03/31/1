Hi All

CVE-2007-1036 describes complete lack of authentication on JBoss admin 
interfaces. CVE-2010-0738 describes the more specialized case of missing 
authentication for the HEAD verb, and could be considered an incomplete 
fix of CVE-2007-1036. CVE-2012-0874 describes the more specialized case 
of missing authentication on some invoker servlets, and could be 
considered an incomplete fix of CVE-2007-1036. To clarify the timeline 
of CVE IDs:

CVE-2007-1036: By default, all admin interfaces in JBoss AS do not 
require authentication. This includes all invoker servlets, HA or not.

Following this, supported JBoss products had authentication applied to 
all admin interfaces by default. From the unsupported community release 
of JBoss AS 7 onwards, authentication is also applied by default. 
Unsupported community releases of JBoss AS <= 6.x never had 
authentication applied by default, and they could be accurately said to 
be vulnerable to CVE-2007-1036.

CVE-2010-0738: It was found that the authentication applied in supported 
JBoss products does not cover the HEAD verb, allowing a HTTP verb 
tampering attack.

CVE-2012-0874: It was found that the authentication applied in supported 
JBoss products does not cover the HA servlets. This is not directly 
exploitable, as a security interceptor still blocks unauthenticated access.

CVE-2013-4810: HP has been picking up unsupported JBoss AS releases that 
expose CVE-2007-1036 [and by extension CVE-2010-0738 and CVE-2012-0874], 
and did not ship patches for any of these CVE IDs. Once the issue was 
reported via ZDI, CVE-2013-4810 was assigned.

Therefore CVE-2013-4810 does not relate to either unsupported JBoss AS 
releases or supported JBoss products. It only relates to unsupported 
JBoss AS releases as a duplicate of either CVE-2012-0874 or 
CVE-2007-1036. Since the CVE-2013-4810 description pertains to invoker 
servlets, I think it is a dupe of CVE-2012-0874, but I can see a 
rational argument for considering it to be a dupe of the more general 
case described by CVE-2007-1036.

Unfortunately the original "Secure JBoss" and "Secure the JMX Console" 
links are now dead, but the content lives on here:

https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SecureJBoss
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SecureTheJmxConsole

Note that one of the steps documented is to secure the invoker:

https://community.jboss.org/servlet/JiveServlet/download/12190-52-6400/jboss-securejmx.html

Although this content does not explicitly mention the EJB/JMX 
InvokerServlets, it covers securing them.
