I believe that a CVE request for this is probably overkill.

The vCalendar plugin does not support login credentials when
subscribing to a WebCal.

The user can work around this missing feature by adding their username
and password to the URI, e.g.
https://USERNAME:MYPASSWORD@...lserver/home/USERNAME/Calendar

The URI is stored in clear text, hence if the user chooses to work
around the missing feature their un/pw will be stored in clear text.

Similar behaviour can be witnessed in a number of other apps. For
example, if I bookmark
https://USERNAME:MYPASSWORD@...lserver/home/USERNAME/Calendar in
firefox, it will save the credentials in clear text.

There are some apps that will store what the user enters in a
password field as clear text, however Claws Mail is not one of them.

Therefore, on the Claws Mail bug tracker, this is marked as a feature
request and not as a security issue.
