Subject: CVE request: openssh client does not check SSHFP if server offers certificate

Hi,

A vulnerability in OpenSSH's ssh client has been reported in Debian's BTS:
https://bugs.debian.org/742513

If the ssh server offers a HostCertificate that the ssh client doesn't accept, 
then the client doesn't then check the DNS for SSHFP records. This is a 
security problem because it means that a malicious server can disable SSHFP-
checking by presenting a certificate. Note that users are still presented the 
well-known "host verification prompt".

Given the prompt will and the still rather peripheral reliance on SSHFP, we 
consider this an issue of low severity.

Please assign a CVE name for this issue.


Thanks,
