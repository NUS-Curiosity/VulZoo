Subject: CVE request: postfixadmin SQL injection vulnerability

Hi,

Postfixadmin has an SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability is only 
exploitable by authenticated users able to create new aliases. If the alias 
contains SQL code, the list-virtual.php overview triggers the vulnerability.

The vulnerability was fixed upstream in this commit:
http://sourceforge.net/p/postfixadmin/code/1650

Please assign a CVE name for this issue.


Thanks,
