I don't care much who runs it.
It might even be a good idea they to be
anonymous.

Though using exactly the same name "Full Disclosure"
doesn't seem right to me -- there must be visible

I suggest people to watch for delays when
posting interesting info (first post might
require approval sometimes).

Are there other alternatives?
