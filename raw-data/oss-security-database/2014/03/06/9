Comprehensively tracking the introduction of new protection mechanisms
and new security features across all browsers is not directly in the
scope of CVE. There are a number of cases described either in older
documents such as http://code.google.com/p/browsersec or newer
documents such as
http://www.strews.eu/results/5-web-platform-security-guide in which
some browsers have chosen to block a type of attack whereas others
have not. At the moment, these types of "competitive analysis" CVE
requests may be deferred. In other words, CVE isn't really "about" a
product suddenly transitioning from non-vulnerable to vulnerable
solely because its development effort has lagged behind its
competitors in a sufficiently important way for a sufficiently long
period of time. The author of a product is free to announce software
mistakes, and there may be opportunities for CVE assignments in cases
of new codebases lacking a security feature that was already
more-or-less ubiquitous before the software was written.
