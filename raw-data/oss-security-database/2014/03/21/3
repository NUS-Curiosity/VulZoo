Subject: Re: [OT] FD mailing list died. Time for new one

For a start I suggest a group of people start
a public mailing list on some public service.

I can volunteer time.

Off the top of my head options are:
A. googlegroups
B. sourceforge:  http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mailing%20lists

google are BB, have no experience with sourceforge ML.
(not sure sourceforge is applicable because of need of project).

This approach has disadvantages, but an advantage is
not dealing with DDOS/legal stuff.
