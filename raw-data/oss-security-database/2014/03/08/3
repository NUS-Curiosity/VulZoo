The following trivial patch fixes this issue by just using File::Temp
instead:

http://git.donarmstrong.com/?p=perltidy.git;a=blob;f=debian/patches/fix_insecure_tmpnam_usage_740670
 
I'm currently preparing an upload which will resolve this issue for
Debian in unstable and testing; I'm not certain if it necessitates a CVE
or security update in stable, but if anyone feels that way, I don't mind
preparing one.
