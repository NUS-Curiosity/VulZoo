Use CVE-2014-2309.

As a side note, this is possibly related to "it seems that Linux is
not affected, you might want to test though as I have only tested this
with a 2.6.x kernel" in the
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/10/10/8 post. (By
mentioning this, we do not mean that CVE-2014-2309 is a duplicate of a
CVE assignment from October 2012. We only mean that this
c88507fbad8055297c1d1e21e599f46960cbee39 issue in the Linux kernel 3.x
might have been suggested but not tested in 2012.)
