Subject: udisks and udisks2: stack-based buffer overflow when handling long
 path names

Hi All,

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team, found a flaw in
the way udisks and udisks2 handled long path names. A malicious, local
user could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted directory
structure that could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the udisks daemon (root).

This issue has been assigned CVE-2014-0004.
