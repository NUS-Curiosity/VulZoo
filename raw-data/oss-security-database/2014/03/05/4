Hi Alexander,

I know it's not realistic, but it may be easier to go to the OpenPAM.
The code is much smaller and easier to audit (and tcb works with
OpenPAM). OpenBSD is doing well with the BSD auth and gain the same as
with PAM (plugins via /usr/libexec/auth/*). BSD auth is only three C
core files:

http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/gen/auth_subr.c?rev=1.39;content-type=text%2Fplain
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/gen/authenticate.c?rev=1.20;content-type=text%2Fplain
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/gen/login_cap.c?rev=1.29;content-type=text%2Fplain

So it might be a better 'patch' than bloated Linux-PAM.

btw. I'm thinking about porting BSD auth API to Linux/tcb.

Daniel
