Subject: CVE Request: Linux kernel: IPv6: crash due to router advertisement
 flooding

The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a crash on hosts that accept router
advertisements. An unlimited number of routes can be created from
router advertisements.

A remote attacker in the same layer 2 segment can cause a crash from
memory exhaustion by flooding router advertisements to a target
machine.
