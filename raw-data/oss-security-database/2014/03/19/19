Not for any sensitive data. And vulnerability descriptions are very
sensitive...

Modelling a charter is easy... But I bet they'll fail on gathering
all previous FD members.

Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha...

Behind that party which you possibly may trust, there's a B.B.,
which is even worse than a Big Brother - as it's a Big Business.

When a Big Business faces something, it asks itself two questions:
0. Could it cause any loss?
1. Could it bring any profit?

Suppose someone posts a zero-day vulnerability on the list which
affects the BB; do you really think it wouldn't be censored out?

No doubt, it will - otherwise that will Cause a Loss, and that's
inacceptable for BB.

Also, several days before FD shutdown there was a long thread
related to some vulnerabilities in Google services... Although
John Cartwright didn't name anyone, I can't be sure these two
events are unrelated.

I'd prefer participating on the list hosted by some party which
isn't directly affected by list postings - say, some ISP.
