Subject: CVE Request: rack-ssl rubygem: XSS in error page

Hi,

The latest version of rack-ssl rubygem (1.4.0) contains a commit that fixes a
XSS vulnerability in the error page.

https://github.com/josh/rack-ssl/commit/9d7d7300b907e496db68d89d07fbc2e0df0b487b

"Some adapters (i.e. jruby-rack) will pass through bad URIs, then display
the resulting exception. This creates an attack vector for XSS attacks.
"

Needs a CVE I think.

Ciao, Marcus
