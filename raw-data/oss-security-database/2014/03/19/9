Sure.  Even though most threads in here mention CVE, they also contain
plenty of technical info that is desirable regardless of one's opinion
of CVE.  So you could consider treating or ignoring your CVE allergy
(just skip the mentions of CVE, look at the rest of what the same
messages say), and then you might find the content in here useful and/or
worth commenting on (just except for the CVE aspects, which are
obviously not your type). ;-)

Makes sense to me.  I hope whoever chooses to setup the new FD will
consider this idea.
