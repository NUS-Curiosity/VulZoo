Hosting?  That's what the cloud is for.

I have no idea who runs https://groups.google.com/group/FullDisclosure

but they seem modeled after original fd charter.  I trust Google as a
neutral third party more than I would trust most security researchers.
 They already host all the old newsgroup archives.  It's also free,
easily consumable, and most importantly, babysat for security issues
in a way that even a team of skilled volunteers would have a hard time
pulling off.
