Chrome crashes on both Linux and Mavericks.

openssl s_client doesn’t report problems, but I wouldn’t expect it to.

wget just downloads index.html without any issue.

Firefox, elinks, midori and curl all refuse one way or another.

I didn’t test any more.  Apart from chrome, those are all on Fedora 20.

I agree that the connections being so trivially decryptable represents a flaw that should be fixed.
