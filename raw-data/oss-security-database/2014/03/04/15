Subject: CVE-2013-6800 is a dup of CVE-2013-1418

Hi,

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6800
is the same issue as 
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1418

(basically the same code fix for the same issue, but that it
was in 2 different github branches seems to have confused someone).

Ciao, Marcus
