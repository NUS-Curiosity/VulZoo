The scope of CVE-2013-1418 is this part of
c2ccf4197f697c4ff143b8a786acdd875e70a89d:

  Multi-realm KDC null deref [CVE-2013-1418] ... If a KDC serves
  multiple realms, certain requests can cause setup_server_realm() to
  dereference a null pointer, crashing the KDC.

  CVSSv2: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C


The scope of CVE-2013-6800 is this part of
c2ccf4197f697c4ff143b8a786acdd875e70a89d:

  A related but more minor vulnerability requires authentication to
  exploit, and is only present if a third-party KDC database module can
  dereference a null pointer under certain conditions.


The practical relevance of the second CVE is that, based on the
available information, a KDC apparently can be vulnerable to
CVE-2013-6800 even if the CVE-2013-1418 exploitation conditions are
not met. The vendor's disclosure binds the CVE-2013-1418 ID only to a
subset of the c2ccf4197f697c4ff143b8a786acdd875e70a89d comment. This
was accompanied by a similar binding within third-party references
such as 1026942 in the Red Hat Bugzilla. It is conceivable that
someone would want to track CVE-2013-6800 even if they determined that
CVE-2013-1418 was not relevant to their installation.

In general, even if a single patch could address two distinct types of
attacks, that does not necessarily mean that two CVEs are duplicates.
