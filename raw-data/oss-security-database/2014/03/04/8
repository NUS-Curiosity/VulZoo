Perhaps this needs more than one RFC, then?

I consider this a flaw in Safari.  These connections are trivially
decryptable by any passive eavesdropper.  An active attacker can tamper
with the content of the session.

On what platform?  Is this for any connection, or just for a primary
connection?  That is, can any web site can crash google chrome with <img
src="https://demo.cmrg.net/" /> ?

(sorry, i don't have either chrome or safari handy to test it myself
right now)
