I added this to the chromium bug tracker:
https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=348987

There's however something interesting: I couldn't reproduce the crash
setup. I created my own test server with a 16 bit exchange and it
doesn't crash. I haven't found out yet what the difference is that's
causing this.
