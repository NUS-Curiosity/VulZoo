Subject: Duplicated CVE assignment for bip

Hi,
Seems there's a duplicated CVE ID for bip:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4550 and
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5268 refer
to the same bugreport.

Since CVE-2013-4550 was used for much longer, CVE-2011-5268 should
be rejected?

Cheers,
        Moritz
