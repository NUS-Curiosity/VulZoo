Subject: kwallet crypto misuse

I just noticed this is now public:

<http://gaganpreet.in/blog/2013/07/24/kwallet-security-analysis/>

Short summary: kwallet uses Blowfish to encrypt its password store, and 
despite an attempt at implementing CBC mode (in a file called cbc.cc no 
less), it's actually ECB mode.  UTF-16 encoding combined with Blowfish's 
64 bit block size means there are just four password characters per 
block.  Encryption is convergent as well.  This may enable recovery of 
passwords through codebook attacks.

Should we treat this as a minor vulnerability?
