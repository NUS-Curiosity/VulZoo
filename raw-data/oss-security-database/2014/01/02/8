Thanks very much for this additional information. At this point, it
seems very unlikely that the "\0a\0b\0c\0d" issue will have an
additional CVE assignment. We were asking just because of the
possibility of a clear implementation error in which security was
weakened by using a "wrong" character width.

It's possible that a group elsewhere at MITRE would work on
recommendations in that area or other areas. For purposes of the CVE
assignments in this situation, that type of opportunity for security
improvement wasn't being considered.
