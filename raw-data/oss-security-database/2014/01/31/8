Subject: CVE needed for libotr's support for OTR v1?

Hello,

Is a CVE needed for versions of libotr that support OTR v1? Quoting the 
Debian bug[1]:

""
as you are surely aware of, it's been known [1] since 2006 that
clients supporting both OTRv1 and v2 (such as libotr 3.x) are subject
to protocol downgrade attacks clients. It's also been known for
a while that OTRv1 has serious security issues (that were the main
reason for a v2, actually). In short, support v2 only is the only safe
way to go these days.
