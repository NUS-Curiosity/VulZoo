That's OK.

I think you were in fact not subscribed in 2012.

This is not a very frequent question, but I've seen this sort of
confusion several times, in different places.  I don't know if it's
addressed in some sort of FAQ list.

I think there's room for improvement for the language used on CVE ID
pages like https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0038 ,
which currently says:

"Date Entry Created
20131203	 Disclaimer: The entry creation date may reflect when
the CVE-ID was allocated or reserved, and does not necessarily indicate
when this vulnerability was discovered, shared with the affected vendor,
publicly disclosed, or updated in CVE."

but follows this with:

"Phase (Legacy)
Assigned (20131203)"

I'm not surprised the latter continues to confuse people, as it appears
not to fall under the disclaimer.  I think the disclaimer should be
worded such that it'd clearly apply to "Phase (Legacy) \n Assigned" as
well.  (And even then some confusion will remain, just maybe less of it.)
