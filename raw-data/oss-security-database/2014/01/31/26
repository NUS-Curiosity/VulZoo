Google is offering bounties for responsible disclosure of bugs in
Google's software, and I guess this includes use of Linux kernel by
Chromium OS.  (I don't know if this specific vulnerability was relevant
to Google's products, but I wouldn't be surprised if Google is generous
enough to pay a bounty anyway.)

On a related note, Google is also offering bounties for security
enhancements to some Open Source projects once such enhancements are
accepted upstream.  This includes Linux kernel and many more:

... but finding a vulnerability would probably not fall under the latter
program.
