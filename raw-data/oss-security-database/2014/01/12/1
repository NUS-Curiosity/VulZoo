Subject: Linux kernel: missing CPU-state sanitation during task-switch causes
 DOS / privilege escalation

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello list,

Although of low impact (only some processors/kernels affected,
escalation currently only with mmap_min_addr=0), this might still be
CVE-worthy:

Faults during task-switch due to unhandled FPU-exceptions allow to
kill processes at random on all affected kernels, resulting in local
DOS in the end. One some architectures, privilege escalation under
non-common circumstances is possible, POC for escalation via
shmem_xattr_handlers is available for about 5 days.

See [1] for information about discovery, exploitation, [2] about LKML
discussion, [3] for patch.
