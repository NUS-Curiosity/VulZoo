The libvirt team thinks the decision to SPLIT was overkill, and that a
single CVE would have been sufficient.

Neither of those versions is released.  The only released version is 1.2.1.

Yes, it took two patches to fully fix the issue.  But the symptoms of
the issue are identical (you either have the connection issue, or you
don't, and it wasn't until the second patch that you get rid of the
connection issue).  But this is no different to other cases of fixing
bugs in unreleased code.

No, the hourly builds are NOT supported releases; we can update the
downloads.html page to explicitly mention that they are to be used at
own risk.

However, since you have already assigned both numbers, we can go ahead
and use them :(
