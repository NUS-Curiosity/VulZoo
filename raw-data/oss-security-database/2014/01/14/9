>From that link:

Apache Archiva use Apache Struts2:
  "In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following "action:", 
"redirect:" or "redirectAction:" is not properly sanitized. Since said 
information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, 
this introduces the possibility to inject server side code."

^ All that is CVE-2013-2251.
