Subject: CVE request: Cantata vulnerability

I would like to request CVE for vulnerability in Cantata[1], which
allows attacker to steal valuable information from user's home directory
via internal HTTP server, that are not properly handled requests and
allows to download every file it has access to from host, where it runs.

More details can be acquired from upstream bugreport[2].
