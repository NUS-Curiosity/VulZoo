Use CVE-2013-7300 for the lack of restrictions on the set of files
available through the web server, i.e., an absolute path traversal
vulnerability.

Use CVE-2013-7301 for the default configuration in which the external
network interface is used with no access control for reading queued
music files.

These could have been fixed independently. For example, fixing only
CVE-2013-7300 means that a remote attacker could read "private" song
data (but that might be irrelevant in some situations on a network
within a home). Fixing only CVE-2013-7301 means that local users could
read arbitrary files (but that might be irrelevant on a single-user
system).

The other issues mentioned in id=356 are probably best considered
suggestions for security improvement (e.g., availability of an HTTP
service in fewer circumstances, defaulting to the lo interface, better
access control, additional build options, etc.).
