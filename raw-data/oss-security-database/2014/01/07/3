Subject: CVE Request: graphviz: stack-based buffer overflow in yyerror()

Hello,

Graphviz, a collection of tools for the manipulation and layout of 
graphs, was recently reported to be affected by a buffer overflow 
vulnerability.

The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "yyerror()" 
function (lib/cgraph/scan.l) and can be exploited to cause a stack-based 
buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.

Can a CVE please be assigned to this issue?
