Subject: CVE split and a missed file

    Hello,

Recently Mitre split up a cve 'CVE-2013-6405' into 3 separate CVEs. Each for 
subset of files touched by a commit 'bceaa90240'.

  -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/bceaa90240b6019ed73b49965eac7d167610be69

But the 3 new CVEs do not seem to cover patch to a file

   -> net/ieee802154/dgram.c.

Is that intentional or a miss. (just checking)

CVE-2013-7263

The Linux kernel before 3.12.4 updates certain length values before
ensuring that associated data structures have been initialized, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system call,
related to net/ipv4/ping.c, net/ipv4/raw.c, net/ipv4/udp.c,
net/ipv6/raw.c, and net/ipv6/udp.c.

CVE-2013-7264

The l2tp_ip_recvmsg function in net/l2tp/l2tp_ip.c in the Linux kernel
before 3.12.4 updates a certain length value before ensuring that an
associated data structure has been initialized, which allows local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
(1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system call.

CVE-2013-7265

The pn_recvmsg function in net/phonet/datagram.c in the Linux kernel
before 3.12.4 updates a certain length value before ensuring that an
associated data structure has been initialized, which allows local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
(1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system call.
