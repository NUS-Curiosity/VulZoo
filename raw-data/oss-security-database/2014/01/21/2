I'm going to interpret your question as "Do you know whether the relevant
attacks [can] occur at times when this original session ID is invalid?"

On reviewing the vulnerability discussion, it seems clear that no, the
attack can not succeed if the original session ID is invalid. And this is
the point of the patch addressing the issue; when logging in a new user
after a purchase, the session is now regenerated with user_login_finalize
