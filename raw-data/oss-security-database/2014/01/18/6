The problem is we can't easily map things against a security advisory
such as

https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2013-02-16

because there is minimal details. There is no mention of which issue
if which and so on. If you can include the ISSUE-NN number in
advisories in future that will prevent such problems, thanks!

If this is indeed a duplicate than yes we need to REJECT CVE-2013-6488
