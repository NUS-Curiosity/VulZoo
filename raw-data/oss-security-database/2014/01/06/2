Subject: [notification] CVE-2013-6888: uscan: remote code execution

Hi,

Given the recent issues in uscan (part of devscripts) I took a look at
it and found a few other issues.
The bugs fixed by the following commit basically allow remote code
execution when uscan is used to download upstream's tarball. With and
without repacking (contrary to the commit message).

This was assigned CVE-2013-6888.

Two other changes were made that IMO should be considered as hardening:

At least I'm not aware of a way to exploit them.
