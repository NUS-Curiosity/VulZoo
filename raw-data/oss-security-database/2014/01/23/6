I'm not convinced. There's a three digit number of Debian-derived distros 
and many of them come and go. The oldest Qlustar advisory is less than 
a year old and there's no visible participation in any security processes.

We maintain the http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/kernel-sec/ repository
which tracks all kernel vulnerabilities as soon as they're public. That's
a good base for every Debian-derived distro with a modified kernel.

Cheers,
