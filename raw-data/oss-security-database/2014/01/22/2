Yes, we definitely care. So far, we took the info from the Debian and
Ubuntu related security advisories or from info on the lists of the
software projects we additionally/differently provide (as compared to
Debian/Ubuntu). I must admit, I didn't even know about the oss-security
list (sorry).

I understand your point of view, but our users (and we) probably won't
care too much about the order of cart and horse. They just need timely updated
software :-)

I'm sure there will be other stuff than kernel important for us to know
as well. Even for the packages that we just redistribute from upstream
(by far the majority) there can be situations that we don't want to
wait for an announced upstream package fix. Having the info before that
will allow us testing proposed fixes earlier and possibly prevent damage.

Exactly. Qlustar is a distro designed for a special purpose
(HPC/Storage/Cloud) clustering and 99% of the binary packages are simply
redistributed from upstream. It's only the remaining 1% we take care of
ourselves. Also note that for our kernels, we compile only stuff that's
relevant for clusters, so a lot of security issues don't affect them.

    SD> At first glance, it appears that about one half of your

Correct, because that's the most concerned (with respect to security)
package where we differ from upstream.

Well it's better than nothing, but I'm pretty sure there will be cases
where it will be too late.

What exactly do you mean by advance notice anyway? Advance of what?
Can't tell without knowing that.

See above. Note that even if we don't put out a security advisory for them,
upstream fixes for stuff unrelated to Qlustar's purpose still are
available from our repo latest a couple of days after the upstream
announcement.

I agree with your example, but such delays don't happen with us.

Well we're pretty new and just getting more widespread ..

Yes, all our packages are publicly available from our website.

Fine.

Will do.

Good, I'm glad about that :)

My bad. When writing my first message I wasn't subscribed to the list
yet, so I had to answer with copy/paste. Should work OK now.
