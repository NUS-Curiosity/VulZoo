Ah, nice catch Jakub. Needless to say, this is related to but
different from CVE-2013-4136.

One thing to notice, however, is that there's a race condition between
the stat check introduced in 34b1087870c2.
The following sequence still triggers the bogus behaviour:

<user> mkdir $dir
<phusion> lstat() (getFileTypeNoFollowSymlinks)
<user> rmdir $dir
<user> ln -s /target $dir
<phusion> stat() (from verifyDirectoryPermissions)
...
