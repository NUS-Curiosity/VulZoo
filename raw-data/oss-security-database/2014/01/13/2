Subject: [OSSA 2014-001] Nova live snapshots use an insecure local directory
 (CVE-2013-7048)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-001
CVE: CVE-2013-7048
Date: January 13, 2013
Title: Nova live snapshots use an insecure local directory
Reporter: Daniel Berrange (Red Hat)
Products: Nova
Affects: Grizzly and later

Description:
Daniel Berrange from Red Hat reported that the directories used to
temporarily store live snapshots on Nova compute nodes were writable to
all local users. A local attacker with shell access on compute nodes
could therefore read and modify the contents of live snapshots before
those are uploaded to the image service.
