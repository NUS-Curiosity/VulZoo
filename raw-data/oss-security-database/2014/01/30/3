Use CVE-2014-1831 for the vulnerability with the "before 4.0.33"
affected versions.

Use CVE-2014-1832 for the vulnerability with the "4.0.33 and earlier"
affected versions.

This is an unusual situation because it depends on a decision about
whether the fix in version 4.0.33 solves part of the problem or
addresses one of the threat models. It also depends on whether two
CVEs should be used to cover a set of reports that are only relevant
to symlink attacks, but arguably have different flaw types.

CVE-2014-1831 requires the ability to create a symlink but apparently
does not require the ability to conduct the described race-condition
attack. The attacker could lack direct shell access, but have some
type of slow or limited access to the system. This could potentially
involve the ability to upload and run scripts that can create symlinks
but can't execute arbitrary commands or code. Alternatively, the
attacker could have access to a file manager with the same
constraints.

Also, in some cases, multiple CVEs are used in the case of a single
original report of a symlink-handling problem, e.g., CVE-2008-1569 and
CVE-2008-1570.
