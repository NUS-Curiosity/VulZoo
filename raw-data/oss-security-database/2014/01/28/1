Subject: Remote code execution in horde < 5.1.1

Hi,

There is a remote code execution bug in horde affecting all versions from
at least horde 3.1.x to 5.1.1.
This has been fixed in commit
https://github.com/horde/horde/commit/da6afc7e9f4e290f782eca9dbca794f772caccb3
Also check changelog
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/82c400788537cfc0106b68447789ff53793ac086/bundles/groupware/docs/CHANGES#L215

Can you please assign a CVE for this issue?

Thanks in advance.

PS: while I discovered this bug independently reviewing horde3 code, the
full credit should go to the horde maintainers as they discovered and fixed
it first on horde5.

Regards
Pedro
