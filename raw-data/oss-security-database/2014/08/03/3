Simple question: who do you trust more - your ISP or site owner?
Or should I ask whether you trush either of them?

Hint: ISPs may be subjected to SORM-2 (been there, seen that, no
t-shirt this time), Jindun Gongcheng, or other pretty things. Site
owners may be interested in tracking their users' activity (that's
why I prefer browsing online shops anonymously, without logging in).
Other people may try to eavesdrop (or even intercept) connections
from users to servers.

When people want to make their systems secure, they use client-side
certificates. When people want to make their systems public, they
normally don't care of who access them and don't track their users.

When a site allows anonymous access, that may be performed via HTTP.
Authenticated (over HTTPS) users may (and normally should) work via
HTTPS, but forcing all users to use HTTPS is "a VERY bad idea"
