There isn't a precise rule of this type. For example, there may be
situations in which the blank credentials can only be entered over a
trusted interface (for some definition of "trusted" that is consistent
with the vendor's security policy and otherwise reasonable for the
product's context).

Similarly, "race the admin to the WebGUI" situations don't always
qualify for CVE IDs. There are many products in which the full
functionality of install.php is available to the first client who
visits install.php. A product can have a design constraint that
installation must not require the person to have any ability to use a
command line (or other non-browser method) for any part of the initial
product setup. This design constraint was historically reasonable for
some types of shared web hosting, for example.

For this FreeNAS case, the blank password seems unreasonable because

  -- the requirement for a reboot implies that the product is not
     intended for use in constrained scenarios such as shared web
     hosting

  -- the web interface exposes a root shell. This is quite different
     from a case where use of install.php has a consequence limited to
     "the machine ends up with a web application that wasn't supposed
     to be there, and maybe some disk consumption or other minor
     resource consumption."

Use CVE-2014-5334.
