Except that it has been determined quite some time ago that all three fixes
having gone in upstream so far don't really fix anything. I posted a patch that
I think actually addresses the issue (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/4/288), but
till now no-one cared to comment on it, apply it, or point out what's still
wrong, despite the ping 3 weeks later (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/25/23). It
was - instead of the insufficient Linux ones - in fact meanwhile applied to the
Xen clone of that code.


Perhaps the kernel folks want to look at it again if they missed it so far.

Ciao, Marcus
