HTTPS wouldn't help much: the attackers (most of which are known to
use 3-letter names) can (and they really do) issue a fake certificate
for their decoy servers.

In general, nothing received from the Net could be trusted. And the
HTTPS doesn't guarantee anything beyond "this certificate was signed
by this CA" - was that voluntary or forced.

Enforcing HTTPS for the whole site is even more stupid: normally only
user-specific data (login procedure, personal settings for registered
users, etc) should be forced to go through HTTPS; everything else
should normally be left up to the users' wish.

But the terminal state of mental disability is... yes, using scripts
from outer sources: intercepting one popular source like
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/*/jquery.min.js will
allow the attacker to not bother of intercepting other sites directly.

Not a vulnerability, not a fix.
