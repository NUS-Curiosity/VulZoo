How can I activate a USB keyboard (the only input device attached to the
system), with the USB keyboard that I plugged into it?

Fun times...

Again, fix the real problem here, if there is one, don't try to throw
"is this device ok to use" dialogs up, they just annoy people and don't
do anything.

Oh, and if you want, you can disable all USB devices on your Linux
system by default, and only "authorize" them explicitly if you
programatically think they should be enabled.  We have had support in
the kernel for that for years now, but very few people actually use it.

So the tools to do this are already there, why aren't you using them? :)
