On the contrary, it's trivial to do on a whole bunch of USB devices as
that is how they were _designed_ to work.  So much so that there is a
whole USB spec on exactly how to do this in a way that will work across
all different operating systems:
	http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/DFU_1.1.pdf
I don't remember when the 1.0 version of this spec was published, I
think around 1995 or so.

So I really don't see how this ability is anything "shocking" to anyone.

Never trust hardware.  Until you have to.  :)
