  Yes, a product with an affected JSONP endpoint can have its own
  individual CVE ID. It is also possible that the vendor of a
  JSONP endpoint has determined that a successful attack is entirely
  the fault of the SWF parser, and does not want to have a CVE ID.
  This might, hypothetically, occur if the JSONP response from a
  product is always noncompliant SWF data, but some SWF parsers accept
  it anyway. ]

Use CVE-2014-5242.

Use CVE-2014-5243.
