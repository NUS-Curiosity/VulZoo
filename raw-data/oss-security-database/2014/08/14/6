Subject: Re: CVE Request: ro bind mount bypass using user namespaces

just wanted to mention that the test script was also submitted in this
commit
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git/commit/?h=for-linus&id=db181ce011e3c033328608299cd6fac06ea50130

On Ubuntu 14.04.1, mounting with MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND (within a user
namespace) resets nosuid, nodev, noexec flags.
