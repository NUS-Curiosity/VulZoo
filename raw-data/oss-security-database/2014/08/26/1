Here, slandelle, representing the vendor, appears to mostly confirm
the original discovery (the "would stop working with self-signed
certificates" objection seems to have been dropped based on
clarification from the discoverer). The primary issue seems to be the
one mentioned in the
https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/352#issuecomment-21795006
comment -- specifically, the code's decision on whether to verify
server certificates depends on unusual circumstances that might occur,
for example, if HTTPS communication also uses client certificates.
This decision process apparently has no relationship to the design
objectives of the async-http-client product.

Use CVE-2013-7397 for this issue involving an unexpected/improper
decision process.

There is no CVE ID for the issue of whether the product should provide
a simple way to disable certificate verification, given that enabling
certificate verification is the default. The discoverer and vendor
disagree about this.


> 2. async-http-client: No SSL HostName verification
> https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/197

Here,
https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/197#issuecomment-21760413
mentions two closely related code problems. Better URLs for these are:

  https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/blob/a12093438aa28e559c30cbbf1c7162f7d468fa2b/api/src/main/java/org/asynchttpclient/AsyncHttpClientConfigBean.java#L69
  https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/blob/ff2d6b3b6776f1c15dd0e94e8d630ebfd868a0b0/api/src/main/java/org/asynchttpclient/AsyncHttpClientConfig.java#L619

Also, jfarcand, representing the vendor, did an
https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/commit/3c9152e2c75f7e8b654beec40383748a14c6b51b
merge for "Fix for #197 -- use a hostname verifier that does hostname
verification." Use CVE-2013-7398 for this issue.
