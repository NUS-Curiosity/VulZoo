    isofs: Fix unbounded recursion when processing relocated directories

    We did not check relocated directory in any way when processing Rock
    Ridge 'CL' tag. Thus a corrupted isofs image can possibly have a CL
    entry pointing to another CL entry leading to possibly unbounded
    recursion in kernel code and thus stack overflow or deadlocks (if there
    is a loop created from CL entries).

    Fix the problem by not allowing CL entry to point to a directory entry
    with CL entry (such use makes no good sense anyway) and by checking
    whether CL entry doesn't point to itself.

This still needs a CVE.

Ciao, Marcus
