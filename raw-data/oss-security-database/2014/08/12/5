Subject: CVE id request: cacti remote code execution and SQL injection

Hi,
Mischa Sall√© and Wilco Baan Hofman reported a security issue in cacti to 
Debian when processing arguments passed to the graph settings script:
http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=7454

We consider this issue to be public given the public fix.
Can someone assign a CVE id? We do have some indication that this was reported 
in parallel Fedora, in case anyone from RedHat already assigned a CVE id to 
this.

Thanks!
Nico
