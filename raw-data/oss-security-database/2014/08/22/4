Subject: FYI, change to Secunia vuln db EULA


FYI, Secunia has clarified what they mean by “commercial use” in a 
revised EULA.  In short, only “students, the press (if the use is for 
media coverage), private persons and hobby researchers” can 
use/view/access Secunia vulnerability data.

Non-profit organizations, private companies, and public authorities and 
entities are NOT allowed to access or use any Secunia data, for any reason.

The revised EULA can be found here:
http://secunia.com/community/profile/
under the “Create Profile” tab.

You may wish to review their EULA to ensure that you're in compliance.

Regards,
Ken
