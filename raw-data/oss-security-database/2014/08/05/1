I think your understanding of the current state of MD5 collision attacks is out
of date.  Chosen prefix attacks are possible.  See:
http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/ChosenPrefixCollisions/

The MD5 hash is created off the data in the following format:
<$URL> $REALM

An attacker trying to take advantage of this only needs the $URL portion to
match their server.  The $REALM can then be whatever data is required to make
the MD5 hash match the system they are trying to attack.

I know of nobody that has taken the time to generate a MD5 collision to take
advantage of this.  But I'm pretty sure that it could be done.
