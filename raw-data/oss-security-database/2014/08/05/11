I think this issue is mis-named. "The ISO C++ 2011 regex library" is a
specfication, not an implementation, and a vulnerability in it would
be a fundamental flaw in the API design (analogous to gets in C). It
seems like this CVE request is for one or more GCC/libstdc++ bugs, and
it should be identified as such.
