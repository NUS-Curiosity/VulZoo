Subject: CVE Request: Plack::App::File does not prune trailing slashes:
 possible code exposure / information disclosure

Hi

Plack 1.0031 contains the following Changes entry[1]:

    [SECURITY]
        - Plack::App::File would previously strip trailing slashes off
          provided paths. This in combination with the common pattern
          of serving files with Plack::Middleware::Static could allow
          an attacker to bypass a whitelist of generated files (avar) #446

See [2,3] for more details about this issue, which might lead to
information disclosure.

 [2] https://github.com/plack/Plack/issues/405
 [3] https://github.com/plack/Plack/pull/446

Can a CVE be assigned for this isssue (as an example, CVE-2013-7329
was previously also assigned for CGI::Application).

Regards,
Salvatore
