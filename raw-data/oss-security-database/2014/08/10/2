Subject: Re: CVE request: issues in ISO C++ 2011 regex library

Not taking into account the vulnerabilities prior to gcc 4.9.1, one
CVE can be considered reasonable assignment CVE for a missing
implementation of error_stack error_space and error_complexity. Lack
of protection against resource exhaustion in official release, will
lead to situations like in glibc.

proftpd glibc remote denial of service exploit

There is many vendors what uses remotely RE.
