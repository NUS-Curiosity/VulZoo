Simple: If we go with Open Source only then "is the code available under
an approved license"?

http://opensource.org/licenses

Obviously if there needs to be an exception (e.g. a closed source/poorly
licensed source interacts significantly with something Open Source it
might be worth discussing).

The other aspect of this: in my experience the majority of closed source
vendors just don't care about security. So discussing it, especially
without their input/even being aware of it is quite pointless.
