Subject: Amended Patches for CVE-2014-3483 for Rails 4.x

The original patches introduced a regression on the PostgreSQL Range
feature. This regression was only introduced to Rails 4.x. Rails 3.2 users
are not impacted.

I'm including a new version of the patches and an incremental version that
can be applied atop the previous patches.

* 4-1-postgres-sqli-amended.patch - Amended Patch for 4.1.2.
* 4-0-postgres-sqli-amended.patch - Amended Patch for 4.0.6.
* 4-1-postgres-sqli-incremental.patch - Incremental Patch for 4.1.3.
* 4-0-postgres-sqli-incremental.patch - Incremental Patch for 4.0.7.
