Kurt, please always include (at least one-sentence) CVE descriptions in
your postings.  Not everyone is into CVEs as much as you are, and not
everyone will bother visiting URLs for an issue that is only potentially
relevant to them.  In this case, it's "file: extensive backtracking in
awk rule regular expression".

Thanks,

Alexander
