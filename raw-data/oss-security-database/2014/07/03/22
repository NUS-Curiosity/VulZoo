No because there is no trust boundary violation. If the root user is
logged in at a terminal executing command as root, that's fine. If a
non root user who is not authorized (e.g. via sudo or a setuid
program) is logged in and executing stuff as root, that's a trust
boundary violation.

In this case it's pretty simple: the back end web servers are NOT
supposed to be able to shut down the varnish cache server (if this was
supposed to happen you'd have built a proper channel to do so). That
they can do so means it is a denial of service, and therefore a trust
boundary violation. Ergo it needs a CVE.
