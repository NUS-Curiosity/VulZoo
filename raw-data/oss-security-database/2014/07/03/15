Subject: Possible CVE request: php5: phpinfo() Type Confusion Information
 Leak Vulnerability

Hi

Recent PHP updates mention bug #67498 in their changes[1,2]: Fixed bug
#67498 (phpinfo() Type Confusion Information Leak Vulnerability).

Upstream bug is at [3], which does not seem to have a CVE assigned.
(If so, could one be assigned?).

Thanks in advance,
