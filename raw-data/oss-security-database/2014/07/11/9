We are not sure of the best way to interpret statements such as

> possible for a remote user to inject commands into the shell via

> data is user supplied.

At this level, one question might be: is it possible that this Gem
wasn't ever intended to be used in the context of a Rails application?
(This question may also apply to some other recent CVE requests.)

At a slightly higher level:

http://rubygems.org/gems/kompanee-recipes says "These are the common
recipes we've been using here at The Kompanee." It seems unclear
whether this is really intended to have widespread use as-is except by
thekompanee.com insiders. For example, parts of it seem highly
site-specific such as lib/kompanee-recipes/bash.rb "This will install
a more secure SSH environment ... it will ... change the default
port ... ln -fs /usr/share/kompanee-common/ssh/sshd_config
/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or lib/kompanee-recipes/environment.rb 'Sets
intelligent defaults for Kompanee Rackspace deployments ... :domain,
"thekompanee.com" ... :server_ip, "174.143.212.245" ... Most of these
values can be overridden in each application's deploy.rb file.
Unfortunately some of them can't be such as :scm but they're our
recipies so... LIVE WITH IT.'

In general, code can be publicly distributed but, realistically,
site-specific. It would perhaps be reasonable to decline to assign CVE
IDs for anything in kompanee-recipes because the entire Gem is
arguably being published as example code that could be adapted by
other organizations, not as a general-use product.
