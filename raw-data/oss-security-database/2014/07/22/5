There should also be a discrepancy regarding when the credentials are 
captured (time of send for SOCK_PASSCRED, time of socket creation for 
SO_PEERCRED).  The latter is required because privileged processes 
assume that they can safely write to stderr, so picking the current 
process credentials may well introduce vulnerabilities.
