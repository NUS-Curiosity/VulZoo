Subject: GLPI: unprivileged users can access cost information

Hi,

A bug has been identified by Simone Imeri in GLPI where a user without
access to cost information can in fact see the information when
selecting cost as a search criteria[1]. This is fixed by commit [2]
which appears to have been included for version  0.84.7 [3].

I believe this should get a CVE id.
