If anyone has found that the patch fixes an additional attack vector
(if that vector crosses privilege boundaries), then we could assign an
additional CVE ID for the discovery by paulgevers. For example, there
is not yet any report stating that the patch to user_admin.php
resolves an issue that crosses privilege boundaries.
