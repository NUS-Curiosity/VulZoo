Subject: Linux peer_cred Mischmasch

Hi

There seem to be some inconsistencies in the handling of peer credentials
on UNIX sockets. I checked kernel 3.15.1 and runtime-tested on a 3.11.10.

While maybe_add_creds() (via SOCK_PASSCRED) and scm_send()
(via unix_{stream,dgram}_sendmsg()) use the real UID,

cred_to_ucred() (via SO_PEERCRED) passes the EUID (this time
also kuid_munged()).

That should probably being consolidated and in particular its unclear
to me why one time you need kuid munging and onother time you dont.


Sebastian
