Subject: X.Org intel driver dev snapshots, backlight helper issue

Hi,

FYI: http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-commit/2014-July/036840.html

The issue was reported by Adam Sampson.

xf86_video_intel_backlight_helper will be installed setuid and lacked
basic input sanity validation.

it is not part of any  release xf86-video-intel (only beta versions
have it). It was added in the 2.99.911 develepment snapshot.
