That's probably unrelated change / regression in the Ruby bug tracker.

Checking some other random bug report, when logged in using a
completely unprivileged account, I see:
- revision strings (rXXXX) are clickable links pointing to URLs as above
- actual revisions / diff are accessible

While doing the same while not logged in:
- revision strings (rXXXX) are not turned to links
- revision / diff pages redirect to login

Anyway, you can view the above commit / diff via:
http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=46778
