Subject: CVE Request: tboot failing to measure commandline parameters

Hi,

The trusted boot loader module "tboot" did not measure all commandline parameters,
which made it possible to pretend a measured boot while there was workaround
possibility (breaking the measured boot chain).

All previous tboot versions < 1.8.2 are affected.

A CVE is needed I think.

Ciao, Marcus
