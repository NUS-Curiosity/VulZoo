Subject: Subscribtion request to linux-distros

Greetings,

our friends from SuSE suggested that it might make sense that
I in my role as maintainer for Linux on System z (alias s390)
get added to the linux-distros mailing list.
If you agree that this indeed makes sense could you subscribe
me please?
