Subject: CVE-Request: KAuth authentication bypass

Hi

We'd like to request a CVE for the following issue:

The polkit authentication backend in KDE's KAuth code
used the UnixProcess subject for authenticating actions.
This is subject to race conditions and allows local users
to elevate their privileges by bypassing any of the KAuth checks.
A followup of CVE-2013-4288.

Discussion and patch can be found here:

Sebastian
