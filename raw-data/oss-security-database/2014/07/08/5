"CentOS 6, RHEL 6, CL 6 & OpenVZ can now be patched against
CVE-2014-4699. The patched kernels are yet to be available from the
vendors. Yet, due to the nature of the issue, we wanted to release the
patch as soon as possible"

Just tracking how quickly distros patch a critical issue for which
there's no published exploit yet.
