Subject: Status of CVE-2012-4542/Linux?

Hi,
I'm wondering on the status of CVE-2012-4542 in the mainline Linux kernel:

The patches referenced in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4542
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/1/24/279) haven't been merged,
so I'm wondering whether this is fixed upstream in a different manner
or still unfixed?

Cheers,
        Moritz
