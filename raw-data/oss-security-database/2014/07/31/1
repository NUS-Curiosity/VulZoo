We've since learned that nobody ever assigned CVE-2014-2970 to that
LibreSSL issue, and apparently every appearance of CVE-2014-2970 in "a
number of web pages" was ultimately the result of a miscommunication
outside of MITRE.

A complication is that CVE-2014-2970 had been assigned to a different
issue, and that issue isn't yet public. What you should do is:

  - if you're part of the embargo audience that has been using
    CVE-2014-2970 for a private vulnerability, use CVE-2014-5139
    instead

  - if you're not part of that embargo audience, all we can suggest is
    that it's very likely that you'll see a public disclosure of
    CVE-2014-5139 in the future

Also:

  - MITRE is not part of the embargo audience and does not know what
    the CVE-2014-5139 vulnerability is

  - MITRE has separately communicated the CVE ID change to the
    organization that originally assigned CVE-2014-2970

Soon, the MITRE CVE web site will have this for CVE-2014-2970:

  ** REJECT **

  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2014-5139.  Reason:
  This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2014-5139, and has also been used
  to refer to an unrelated topic that is currently outside the scope of
  CVE.  This unrelated topic is a LibreSSL code change adding
  functionality for certain process-bifurcation use cases that might
  arise in future LibreSSL-based applications.  There is no CVE ID
  associated with this LibreSSL code change.  As of 20140730,
  CVE-2014-5139 is an undisclosed vulnerability in a different product,
  with ongoing vulnerability coordination that had previously used the
  CVE-2014-2970 ID.


The MITRE CVE web site entry for CVE-2014-5139 will have the details
of the issue after the public disclosure happens.
