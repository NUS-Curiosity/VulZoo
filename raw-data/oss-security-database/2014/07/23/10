Subject: CVE request: kernel: vfs: refcount issues during unmount on symlink

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1122472
"
A flaw was found in the way reference counting was handled in the Linux kernel's
VFS subsystem when unmount on symlink was performed.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 an unprivileged local user could use this flaw to
cause OOM conditions leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger
use-after-free error.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 a privileged local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability (also in a container) could use this flaw to cause OOM conditions
leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger use-after-free error.

Acknowledgements:
Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin of Parallels for reporting this issue.
