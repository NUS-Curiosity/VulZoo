This policy is presumably trying to stop the problem where lists receive
notification from 20 OS distributions that they have updated some common
package like PHP.

Personally I'm happy to see vendor-specific advisories for some problems
that just affect that vendor (but not the advisories for other problems
common to many vendors), but think that it needs to be a manual selective
process rather than just as another place where the advisories are CC'd.
