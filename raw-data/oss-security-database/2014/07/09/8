No, I do not.

If DNS is spoofed, then DNS is spoofed and anything which uses DNS
is vulnerable, but it is not a security vulnerability in every
single piece of software that might conceiveably use DNS lookups,
it is a vulnerability in DNS which we have known about since DNS
came about.

If the so-called "security industry" wants to be taken seriously,
it has to stop this kind of nonsense.

It seems that the primary thing a CVE assignment will cause is for
somebody to make another notch in his bedpost.

I also have no idea what "out-of-band patches", nor for that matter
which "distros" you are talking about here.

Do you ?

If so I'd like to hear about them, because as I said as the very first thing:
We fix bugs in Varnish, and I'd like to receive a copy of those patches.
