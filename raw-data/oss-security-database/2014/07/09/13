> While working with an AWS sample I hit a segmentation fault.  The same sample works under 1.9.3.  It appeared to be coming from pack.c function encodes.  After looking at the source there's a 4K buffer allocated on the stack.  I made a minor change to base the buffer length off of the incoming buffer length with a pad and allocate it off the heap.  Anyway, after fixing this my code sample runs fine.  I'm including a patch file and the sample code.
