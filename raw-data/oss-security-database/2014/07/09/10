I'm sorry, but I'm still relatively new to this list, so forgive
me my questioning:

I see lots of "vendor specific" advisories here. So my guess
is that "vendor" means "a vendor who bundles software into
a linux/bsd/whatever distribution"?

Because I would consider vulnerabilities in php, curl
pnp4nagios (just picked as fresh examples) also as
"vendor specific", as they are maintained by one
vendor/project and those vulnerabilities don't occur
in different tools or language implementations.

What I would not consider "vendor specific"
are issues inside algorithms or reference implementations
of algorithms which are incorporated
into different software projects (vendors) like
the recent LZ4 and LZO vulns.

Could you clarify this policy maybe a bit?

I find it quite useful to have a dedicated list
collecting these reports, and also freebsd ones
even if just freebsd is affected.

Lists like full disclosure create way more noise
and are thus less useful.

Thanks in advance.
