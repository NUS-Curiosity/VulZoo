Maybe it's just me, but I find the above ambiguous.

What exactly do you mean by "crash" and "panic" above?  How do you know
it's a double fault?  What appears in dmesg on the first system, and
what on the second system?  What's the value of the kernel.panic_on_oops
sysctl, and is it the same on both systems?

Thanks,
