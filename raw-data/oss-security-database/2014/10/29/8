It could be because they're hosted at Security Focus, whose mailserver 
could best be described as erratic.  It doesn't like long banners or greet 
pauses (both anti-spammer defences) and retries frequently, as if that 
will make any difference.  I'm told that this is a "feature" of Qmail 
(along with its other antisocial habits).

Oddly enough, I do receive the occasional BugTraq message, so sometimes it 
works, hence my description of them being erratic.  For example, this one 
worked:

Received: from sf01smtp2.securityfocus.com (smtp.securityfocus.com [143.127.139.113])

yet these failed miserably:

Oct 30 09:46:20 aneurin sm-mta[79426]: s9TMhmHs079426: smtp.securityfocus.com [143.127.139.113] did not issue MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection to IPv4
Oct 30 09:46:30 aneurin sm-mta[79427]: s9TMhv1H079427: smtp.securityfocus.com [143.127.139.113] did not issue MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection to IPv4

Feedback to list owner, abuse, and postmaster go implacably unanswered.
