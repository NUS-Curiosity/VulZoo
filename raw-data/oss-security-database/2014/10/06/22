I doubt that (or more realistically, I hope it's not true).  Even the 
1996 edition of “Practical UNIX and Internet Security” mentions that you 
have to reset IFS as well (a significant omission if “at” does something 
even if it hasn't received any parameters).  The authors also point out 
that putenv and setenv may only replace the first occurrence of an 
environment variable in the environ array, while the system shell could 
well pick up the last occurrence.
