Subject: Who named shellshock?

Who created the name "shellshock"?  And when?

I can't seem to find anything:
* St√©phane Chazelas proposed "bashdoor" on 2014-09-14 14:29:48 +0100, but this did not catch on. (http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/92).
* Robert Graham (Errata Softwre) posted "Update: I think people are calling this the "shellshock" bug. Still looking for official logo" ( http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/09/bash-bug-as-big-as-heartbleed.html ).  This wording suggests that is reporting what OTHERS call it, and not a name he gave himself.
* Andreas Lindh tweeted a proposed image for "shellshock, but this was in response to Robert Graham's "official logo" request - so this is DEFINITELY not the source of the name. (Tweet at: https://twitter.com/addelindh/status/514840916692324352 )

Suggestions?
