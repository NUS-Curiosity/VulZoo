On the moderated crypto list where I hang out, it's receiving much 
attention.  The consensus is that it's likely a buggy compiler or 
optimiser that rounded integer division upwards instead of truncating it 
as required by the C standard, and that the "discoverer", by refusing to 
provide further details, is full of it.

You may be able to search the archives at cryptography@...zdowd.com; as I 
said it's a moderated list, but full of techie people who really know 
their onions.
