Possibly. I've been having my posts to the list dropped for many
months, unable to get ahold of anyone who could fix or diagnose the
problem. I eventually figured out that cross-posting to BUGTRAQ and
F-D causes the posts to end up in their spam folder. If that's true
for everybody, that's hilarious.

But even if I don't cross-post, it usually takes 3+ days for things to
go through, and the number of bounces you get in response is the worst
I've ever seen on the list.
