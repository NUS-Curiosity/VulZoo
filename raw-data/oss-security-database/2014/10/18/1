The mitre.org description is:

The pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel
through 3.17 does not properly interact with certain locations of a
chroot directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(mount-tree loop) via . (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root
system call.

This is a bit misleading.  Passing "." to both arguments of the
pivot_root system call is a perfectly fine (albeit brain-bending) thing
to do.

The bug was that, if either argument to pivot_root referred to a
directory outside of the calling processes's chroot, then pivot_root
would malfunction, corrupting the mount tree.
