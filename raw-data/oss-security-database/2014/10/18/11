Dears,

TYPO3 CMS Core already provides such update check. This is either triggered
manually or automatically on regular bases (cron like).

This works by retrieving a complete dataset of available third-party plugins
and their versions from typo3.org infrastructure. Then a TYPO3 CMS installation
on its own determines whether an update is available. So the only information
is the request for such dataset file (exposing remote IP address).

An update check in an extension is unnecessary and not an expected behaviour;
especially when it reports additional environment data and communicates with 
third-party infrastructure.

Marcus Krause.
