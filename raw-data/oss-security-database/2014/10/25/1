Yeah, `strings -a` is closer to what people expect by default - most
people find the section parsing a surprise. I found this one 10 years
ago https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91398, and suggested at
the time that maybe `strings -a` should be the default mode, enabling
bfd parsing only when requested.

This was dismissed by upstream, but I still think it's a good idea...
