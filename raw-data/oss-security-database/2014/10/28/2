Then perhaps just remove it? It always seemed to me a strange 
restriction. Other guidelines are either technical in nature or they are 
intended to reduce the amount of noise. This restriction seems to be 
neither.

Of you can replace it with something like this:
- Please only send fully working exploits which themselves are open-source.
