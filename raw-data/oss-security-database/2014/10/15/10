What seems to get lost is this part of Mozilla's announcement:

“This relies on a behavior of browsers called insecure fallback, where 
browsers attempt to negotiate lower versions of TLS or SSL when 
connections fail.”

<https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/10/14/the-poodle-attack-and-the-end-of-ssl-3-0/>

As far as I can tell, the TLS downgrade protection mechanism work. 
However, browsers have an out-of-protocol, unprotected downgrade 
mechanism to SSL 3.0.  (The Firefox function is called 
“retryDueToTLSIntolerance”.)  I think we would be better off disabling 
*that* mechanism (for which configuration knob seems to exist, alas), 
instead of disabling SSL 3.0 or adding a different protocol version 
probing mechanism.

 From what I can tell, applications which simply use one the usual TLS 
implementations and do not implement their own protocol downgrade are 
still secure even if both ends implement SSL 3.0 support because the 
version numbers are protected by the handshake hash and the TLS 
implementation will never negotiate use of the SSL 3.0 protocol version.
