Subject: RE: Truly scary SSL 3.0 vuln to be revealed soon:

Thanks Hanno,

A reflection: Maybe we shouldn't post  information like this here or somewhere else which is not published yet even if the information has leak out? Although all members here are reliable but it is still an open mailing list and we should be careful and act more responsible. 

Cheers
Sona
