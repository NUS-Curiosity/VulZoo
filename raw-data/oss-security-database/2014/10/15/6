Hi,

For "standard" IT people, this was kind of a good thing actually.
Without knowing anything about the vulnerability itself, you were at
least aware that something totally wrong was coming with SSLv3. So, it
was letting a few hours to disable (for instance) SSLv3 on the
infrastructure (or to check it had been properly done a while ago)
before the issue comes out publicly with all the details and
eventually PoC to exploit it.
That's kind of great opportunity to make sure we're safe before it
gets wrong.

Just my 2 cents.
