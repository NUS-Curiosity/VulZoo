Hi Pierre.

For modern block ciphers (e.g. AES, or even 3DES), known-plaintext 
attacks still generally require the entire keyspace to be brute-forced, 
which is not practical using the technology available today.

Think about the Adobe credential breach. There are many thousands of 
known plaintext + ciphertext pairs there (the same 3DES key was used to 
encrypt all of the passwords, and the passwords for many users were able 
to be recovered based on a combination of ECB-mode encryption + 
plaintext password hints), but the actual key was never recovered even 
with all of that data to work with.
