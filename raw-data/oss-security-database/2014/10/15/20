No.
If you could brute force the key then this would indicate a completely
broken ciphersuite.
We're usually talking about AES or 3DES here. These are considered
reasonably safe.

You only get the cookie. The reason this matters is that cookies often
contain a secure token that is used to indicate the session. So you can
takeover a session e.g. for a mailaccount.
