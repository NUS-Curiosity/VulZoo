Are you saying that as a reflection on your part?

By the time you posted this morning, Twitter was already aflame with
rumors and news orgs were already starting to post them (again, all
unproven at the time), so I think it's perfectly reasonable to post here
to see what others have heard (if they aren't embargoed).

If you're talking about Hanno's reply, then by the time he posted, the
embargo was already lifted, and those were the official links to the
issue and to the associated paper.
