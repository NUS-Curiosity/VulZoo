Subject: RE: more bash parser bugs (CVE-2014-6277,
 CVE-2014-6278)

Hi,

What URL do I point to see the security bugs listed by CVE for CVE for bash43-25 through -28?

I didn't see it in the patches themselves - ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/bash-4.3-patches 

Sorry, I am new to bash culture,

My mistake, it's 7186/7187.  There are fixes for both in one patch.  The fix for the off-by-one error is not obvious, but it's in there in the third chunk.
