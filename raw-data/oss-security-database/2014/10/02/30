Thanks Michal,

According to shellshock  test (https://shellshocker.net/shellshock_test.sh) 
Florian's patch (Gnu patch bash43-027)  and all other GNU patches (bash43-025 , 
bash43-026   & bash43-027 ) seems to have solved all so far known shellshock  
vulnerabilities.  

root@...uarm:~# ./shellshock_test.sh
CVE-2014-6271 (original shellshock): not vulnerable bash: shellshocker: command not found
CVE-2014-6278 (Florian's patch): not vulnerable
CVE-2014-7169 (taviso bug): not vulnerable
CVE-2014-//// (exploit 3 on http://shellshocker.net/): not vulnerable
CVE-2014-7186 (redir_stack bug): not vulnerable
CVE-2014-7187 (nested loops off by one): not vulnerable

I guess CVE-2014-//// in the "shellshock_test.sh" should be CVE-2014-6277, right?

Thanks
