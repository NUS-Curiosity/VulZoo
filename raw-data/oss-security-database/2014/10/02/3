Eric - you probably want to CC: Chet on your new findings.  Added the CC.

Structures started in the name such as comments, quoted strings, etc. are allowed to continue into the body. Some of the existing safety checks stop the obvious attacks, but things like this can still get through.

The function importer can then call bash-simple-parse and extract a function definition, knowing that nothing other than a function definition (not even the name) will be returned. That result can then be bound to the name provided, directly in the variable setup function without ever invoking the general parser.
