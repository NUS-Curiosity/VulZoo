A moderator approved the above posting in error.  Normally, we just
unsubscribe people who happen to ask for that in an attempted posting
(instead of unsubscribing themselves via the list robot), and then we
reject messages like the above.  There are not a lot of requests like
this, but it does happen once in a while.

However, let me use this opportunity to inform any others wishing to
unsubscribe that we have instructions on doing so here:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security/unsubscribe

And in case anyone reads this in the list archives on the web and wants
to subscribe, those instructions are here:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/subscribe

Actually, we simply run ezmlm-idx, so its usual commands work, and
instructions are also included in the "welcome" message that the list
sends when one subscribes.  The web pages above are just extras.
