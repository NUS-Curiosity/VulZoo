The "class of problems" here is imho that we have a bunch of tools that
get rare attention from anyone, are run by few volunteers, but they're
an essential part in running the Internet.

Just think about busybox, curl, wget, coreutils, gettext, gzip, ... - a
vuln in any of these could have severe consequences.

Maybe the topic here should be: "How can we get the (whitehat) IT
seucrity community to have a deeper look at neglected but important
opensource projects."
