Subject: CVE Request: linux kernel net_get_random_once bug


My colleague Tom O'Connor and I have identified a security bug in the
Linux kernel that results in drastically degraded randomness of IP IDs,
TCP sequence numbers, and ephemeral port numbers on affected systems.
The bug existed in kernel versions 3.13 and 3.14.  We are posting here
rather than to the private "distros" list because the bug has already
been fixed.  However, we don't think that the security implications of
the bug have been acknowledged anywhere, and we think it needs a CVE.  A
full write-up on the bug is posted at
http://secondlookforensics.com/ngro-linux-kernel-bug/.
