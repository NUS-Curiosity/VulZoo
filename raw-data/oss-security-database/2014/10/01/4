Heartbleed brought in a new era in vulnerability releases. But that's another topic for another day...

I'm sure that there are many other things just like this, and now everybody will be looking for the next "shellshock" in places where nobody has looked before. It's very difficult sometimes to know who to reach to. As far as I can tell oss-security is really more focused on how to get found vulnerabilities to the world in some sort of organized fashion, which is it does well (please correct me if I'm wrong here) but it seems very easy to stray off topic. 

As far as I can tell, oss-security has turned out to be a focal point for
requesting CVE identifiers, but AFAIK the topic is broader than that;
anything regarding security in open source software is on-topic.  See
the description: http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security
