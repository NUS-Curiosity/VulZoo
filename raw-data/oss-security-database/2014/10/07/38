So for example the
http://boingboing.net/2014/10/07/adobe-ebook-drm-secretly-build.html
article would indicate to me that this is CVE worthy under #4 for
example. I also assume that "makes no statement" means the company
actually has to make it easily viewed/available, e.g. not buried in some
huge 60 screen long EULA/TOS, or in some random source code file ("# and
here is where we send information back").
