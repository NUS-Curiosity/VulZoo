I assumed you leaned towards steps like expanding private lists versus
more rapid engagement of the broader community. As you say, you use
"arguably" so it would help if you'd clarify your position more
explicitely.

That's a fact of life: resources are constrained. The question isn't
whether there are 24 hours in the day but whether the overall good was
being maximized in an embargo framework or not.

In this case was embargo under-used? over-used? just right? I don't know
but one way to arrive at an answer is to consider things empirically.
How did the process evolve in practice? Did things improve (by various
metrics) post disclosure, or not, etc.

I added Chet because I was thanking him for his efforts and because he
has a unique perspective: how was working with the community and how did
things change for him, as upstream, pre and post disclosure. Thanks for
adding the link to the full message but I wasn't intentionally trying to
filter context.
