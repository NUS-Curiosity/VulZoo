Thanks!

This certainly sounds bad, but what matters most is whether any info on
the bug got to an unintended party before 2014-09-24 14:00 UTC or not.
The name bashdoor.com itself does not leak any vulnerability details,
nor that there was in fact a bash vulnerability coming.  This does
suggest that someone wasn't 100% busy using the then non-public info for
its intended purpose, but it does not indicate they violated the trust
of whoever disclosed the info to them (except possibly by cybersquatting
the domain), nor put bash users at any additional risk.
