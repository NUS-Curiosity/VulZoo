I've noticed that OpenBSD developers tend to be very careful when
introducing new features. Typically, a commit for a new feature is
reviewed by a senior developer for possible security problems.

Before code is committed, it is posted on a public mailing list where
the diff is peer-reviewed. IMHO, this is what makes OpenBSD stand out
from other projects: systematic peer-review of patches by people who
analyse it from the security angle, and a developer tree that always
compile.
