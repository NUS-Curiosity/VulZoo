Subject: Re: Discussion: information leakage from server and client software - CVE/hardening/other?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The main cases in which a CVE could exist are:

1. The author of the software states that the information-leakage
behavior was a violation of the product's security policy.

2. The information-leakage behavior directly contradicts the product's
documentation stating that the specific information leakage doesn't
occur.

3. The author of the software makes no statement, but all (or nearly
all) similar products follow a standard practice in which the
information-leakage behavior doesn't occur. For example: common web
browsers don't send a file: URL in a Referer header.

4. The author of the software makes no statement, and disclosing the
information results in no benefit to the user, and the information
would not be useful to the vendor in further developing the product or
complying with restrictions on the data that the vendor offers in
conjunction with the product.
