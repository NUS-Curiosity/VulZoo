Possibly, but it probably wouldn't have stayed that way for long. Even
though the bug was introduced long before the arrival of Apache, I
would guess that it had affected Sendmail from day one.

In practice, it's usually counterproductive to try to precisely pin
the blame; bash is the place where we can fix it more easily and
produce more intuitive behavior with one less things for other
developers to worry about it.
