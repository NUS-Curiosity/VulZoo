It is not only possible, I have already posted a list of ways to find Heartbleed:
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html

I think identifying specific ways to counter classes of vulnerabilities is really important.

I am still struggling with this one.  I am trying to create that list here:
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/shellshock.html#detect-or-prevent

But to be honest, that list is pretty pathetic. This is a challenging class of vulnerability to detect or prevent ahead of time. Ideas would be very welcome.
