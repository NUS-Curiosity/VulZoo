In section 1.2, you mention that Florian suggested suffix additions; but
he was not alone in the suggestion; I also independently came up with
the idea (primarily because patch 25 included a change to a comment line
that mentioned the past attempt to use a suffix):

My arguments at the time were based more on namespace pollution
considerations (what happens when a function name and variable name
collide), and it wasn't until later that I learned that the oss-security
list was discussing ramifications of the fact that ANY parser bug is a
major hole if untrusted user data is unconditionally presented to the
parser, without regards to namespace pollution.
