Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Nova

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Nova VMware instance in resize state may leak
Reporter: Zhu Zhu (IBM)
Products: Nova
Versions: up to 2014.1.3

Description:
Zhu Zhu from IBM reported a vulnerability in Nova VMware driver. If an
authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it
will cause the original instance to not be deleted. An attacker can use
this to launch a denial of service attack. All Nova VMware setups are
affected.
