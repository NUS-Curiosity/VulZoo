Sure, but at least with Haskell (and the like) you have to make it very
explicit that this is what you want to do. A lot of our problems seem to come
from the mixing happening by accident.

Right. Which is why it should be a little more work to do and require that it
be made explicit that the mixing is what is intended.

Educating developers will be equally hard as switching to safer languages but
at least it is something people will stomache getting started on.
