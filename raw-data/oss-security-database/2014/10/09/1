No.  At least not in the sense of totally separating data and code.
It's trivial to implement a language (say Lisp) inside Haskell,
and then hand data to that implementation to be executed.

That does not make Haskell *bad*; you can implement an interpreter
in any Turing-complete language.  And it's absurd to say "NEVER
mix data and code" - it's sometimes the right approach to use.
But mixing code with data is probably an *overused* approach,
given the risks that come with it.

We need to help developers know what is safe, and what is less safe.
Then they can avoid easily-avoided problems, and know when they have
extra work to do.
