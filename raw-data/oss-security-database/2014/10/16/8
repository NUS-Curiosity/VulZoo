The obvious solution being to whitelist your site (in the chrome/firefox
source code)if you truly care:

email agm@...omium.org asking to be added to the whitelist, from the
domain you want white listed (otherwise they tend to ignore it). Usually
within a few business days they'll add it to the source code, and then
in the next browser update they will update the list and you will now be
white listed.

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/+/trunk/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json

I've done this for my domains, you should too!
