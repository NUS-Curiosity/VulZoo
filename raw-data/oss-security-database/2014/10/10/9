If we're going to advocate for accessing keyservers via https (which i
think is a lovely idea, even if it doesn't mitigate all possible
attacks), it's worth advocating for the well-curated
hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net [0], rather than encouraging everyone to
flood either https://keybase.io or https://pgp.mit.edu with traffic.

I agree with David and Thijs that OpenPGP v3 keys are long overdue for
the chopping block.
