In cases of disputes about the validity of a vulnerability with
respect to a specific threat model, it's sometimes possible to have
multiple CVEs.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2013-2185 says:

> A remote attacker able to supply a serialized instance of the
> DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a server, could use
> this flaw to write arbitrary content ...
> 
> The Apache Tomcat team does not agree that this is a valid security

This suggests a completely general case in which the serialized
instance could come from an arbitrary untrusted source in an
application-specific way. Apparently, from the perspective of the
Apache Tomcat maintainer, they are not interested in recognizing the
completely general case as a vulnerability. Thus, from their
perspective, there are no affected versions.

The CVE-2013-4444 section of http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html
discusses a much more specific threat model. From the perspective of
the Apache Tomcat maintainer, this is recognized as a vulnerability
with the affected versions of 7.0.0 through 7.0.39.

Both parties apparently agree that changes such as:

 -public interface FileItem extends Serializable, FileItemHeadersSupport {
 +public interface FileItem extends FileItemHeadersSupport {

should have occurred. However, there isn't agreement on exactly what
is the motivation for making the change.
