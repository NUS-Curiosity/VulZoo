I think it does deserve a CVE, because it's an instance of CWE-125.
The problem is a max 11-byte out-of-bounds read on a heap-allocated
array. For debug builds this trips an assert in Qt (resulting in
denial of service), otherwise it's an information leak to the user of
Quassel (who may or may not be trusted).

Should a CVE be assigned, note that Quassel took the code (cipher.cpp)
from Konversation, and the same issue has been reported there [1].
