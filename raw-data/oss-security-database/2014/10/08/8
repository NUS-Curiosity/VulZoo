Subject: openssh on linux rce in sftp-only mode

This seems CVE-worthy:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Oct/35

Quote:
"OpenSSH lets you grant SFTP access to users without allowing full
command execution using "ForceCommand internal-sftp". However, if you
misconfigure the server and don't use ChrootDirectory, the user will be
able to access all parts of the filesystem that he has access to -
including procfs. On modern Linux kernels (>=2.6.39, I
think), /proc/self/maps reveals the memory layout and /proc/self/mem
lets you write to arbitrary memory positions. Combine those and you get
easy RCE."

It involves a number of issues coming together, however in the end it
is an RCE with a legit configuration.

Changelog:
http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.7
 * sftp-server(8): On platforms that support it, use prctl() to
   prevent sftp-server from accessing /proc/self/{mem,maps}
