I agree significant security benefit can be gained from these kinds of
approaches.  The trick is, convincing people to use such a language.  

Things like JavaScript and PHP are wildly popular because they are so
easy to get started with.  Minimal learning curve counts for a lot.
That, and rapid development of new functionality is king in business.
How can strongly typed functional language compete?
