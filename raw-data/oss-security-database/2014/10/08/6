Subject: CVE request  for VDSM denial of service

Gday,

The issue (outlined here https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1148688 ) allows
an attacker to hold open an ssl connection effectively denying new connections the
ability to complete any new ssl connections.

I would like a CVE number to assign to this issue.  Please assign me one.

Thanks,

Wade Mealing
