I agree with Kurt. I think there should be something along the lines
of "reasonable expectation of privacy" here. I admit that this is
subjective, but cases like the Adobe one are pretty clear. Even if
it's not 100% clear whether the vendor has a legitimate need for the
data (I would say they don't, but this is not the point right now),
random third parties with the ability to intercept unencrypted network
traffic certainly do not have a legitimate need for it. So at the very
least, I think any transmission of data where the user might have a
reasonable expectation that the data is "private", if it takes place
over a non-encrypted channel, is CVE-worthy.
