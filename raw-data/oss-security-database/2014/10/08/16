We do, but for public issues we prefer to ask here sometimes so as to
prevent duplicate assignments (e.g. it is possible for a race condition
to occur, Red Hat and Mitre both see something new, we see no CVE for it
so we both assign one).

I believe this one is
https://www.mail-archive.com/vdsm-patches@lists.fedorahosted.org/msg68420.html
(but don't quote me, wmealing is in .au and asleep so I can't confirm).
