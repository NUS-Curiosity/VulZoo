Subject: Re: Thoughts on Shellshock and beyond

All:

Given the feedback here and elsewhere, I've tried to distill how to detect or prevent shellshock-like things ahead-of-time.  My current try is here:

More ideas and refinements would be welcome.  I've also made a number of refinements (e.g., the timeline has more info, where the name came from has been identified, etc.).

Thanks again!
