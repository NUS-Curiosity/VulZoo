Subject: Re: Shellshock timeline (was: CVE-2014-6271: remote code execution
 through bash)

The ChangeLog
(http://www.oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bin/old/bash-1.05/ChangeLog)
and the usenet discussion that Eric unearthed
(https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gnu.bash.bug/72jXoIWYsfE/jJqC-fjSh0wJ)
and
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.unix.questions/LwsdchovzFY/qokUr2mfCboJ

Remove any doubt as to when the bug was introduced (August 1989,
released in 1.03) and how it was implemented from the start. The
code is very simple, it just replaces the = with a space in the
environment entry and interprets it.
