This is my script and I think what it does in the current version is
the reasonable thing to do:
It will first test if function importing old style is enabled and if
yes it will warn about that, if it is disabled or any of the prefixing
solutions is enabled then it will say so.

All further test outputs for all 6 CVEs depends on that. If the old
function import is enabled warnings will be shown in red, because then
people are in real danger. If function importing is disabled or
prefixed the warnings will look less scary and clearly state
"non-explitable".

I think this is reasonable. I regret that previous versions of my
script showed a  more scary output even if people weren't really in any
danger because prefixing was already enabled.It was even
referenced in a number of inaccurate media reports.
