Sona,

Oh, I didn't realize you actually are with a distro vendor:

"Enea Linux is a Yocto-based Linux distribution targeted for
communication and networking solutions."

Then you do in fact have a valid reason to test for and patch the
individual bugs even when they're no longer security relevant.  My
advice is that if you feel you're a "non-expert" in bash bugs, you
simply apply all bash upstream's patches, and keep adding them to your
package of bash as more upstream patches become available.  You do not
need to issue security advisories (or whatever you normally do when
fixing security vulnerabilities) each time: it's sufficient to do that
once, when you've just included the prefix/suffix patch (bash43-027 or
equivalent).  Once you have bash43-027, further patches to bash are no
different than e.g. the many patches that are issued for VIM (a project
that tends to release hundreds of post-release patches, most of them
non-security).

I hope this helps.

Alexander
