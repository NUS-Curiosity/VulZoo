The scope of CVE-2012-6636 is the following description of a specific
change made by a vendor in response to a vulnerability:

  On Android prior to API level 17, these interfaces are
  generically insecure. Malicious JavaScript executing inside
  WebView can use the Java reflection API to invoke any method
  of any Java object exposed via 'addJavascriptInterface' and
  take control over the local side of the application.
  Starting from Android API level 17, only the methods explicitly
  annotated with @JavascriptInterface are visible in the Java
  objects exposed to WebView via 'addJavascriptInterface'.

Our expectation is that a number of issues "rooted in
reliance on an incorrectly exposed Javascript bridge" could
have their own separate CVEs.

> You may have seen recently released Metasploit module that allows a
> remote compromise of the Google Glass browser using an incorrectly
> exposed Javascript bridge ...
> 
> If this issue should have the same CVE assignment, please ack.
> Otherwise, please assign a new CVE.

We'll send a separate message soon about this Google Glass CVE
request. We don't want to have CVE assignments for separately reported
issues in this thread.
