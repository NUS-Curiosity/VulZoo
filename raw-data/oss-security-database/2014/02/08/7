Use CVE-2014-1909 for this issue with incorrect use of an integer
value.

There is no CVE assignment for this. Here, "no authentication is
required" is probably best considered an opportunity for security
enhancement. (For example, there are many other applications that
provide other types of port forwarding in other contexts, and don't
implement authentication.)

There is currently no CVE assignment for this. Absense of these types
of protection mechanisms can have a CVE ID in some cases, but the CVE
project typically proceeds only in instances where an upstream vendor
chooses to make an announcement that this was a software mistake. An
example is CVE-2013-5057. A third-party report could be used in a
limited set of scenarios, e.g., a build process that has a list of
files requiring safe compilation options, with a typo in one of the
filenames. Similarly, if the available information is that the vendor
intentionally disabled this type of a protection mechanism, a CVE
assignment can't be made.
