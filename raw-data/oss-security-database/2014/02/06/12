Subject: CVE Request: Linux kernel: SELinux local DoS

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the NSA SELinux Support(CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX) is 
vulnerable to a crash caused by an empty SELinux security context. When a file 
has an empty security context, listing it via 'ls(1)' could trigger this 
crash. Only user/processes with CAP_MAC_ADMIN privileges are allowed to set 
the SELinux security context of a file.

A user/process with CAP_MAC_ADMIN privileges could use this flaw to crash the 
kernel, resulting in a DoS.

Upstream fix:
