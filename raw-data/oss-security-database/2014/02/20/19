I support this request.  Luckily, most of the time this is already the case.

I am a bit puzzled.  Are you possibly referring to the three Ruby
advisories posted on 2014/02/18?

If so, I doubt Aaron will notice your request - I think he's not
subscribed.  You might want to e-mail him privately, in case he intends
to post more advisories in the future.

Or maybe you were referring to Vincent's CVE request for
CGI::Application, which didn't mention Perl in the Subject line (but did
in the message body)?  This one actually looks OK with respect to your
request, since CGI::Application appears to be a product on its own (not
bundled with Perl).

I find no other examples of this problem "in the past few days",
although of course we've seen it numerous times before.
