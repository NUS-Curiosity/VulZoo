Otherwise MITRE attempts to use the best available information in
deciding whether "security improvement" is a better categorization.
Across all types of products and problems, the original author is
generally allowed to admit that they made a mistake when writing the
code in a certain way.

> So now SipHash is 'the only' way to avoid hash collision ever?

At present, introducing SipHash is a type of patch that's very likely
to be considered when a software maintainer is responding to
hash-collision problems. Certainly other patch approaches are
possible. Not all code originated with an implicit functional
specification that the code would do a good job at resisting all types
of intentional hash-collision attacks. So, in general, when a
description of a new attack is published, any resulting patches can be
considered security improvements.
