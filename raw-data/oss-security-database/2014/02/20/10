Subject: CVE Request: Linux kernel: s390: crash due to linkage stack
 instruction

    Hello,

Linux kernel built for the s390 architecture(CONFIG_S390) is vulnerable to a 
crash due to low-address protection exception. It occurs when an application 
uses a linkage stack instruction.

An unprivileged user/application could use this flaw to crash the system 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/8d7f6690cedb83456edd41c9bd583783f0703bf0
