Subject: CVE request: a2ps insecure temporary file use

Hello,

Jakub Wilk found that a2ps, a tool to convert text and other types of
files to PostScript, insecurely used a temporary file in spy_user(). A
local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to
modify an arbitrary file accessible to the user running a2ps:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=737385

The original report notes there are calls to tempname_ensure(). If any
of those are found to be vulnerable, would they use the same CVE number,
or require a different one?
