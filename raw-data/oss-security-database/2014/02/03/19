No one from another distribution responded with specific details that were
different from this "aren't security flaws, precisely" statement.
So, we will make the CVE assignments on the basis of the original report.

Use CVE-2014-1845 for this issue in which the environment isn't
properly restricted.

Use CVE-2014-1846 for this issue in which gdb is available unsafely in
the unpatched codebase.


In this interpretation, "and (b) a weak default configuration. Users
in select groups could exploit this to execute arbitrary programs as
root" means that at least one not-equivalent-to-root user is able to
execute the helper program. In other words, it is not an independent
vulnerability.

A specific Linux distribution might, for example, have an
implementation error in determining who is allowed to execute the
helper program. If anything like that is reported, additional CVE
assignments would be possible.
