Unfortunately, your two attached files - nox32recvmmsg.c and Makefile -
arrived each in a separate message, with the content yEnc encoded:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YEnc

Moreover, at least nox32recvmmsg.c definitely looks wrong - only 5 bytes
of the encoding are present:

=ybegin part=1 line=128 size=2287 name=nox32recvmmsg.c
=ypart begin=0 end=5
M<8E><8F><90><93>
=yend size=5 part=1 pcrc32=bdd2de8b

(where the <8E><8F><90><93> portion is literal 8-bit characters).  The
rest of nox32recvmmsg.c is nowhere to be seen.  The Makefile could be
OK, but without the .c file it's useless.  As a moderator, I'll reject
those other two messages since they're of little use.

Rather than post via Gmane's NNTP gateway, can you please reply to this
message with the files MIME-attached, or include the files in message
body with some sort of delimiters (e.g. Phrack-style)?

Thanks,

Alexander
