Subject: CVE request: PHP object insertion in Contao CMS <= 3.2.5

Hi,

I have discovered a vulnerability that might lead to code execution in
Contao CMS <= 3.2.4
Contao CMS <= 3.2.4 does not properly validate user input in several
locations which is then passed directly into PHP's unserialize.

This has been fixed in Contao 2.3.5 as per commit:
https://github.com/contao/core/commit/8c9cb044bdc887a8202bb65a64545c025664f957
and
https://github.com/contao/core/commit/1717336598fdcf1ed3f4ad488e140147cb31516d
