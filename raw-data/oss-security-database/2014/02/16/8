On Android, third party applications have always been compiled with
-fPIC, ever since the initial release of Android. As mentioned earlier
in this thread, the performance impacts of PIC and PIE are similar.

Starting in Android 4.1, all dynamically linked ARM [1] and x86 [2]
executables are compiled with PIE. Compiling with PIE on MIPS was
added in Android 4.3 [3]. Statically linked executables with PIE are
not supported today [4], although I'd love to see it in the future.

I have yet to hear any complaint, on x86 or ARM, about any real world
performance impact of PIE on Android, even though the code has been
live and in user's hands for almost 2 years.
