How it is possible to poison the cache if the response is not cached?

If dnscache updates the cache with additional or authoritative data, 
overriding existing data (as most resolvers do), then it is possible to 
do so without relying on the implementation anomaly quoted above.

In short, I'm not convinced at all that the alleged security implication 
exist.
