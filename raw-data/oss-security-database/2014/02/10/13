It is conceivable for a CVE assignment to apply to a combination of
two products, and not apply to either product alone, but we prefer not
to do that if there's any type of (partial) agreement that one product
could be chosen.

Use CVE-2013-7324 for this issue in WebKit-GTK. When the issue is
later listed on the
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7324 web page,
we will try to include a note that the WebKit-GTK behavior complies
with existing W3C standards and existing practices for GNOME desktop
integration.


> PulseAudio's security model is based on clients not sending malicious
> requests to change the stream volume

If there ever happens to be a later vendor announcement that this
model is incorrect, and that a different model is required as a
security fix, then a second CVE assignment could be made.
