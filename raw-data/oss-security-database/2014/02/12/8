Subject: Re: Old CVE ids, public, but still "RESERVED"

Hi again,

It appears that some of the issues in the lists I previously sent have
been processed lately, so I figured I could provide the list of issues
with a year between 2001 and 2010.

This batch contains the ids followed by any information that can be
found in our text database.

HTH.

Cheers,
