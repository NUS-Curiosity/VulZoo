The advisories don't mention the release of Qlustar which they apply to
but it seems to be Qlustar 8.1. Then, I think, you look into

http://repo.qlustar.com/repo/ubuntu/dists/8.1-precise/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz
http://repo.qlustar.com/repo/ubuntu/dists/8.1-precise-proposed-updates/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz

and locate the interesting files. Here they are:
