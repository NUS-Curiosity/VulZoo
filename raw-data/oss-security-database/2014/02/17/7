Subject: [OSSA 2014-005] Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client
 (CVE-2013-6396)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-005
CVE: CVE-2013-6396
Date: February 17, 2014
Title: Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client
Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP)
Products: python-swiftclient
Versions: 1.0 version up to 1.9.0

Description:
Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Swift client was failing
to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS
connections. A remote attacker with access over segments of the network
between client and server could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle
attack and access the contents of the Swift client's communication with
the server, including any used credentials.

python-swiftclient fix (included in 2.0 release):
