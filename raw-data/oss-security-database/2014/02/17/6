I think I've come around to a yes for this one. Pushing attacker-chosen
entries
out of the cache after only 100 packets is clearly not what the admin
wants.  It
makes a secondary attack (DNS over UDP blind cache poisoning) much more
viable than it was.

I can think of some DoS scenarios where this vector would assist another
attack.
