Subject: CVE request New-djbdns: dnscache: possible DoS 

    Hello,

dnscache(8) resolver reads messages over a TCP connection one byte at a time. 
For long messages, it'll trigger as many read(2) calls as the length of a 
message. Thus consuming extra CPU cycles. A malicious remote user could use 
this to cause a DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------

Thank you.
