Subject: oath-toolkit PAM module OTP token invalidation issue

Bas van Schaik discovered that commented-out lines in /etc/users.oath
have an undesired side effect:

There is a test file with comments in the distribution, so I believe
this is an actual bug with security implications, not accidental
misuse of the file format.
