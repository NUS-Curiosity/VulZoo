Subject: Re: CVE Request: Percona Toolkit automatic version check - remote code execution / information leak

Use CVE-2014-2029 for this issue in which a plain HTTP session is
used, and a man-in-the-middle attack can lead to remote code execution
(or retrieving sensitive configuration information).

There is no CVE assignment specifically for the transmission of data
to Percona without user confirmation. This is potentially unwanted
behavior, but it does not seem that this a mistake (in the sense that
a developer was trying to implement a different behavior).
