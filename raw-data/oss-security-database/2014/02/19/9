Changing the TCP read approach can be considered a performance
improvement (and, somewhat marginally, a security improvement), with
no CVE assignment. The commit mentions "making slight gain in
performance" and "could also lead to potential denial of service." The
original implementation might have chosen its approach for
design-for-auditability reasons, i.e., it may not have been a
"mistake" at all. It seems impractical to assign CVE IDs to all
opportunities to speed up the processing of untrusted input in all
products. The situation would be different if it were clearly a logic
error in the code, e.g., processing the first byte once, the second
byte four times, the third byte nine times, etc.
