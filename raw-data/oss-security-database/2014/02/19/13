Option 2 has now been chosen.

The clarified meaning of CVE-2014-1947 is now the vulnerability in
older ImageMagick versions (such as 6.5.4) that use the "L%02ld"
string. The root cause here is that the code did not cover the case of
more than 99 layers, which is apparently allowable but relatively
uncommon. This has a resultant buffer overflow, e.g, L99\0 is safe but
L100\0 is unsafe. When the overflow occurs, it can be described as "1
or more bytes too many."

A new ID of CVE-2014-2030 is now assigned for the vulnerability in
newer ImageMagick versions that use the "L%06ld" string. The root
cause here is that the code did not recognize the relationship between
the 8 (or more) characters in "L%06ld" and the actual buffer size.
This has a resultant buffer overflow of "4 or more bytes too many."
