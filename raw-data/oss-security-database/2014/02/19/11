Subject: CVE request for CGI::Application information disclosure flaw

I don't believe a CVE was requested for this issue.  Looks like it requires a 2013 CVE.  Copying-and-pasting from our bug [5]:


It was reported [1],[2] that the CGI::Application perl module suffered from a flaw where, in certain cases, it would unexpectedly dump a complete set of web query data and server environment information as an error page.  This could allow unintended disclosure of sensitive information.

A suggested fix is available [3] and the commit that caused the problem [4] was most likely introduced in version 4.19.
