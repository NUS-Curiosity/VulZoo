You referenced it above in your statement about why you want to be part
of the group.  You write:
	It also implements a Linux kernel module interface and uses many
	Linux device drivers and kernel modules that also should be
	supported.

That Linux kernel driver codebase is huge, and odds are, much larger
than the core kernel you are linking it to (just by the virtue of the
fact that the Linux kernel core is much smaller than the driver portion
of the source tree you are using.)  If I'm wrong in that your kernel is
much larger than the drivers being used here, well, you all are doing
something wrong :)

Well, as that is what you are supposed to be doing in order to get
admission, it seems odd that you don't intend to do this.

Taking emotions out of humans and decisions causes other major problems,
don't try to do that.  On the linux-distro list, you will have to be
interacting with (well, supposed to be) the humans of those open source
projects in order to address the issues found on the list.  Those
community members are actual people with emotions and histories of
dealing with companies in various manners.  If you somehow think that
they will not react in ways that they feel are in the best interest of
their project's long-term interests, well, then you are forgetting how
open source communities work.
