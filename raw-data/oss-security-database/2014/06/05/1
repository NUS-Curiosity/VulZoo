It sounds like adding VMware is not warranted, they don't ship "a
Linux[1]", so I see no compelling reason for them to be added. For the
few Open Source  projects they are involved in, those upstreams are
notified as part of the process of bringing things to the distros list
so that should suffice.

[1] if they are added then by that logic we need to add every product
which has virtualization support or a ported environment that can run
Linux (busybox anyone?) which is basically crazy.
