Thanks for pointing this one out. FWIW, I discussed this issue with Kurt 
Seifried and we believe it would be hardening fix, not a CVE-named issue.

It seems this flaw could let you accidentally connect to an LDAP server 
without a password, but the flaw in this scenario is in the LDAP server, 
and this fix helps prevent you from doing that.

Some further explanations about this are available in
