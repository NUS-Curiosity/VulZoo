Mark Cox, who was providing vulnerability detail to individual distros,
has just posted the timeline:

Here is the timeline from my (OpenSSL) perspective for the recent CCS
Inject MITM vulnerability as well as the other flaws being fixed today.

** SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224)

On Twitter, Mark (@iamamoose) pointed out that "by telling OS vendors in
advance we actually caught two problems with the patches!", I guess
referring to these two timeline entries:

2014-06-02 Red Hat find issue with patch (1400), updated patch
                        sent to vendors
2014-06-02 Canonical find regression with patch (1700), Stephen
                         produces updated patch, sent to vendors (1820)
