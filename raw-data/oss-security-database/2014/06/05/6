Wait, companies aren't on these lists to "fix things in advance", they
are on them to help resolve the issues with the community members of the
OSS projects, and to help prepare for the announcement in an organized
manner.  The fact that they work _with_ the community projects is a
major thing here.  It is not a one-way street at all.

I'm sure if anyone is found to be "fixing things in products ahead of
time", that will be addressed properly, but that is _not_ the reason
this group is here for at all from what I can tell (note, I'm not on the
list, but was on vendor-sec for years, and never saw any "fixes ahead of
time" there that were not just honest mistakes.)

What specific OSS products are you relying on that you wish to have
advance notice of vulnerabilities in?  As you aren't a public Linux
distro, it's hard to find a list anywhere about what exact code bases
you are concerned about tracking here.

Well, except for the previously mentioned huge Linux driver code base
(i.e. the thing that runs your flagship product) but I've already stated
my objection there for why you should not be allowed access to any
"special" knowledge there.
