I'd appreciate any references to back the "a large majority of the Linux kernel source tree", "while refusing to contribute back to those drivers", and "tiny "core" of a custom kernel" statements if you want me to make any comments.

Same for "Because of this reliance on that large body of code".

My intention isn't to persuade anyone. If everyone thinks that we shouldn't be subscribed to linux-distros, that's fine. I just would like a fair reasoning of why not, instead of biased and emotionally-filled comments.
