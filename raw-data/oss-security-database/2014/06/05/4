Ok, let's keep this on a purely community basis, no legal issues
involved (to quell the tide of private emails about this as well.)

Your company takes the Linux kernel drivers (a large majority of the
Linux kernel source tree) and builds a product around it, while refusing
to contribute back to those drivers.  What you are doing has been
explicitly stated as something you should not be doing by a number of
community members.  Somehow you feel that your tiny "core" of a custom
kernel is more important than the larger body of community work you are
relying on in order for that core to work properly.

Because of this reliance on that large body of code, you are now asking
to be notified ahead of time about vulnerabilities in that code base by
the same community members you are ignoring in the first place.

Does that seem like a fair thing to be asking for?

To me it does not, but feel free to persuade me otherwise.

thanks,
