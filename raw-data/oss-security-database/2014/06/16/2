Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Neutron

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Neutron L3-agent DoS through IPv6 subnet
Reporter: Thiago Martins (HP)
Products: Neutron
Versions: up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1

Description:
Thiago Martins from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Neutron
L3-agent. By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router, an
authenticated user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating
IPv4 addresses from being attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal
of the faulty network can not be done using the API and must be cleaned
at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are
affected.
