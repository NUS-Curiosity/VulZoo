Hi Ben,

we usually don't assign CVE from our pool for public issues, and I'm
especially reluctant here as I don't know if someone else aware of this
issue could have assign one.

So I'm asking on oss-sec to assign one so it gets some publicity for
security people and someone has a chance to yell if a CVE has already
been assigned.

oss-sec / MITRE: it seems that SECCOMP on MIPS doesn't behave properly
(see [1] for all the details). I'm unsure when it started (I guess when
seccomp was first added to MIPS, it seems at least 3.2 is affected), and
it's fixed in 3.15 (with 137f7df8cead00688524c82360930845396b8a21).

Can someone assign a CVE is this is indeed a new issue?
