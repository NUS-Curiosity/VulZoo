Subject: CVE-2014-0206 -- Linux kernel: kernel memory disclosure in
 io_getevents()

A kernel memory disclosure was introduced in aio_read_events_ring() in
v3.10 by commit a31ad380bed817aa25f8830ad23e1a0480fef797.  The changes
made to aio_read_events_ring() failed to correctly limit the index into
ctx->ring_pages[], allowing an attacker to cause the subsequent kmap()
of an arbitrary page with a copy_to_user() to copy the contents into
userspace.
