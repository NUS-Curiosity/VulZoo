It might be worthwhile to clarify what problems we're solving, in the
specific case of a request by a product's upstream vendor, by
requiring that more vulnerability details be sent here at the time of
the CVE request.

MITRE is almost certainly willing to accept this as a valid reason, if
there's general agreement:

  - people here don't want to see announcements of vulnerabilities
    that are both vague AND unfixed, and would just unsubscribe if there
    were many of these

    (vague vulnerability details for fixed issues typically haven't
     had objections in the past, e.g., the
     http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/11/28/5 post)

(In 2013 and earlier, vulnerability details here had a de-duplication
purpose for MITRE, but they often don't now. If we were to assign a
CVE ID for this, we'd already know whether any kio CVE requests had
been sent directly to us. The CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html page
and examples aren't directly applicable to us, and we're generally
more concerned with knowing whether something is a unique issue that
everyone will want to fix, than with knowing every possible detail.
But we realize the list charter may imply a minimum level of details.)

Going back to the security content, KDE Bug 330795 mentioned above says:

  Product  kio

  KDE's KIO completely ignores the first part, "must not automatically
  redirect without prompting the user"

and possibly this is (or was) a violation of RFC 7231 section 6.4,
with security implications:

  "Automatic redirection needs to done with care for methods not
   known to be safe, as defined in Section 4.2.1, since the user
   might not wish to redirect an unsafe request."

Does anyone want a CVE ID for that?

Finally, for the original "a vulnerability in KIO that causes a security
issue in kmail" request: to get a CVE ID for this more quickly, please send
to cve-assign@...re.org mentioning whether it is or isn't Bug 330795.
We don't want to send a CVE ID here immediately because MITRE doesn't
determine the list charter and it might be an off-topic request.
