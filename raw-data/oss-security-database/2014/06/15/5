That is unrelated.

In the past when I've tried to use the cve-assign address it has basically
been a black hole. Since then I've either asked redhat or one of the other
OSS vendors for a CVE. I've used the distros@...openwall.org now as a
fallback.

I'd also note as part of the meta discussion that I'm not going to release
details of vulnerabilities to a public list  before the fix, and just
because someone asks for more details doesn't mean I will provide them. - I
have no way to know who the person asking is. If getting a CVE assigned
becomes a problem then the solution from my side will be to release the
advisory then let someone else sort out assigning CVEs afterwards.

Cheers

Rich.
