So one comment on this, replace the above with "DAC"
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control) and I bet
we'd hand it a CVE =).

Security lines move, I would expect most modern system of any type
(Windows, Linux, router, maybe not my bathroom scale that talks
wifi... yet) to have some sort of firewall enabled by default and not
simply leave everything exposed to the world. So in that case not
having a fire enabled by default would definitely violate the
principle of least surprise and maybe even qualify for a CVE.
