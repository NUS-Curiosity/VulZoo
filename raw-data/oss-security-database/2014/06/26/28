Subject: Re: LMS-2014-06-16-1: Oberhumer LZO

I will clarify my actions here, and this will be my only comment on this
matter:

First and foremost I would like to thank the Linux kernel community, the
oss distros community, and select members of this oss-security mailing list
community, for helping move this issue forward.

I would also like to thank Alexander (Solar) for his advice and direction,
even if I didn't take all of it.

I chose not to release the bug reports to the public within the timeframe
suggested by Solar for several reasons:
 1) I have deep visibility into the vulnerable code and understand the
constraints of exploitation and the breadth
 2) The public exposure was non-obvious, and was not advertised by the
vendor
 3) The most widely effected vendors (Linux and Oberhumer) had yet to
release a patch publicly
 4) The time between exposure and public release was short enough to
negative exposure

This effort took coordination with a large number of entities world wide.
It was not an easy effort, and we all did our best to push this as quickly
and effectively as possible. But, I made a promise to the affected vendors
that I would do my best to give them adequate time to coordinate and
release. Oberhumer would not have been given sufficient time with an early
release, and he was the most affected by this issue.

Had the lack of communication from Oberhumer persisted, a release would
have occurred today regardless. I am glad he was able to release a patch.

My job, as I saw it, was to responsibly coordinate word between all
parties. I did that as best as I could given the teams, their time zones,
their understanding of the bug, and their speed.

All in all, I think it worked out OK, and I am satisfied with the result
thus far. There are things that could have gone better, but over all each
team worked hard to produce solid patches in a reasonable time frame. We
hit that goal.

Thank you,
