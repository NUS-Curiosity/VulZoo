Subject: Re: CVE Request: Linux kernel ALSA core control API vulnerabilities

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/sound/core/control.c?id=07f4d9d74a04aa7c72c5dae0ef97565f28f17b92
> ALSA: control: Protect user controls against concurrent access

> The user-control put and get handlers as well as the tlv do not
> protect against concurrent access from multiple threads. Since the
> state of the control is not updated atomically it is possible that
> either two write operations or a write and a read operation race
> against each other. Both can lead to arbitrary memory disclosure.

> (aka "The first issue is a race conditions in the user-control put/get
> and tlv handlers" ... "first affected release is v2.6.18")

Use CVE-2014-4652.

> ALSA: control: Don't access controls outside of protected regions

> A control that is visible on the card->controls list can be freed at
> any time. This means we must not access any of its memory while not
> holding the controls_rw_lock. Otherwise we risk a use after free
> access.

> (aka "There are a couple of places where a kcontrol is de-referenced
> after controls_rwsem has been released" ... "first affected release
> predates the git history")

Use CVE-2014-4653.

> ALSA: control: Fix replacing user controls

> The first is that the code does not check if the control is actually a
> user control and neither does it check if the control is owned by the
> process that tries to remove it. That allows userspace applications to
> remove arbitrary controls, which can cause a user after free

> (aka "The next issue is that SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE does no
> permission checking on the control that is to be replaced. This allows
> a application to remove controls that were created by the kernel
> driver and also controls that are locked by other applications." ...
> "first affected release predates the git history")

Use CVE-2014-4654.


> The second issue is that on one hand when a control is replaced the
> user_ctl_count limit is not checked and on the other hand the
> user_ctl_count is increased (even though the number of user controls
> does not change). This allows userspace, once the user_ctl_count limit
> as been reached, to repeatedly replace a control until user_ctl_count
> overflows.

> (aka "SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE also gets the user_ctl_count
> handling wrong" ... "first affected release predates the git history")

Use CVE-2014-4655.

[ in other words, two different CVE IDs for the
  82262a46627bebb0febcc26664746c25cef08563 commit ]

> ALSA: control: Make sure that id->index does not overflow

> ALSA: control: Handle numid overflow

>    card->last_numid = 0;

> (aka "The last two issues are overflows of id.index and id.numid" ...

Use CVE-2014-4656.

[ in other words, a single CVE ID for both the
  883a1d49f0d77d30012f114b2e19fc141beb3e8e and
  ac902c112d90a89e59916f751c2745f4dbdbb4bd commits ]
