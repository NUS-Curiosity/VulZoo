By that logic then we wouldn't assign CVE's for bad salt/lacking
salt/bad password encryption, as the "real" vulnerability" is in the
access of that data. The reality is a lot of what used to be exotic
security is now becoming basic standard practice, largely I think for
two simple reasons: 1) attackers keep getting better and 2) the
technical security debt in most existing software keeps getting
discovered to be larger.
