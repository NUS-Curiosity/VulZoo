Subject: Operating system distribution security contact lists



Hi

I would like to request membership to the closed "Operating system
distribution security contact lists" mailing list on behalf of the IBM
Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT). I am part of the PSIRT
team where I help manage the receipt, investigation and internal
coordination of security vulnerability information related to IBM
offerings. You can read more about PSIRT here:
http://www-03.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/process.html.  I am the
main coordinator of Open Source vulnerabilities that affect IBM products.
We have products that utilize Open Source software, so being part of this
list will be beneficial. I do not plan on posting any IBM product specific
issues as we do that through Security Bulletins (see
http://www-03.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/bulletins.html).

You can verify that I am part of the PSIRT team by emailing PSIRT directly
at IBM PSIRT<slash>Somers<slash>IBM or psirt<at>us<dot>ibm<dot>com.

Here is my Personal PGP key: (See attached file: Lisa

Thanks for your consideration,
Lisa
