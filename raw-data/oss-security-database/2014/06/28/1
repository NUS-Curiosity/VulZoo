That is my question.  If not having DAC is a vulnerability, why do I find absolutely _no_ CVEs for its absence?  Whether it's required or not has no bearing on whether or not it's a flaw.  But now HttpOnly is not only _not_ required, but its absence is being considered a flaw.

This is where my concern/confusion is.  Are we calling things flaws because they have an actual vulnerability, or are we starting to call things "flaws" even tough they don't have vulnerabilities, don't fix vulnerabilities, but they're extremely useful things to have?  I don't think that's the definition of a flaw.
