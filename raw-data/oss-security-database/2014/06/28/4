Subject: Re: Question regarding CVE applicability of missing HttpOnly flag

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

You quoted two paragraphs on the topic of whether system-integration
issues are covered by CVE and CWE, and then wrote "shouldn't the same
be true of the HttpOnly flag?" It's unclear how to answer except by
saying: a decision to use or not use the HttpOnly flag isn't a
system-integration issue.

You then mentioned 'if setting this flag "fixes" all XSS issues.' It
seems that a reasonable response here is: an XSS attack can have a
severe impact even if it's not designed to steal any cookies. (The
non-cookie-stealing severity varies, in part, based on the types of
input that are common for the web application in question.) The
HttpOnly flag is specific to cookies.

Finally, you mentioned "They can't _both_ get CVEs" - a question that
seems to be about a superfluous CVE assignment in a case where the
only goal of an XSS attack is to steal a cookie, and the attack relies
on an XSS vulnerability in a certain web application that doesn't set
the HttpOnly flag. A response here is: there could be a scenario that
ended up with a single CVE assignment for a composite of one specific
instance of incorrect input validation and an incorrect cookie
restriction. This scenario seems rare. It would require that neither
issue was dangerous except in the presence of the other issue. For
example, it would require that the only possible impact of the
incorrect input validation was to pass JavaScript code that could
steal cookies (any other malicious JavaScript code would be blocked).
In most practical cases, two CVE assignments would often be possible
if someone happened to request two.
