Subject: CVE request: python: _json module is vulnerable to arbitrary process
 memory read

Hello,

It was reported [1] that Python built-in _json module have a flaw
(insufficient bounds checking), which allows a local user to read
current process' arbitrary memory.
From initial bug report [1]:
...
The sole prerequisites of this attack are that the attacker is able to
control or influence the two parameters of the default scanstring
function: the string to be decoded and the index.

The bug is caused by allowing the user to supply a negative index
value. The index value is then used directly as an index to an array
in the C code; internally the address of the array and its index are
added to each other in order to yield the address of the value that is
desired. However, by supplying a negative index value and adding this
to the address of the array, the processor's register value wraps
around and the calculated value will point to a position in memory
which isn't within the bounds of the supplied string, causing the
function to access other parts of the process memory.
...

Can a CVE ID be assigned to this issue please?
Also CC'ing the Debian bugreport here.
