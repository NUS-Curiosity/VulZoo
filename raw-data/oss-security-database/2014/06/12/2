Subject: CVE request: PHP heap-based buffer overflow in DNS TXT record parsing

Good morning,

Stefan Esser pointed out that the following commit fixes a heap-based 
buffer overflow in DNS TXT record parsing:

https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/b34d7849ed90ced9345f8ea1c59bc8d101c18468

A malicious server or man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this 
flaw to execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP 
application uses dns_get_record() to perform a DNS query.

Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already?

(Red Hat bug with no further details: 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1108447)

Cheers,
