Subject: OpenJDK CVE duplicates

Hi!

CVE-2014-0462 and CVE-2014-2405 should be rejected as duplicates of
libjpeg CVE-2013-6629 and libpng CVE-2013-6954 respectively.  Those
were incorrectly used for known issues in the bundled library versions,
but replaced by previously assigned ids before updates announcements.
They were used briefly in the NEWS file though:
