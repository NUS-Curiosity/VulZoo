I'm afraid I can't comment on Greg's comments due to my lack of legal understanding. However, in addition to the reasons explained above and also Alan's comments (which, IMO, also add to our reasons), I'd also appreciate comments by others active in this community and would be happy to answer any questions anyone might have.

We have some (minor) open source software and libraries at http://github.com/vmware, and also others hosted at SourceForge, such as http://vmware-svga.sourceforge.net. (Not sure if these are significant for this request, though.)

  Would it be reasonable to include VMware

I've added our security advisory/contact details to the wiki.
