Either way, I suppose that anyone running such a bittorrent client isn't expecting that all ports start forwarding (but, as a result, I'm not sure if this is malfunctioning firewall which is where knowing whether or not this is according to spec would be good).

It was pointed out that according to http://upnp.org/specs/gw/UPnP-gw-WANIPConnection-v1-Service.pdf UDP port 0 is meant to do this:

"
2.2.16. ExternalPort 

This variable represents the external port that the NAT gateway would “listen” on for connection 

requests to a corresponding InternalPort on an InternalClient.. Inbound packets to this 

external port on the WAN interface of the gateway should be forwarded to InternalClient on 

the InternalPort on which the message was received. If this value is specified as a wildcard 

(i.e. 0), connection request on all external ports (that are not otherwise mapped) will be forwarded 

to InternalClient. In the wildcard case, the value(s) of InternalPort on 

InternalClient are ignored by the IGD for those connections that are forwarded to 

InternalClient. Obviously only one such entry can exist in the NAT at any time and conflicts 

are handled with a “first write wins” behavior
"

Seems to be a newer addition to the spec though, as it also indicates that not all NAT implementations will support it.  In light of this, I suspect a CVE is warranted here.
