We will wait a short time for any other comments from anyone before
assigning the two CVEs. One other observation is that 3089 says
"Product Version 2.6.2" and "An admin can perform an SQL injection."
Also, http://piwigo.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=24009 is from
2014-06-11 whereas http://piwigo.org/bugs/view.php?id=3089 is from
2014-06-12.

So, possibly, the requirement for admin access was part of the
motivation for not pushing out a new release immediately. And, the
lack of the fix in 2.6.3 might be a result of the bug perhaps not
being discovered until the day after the 2.6.3 release.
