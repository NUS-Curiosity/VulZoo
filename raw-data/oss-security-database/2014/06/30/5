Subject: Xen Security Advisory 101 (CVE-2014-4022) - information leak via
 gnttab_setup_table on ARM

           Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-4022 / XSA-101
                            version 3

            information leak via gnttab_setup_table on ARM

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Provide the CVE.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When initialising an internal data structure on ARM platform Xen was
not correctly initialising the memory containing the list of a
domain's grant table pages. This list is returned by the
GNTTABOP_setup_table subhypercall, leading to an information leak.

IMPACT
======

Malicious guest administrators can obtain some of the memory contents
of other domains:

Up to 8*max_nr_grant_frames bytes of uninitialised memory can be
leaked to the calling domain. This memory may have been previously
used by either the hypervisor or other guests.

The default max_nr_grant_frames is 32, hence by default 256 bytes may
be leaked in this way.  However this can be overridden via the
"gnttab_max_nr_frames" hypervisor command line option.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.

MITIGATION
==========

None.
