Subject: CVE requests: nagios check_dhcp plug-in: read parts of INI config
 files belonging to root

Good morning,

Dawid Golunski discovered a flaw in the Nagios check_dhcp plugin that
allows "Malicious user that has local access to a system where
check_dhcp plugin is installed with SUID could exploit  this
vulnerability to read any INI format config files owned by root and
potentially extract some sensitive information.":

This was fixed in version 2.0.2:

<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/>

Dawid later reported a race condition. Despite the above fix, it was
still possible to read parts of root-owned files:

This was fixed in version 2.0.3:

<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/>

Can CVEs please be assigned if they have not been already?

Thanks,
