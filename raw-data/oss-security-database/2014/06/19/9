Hi!

It seems this CVE request slipped through the cracks.

Note that there is another CVE needed for that commit, more specifically
for the "In addition, some fixes against OOB access are done." part.
That issue affects versions before 1.0.41 (which is the first version
affected by CVE-2014-2707) and can be used to crash cups-browsed
remotely.
