Really? :-)

Have you checked that for anything else?

Have you ever seen OpenVZ?

Look at this trivial code example...

Classic kernel:

if (!uid)
{
	// perform privileged operation here
}

Containers-enabled kernel:

if ( !uid && !container_id )	// container_id: 0 for host
{
	// perform privileged operation here
}

How would you bypass this check to get privileged access to anything
outside the container?
