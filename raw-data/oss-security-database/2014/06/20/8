I am talking about standard Linux Kernel.  I have not played with OpenVZ
so I can not comment on its security.

My point being that any process on a Linux System that has lots of linux
capabilities (DAC*, SYS_ADMIN, and many others) can not be contained. 

I think it is premature to treat breakouts against Docker Containers
with CVE's because of this.  If people stop making claims about the
security of a docker process with privs being isolated from the host
system, we can prevent the flood of CVE's, that are likely to come.
