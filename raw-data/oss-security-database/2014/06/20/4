Subject: CVE request: softhsm, softhsm-keyconv tool creates world-readable
 files

Good morning,

As reported in

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=752092

and

https://issues.opendnssec.org/browse/SUPPORT-136

softhsm-keyconv tool creates world-readable files. Based on the 
description of the tool at [1], my uneducated guess is it would allow an 
unprivileged user to control (if the output file is created in a 
directory they can access) a DNS server via rndc.

Could a CVE be assigned if one has not been already?

The Debian bug also notes a similar issue was fixed in ldns - I've asked 
for more details about that in the bug).

Cheers,
