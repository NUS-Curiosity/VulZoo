Subject: [OSSA 2014-019] Neutron L3-agent DoS through IPv6 subnet (CVE-2014-4167)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-019
CVE: CVE-2014-4167
Date: June 18, 2014
Title: Neutron L3-agent DoS through IPv6 subnet
Reporter: Thiago Martins (HP)
Products: Neutron
Versions: up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1

Description:
Thiago Martins from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Neutron
L3-agent. By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router, an
authenticated user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating
IPv4 addresses from being attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal
of the faulty network can not be done using the API and must be cleaned
at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are
affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:

Havana fix:

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in
future 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.2 releases.
