Thanks for the research! Following the submission guidelines[1], please
send your ASLRv3 patch to upstream at linux-kernel@...r.kernel.org and
CC the following people:

	Andrew Morton <akpm@...ux-foundation.org>
	Thomas Gleixner <tglx@...utronix.de>
	Ingo Molnar <mingo@...hat.com>
	"H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@...or.com>
	Russell King <linux@....linux.org.uk>
	Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@....com>
	Will Deacon <will.deacon@....com>
	Oleg Nesterov <oleg@...hat.com>
	Andy Lutomirski <luto@...capital.net>
	Kees Cook <keescook@...omium.org>

I noticed in testing that this hugely reduces the available mmap space
available to 32-bit processes. I suspect this is what this wasn't done
before.

Thanks!
