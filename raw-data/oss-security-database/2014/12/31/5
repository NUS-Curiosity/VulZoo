Subject: CVE Request: Linux: Remote crash via batman-adv module

Hi

It was reported on the netdev mailing list[1] and in the Debian
bugtracker[2] that linux could crash when using the batman-adv module,
see also [3]. The bug was introduced in [4], in 3.13-rc1, and a fix
recently merged in [5] (sheduled for 3.19).

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue?
