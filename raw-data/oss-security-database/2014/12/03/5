You mixed up Michal and me :-)

But appart from that: It's really not a single issue. I just fuzzed one
and reported it to check whether there is any reaction. But you easily
get dozends if you run afl on it.

If you want to fix unrtf there's more to it than that. Basically you'd
have to fork it and take over development. Same is true for a whole
bunch of other tools (catdoc, antiword, latex2rtf, ...)
