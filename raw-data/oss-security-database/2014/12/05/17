The context of the architecture you're testing on is required for the
numbers to be meaningful. It's known to be expensive on x86 and should
be nearly free elsewhere if there aren't compiler / linker perf bugs.

The cost on x86 is also quite different with Clang, and will be
improving in the next GCC release due to register allocator improvements.
