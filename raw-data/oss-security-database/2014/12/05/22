Subject: RE: CVE-2014-6316: URL redirection issue in MantisBT

"Paul Richards also found another redirection issue in permalink_page.php, which turned out to have the same root cause."

And nik-picking here, but the issue that I identified in permalink_page.php I believe was a cross site scripting issue and not a URL redirection vulnerability so should probably be allocated a separate CVE identifier?

The http request headers of the permalink_page.php issue that I recall are at http://tinypic.com/r/2dh8y1f/8 and relate to a XSS vulnerability and not a URL Redirection as shown in the image linked.
