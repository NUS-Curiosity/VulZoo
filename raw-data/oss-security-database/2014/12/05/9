Interesting.

Do you know the state of this? The thread indicates that the poster
asked for review of his patch and never got one.
Any gcc people here who could comment?

Do you have numbers on the performance impact? Or some good ideas what
would be reasonable benchmarking targets?
As libraries are pic-compiled anyway from my limited understanding I
think this only affects code in the main executables.
I saw that chrome already ships pie-binaries, firefox doesn't.
(Browsers seem like performance critical, so google seems to think it's
no big performance deal).

"somewhwat complex" seems to be a reasonable description when it comes
to this whole topic of memory exploit mitigation :-) I feel I'd like to
know more about this but easy-to-grasp documentation / talks etc. are
hard to find.
