Hello,

It looks like the following issue has not received a CVE identifier as
of yet:

A NULL pointer dereference has been found in the
"CWebAdminMod::ChanPage()" function in modules/webadmin.cpp.

This was reported to Gentoo [1] by means of a Secunia advisory [2],
which in turn referenced the upstream bug request [3].
