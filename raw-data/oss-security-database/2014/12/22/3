I don't think this contradicts my statement that average consumer hw
doesn't need the high accuracy of ntp :-)

Yeah, I totally agree that this would be the desired thing to have.
However the facts are that at the moment we don't. And imho for
consumer HW the slight inaccuracy of tlsdate doesn't matter, while the
insecurity of ntp does (as the very practical hsts attack has shown).

I read these days that the Linux foundation is sponsoring some work on
NTP. Anyone involved in this and can comment whether secure
authentication for NTP is something that's being looked at or if it is
only about creating a better implementation of the ntp software?
