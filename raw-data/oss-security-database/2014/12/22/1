I perfectly understand that some people need more accuracy than tlsdate
can give. However it's probably rare, right? I don't see any reason why
average consumer hardware (Desktop, smartphone etc.) would have any
problem with the 1-2 sec max inaccuracy of tlsdate.

I think it shouldn't be too hard to get both.
You could do an asymmetric key exchange before you do any time
transmission. Then the only thing you really need is a single
authentication operation (HMAC or whatever). That shouldn't delay by
any significant amount.

tlsdate has tlsdated, I hope it acts intelligent and doesn't do time
jumps. Haven't tested though.
