Having to reconcile multiple logs/events across widely distributed
systems, especially in high volume situations, 1-2 seconds is a deal
breaker. Or people running SCADA systems for industrial plants. Or
people that run financial systems. A lot of them care very much about
security, and require accurate time, or else there's really no point to
this all.

To say nothing of a post incident forensics response, where loose time
would make things a lot harder to figure out.

So it's not an either/or situation (care about security, or have
accurate time, sometimes we need both).
