Nice, thanks. Revised:

8.7 RUNPATH and RPATH
Libraries that define RPATH or RUNPATH should ensure that this does not
contain relative paths or paths that traverse insecure directories
(eg /tmp or /var/tmp). This is to prevent an executable from loading a
library from an untrusted location. (This should include the corner
cases whereby the path list starts or ends with a colon, or includes two
consecutive colons).


("insecure directories" is intentionally broad (not just "world
writable"). Clarify?).

I'll file a bug against debian-policy in ~24h unless there are further
edits/additions/objections.
