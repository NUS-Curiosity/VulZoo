> It was reported that hivex [1], a library that can read and write hive files (undocumented binary files that Windows uses to store the Windows Registry on disk), did not properly handle small-sized hive files. An attacker able to supply a hive file of a small size to an application using the hivex library could use this flaw to read, and possibly write, up to 4095 bytes beyond the end of the allocated buffer, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution with the with the privileges of the user running that application.
