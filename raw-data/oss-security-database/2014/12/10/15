Subject: [OSSA 2014-039.1] Neutron DoS through invalid DNS configuration (CVE-2014-7821)
 ERRATA 1

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-039 (ERRATA 1)
CVE: CVE-2014-7821
Date: December 10, 2014
Title: Neutron DoS through invalid DNS configuration
Reporter: Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill and Michael Xin (Rackspace)
Products: Neutron
Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2

Description:
Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill and Michael Xin from Rackspace reported
a vulnerability in Neutron. By configuring a maliciously crafted
dns_nameservers an authenticated user may crash Neutron service
resulting in a denial of service attack. All Neutron setups are affected.

Errata:
The former fix did not take into account the usage of hostnames as
nameserver and caused a regression for this use-case. This update
provides an additional fix for that issue.
