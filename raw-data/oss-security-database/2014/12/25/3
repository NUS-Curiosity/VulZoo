It's typical to require at least 1/2 second accuracy for log correlation. 
This is not just for some people, but (for an example) at academic 
institutions where the staff is running average consumer hardware.

tlsdate is certainly an OK boundary sanity check on more accurate time, or for 
initial stepping on a new boot or new clock start.
