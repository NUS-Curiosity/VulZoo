Subject: CVE Request

(Pardon my complete lack of any clue how this process works) 

Now seems like a good time to formalize our internal policy of how we do security releases, and while we might have already butchered this one, it was suggested we attempt to get a CVE assigned.

Software name and optionally vendor name
raven-ruby (part of Sentry)

Type of vulnerability
DoS

Thanks!
