Fixes are now available in the X.Org master git repositories for the Xserver
1.17 development branch ("master") & 1.16 stable branch ("server-1.16-branch").

Additionally they are included in today's release of xorg-server 1.16.2.901
(Release Candidate 1 for 1.16.3):
    http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2014-December/002501.html

For those who either used the patches mailed to the distros list during embargo
or pulled changes from my personal git repository earlier today, please note
there are some additional changes that were made due to issues raised when the
patches were on final approach this morning.  These fixes mostly silence
compiler warnings, but also fix at least one bug in calculating buffer sizes
that could result in false failures or allowing overflows.  These added patches
are:

dbe: Call to DDX SwapBuffers requires address of int, not unsigned int 
[CVE-2014-8097 pt. 2]
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=b20912c3d45cbbde3c443e6c3d9e189092fe65e1

glx: Can't mix declarations and code in X.org sources [CVE-2014-8098 pt. 9]
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=61b17c0f10307e25e51e30e6fb1d3e3127f82d86

Missing parens in REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE macro [CVE-2014-8092 pt. 5]
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=9802a0162f738de03585ca3f3b8a8266494f7d45

dix: GetHosts bounds check using wrong pointer value [CVE-2014-8092 pt. 6]
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=1559a94395258fd73e369f1a2c98a44bfe21a486

They are also included with all the earlier patches in the list now posted to:

http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Security/Advisory-2014-12-09

Since these additional commits went into the X.Org master repo as part of the
same pull request as the earlier fixes, X.Org considers them to be part of the
fix for the CVE's in this advisory and does not believe new CVE id's are
warranted as X.Org distributed no version of its code in which only part of
these fixes were present.
