I expect someone else will get back to you regarding the CVE request,
but I'd like to ask that we please always include the affected software
name and usually also the vulnerability type in the Subject line of
messages posted in here.  Many of us don't care about CVEs much, but
would like to notice information about vulnerabilities possibly relevant
to us.  Also, having two or more mere "CVE Request" threads on the list
almost at once is confusing.  A better Subject line would have been e.g.
"CVE Request - raven-ruby (part of Sentry) DoS".  Thanks!
