Subject: Re: What is the "Grinch" polkit/wheel group issue?

The key here is the line:

"In order to exploit this, all we need is a single vulnerability in
any package in a repo. There are tons to choose from. If we type
‘PKCon’ or simply ‘man PKCon,’ we can find a list of repos in use and
then pull a list of all bins and version numbers. I won’t provide one
here because you don’t want everything handed to you."

Had they actually found a package they could leverage to get root,
then this would absolutely be a vulnerability, but they didn't.  While
configuring pkcon to allow admins to install packages without typing
in a password *is* something that might be unexpected for people
unfamiliar with polkit, that is the exact type of use case it was
built for.
