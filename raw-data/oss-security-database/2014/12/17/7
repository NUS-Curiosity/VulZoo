This paragraph suggests so many things which are simply wrong, confused,
or irrelevant that i don't know what to make of the rest of the article.

 * modern debian GNU/Linux systems do not have a wheel group at all.  No
particular versions or flavors of "Linux system"

 * on systems where members of group wheel really do have unrestricted
access to the su command, having wheel in the first place *is* the
vulnerability -- it is a misconfiguration to expect an account to be
non-privileged if it is a member of wheel.

 * the last sentence appears to be about setuid/setgid binaries, but
makes no mention that the overwhelming majority of binaries are not
setuid/setgid.

Later on, the post suggests that wheel group membership is related to
sudo privileges.

It also seems to assume that polkit always permits access for members of
group wheel.  I can find no such configuration on a modern debian system.

I don't think there's anything significant in this ambiguous,
underspecified, and confused report.
