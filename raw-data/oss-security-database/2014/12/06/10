A far better mechanism in Nautilus would be to use execve(2) on the
pathname and see if it executes. Nautilus will never be good at guessing
which files are actually executable on a given system and it is ridiculous
for it to try to guess. It should just execute the selected file and if
that fails, report the failure to the user.

One goofy filemanager doing something silly ought not stop Mozilla from
shipping a safer Firefox.
