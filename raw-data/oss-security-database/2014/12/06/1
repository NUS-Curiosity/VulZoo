I tried to dig into this a bit. I'm not really sure, but based on the
output I assume nautilus is relying on file or libmagic to assess the
file type.

And that's what fails:
$ file --mime-type pie
pie: application/x-sharedlib


It seems there is no really easy way to separate executables from
shared libraries and whether this should be considered a bug in
file/libmagic. The only thing I quickly found that would be possible is
searching if a SONAME is present. libmagic uses some "magic" file
format to parse files, I don't know if that's capable of such complex
parsing.

(oh, btw, this is one more reason to wipe out potential security bugs
in file...)
