Don't do that, stick to the linux-kernel mailing list, cc:ing the proper
developers involved.  I say this as most kernel subsystems do not use
bugzilla.kernel.org (USB and Networking are two examples), while others
use it heavily (like ACPI).

For "core" issues like this, stick to the mailing lists, they work
better.

Actually, for "security" stuff, use the security@...nel.org alias,
that's the best way to get a quick response.
