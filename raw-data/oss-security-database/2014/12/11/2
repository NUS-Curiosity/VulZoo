Awesome!! I am *DELIGHTED* that this serious problem is finally getting fixed.
Thank you for your effort!  For those curious about this,
more information about this is in PEP 0476:
  http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0476/
and these articles:
  https://lwn.net/Articles/582065/
  https://lwn.net/Articles/611243/

This has been the underlying cause of numerous CVEs going back to at least 2010, e.g.:
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4340
but the CVEs have always been assigned (to my knowledge) to the applications
using Python, and never the library that didn't provide the functionality that developers
often expected.  I expect a lot of silent vulnerabilities will be removed by this change.
