Subject: mpg123 CVE Assignment?

Hello All,

Did a CVE ever get assigned to mpg123 (Version 1.18.0) (http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/news.cgi <http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/news.cgi>). I have searched but can not find any, it is a regression bug, but I could not find any assigned to the original bug as well.

http://sourceforge.net/p/mpg123/bugs/201/

If none are assigned can we get one assigned?

=== Text from Site ===
2014-01-31 Thomas: mpg123 1.18.0 fixing regressions from 1.14.x
Regression fix: Ensure decoder reinitialization on combination of seek and resync (buffer overflow bug 201, introduced in 1.14.1).


Thank you,
Yury German
