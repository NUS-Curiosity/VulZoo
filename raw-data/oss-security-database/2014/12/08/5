Subject: CVE request:  mpfr: buffer overflow in mpfr_strtofr

Hello,

A buffer overflow was reported [1] in mpfr.
This is due to incorrect GMP documentation for mpn_set_str about the
size of a buffer (discussion is at [1]; first fix in the GMP
documentation is at [2]). This bug is present in the MPFR versions
from 2.1.0 (adding mpfr_strtofr) to this one, and can be detected by
running "make check" in a 32-bit ABI under GNU/Linux with alloca
disabled (this is currently possible by using the --with-gmp-build
configure option where alloca has been disabled in the GMP build). It
is fixed by the strtofr patch [3].
Corresponding changeset in the 3.1 branch: 9110 [4].
