Thanks for the info.

Right now details on this vuln seem to be scarce. I asked myself some
questions, but I don't know DNS internals very well.

As this affects three implementations the obvious first question would
be if others are affected, too. Has this been checked?

And is this only a DoS for the attacked server or would it also allow
some completely new kind of DNS reflection attack (i.e. generating a
loop where every loop iteration generates an UDP packet send to a
victim)?
