This sounds like you're referring to leap seconds, where due to the 
Earth's rotation slowing down (as determined by the International Earth 
Rotation Service), an extra second is inserted every so often, typically 
in July; it's quite fun watching it on a GPS receiver (assuming that it 
even survives the event, as I've seen a few cheaper ones lose the plot).

There is a serious proposal to phase out leap seconds (no URL handy right 
now), and I have no idea how that will affect time-based security.
