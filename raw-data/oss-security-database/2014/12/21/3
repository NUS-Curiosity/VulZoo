I don't think it has ever changed. CLOCK_MONOTONIC won't *ever* jump
either forwards or backwards, but is impacted by clock skew. I don't
think most use cases actually want CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, especially
considering that there's no vdso implementation so it's slow.

Of course, there's lots of buggy software which is why we have stuff
like ASLR / SSP in the first place. :)
