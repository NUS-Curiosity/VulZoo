Lots of good references on wp for those who are interested in the details:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second#Proposal_to_abolish_leap_seconds

short version: the proposal is controversial and many people seem to

If anyone from oss-security can make a concrete argument for why leap
seconds are a serious risk for computer security, that would probably be
useful information to pass along:
