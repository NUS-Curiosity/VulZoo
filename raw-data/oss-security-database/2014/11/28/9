We're not sure that this crosses privilege boundaries.
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_lua.html#luaauthzprovider
says

  Context: server config

Apparently you're trying to use it in a directory context and finding
that it doesn't work correctly. At least in theory, this could have
been resolved by reporting an error when LuaAuthzProvider is found in
a directory context, rather than by using the actual
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c2 approach
to add the functionality.

So, it may be reasonable to interpret this as a non-security bug that
occurs when an administrator intentionally enters httpd.conf content
that is, according to the documentation, invalid.

We notice that
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c4 says
"waiting to see if a CVE should be assigned." The usual process for
CVE assignments for Apache Software Foundation products is:

  http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html

Here, we realize that the issue was sent directly to the oss-security
list, but MITRE doesn't have enough information to make a final
decision. The Apache Software Foundation can decide whether the
erroneous LuaAuthzProvider handling is a vulnerability from the
perspective of their security policy.
