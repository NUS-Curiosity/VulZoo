Yes, sometimes a crash is only happens under valgrind or with specific 
ulimit etc.

You mean the closest non-crashing parent (in case there is a chain of 
samples as in AFL)?

And while we are at it, would you mind describing your experience in 
case of ffmpeg. Your blogpost -- http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=524 -- 
gives only high level review of the work. The fuzzer and specific 
methods of fuzzing seems to be proprietary. That's fine. But perhaps you 
can describe other sides of the work:
- how did you deduplicate crashes (full stacktrace, some frames only or 
some other way);
- how did you decide which issues are security-sensitive and which are not;
- how did you requested CVEs (for which issues, which info was required);
- (if you know) how security fixes were released by ffmpeg.
This kind of questions.

Given the sheer number of findings you probably did everything 
automatically?
