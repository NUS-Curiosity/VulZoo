Subject: CVE Request: information disclosure in MantisBT attachments

Please assign a CVE ID for the following issue.


Description:

MantisBT issue attachments can be downloaded without permission.

Due to an incorrect access check, by guessing the download URL 
correctly, unprivileged users can download files from a private project 
with restricted access to attachments, i.e. where 
$g_download_attachments_threshold /
$g_view_attachments_threshold are set e.g. to 55 (developer), if another 
project to which they have access does not restrict attachments download.

Affected versions:
<= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:
Issue was discovered by Florian Fuchs and fixed by Paul Richards (former 
MantisBT developer)
