Cats shouldn't be in bags, anyways.

The crasher has an OS/2 extra field that claims to have a compressed
block size of 52735 bytes and an uncompressed block size of 127 bytes.

The attached patch against UnZip 6.0 ensures, within extra fields, 
size(compressed) <= size(uncompressed) and should fix this issue.
