Subject: OpenBSD patch issue also affects GNU patch

Hi,

I saw this
http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=141693055412785&w=2

And thought "let's try this on GNU patch on my linux sys".

And bang... segfault.

I don't know if this is a random coincidence or if gnu patch and
openbsd patch share some common ancestor code (haven't checked details).

valgrind output indicates this is an oob write issue:
==22957== Invalid write of size 1
==22957==    at 0x40904A: another_hunk (pch.c:1902)
==22957==    by 0x40304E: main (patch.c:366)
==22957==  Address 0x80000000051d3b82 is not stack'd, malloc'd or
(recently) free'd
