Subject: Running Java across a privilege boundry

All,

Does anyone know of any obvious cases where Java is executed across a 
privilege boundary? I'm specifically thinking of cases where it might be 
executed via sudo, via another set[ug]id binary or where it gets called from 
an untrusted working directory i.e. one not owned by the calling user? FWIW, 
I'm looking at openjdk as it is distributed by various F/OSS distros which is 
why I'm emailing this list in particular.
