Thanks.

Here's some additional information to document this CVE.


Description:

The MantisBT Configuration Report page (adm_config_report.php) did not 
check that the config value retrieved from the cookie was valid, 
allowing XSS attacks.

The severity of this issue is mitigated by the need to have a 
high-privileged account (by default, administrator) to access the 
configuration report page.

Affected versions:
 >= 1.2.13, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:
Issue was discovered by Paul Richards, and jointly fixed by Paul 
Richards & Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer)
