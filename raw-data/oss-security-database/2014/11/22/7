"sudo service tomcat6 restart" would be a pretty obvious example that I
suspect is not uncommon in server environments.

In general, Java is a general-purpose programming language, so I think
there are plenty of examples of this just like there are with any other
programming language.  Any large system written in Java probably has a few
Java command-line tools or ways to spawn Java daemons, and in the normal
course of setting up a system, it's likely that someone is granting access
to run those tools via sudo.
