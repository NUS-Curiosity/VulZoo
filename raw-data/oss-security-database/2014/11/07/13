[Cc-ing Binutils ML back again]

Yeah, I think there was even an article in one of recent PLDIs which 
discussed different approaches to filtering duplicates arising in 
compiler fuzz testing (they did various combinations of stacktraces, 
Valgrind output, program coverage, etc.).  I was just curious how well 
this works for real world tasks like objdump crashes.
