american-fuzzy-lop kind of does that. It creates a hash among the code
path and groups fuzzing samples by that. That's quite convenient.

I am currently playing a lot with this. afl is in a somewhat
experimental state and you'll run into more problems trying to get it
running, but if it runs it is much more convenient than zzuf.
Disadvantage is you need to recompile stuff to work with it and that
sometimes fails, esp. when assembler is involved.
