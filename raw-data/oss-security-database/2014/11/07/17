Yes, you understood the bug correctly.

In reality, the vuln/bug is not a huge one. People _normally_ download
.deb files to install them.
But in some cases, that isn't always true.
If the bug was triggered before apt's signature handling, then it could
be a huge one. But it isn't(I'm guessing...)

And as I said, what if another program that, for example, integrates
with a browser, uses dpkg to analyze the .deb file.

The bug itself isn't confined to the -i flag either. It's in the
handling of the warnings. i.e very easy to trigger.

I'm taking a guess here, and going to say that there are other ways of
passing  arbitrary strings to the warning function. I may be wrong though.
