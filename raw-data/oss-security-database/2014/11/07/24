Anything in particular we're supposed to look at?  Besides the obvious
fact that anyone using rand() or random() in a security-conscious
program should be shot, and therefore, any possible bug in the
implementation of these notoriously weak functions shouldn't have any
implication on programs that use secure random number sources?
