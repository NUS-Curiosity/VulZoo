Subject: CVE Request for requests-kerberos

Hello all,

A fix was merged and released today for the package which performs
kerberos authentication when using python-requests. Prior to this,
every version of the package did not properly handle mutual
authentication which means that the client did not verify that the
user was communicating with a trusted server. The version which
contains the fix is 0.6 and all prior versions are considered
vulnerable.

Please assign a CVE to this issue.

Cheers,
Ian
