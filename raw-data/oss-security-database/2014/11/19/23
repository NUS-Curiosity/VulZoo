Subject: CVE request: icecast: possible leak of on-connect scripts

Good morning,

It was reported that Icecast could possibly leak the contents of 
on-connect scripts to clients, which may contain sensitive information. 
This issue has been fixed in the 2.4.1 release:

http://icecast.org/news/icecast-release-2_4_1/

"Fix on-connect and on-disconnect script STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR corruption 
due to shared file descriptors."
