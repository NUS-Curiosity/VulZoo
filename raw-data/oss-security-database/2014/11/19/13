Interesting and sort-of but no not really, but I appreciate the
pointer and thank you.

I see you're in Vietnam is there anything at all like a non-western
OS in use there? Or anywhere in that part of the world? I must be
naive but I thought I was just lacking information. It doesn't
seem possible that there are only "western" OSs on the entire
planet. Although my problem might just be that my definition of
OS is all wrong.
