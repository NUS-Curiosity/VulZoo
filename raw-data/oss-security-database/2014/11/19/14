I am not Vietnamese but I have spent a lot of time in Vietnam and occasionally
do business there.

No, there are no non-western OS in use there. It is pretty much all pirated
Windows. The hacker culture there is very small, nearly non-existent, although
the Saigon Linux User Group are very bright and capable albeit only maybe 4
regulars:

I am not aware of any non-western operating systems in use anywhere in the
world. Even China cribbed Linux for their "Red Flag" (now defunct,
surprisingly) OS:
