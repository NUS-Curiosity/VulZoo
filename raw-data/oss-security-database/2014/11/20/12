Only if Android has groups that act as "anti-capabilities", i.e. members
of the group are less privileged than non-members. For instance, if I
remember correctly, the grsecurity patchset has (or used to have) the
ability to deny networking to members of a designated group while
allowing it for everyone else.

I don't know of any groups in Android that are anti-capabilities, and
nothing in
<http://osxr.org/android/source/system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h>
looks like an obvious anti-capability. Do you know of any?
