Subject: Pending CVE assignments for SA-CORE-2014-006?

Hi

I just wanted to ask back if the CVEs for SA-CORE-2014-006[1] were
already requested (the advisory mention that they will be requested
and added to the advisory). If so this will ease tracking the two
issues. For reference they are:

> Session hijacking (Drupal 6 and 7)
> 
> A specially crafted request can give a user access to another user's
> session, allowing an attacker to hijack a random session.
> 
> This attack is known to be possible on certain Drupal 7 sites which
> serve both HTTP and HTTPS content ("mixed-mode"), but it is possible
> there are other attack vectors for both Drupal 6 and Drupal 7.
>
> Denial of service (Drupal 7 only)
> 
> Drupal 7 includes a password hashing API to ensure that user
> supplied passwords are not stored in plain text.
> 
> A vulnerability in this API allows an attacker to send specially
> crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory exhaustion. This may
> lead to the site becoming unavailable or unresponsive (denial of
> service).
> 
> This vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users.

They are fixed in Drupal7 7.34 and Drupal6 6.34.
