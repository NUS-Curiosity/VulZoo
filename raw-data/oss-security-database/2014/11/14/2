 unrestricted access

Hi,

What's holding this up?

As far as I read the oss-sec archive there are three unfixed mantis
vulnerabilities, one of them an sql injection, and the release supposed
to fix them is still not there (it's been two weeks since the first
issue hit oss-security).

Makes me feel mantis isn't really handling security issues in a
responsible way :-(

cu,
