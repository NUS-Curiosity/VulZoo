Correct.

Now in the CVE-2014-9093 case (where I got https://bugs.debian.org/771163, sigh,
in addition to your all-in-one and thus bogus in any case
bugs.debian.org/770166) the code is even so much different that I will even succeed backporting
it...

3.x is totally obsolete.
I'd assume anyone who really cares about doing stuff with LO uses wheezy-backpots
(which has a 4.3.3)
