Subject: CVE Request: polarssl

Hi,

https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/releases/polarssl-1.2.12-released

and

https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/releases/polarssl-1.3.9-released

have some security issues worth CVEs.

"On the security front this release fixes a mistake in the negotiation
introduced in PolarSSL 1.3.8. The mistake resulted in servers
negotiating a weaker signature algorithm than available. In addition
two remotely-triggerable memory leaks were found by the Codenomicon
Defensics tool and fixed in this release."

Ciao, Marcus
