It'd already be a good start to do this for format-parsing tools. So
stuff that runs on files. Everything else is more complicated, fuzzing
file formats is the easiest.

You may overestimate the complexity of afl. Once you get used to it it
basically takes minutes to start a fuzzing job.
And Michal is very open to suggestions to improve it (and it is
improving on a daily basis right now).

A bit sad is that afl+asan is somewhat tricky business, because that'd
be the ultimate combo.

I agree that it's not the best proxy for code quality. But for me what
is a good proxy for *project* quality is how they handle the bugs that
result from fuzzing.
While libbfd was in a terrible state, Nick did a marvellous job in
fixing everythin we reported in a timely manner.
Whilst for others you simply don't get a reply (or there is noone to
report to).

That's the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy project.
