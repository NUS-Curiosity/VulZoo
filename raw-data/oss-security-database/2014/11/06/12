This is a serious bug (it certainly circumvents the security of
OpenSSH), but I think
the proposed fix doesn't fit.

What might be a better solution is to store the public key for all
devices, and accept
if it matches any device you've talked to before.  On discovering a
new device, it shows
the fingerprint and prompts for a name/description.

Then you can revoke devices in some other part of the UI when you need
to clean up.
