Subject: CVE request for Apache Traffic Server

 Versions Affected:  v4.0.2 to 4.1.2
Not affected: >= 4.2.0

The vulnerability is due to unescaped hostnames. If we change the hostname
in the HTTP header by HTML code, Apache Traffic Server does not properly
filter HTML code from user-supplied input before displaying the input. A
remote user can cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target
user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the Apache
software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result,
the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including
authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data
recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take
actions on the site acting as the target user. I

I believe it is similar to CVE-2012-3499.

I did several tests and I was able to get the user cookies by changing the
hostname (in the HTTP header) to this code <img src=x
onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-3095S

Should this issue have a CVE assigned?
