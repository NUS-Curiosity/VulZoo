I'd consider "few hours of afl-fuzzing" not to be low hanging fruit,
but opinions may differ on that (I'm currently only focusing on
software where I get the crashers within minutes).

But appart from that: The first bug is marked as fixed but no
indication is given whether the fix went upstream. Did you do that or
should it be reported to gettext?

(Actually that's also a thing I also see far too often - bugs get
reported somehow in public, but the reports don't arrive at the
appropriate upstreams)
