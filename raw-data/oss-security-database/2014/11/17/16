Everybody wants to play with a shiny new toys but old ones are also good 
sometimes:

$ printf 'msgid "a"\nmsgstr "b"' > test.po
$ msgfmt test.po -o test.mo
$ time zzuf -qcs: msgunfmt test.mo
zzuf[s=93318,r=0.004]: signal 11 (SIGSEGV)

real	6m30.636s
user	0m1.212s
sys	0m14.853s

Actually, afl-fuzz found a crash in it in 1 min 33 sec.
