Subject: Wordpress WP-DB-Backup v2.2.4 Plugin Remote Database Backup Download
 Vulnerability

Hello List,

So I had been tinkering with the WP-DB-Backup v2.2.4 plugin that uses security through obscurity to hide the location of the wordpress database backups it creates.  The advisory with PoC I had been working on is here: 

http://www.vapid.dhs.org/advisories/wordpress/plugins/wp-db-backup-v2.2.4/

I contacted the plugin author with my advisory and my proposed fix. The author acknowledged my work, but I never heard from him again.

Turns out Matthew Bryant had already covered everything I had but a few months ago here:

http://thehackerblog.com/auditing-wp-db-backup-wordpress-plugin-why-using-the-database-password-for-entropy-is-a-bad-idea/

We arenâ€™t sure if this is CVE worthy, it seems since the database is exposed one only needs to guess the database name in order to succeed besides a bunch of brute forcing stuff. :-)  I thought I would see what you folks had to say.


Thanks
Larry
