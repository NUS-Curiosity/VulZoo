It all comes down to code, whether out of the browser, in it, written
in javascript, or a pure C implementation. So I disagree.

Just to give an example of an in-browser crash, the other day I opened
a 4-years old pdf of a random company and it made chromium's pdf
plugin crash.
No problem opening it with pdf.js under firefox or poppler.
