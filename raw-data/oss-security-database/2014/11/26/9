Correct, the BSD patch programs (which mostly derived from OpenBSD
these days) are siblings to GNU patch, therefore the basic fundamentals
are equal, yet they differ among their functionality.  In this regard,
GNU patch is definitely leading.

After creating a patch for OpenBSD, I have also created a bug report
through bug-patch@, here:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-patch/2014-11/msg00007.html

So by now, there are two reports.  Good to see that this was discovered
on an OpenBSD mailing list and reported to other software projects, too!
