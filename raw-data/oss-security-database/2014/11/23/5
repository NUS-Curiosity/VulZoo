It's not like I'm literally "approving" (or not) postings to distros.
Yours got to distros list members right after it was received by the
server.  However, I think it's better discussed on oss-security right
away, without use of the distros list.  The distros list is for issues
where distros are expected to prepare updates during the not-too-long
embargo period, and the "instant" availability of updates when the issue
is finally made public benefits the end-users in a significant way.
I doubt that the issue at hand fits this description.  I think almost
all of the (relatively few?) systems where this issue matters (where it
lets an attacker bypass a privilege boundary, yet no other at least
similarly easy and obvious bypass exists and is likely known to the
attacker) would probably be slow to update anyway.

So far no distro has expressed any interest in having this embargoed.

Distros list members: please speak up (here or on the distros list, with
Tim CC'ed) if you'd like this embargoed.

Tim: if until Tuesday no distro says they want this embargoed, please go
ahead and make the issue fully public.  (On a related note, I hate it
when an issue is sort of "semi-public".  It's the worst possible case.
When this happens, it's a reason to opt for a shorter embargo period, or
for none at all indeed.)  If an embargo is requested, please make sure
there's an exact date and time for the planned public disclosure.

Thanks,

Alexander
