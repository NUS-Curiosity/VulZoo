Hello Agostino,

I agree that world-readable log files is a problem and should be fixed.
However, should this be given a CVE?

Do those log files contain any information that would be considered a
security risk? It's been quite a few years, admittedly, since I've worked
with Icecast so I don't remember if those files contain any information
that could be considered a problem.

Cheers!
-Tim
