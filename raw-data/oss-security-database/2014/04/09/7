<@lampska> @cynicalsecurity It was independent co-discovery. Plan was for responsible disclosure but it leaked (dunno where) forcing openssl go public

<_snagg> Wait, CloudFare fixed the OpenSSL bug 1week ago?somebody is getting the hang of this 'responsible disclosure' thing http://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-ahead-of-openssl-vulnerabilities
<@lampska> @_snagg Independent co-discovery. Plan was a responsible disclosure, but it went public too soon http://www.heartbeat.com
<@ysaw> @lampska @_snagg why did some get notified last week, but other didn't get notified until it went public?
<@lampska> @ysaw @_snagg I do not have visibility to what happened there. I do know we had just started conversations with CERTs when this went public
