Yes, it does affect clients.

Yeah, anyone connecting to any TLS server using a libssl client is
affected. Most web browsers actually don't use OpenSSL but rather nss,
but other clients (like, for example, svn/git/etc., wget/curl etc.) are
affected if they are linked against OpenSSL.

All users, obviously.

People insist on server because that's the urgent problem. If NSS was
vulnerable, it'd be really bad because it's pretty easy to trick any
browser to open a connection to a random TLS website which would try to
steal stuff from the browser memory (although sandboxing might help).
For libssl clients though, I'm not sure it's that easy, but it's still
possible.

I don't have much clue about Android, but I think I heard heartbeat was
disabled in Android, but I don't have a link right now. Also, I'm unsure
what actually use libssl in Android and what uses NSS.
