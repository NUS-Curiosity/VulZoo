Subject: Two security flaws with json-c

Hi All,

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered two flaws
in json-c, details as follows:

1.  CVE-2013-6371 json-c: hash collision DoS

The hash function in the json-c library was weak, and that parsing
smallish JSON strings showed quadratic timing behaviour.  This could
cause an application linked to the json-c library, and that processes
some specially-crafted JSON data, to use excessive amounts of CPU.

2. CVE-2013-6370 json-c: buffer overflow if size_t is larger than int

The printbuf APIs used in the json-c library used ints for counting
buffer lengths, which is inappropriate for 32bit architectures.  These
functions need to be changed to using size_t if possible for sizes, or
to be hardened against negative values if not.  This could be used to
cause a denial of service in an application linked to the json-c library.

Both these issues are fixed via the following upstream commit:
