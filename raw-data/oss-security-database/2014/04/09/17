Can anyone explain how an attack scenario would work?
Is it like:
* we have a Man-in-the-Middle.
* Client/Server establish connection.
* MitM inserts a malicious package with the heartbeat-payload and sends
  it to the client, client parses package, verifying MAC fails, but it
  still will output memory

Or is it ONLY an issue if we contact a malicious server that may
extract random information from the application's memory? (which would
reduce the impact somewhat, e.g. operating system update systems or
wget etc. wouldn't have to worry)

Seems Android disabled Heartbeat in 2012:
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/openssl.git/+/android-4.1.2_r1

Still leaves some android versions as potentially vulnerable.
