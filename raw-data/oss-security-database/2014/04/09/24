Subject: pam_cifscreds stack overflow

Hi

We are tracking a patch at:

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=870168

which fixes a overflow in the cifskey.c (taken from
Linux CIFS VFS) as used in pam_cifscreds. I did not
check upstream length checking during their packet processing
but I doubt the same fixed max length's also apply ad-hoc to
pam processing of user and password.

Sebastian
