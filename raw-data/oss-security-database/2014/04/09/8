After i sent a mail to distros, i was contacted by security engineers
from most major distributions. I answered most of the them as soon as i
could with complete details including the upstream patch.

Some of them mailed during my night time. I saw these emails the next
day, and it was pointless to answer them at that time, since the issue
was already public.
