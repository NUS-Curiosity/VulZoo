Subject: CVE request: cross-site scripting issue fixed in CUPS 1.7.2

Hi,

As reported in <https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13196>, the CUPS 
1.7.2 release (<http://www.cups.org/blog.php?L717>) fixes a cross-site 
scripting issue:

http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4356
http://www.cups.org/strfiles.php/3268/str4356.patch

It may only affect certain configurations - I was not able to reproduce 
the issue on Fedora 19 and 20. Also, the patch may not be sufficient to 
cover all different encodings, other special characters of interest etc.

Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already?

Thanks,
