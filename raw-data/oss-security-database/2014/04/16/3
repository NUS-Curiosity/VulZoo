Subject: libmms heap-based buffer overflow fix

Hello list,

It seems libmms has fixed a buffer overflow in a recent 0.6.4 version
with the following commit.

http://sourceforge.net/p/libmms/code/ci/03bcfccc22919c72742b7338d02859962861e0e8

This may be triggered via an overly long line of a MMSH (MMS over
HTTP) server response, effectively overflowing the buffer which has a
static size (defined as BUF_SIZE, didn't check the actual numeric
value).

Please assign a CVE name for this, if there is none.

Kind regards,
Z.
