Subject: CVE request Linux kernel: mm: try_to_unmap_cluster() should lock_page()
 before mlocking

    Hello,

Linux kernel kernel's Memory Management Unit(MMU) is vulnerable to a crash
caused by unlocked memory pages. It could occur during the memory page
migration or while cleaning the swap cache pages.

An unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the system kernel,
resulting in DoS.
