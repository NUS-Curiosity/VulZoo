Alexander,

just a short reply: I appreciate your serious consideration and fair
reasoning for your decision and can definitely live with it. When we
(Qlustar) meet more of your specified criteria I might reapply.

Thanks for the time you put into this particular issue and for the
effort on these lists in general.
