Hello all,

These issues have been discussed in depth on many fora by now, but
replying just for the record:

Codenomicon did find the bug independently. Codenomicon did not notify
anyone else than us. We did not notify anyone else but OpenSSL. We did
request a CVE for "a critical issue in OpenSSL" from CERT/CC but did
not provide them any details at that time.

We received the vulnerability report from Codenomicon on Thursday the
3rd of April, at around 14.30 EEST. AFAIK Codenomicon had found the
vulnerability at around 09.30 EEST on the same day, while developing
new features to their test tools. We spent a few hours reproducing the
issue, followed by a couple of days of work on the technical report
and other preparatory material for the coordination effort, impact
assessment, etc.
