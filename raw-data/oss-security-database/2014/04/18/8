See the original advisory
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/240), which calls bash
command substitutions out as being handled already.

Specifically:

""""
The code is also making sure that arguments do not contain bash command
substitution i.e. $(ps aux)

if(strstr(macro_argv[x],"$(")) {
        syslog(LOG_ERR,"Error: Request contained a bash command
substitution!"); return ERROR;
""""
