I worked closely with Anthony when we were both employed by IBM. I know
him very well in a work setting and also quite well outside of work.

I've spoken with him, face-to-face over dinner at LinuxCon/Plumbers
2013 [1], about his decision to leave IBM [2] and take a position at
Amazon. I knew it involved EC2 but he could not divulge details at the
time. I have absolutely no concerns about Anthony's request being
devious in nature, especially considering that two other Amazon
employees are saying that he's the right contact for the company.

I also think his knowledge of the Linux virtualization stack would be
a great addition to the list.

I'll leave the discussion about if/when Amazon should gain access to the
distros lists to others, but I do vouch for Anthony.
