Amazon's interest here isn't sudden; when I intereviewed with Amazon
roughly two years ago, it was for more or less this role, security work
for the Amazon Linux AMI. At the time I recommended building a history of
security bulletins and publicly contributing to fixes and discussions. At
least the security bulletins has happened.. :)

Sadly I can't speak to any of the specific team members; I don't recall
any of the names currently under discussion.

Thanks
