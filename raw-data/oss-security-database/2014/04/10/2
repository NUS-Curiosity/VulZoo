We use DKIM which doesn't work very well with all mailing lists.  You
should receive this okay since you are on CC but I'm not sure everyone
will get this through the mailing list.  If it doesn't make it, I'll
send this same (signed) message via the @codemonkey.ws address.

I also added this address as a uid to my key.  Here it is again:

pub   2048R/5682E5FF 2013-07-30
      Key fingerprint = EF0F 60F4 390F A270 BC30  4A93 1AAD C710 5682 E5FF
uid                  Anthony Liguori <aliguori@...zon.com>
uid                  Anthony Liguori <anthony@...emonkey.ws>
sub   2048R/44FFA77F 2013-07-30

Yes, this is an official request on behalf of Amazon.  I am requesting
access on behalf of the Amazon Linux AMI team[1].
