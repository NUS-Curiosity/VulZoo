Subject: jbigkit security flaw

Hi All,

Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team found a stack-based
buffer overflow flaw in the libjbig library (part of jbigkit).  A
specially-crafted image file read by libjbig could be used to cause a
program linked to libjbig to crash or, potentially, to execute
arbitrary code.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2013-6369.
