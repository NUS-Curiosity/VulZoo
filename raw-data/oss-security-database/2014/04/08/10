So to respond/clear up some points:

It appears Codenomicon and Google found the vulnerability
independently. Google reported it to OpenSSL. Codenomicon reported it
to NCSC-FI, I'm not sure who (Codenomicon or NCSC-FI) drove the
notification of CloudFlare/etc. and they also reported it to OpenSSL
(I don't know if that was before or after notifying OpenSSL).

1) Mark J. Cox did not give Red Hat any advanced warning, he strongly
separates what he does with OpenSSL with what he does with Red Hat
(this is quite common at Red Hat, for example we have a guy on the
Debian security team, the Samba group, etc.). I for example sometimes
issue private CVE's in advance, but they don't get bugs filed/etc
until they hit a "public" source like distros@ or oss-security@.

2) Mark informed Red Hat and as you can see from the public time line
Huzaifa entered a bug into BZ and then notified distros@ about 14
minutes later, basically at the same time. Red Hat SRT is globally
situated so anyone from distros@ emailing us for details would have
gotten a very prompt response.

3) At this point the plan was to embargo this until April 9th (I
forget what time), giving everyone 2+ days to deal with it. So OpenSSL
in conjunction with Red Hat attempted to do a coordinated response
with the community.

4) Things blew up. My understanding is that OpenSSL made this public
due to additional reports, I suspect it boiled down to "Group A found
this flaw, reported it, and has a reproducer, and now Group B found
the same thing independently and also has a reproducer. chances are
the bad guys do as well so better to let everyone know the barn door
is open now rather than wait 2 more days" but there may be other
factors I'm not aware.

5) Monday morning: everyone is scrambling to get patches out and
update systems.

6) At least one vendor (CloudFlare) posts a blog entry stating they
were notified a week ago by Codenomicon/NCSC-FI , and claiming that it
was via "responsible disclosure". Other major vendors were not
informed (e.g. Amazon:
http://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/heartbleed-bug-concern/).


7) At least one vendor (Google) found this independently and, as I
understand it, patched their own systems (which is completely
understandable).

As you can see above, it was attempted, but Murphy's law took over.
