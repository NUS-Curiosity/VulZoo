validity leading to a hypervisor crash and host Denial of Service.

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious guest can crash the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.

x86 systems are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

None.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

that there was a security problem.

CREDITS
=======

aspect was diagnosed by Julien Grall.
