I don't think this is an issue on its own. 
Not disabling javascript could be treated as one.
I haven't tried myself, but can plugins be loaded? if that's so then there's
a bigger risk here.

Just like the above.

I wouldn't treat that as an issue, I would expect applications to disable
javascript appropriately.

Agreed.

Sure, not allowing xmlhttprequest when the context and the request are both
file:// should have been expected to cause disruptions.

Further investigation is needed. If they were fixed at different times they
might each deserve their own CVE.

No matter what they say or do, this is an issue.
