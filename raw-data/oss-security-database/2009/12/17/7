That's the normal behavior of the PHP team. As far as I know, they are 
not willing to announce security-related fixes unless the issues are quite 
important. The vulnerabilities are silently fixed.

I think, we should contact PHP developers about security related issues 
from the release of the last php version (5.2.11, e.g) up to now. We can 
miss some issues that have already been fixed. It would be better to get 
an issue list from vendor. I hope they will be responsive.
