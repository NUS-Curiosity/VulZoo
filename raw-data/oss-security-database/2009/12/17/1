I think part of the underlying problem is that we're talking about blended 
threats (in the case of Ark and KMail).  I took an agressive view regarding 
the issues as I originally discussed them when I dealt with them but for many 
reasons we reached a stale mate.  We ended up releasing things as they were 
to get them into the domain where they could better be discussed and 
discussed.  Retrospectively, I would go with CVEs for the the following:

* Ark Uses KHTML For Rendering Unknown File Types
* KMail Allows Attachment Spoofing
* Javascript Enabled On KHTML Based Views By Default
* KJS/KIO Slaves Enforcing Broken Same Origin Policy

Note that KDE's fix for the latter has caused some complaints, something that 
I suspect they were mindful of when we discussed the issues:  

* http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=83649

On top of this we have a raft of IO slave related vulnerabilities (which KDE, 
oCERT and Portcullis agreed about) .  I'm not sure what the status of each of 
these is, as Thomas alluded to they were fixed at various times (I'm not even 
100% sure they're all fixed now).  I would create another CVE for these.

Finally, there is the issue with KWallet which KDE never addressed.  The 
closest I got to an answer regarding this was that users complained too much 
even now about the matching, so adding additional restrictions were 
unwelcome.
