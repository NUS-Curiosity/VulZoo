Subject:  CVE request: php5: multiple issues

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Stefan Esser on his "Shocking News in PHP Exploitation"[1] presentation
reports and analyses a couple of issues:

* usort() interruption memory corruption:
uksort() although not mentioned on the presentation is also affected. It was
recently fixed in 5.2.12 but not considered security-relevant by upstream
* explode() information leak
* serialize() information leak

As mentioned by the presentation all these are local vulnerabilities.

Additionally, I've started to closely follow upstream development and found
the following issues that were or have not been mentioned anywhere else:

Null pointer dereference:
http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=292083

This one looks suspicious, basically a switch from sprintf to snprintf which
apparently already happened in the other branches at some point:
http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=291888

Improper decoding, not sure what the impact could be:
http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=291586

Insufficient memory allocation for unicode strings:
http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=291259

I think a cross-vendor security support and tracking effort for php5 is
needed. The number of issues silently fixed are a continuous risk, leaving
users exposed.
What does the others think?
