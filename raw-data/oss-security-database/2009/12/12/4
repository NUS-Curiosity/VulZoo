Subject:  CVE request: polipo DoS via overly large "Content-Length" header

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

A vulnerability has been found in polipo that allows a remote attacker to
crash the daemon via an overly large "Content-Length" header.
The vulnerability is caused by connection->reqlen (in client.c:
httpClientDiscardBody()) being a signed integer which can be overflowed
turning it into a negative value which later leads to a segmentation fault
in the call to memmove.
