Actually, you can ignore this request. So what happened was that, there 
were actually two patches for this, but Johannes combined them together 
when he shared the fix with us. So, this is part of the fixes for 
CVE-2009-4026: upstream commits (1) 4253119a and (2) 827d42c9.

Hope this clears up the confusion!

Thanks, Eugene
