Subject: Need more information on recent poppler issues


DSA-1941 lists three reserved CVE entries for Poppler issues, but there
aren't any more details, which makes it difficult to create CVE
descriptions.  Specifically, CVE-2009-3906, CVE-2009-3907, and
CVE-2009-3908 don't have any details as far as I can tell.

Can anybody help?
