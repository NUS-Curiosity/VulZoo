Subject: CVE request: acl 2.2.47 always follows symlinks

setfacl/getfacl (part of package acl-2.2.47) contains a bug that it ignores 
the --physical/-P parameter that means don't follow symlinks on -R 
(recursive).

This can lead to security problems, e.g. if there's a cron script giving a 
user full rwX rights for a directory, he can put a symlink there pointing to / 
or /etc or whatever.
Another scenario would be a backup script saving the /home acls to a file, 
every user can create an endless loop for that and prevent the script from 
completing.

Fixed in upstream source, but no new release yet.
Please assign a CVE.
