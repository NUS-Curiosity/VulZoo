Subject: CVE request - kernel: fuse_ioctl_copy_user() dos

Reported by David Shaw. There is a problem in the ioctl handler in the 
fuse kernel code that causes a panic under some circumstances.

fuse_ioctl_copy_user() was introduced in 59efec7b (v2.6.29-rc1, 
2008-11-26). This was fixed upstream but was missed in 2.6.30.y. The 
most recent 2.6.31/32.y kernels already have this fix. So this only 
affects distros that are still using 2.6.30.y.
