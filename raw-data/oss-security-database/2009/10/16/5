Subject: QEMU VNC use-after-free

Hi!

Use-after-free / double-free problems were reported for QEMU's VNC
server:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=501131
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=505641

Problem can cause QEMU process (and hence virtual machine) to crash
(which is not security in most use cases, as VNC access means console
access for the virtual machine), but if used for code execution, it can
mean guest -> host escape.

Versions in between the following two commits are affected:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/qemu.git/commit/?id=753b405331
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/qemu.git/commit/?id=198a0039c5
