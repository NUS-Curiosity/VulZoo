OK, let's do this:

CVE-2009-3692 can be "recast" so that it only addresses the shell metachar
injection in popen.

I've assigned a new CVE-2009-3704 to concentrate only on the strncpy().
Any thoughts on exploitability might be nice.

Regarding http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog this URL is generic:
"fixed vulnerability that allowed to execute commands with root
privileges."  This implies only one problem, not too.  Are we sure that
the changelog addresses both problems?
