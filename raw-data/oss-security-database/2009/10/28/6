So I've deliberately not allocated one because we generally do not 
consider a crash of a user application like a PDF reader to be a security 
issue.  However CVE does have a few cases where CVE names were allocated 
for such cases, so if any vendor here is going to treat this as a security 
issue let me know and I'll allocate a name for tracking purposes.

Thanks, Mark
