Correct.  And the fixes brought in as part of those updates are
possible spread across multiple upstream versions, which is a common
reason to do a CVE split.

It's listed among libvorbis bugs and I wasn't able to tell if there was
only liboggplay-side issue.

I've only added a comment to 515889, which seems to be a dupe of one
older vorbis CVE.

Thank you!
