I think we used one CVE per library upgrade, so three in total
(libvorbis, liboggz, liboggplay). As for individual fixes, I don't
really know if that's possible, as I mentioned earlier, due to the fact
that fixes were dependent on other changes that you would need to
backport, too, which all just ends badly. :(

Feel free to comment in the bugs asking questions. If you don't receive
a response in a reasonable amount of time from one of the developers,
drop me a note OOB, and I'll see about making sure somebody replies to
you. I'm by no means the media library expert, so I don't know all of
the details myself. Bug 499512 seems to be a liboggplay issue fixed by
bug 512328. As for 501279#c5, you'll just have to ask the developers.

I think the advisory is missing a few bugs and is mislabeling a few
others. If I get a chance, I'll edit the advisories to add a few
other bugs (like 512328). However, if you notice any issues yourself
with the advisory, please feel free to report any issues to me or to
security@.... We try to be good at bug dependencies, so if you
loop through the bug chains, you may find some bugs that help you better
understand all the issues that were fixed by the upgrades.
