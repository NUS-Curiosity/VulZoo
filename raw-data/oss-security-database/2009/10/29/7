Subject: MFSA 2009-63

Hi!

Has anyone been looking into MFSA 2009-63 already trying to figure out
what really got fixed?  We have some notes in:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-3379
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-3377

but I'm still not quite convinced we have a full list of upstream
commits that need backporting.  Has anyone got any further already?
