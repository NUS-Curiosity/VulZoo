Based on the additional comments in the upstream bug:
  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?25296

> CVE-2009-1214 - world-readable permissions

This should be expected and intended behavior.

> CVE-2009-1215 - symlink following

There should be no real symlink issue for /tmp/screen-exchange in the
upstream version.  Debian screen version seems to have a patch, that
introduces a symlink flaw, but it does not depend on any race
condition.  Description for this one may need to be updated.
