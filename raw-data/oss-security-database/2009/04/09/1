Ah, sorry for using confusing wording.  I was only trying to say that
the affected code was only introduced in 5.2.7, but anyone backporting
upstream patch for CVE-2008-5658 may actually introduce this problem in
earlier version.  I have no reason to believe 5.2.8 is not affected,
5.2.7 was supposed to give "first affected" version.
