Subject: Solaris/OpenSolaris xscreensaver issue (CVE-2009-1276)

Is anyone familiar with Solaris or OpenSolaris at all?

They've released a bulletin about a security issue with xscreensaver,
but I don't recall seeing anything else about this issue so I'm
wondering if it is specific to Solaris.

Does anyone know more about this?
