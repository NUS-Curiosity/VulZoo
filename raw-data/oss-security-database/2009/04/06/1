Subject: CVE request: kernel: NFS: Fix an Oops in encode_lookup()

According to the upstream commit 54af3bb543, the NFS file name limit is
not being initialised correctly in the struct nfs_server. The problem
can be easily triggered by a local, unprivileged user. We need to make
sure that we limit whatever is being set in nfs_probe_fsinfo() and
nfs_init_server(). We also need to ensure that readdirplus and
nfs4_path_walk respect our file name limits.
