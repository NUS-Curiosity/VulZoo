Subject: CVE request -- bibtex, pam_ssh

Hello Steve,

  could you allocate new CVE ids for the following two issues:

1, bibtex invalid reads/writes when parsing big *.bib file
          (valgrind reports suspicious behavior)
   References: 
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=520920  (texlive-base-bin)
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=492136 (tetex, texlive)

   The problem is in bibtex, but looks like it is shipped
   in various packages for various vendors.

2, pam_ssh Password prompt varies for existent and non-existent users
   References: 
   http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=263579
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=492153

   While this is not problem of pam, pam_ssh is affected.
   Also admit this is a very low security issue (affecting
   special configurations), but in any case the password
   prompt should be always the same. Successfully reproduced.

Thanks, Jan.
