Linux-specific modifications to a 20-year old API break cross-platform
software. May I remind you that not all the world runs Linux.

On the other hand, no cross-platform software will break if one
adds a Linux-specific extension to the API.

I haven't yet pointed out the problems with automatic hostname
lookups from hosts_ctl(). One problem is that it breaks programs
that must not do hostname lookups such as portmappers.

Programs like the portmapper should not do hostname lookups, because
that would result in infinite recursion when host lookups involve
SUNRPC services such as NIS.

Again, not all the world is Linux. Making platform-specific changes
to a 20-year old API breaks cross-platform software in unexpected ways.
