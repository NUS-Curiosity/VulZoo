Subject: CVE request: kernel: 'kill sig -1' must only apply to caller's PID
 namespace

I came across this while reviewing some older upstream patches.

Apparently, it was possible to run kill <sig> -1 to kill processes in
all PID namespaces, and break the isolation of namespaces. The expected
behaviour for this is to only kill processes in its own hierarchy. The
fix uses task_pid_vnr() to check if the process is outside of the
caller's namespace before killing.

PID namespaces was merged in 2.6.24.
