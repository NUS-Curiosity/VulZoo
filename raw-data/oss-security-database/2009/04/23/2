Subject: CVE request: kernel: missing capabilities in fs_mask

"When POSIX capabilities were introduced during the 2.1 Linux cycle, the
fs mask, which represents the capabilities which having fsuid==0 is
supposed to grant, did not include CAP_MKNOD and CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE.
However, before capabilities the privilege to call these did in fact
depend upon fsuid==0.

This patch introduces those capabilities into the fsmask, restoring the
old behavior.

See the thread starting at http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/3/11/157 for reference.

Note that if this fix is deemed valid, then earlier kernel versions (2.4
and 2.2) ought to be fixed too.

Changelog:
 [Mar 23] Actually delete old CAP_FS_SET definition...
 [Mar 20] Updated against J. Bruce Fields's patch"
