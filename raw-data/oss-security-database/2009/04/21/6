======================================================
Name: CVE-2009-1358
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1358
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/356012

apt-get in apt before 0.7.21 does not check for the correct error code
from gpgv, which causes apt to treat a repository as valid even when
it has been signed with a key that has been revoked or expired, which
might allow remote attackers to trick apt into installing malicious
repositories.
