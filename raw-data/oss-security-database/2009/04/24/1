How is this different than CVE-2009-1072?  That CVE is based on the same
bug report by Igor Zhbanov, although the description doesn't mention
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE.

nfsd in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28.9 does not drop the CAP_MKNOD
capability before handling a user request in a thread, which allows
local users to create device nodes, as demonstrated on a filesystem
that has been exported with the root_squash option.
