Subject: CVE request: kernel: ipv6: null pointer dereference in __inet6_check_established()

According to the upstream commit 3f53a381, "we already have a valid net
in that place, but... the tw pointer can be NULL there sometimes, thus
causing an oops in NET_NS=y case.

The same place in ipv4 code already works correctly using existing
net, rather than tw's one."

The bug exists since 2.6.27.
