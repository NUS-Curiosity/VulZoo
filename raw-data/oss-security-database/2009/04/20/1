Subject: CVE request: kernel: cifs: fix unicode string area word alignment
 in session setup

According to the upstream commit 27b87fe5, "the handling of unicode
string area alignment is wrong. decode_unicode_ssetup improperly assumes
that it will always be preceded by a pad byte. This isn't the case if
the string area is already word-aligned.

This problem, combined with the bad buffer sizing for the serverDomain
string can cause memory corruption. The bad alignment can make it so
that the alignment of the characters is off. This can make them
translate to characters that are greater than 2 bytes each. If this
happens we can overflow the allocation."

This is similar to the bug Marcus posted recently.
