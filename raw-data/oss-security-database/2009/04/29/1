To summarize (and make sure I understand), the plan is to create a
single CVE for a collection of CIFS fixes. So far, this series includes
the following changesets, but others may be added as well:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.29.y.git;a=commitdiff;h=15bd8021d870d2c4fbf8c16578d72d03cfddd3a7
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfrench/cifs-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=f083def68f84b04fe3f97312498911afce79609e
http://git.kernel.org/linus/27b87fe52baba0a55e9723030e76fce94fabcea4
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfrench/cifs-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7b0c8fcff47a885743125dd843db64af41af5a61
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfrench/cifs-2.6.git;a=commit;h=968460ebd8006d55661dec0fb86712b40d71c413

Is that correct? If so, is there an estimate for when this set will be
deemed complete and a CVE assigned?

I think that if we wait too long to close this, we'll end up with
distributions releasing updates with only a subset of these
fixes, which would make this "collection" somewhat difficult to track
by CVE ID handle. I'm otherwise quite happy with this plan, fwiw.
