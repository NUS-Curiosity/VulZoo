Hello again Steve,

  got couple of points to discuss yet:

  1, thanks! for all the CVEs (probably more reports still
to come, since currently still investigating all
the F10 srpms code in Everything repo to ensure we didn't
miss something). Recommending other distros to behave in
similar way.

  2,

Not aware of any upstream Python bug report
yet (there are still some obstacles with the patch :(,
so it seems the upstream root Python issue fix can not
be expected any time soon (that's why we reported this issue
in most affected applications/packages at least).

Current RH status can be seen here:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1 and here:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c4 and here:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c5

For testing purposes it is possible to use Ray Strode's test case
from:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8

The Python upstream bug report will follow as soon as we will
find a patch, which would resolve also the 'sub-modules,
which are in more than a one file' ('import utils' example) case.

3, The original CVE-2008-5983 description will need modification.
Robert is right, this issue is still present also in Python
2.6 (even absolute imports didn't resolve it). For more
details please proceed to:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/01/28/5 and to:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1

So please update the text of CVE-2008-5983 to state:

"... in Python prepends an empty string to sys.path ...".

Thanks && regards, Jan.
