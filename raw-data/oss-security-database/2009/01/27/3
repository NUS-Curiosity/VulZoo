Subject: CVE Request: winetricks symlink problem

Hi,

The winetricks script (for installing windows components into
a Wine environment) has a /tmp race when displaying a menu
to select components to install.

Fixed in winetricks 20081223 by this commit:
	http://code.google.com/p/winezeug/source/detail?r=253

Ciao, Marcus
