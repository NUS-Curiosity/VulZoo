Subject: CVE request -- git

Hi Steve,

could you please assign a CVE for this bug:

| Current gitweb has a possible local privilege escalation bug that allows a
| malicious repository owner to run a command of his choice by specifying
| diff.external configuration variable in his repository and running a
| crafted gitweb query.
|
| [...] Maintenance release v1.6.0.6, v1.5.6.6, v1.5.5.6 and v1.5.4.7
| are already available at k.org (see the announcement for v1.6.0.6 I
| sent out a few minutes ago), and the master branch and others pushed
| out tonight have the same fix. [...]

It's from 2008, so maybe it should get a 2008 number.

Thanks,
Florian
