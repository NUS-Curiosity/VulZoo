                       Submission Deadline:  January 30, 2009



Brief Description: Collaboration relies on distributed systems that
provide the required security properties.  Virtual organizations often
use the Internet to support collaboration.  The Internet, operating
systems and distributed environments currently suffer from poor
security support and cannot resist common attacks (spamming, worms,
session hijacking, buffer overflow, denial of service, social
engineering, etc.).  Collaborative organizations require better
security properties (strong authentication, efficient encryption,
Mandatory Access Control, integrity, non-repudiation and
availability).  Nowadays, collaborative organizations use new
technologies such as mobile devices, smartcards, wireless networks,
high performance networks, grid computing, multi-agent systems,
peer-to-peer systems, sensor networks.  These environments introduce
new needs, requirements and difficulties related to security.  Hence,
collaborative organizations and technologies face several challenges in
the field of security.

This Workshop on Security and Collaboration - to be held as part of the
2009 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems
(CTS'09) - will focus on security issues related to collaborative
systems with emphasis on distributed environments, smartcards, grid,
clusters and multi-agent systems, mobile and wireless cooperation.  The
aim is to have a dedicated workshop that fosters closer interactions
among researchers and users communities, providing an excellent
opportunity for them to meet and discuss their ideas.  It addresses
specifically relationships between collaborative systems and security.
It intends to present new challenges and solutions related to latest
security requirements, specific methods of access control enabling
large scale cooperation, usage of mobile technologies and smartcards,
new security infrastructures supporting better prevention, detection,
recovery and healing in the context of cooperative systems.

We invite original contributions from researchers in academia, research
institutions and industry on these emerging and important areas of
information technology.

Workshop topics must address security and collaboration:
*  Frameworks for Security in Collaborative Systems
*  Access Control in Collaborative Environments
*  Trusted Operating Systems for Distributed Environments
*  Security of Grid and Cluster Architectures Supporting Cooperative
Applications
*  Honeypots for Collaborative Systems
*  Intrusion and Attacks Detection for Collaborative Systems
*  Role Based Security, Reputation, and Trust
*  Cross Domain Identity Management Systems Collaboration
*  Collaborative Security Monitoring Schemes and Systems
*  Web Services Security
*  Privacy Protection for Collaborative Systems
*  Encryption and Cryptography Systems Supporting Cooperative Systems
*  Use of Smartcards in the Context of Collaboration
*  Disclosure and Integrity Issues of Collaborative systems
*  Resistance to Denial of Service in Collaborative systems
*  Detection and Self-Recovery Schemes and Strategies Supporting
Cooperation
*  Security in Multi Agent Systems
*  Secure Collaborative Agents
*  Using Multi Agent Systems for Security
*  Security in Mobile and Wireless Networks
*  Security of Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks
*  Security in Peer to Peer Networks
*  Security in Social Networks

Submission Instructions:

Papers reporting original and unpublished research results on above and
any other related topics are solicited.  Submission should include a
cover page with authors' names, affiliations, addresses, fax and phone
numbers, and email addresses. Include up to 6 keywords from the above
list and an abstract of no more than 300 words.  Authors can submit
their contribution as a short or long contribution:

Short paper: it should present ongoing work of the researchers in order
to communicate and share their current ideas with the community.  It
could also present new extended results of a previously published
paper. Short papers should not exceed 4 pages in length in
single-space, two columns IEEE format Conference style.

Long paper: this is a full research paper presenting innovative and
interesting research results, containing original and new material.
Long papers should not exceed 8 pages in length in single-space, two
columns IEEE format Conference style.

If accepted the final camera ready version will be following the CTS
2009 template and should not exceed 8 pages for long papers, 4 pages
for short papers.  Electronic submissions will be accepted only in PDF
format uploaded at
http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Manifestations/COLSEC/.  For other
electronic formats, please check with the organizers.

Consistent with standard practice, each submitted paper will receive a
minimum of three reviews.  Papers will be selected based on their
originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of
presentation.  Initial selection will be based on full papers.
Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to
register and present the paper, if accepted. All accepted papers in the
Workshop are required to be presented and will be included in the
Symposium proceedings.  It is our intent to have the proceedings
formally published in hard and soft copies and be available at the time
of the conference.  Instructions for final manuscript format and
requirements will be posted on the CTS 2009 Symposium web site later.

Further instructions will be provided at
http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Manifestations/COLSEC/.
