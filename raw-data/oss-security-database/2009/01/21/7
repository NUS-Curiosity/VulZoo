Thank you!

Looks like they got texts mixed up.  -5516 was given to git_search
issue, and -5517 to git_snapshot and git_object issues (the idea was
to use lower id for the issue fixed earlier).  Btw, commitdiff links are
correct, only texts need swapping.

Can you also change "in 1.5.x" to "before 1.5.x" in both descriptions?
Wording in our BZ is probably confusing, but versions 1.5.5 and 1.5.6
are the first versions to include the fix, not the vulnerability.

I've looked into their source rpm, and this is from my previous mail:
  "They fixed both -5516 (git_search) and -5517 (git_snapshot and
  git_object) issues using quote_command() (in their
  git-1.5.2.4-24.4.src.rpm)."

Their announcement mentions version 1.5.6.6, that should have both
issues fixed (and -5916).  They'll probably clarify what was their
"old" version.
