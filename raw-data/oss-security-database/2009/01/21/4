Subject: Re: CVE request - ganglia


Notice the second CVE for the bandwidth/CPU consumption.  The attack
scenario isn't completely clear to me, but since it's labeled as a DoS by
the developer, I decided to include it.

Stack-based buffer overflow in the process_path function in
gmetad/server.c in Ganglia 3.1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) via a request to the gmetad service with a
long pathname.


======================================================
Name: CVE-2009-0242
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0242
Reference: MLIST:[Ganglia-developers] 20090113 patches for: [Sec] Gmetad server BoF and network overload + [Feature] multiple requests per conn on interactive port
Reference: URL:http://www.mail-archive.com/ganglia-developers@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04929.html

Ganglia 3.1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via
a request to the gmetad service with a path does not exist, which
causes Ganglia to (1) perform excessive CPU computation and (2) send
the entire tree, which consumes network bandwidth.
