CVE-2009-0242 was disputed on the ganglia mailing list, even by the
reporter:
http://www.mail-archive.com/ganglia-developers@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04973.html

The flaw should only apply to gmetad with multi-request feature
proposal included (was part of the original mail, along with the fix
for buffer overflow).  Though from the quick look at the issue,
specifying invalid paths does not seem to make the issue any worse even
there:
