Introduction 
Based on the work of rdesktop, xrdp uses the remote desktop protocol to present a
GUI to the user. The goal of this project is to provide a fully functional Linux
terminal server, capable of accepting connections from rdesktop and Microsoft's own 
terminal server / remote desktop clients. (http://xrdp.sourceforge.net)
There are multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in xrdp which could be used by
malicious attackers to execute arbitary code on the system.
Vulnerable version
xrdp <=0.4.1
