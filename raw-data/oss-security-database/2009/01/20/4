I am not the Incident Manager in charge, but AFAIR both issues
have been tracked separately and the remote-fix has been released
sooner, also b/c of its larger severity, which makes sense.
Honestly, diff.external is not a very severe bug but
it will probably be announced in the weekly report (if it
hasnt). Additionally, the autoupdater shows exactly
which issues have been fixed.
