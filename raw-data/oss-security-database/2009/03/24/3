Subject: Lua 5.1.4

Has anyone looked at the Lua fixes[1] in 5.1.4?  I'm not familiar with the
codebase, but it seems that several may have security implications:

 2: stack overflow  (this is the Lua stack? so... heap overflow?)
 3: integer overflow
 4: integer overflow
 6: stack overflow  (this is the Lua stack? so... heap overflow?)
 8: memory writing?
 9: memory reading
10: CPU DoS

I haven't had a chance to examine it closely yet.  Has anyone looked at
these changes?
