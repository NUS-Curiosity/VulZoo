At least for the root user, I missed (because I was glancing through
the contents of a tarball encoded as base64 data in the script,
not reading the script itself nor actually running it) that when
you run the script it tells you inline that it defaults to the
literal string "root" for the root password for the container.
That immediate inline notification precludes any need for a CVE;
I don't think it's a vulnerability per se.

Also, the script assumes certain specific configuration of the host
system (specifically, a routeable bridge named br0 to which to attach
a virtual ethernet interface) that more or less requires that you
are familiar with what is happening under the hood in order to have
a functioning container.

Sorry to have bothered everyone here...
