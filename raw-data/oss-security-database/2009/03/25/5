As far as I can see, they have security implications if you run
untrusted script code (or untrusted bytecode).  I don't think we've
got such software in our code base, but I might be mistaken.

There are additional issues if you run untrusted bytecode, these
issues haven't been fixed (and are very difficult to fix).
