Subject: CVE request -- postgresql

A stack overflow was found in how PostgreSQL handles conversion
encoding.  This could allow an authenticated user to kill
connections to the PostgreSQL server for a small amount of time,
which could interupt transactions by other users/clients.

Could we get a CVE name for this please?  Thanks.
