Subject: CVE-2009-0876 (VirtualBox) references

Sun released an advisory for VirtualBox referenced for CVE-2009-0876 
recently: 
http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-254568-1

However, details are missing and patch information is (unintentionally) 
obfuscated due to inconsistent revision numbers in the public svn vs. 
internal build revisions.

The original bug report for Gentoo and upstream were here:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=260331
http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/3444

where the upsteam bug contains patch information.

Note that it was brought to my attention the problem has been mentioned 
in an earlier bug report, but it has not been escalated to the security 
team or upstream:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236692#c5
