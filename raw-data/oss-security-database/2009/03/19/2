Thanks, Eugene!  More interpretation for those looking at various
kernel versions for those changes:

16dbc6c96163 was introduced between 2.6.27-rc8 and 2.6.27-rc9, so
2.6.26 and earlier are not affected.   The change represented by
16dbc6c96163 was also not imported into the 2.6.26.y stable release
tree during its lifetime, so no 2.6.26.y releases are affected either.
