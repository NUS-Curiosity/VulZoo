Hello Steve, vendors,

  1, thank you for the prompt assignment. 

  2, what's related to:

    Name: CVE-2009-2560
    Status: Candidate
    URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2560

    Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Wireshark 1.2.0 allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors
    in the (1) Bluetooth L2CAP, (2) RADIUS, or (3) MIOP dissectors.

    This one will need to be split into two different ones, because:

    a, the Bluetooth L2CAP and MIOP dissectors flaws are affecting only
       version Wireshark 1.2.0 (as mentioned in upstream's 
       wnpa-sec-2009-04.html)

    b, but the RADIUS dissector issue affects also prior versions of
       Wireshark -- issue / crash confirmed also in upstreams 
       Wireshark-1.0.8.

  Could you please split the CVE-2009-2560 into two CVE ids?
  (one for the L2CAP, MIOP dissectors, other one for
   the RADIUS).

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: Affected Wireshark versions in other CVE identifiers
      assigned within this update are sane.
