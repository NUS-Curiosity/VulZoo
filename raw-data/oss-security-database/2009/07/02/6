Sadly I missed that (having two identical pages with different URL as the
project page and google only returning the 2.2 one as the first 50 hits
didn't help).

Anyway the affected functions in pngread.c code are identical so they are
both affected (though just to be sure I'm pinging original reporter as well
and test with the PoC).

Thanks for the feedback.
