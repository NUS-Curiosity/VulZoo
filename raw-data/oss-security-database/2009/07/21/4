Subject: Re: CVE Request -- RubyGems

Hi,

first a little note: I have talked to some people in the Ruby community
and the issue is quite disputed. There is no upstream reaction that I
know of. But since CVE-2007-0469 was assigned to a similar issue, I
think this issue is valid, too.

Please note that .gem files are not neccesarily tarballs, there is at
least a proprietary base64-based format around and I've heard about
cpio.

The user in this context has to be a privileged user. gem will use
~/.gem/bin if the system-wide gem binary directory is not writeable.
