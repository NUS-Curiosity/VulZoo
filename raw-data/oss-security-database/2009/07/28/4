======================================================
Name: CVE-2009-2621
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2621
Acknowledged: yes advisory
Announced: 20090727
Flaw: undiag
Reference: CONFIRM:http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2009_2.txt
Reference: CONFIRM:http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/b9654.patch

Squid 3.0 through 3.0.STABLE16 and 3.1 through 3.1.0.11 does not
properly enforce "buffer limits and related bound checks," which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) an
incomplete request or (2) a request with a large header size, related
to (a) HttpMsg.cc and (b) client_side.cc.


Analysis:
ACCURACY: some specifics were inferred from b9654.patch, especially
the debug statements that were added.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: SQUID-2009:2 says "Due to incorrect buffer limits and
related bound checks Squid is vulnerable to a denial of service attack
when processing specially crafted requests or responses."
