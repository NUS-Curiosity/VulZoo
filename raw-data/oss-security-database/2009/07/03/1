It seems that the vulnerability was introduced by a Debian patch [1],
that somehow found its way into Fedora, as well. I cannot find the
relevant code in the Gentoo sources, nor does the PoC file cause any
abnormal behaviour in our "vanilla" compface.

Steven, maybe you want to update the CVE description to limit the scope
of the issue?

Thanks,
Alex
