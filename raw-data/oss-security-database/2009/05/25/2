Subject: CVE-2009-0161 dupe of CVE-2009-0642

Hi,
looks like CVE-2009-0161 is a dupe of the original CVE id 
that already covered invalid return value checking of 
OCSP_basic_verify.

This is not the first time Apple products receive their own 
CVE id for issues in the underlying oss product (e.g. webkit 
very often). Is that on purpose or is that just because 
Apple is lacking to provide the proper information to notice 
that?

Cheers
Nico
