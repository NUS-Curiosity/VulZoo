Different from both.  CVE-2009-0148 is more of a dupe / re-occurrence /
incomplete fix of even older CVE-2004-2541.  Some vendors originally
addressed that via sprintf -> snprintf across whole sources.  Upstream
instead preferred to use "%.*s" with bit of length math to avoid
overflow and not harm portability.  Though the math could int
underflow, still allowing buffer overflow.

BZ#189666 issue was fixed upstream in 15.6.
