Subject: CVE Request: XEN local denial of service

Hi,

http://lists.xensource.com/archives/html/xen-devel/2009-05/msg00561.html

A user mode application running in a x86 32bit Xen Guest could Ooops (denial of service)
of the guest by causing a segfault in certain address ranges.

(Just jumping to an address between "ecrit" and "scrit" symbols is sufficient.)

This is not a mainline Linux kernel issue, the bug is in the XEN patchset against
the Linux kernel.

Ciao, Marcus
