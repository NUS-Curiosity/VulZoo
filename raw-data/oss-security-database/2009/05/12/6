Subject: CVE Request (evolution)

Hello everyone,

So there is a public bug about how Evolution sets permissions on folders in
~/.evolution

The current public bugs I know of are here:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526409
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=581604
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=498648

This one probably needs some discussion with upstream before it gets fixed.
The threat is fairly minor, and we don't want to do anything rash and end up
breaking something.
