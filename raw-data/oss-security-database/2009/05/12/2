Subject: CVE Request -- kdebase4 (konqueror) -- Incomplete SSL Certificate
 support in KDE4

Hello Steve,

  not sure if original Debian bug [1] reporter meant this insufficiency,
but [2] might be interesting for your attention. While this is not
direct security vulnerability, is is preventing users from using
the functionality provided by digital certificates.

[3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=500373

This issue is present only in Konqueror web browser, as shipped
with the K Desktop Environment 4 (kdebase-4.*). Konqueror in
kdebase3 works fine.

Regards, Jan.
