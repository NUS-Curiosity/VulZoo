Exact URL? Do you mean http://milw0rm.com/exploits/8678?

There is a ptrace exploit and studying the changelog it was fixed
with 2.6.29.3.
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.29.y.git;a=commit;h=2c9ca2baf3f368a2b747124d39bf31b779eb7571

So yes, update.

2.6.29.4 has fixes for CIFS potential remote overflow fixes (if you mount "cifs" kernel
filesystems in potentially untrusted network), and some other local denial of service
specific fixes, in splice, page_mkwrite, KVM, some small selinux things.

Unless you are using CIFS mounts I guess you can postpone the update for a bit.

There is no good place at this time, and CVE DB search might not be a good way here :/

Ciao, Marcus
