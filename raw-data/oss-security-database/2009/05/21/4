Subject: Re: CVE Request -- kdebase4 (konqueror) -- Incomplete
 SSL Certificate support in KDE4


In CVE, we treat the inadvertent prevention of access to security
functionality as a bug.  There is no direct way that an external attacker
can trigger it, and the attacker gets no direct benefit by waiting for it
to happen passively.  It's only doable by a person doing this to
himself/herself.

So, this would not get a CVE.
