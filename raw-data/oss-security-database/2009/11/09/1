Yeah, currently it looks identical.

With draft-rescorla-tls-renegotiate, the new header comes back to the
client on Server Hello, and this notifies the client that the server
believes it's a re-negotation. Even better, it ties it strongly to the
previous session, so legit renegotiations are protected, too.
