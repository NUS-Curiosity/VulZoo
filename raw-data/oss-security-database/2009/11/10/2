Is it so different than "vulnerable if dangerous_php_option=true is 
configured"? I guess the distinction is that we know many systems 
configure PHP with dangerous options, while admins generally don't run 
around slapping SUID on everything. 

To me, it is a vuln if there is a reasonable case where it may be SUID, 
or called with increased privileges.
