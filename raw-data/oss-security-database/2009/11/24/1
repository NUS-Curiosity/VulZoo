Subject: a new bind issue

Hello.

A new bind release is out there, it mentions:

"It addresses a potential cache poisoning vulnerability, in which data in the 
additional section of a response could be cached without proper DNSSEC 
validation."

"2772.   [security]      When validating, track whether pending data was from
                        the additional section or not and only return it if
                        validates as secure. [RT #20438]"


A CVE should probably be assigned.
