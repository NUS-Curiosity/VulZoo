   I still haven't seen a CVE id for this (pls correct me
if I overlooked it). Could one be assigned? (if there isn't one yet).

Also not sure, if this one has been already addressed upstream?
(as there has been couple of more important Nginx security issues
  recently).

Igor, could you comment on upstream status of this one? Is there
a patch handy?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
