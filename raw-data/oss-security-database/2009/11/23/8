Subject: CVE request: Argument injections in multiple PEAR packages

Hi,

here are a couple of issues in PEAR packages that do not yet have a CVE
afaik:

1. PEAR-Mail Mail::Send() Argument Injection when using Sendmail

Secunia writes:
"The sendmail implementation of the "Mail::Send()" method does not
properly sanitise the "from" parameter before invoking sendmail,
which can be exploited to pass arbitrary arguments to the sendmail
command."

Contrary to Secunia, this does not seem to be completely fixed yet (see
Raphael Geissert's comment in the upstream bug)

http://secunia.com/advisories/37410/
Upstream bug:
http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=16200
First commit:
http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pear/packages/Mail/trunk/Mail/sendmail.php?r1=243717&r2=280134
Gentoo bug:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294256

2. PEAR-Net_Ping < 2.4.5 ping() Argument Injection via $host

Upstream writes:
"When input from forms are used directly, the attacker could pass
variables that would allow him to execute remote arbitrary command
injections."

Upstream advisory:

Commit:
http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pear/packages/Net_Ping/trunk/Ping.php?r1=274728&r2=290669

3. PEAR-Net_Traceroute < 0.21.2 traceroute() Argument Injection via
$host

See above, same advisory.
