Subject:  CVE request: Mail PEAR module code injection vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

A code injection vulnerability has been found in the sendmail
(Mail/sendmail.php) method of the Mail PEAR module.
The bug was originally reported at [1] and fixed upstream in 1.2.0b2.
Proper sanitation is also missing for $recipients, but it wasn't addressed
by the fix applied by upstream.

Could a CVE be assigned? thanks in advance
