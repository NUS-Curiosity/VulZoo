Let's use CVE-2009-3898 for this one:

CVE-2009-3898

nginx versions before 0.8.17 and 0.7.63 contain a directory traversal flaw in
the webdav component. A user who can COPY or MOVE permissions could place
files outside the webdav root.

We'll use the same ID. mod_ssl did a similar thing and used CVE-2009-3555. I
think multiple IDs in this instance would actually create more confusion that
it would solve.

Thanks.
