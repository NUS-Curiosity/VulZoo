Subject: Re: CVE request: Argument injections in multiple PEAR
 packages


All,

Please use CVE-2009-4023 for the $from variable in Mail only.  I just
assigned CVE-2009-4111 for the outstanding bug for $recipient; since that
argument was reported after $from had been fixed, we are effectively
dealing with different downstream versions and possibly partial patches by
some distros.
