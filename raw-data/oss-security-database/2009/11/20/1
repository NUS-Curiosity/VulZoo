Subject: CVEs for nginx

Hi,

are the CVEs for

1.) nginx webdav: http://secunia.com/advisories/36818/

2.) nginx Null Pointer dereference:
http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.null.pointer.txt

3.) nginx SSL Renegotiation: http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.cve-2009-3555.txt

I know the last one contains a CVE number, nginx uses openssl and the
patch will disable renegotiation, maybe this deserves an own CVE?


Best regards,

Craig
