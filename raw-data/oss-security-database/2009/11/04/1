Our advisories are now up at http://www.portcullis-security.com/advisories:

* Portcullis Security Advisory 09-008 Insufficient Input Validation By IO 
Slaves
﻿* Portcullis Security Advisory 09-004 KMail Attachment Mime Type Spoofing 
Enables Javascript Injection
* ﻿Portcullis Security Advisory 09-003 Form Spoofing In Konqueror Enables 
KWallet Stored Credential Theft
* ﻿Portcullis Security Advisory 09-002 Ark Default View Allows JavaScript 
Injection

Note that Tomas and I had quite a long discussion off list, I'll try and 
summarise that as an update later tonight.  The key points are that that KDE 
determined that 09-003 would not be fixed and that KDE determined that the 
PoCs for 09-004 and 09-002 were possible due to a same origin policy 
violation and fixed that.
