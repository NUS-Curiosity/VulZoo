This advisory covers both buffer overflows and path traversal in the same
data field.  While these may stem from "input validation" (as many issues
do), we would typically assign two separate CVE names, since the fix for a
buffer overflow would not necessarily fix the path traversal (or vice
versa).

Unless there's some deeper reason for using a single CVE, I think we
should assign separate CVEs here.  If you agree Mark, we can use
CVE-2009-3721 for the overflow, and you could assign a new CVE for the
traversal.
