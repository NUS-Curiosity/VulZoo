Subject: CVE request: awstats

Hi,

I think there isn't a CVE for this issues - which was fixed in 6.95 -
yet (quote from http://awstats.sourceforge.net/docs/awstats_changelog.txt):

- Fix security in awredir.pl script by adding a security key required by
  default.
- Enhance security of parameter sanitizing function


best regards,

Craig
