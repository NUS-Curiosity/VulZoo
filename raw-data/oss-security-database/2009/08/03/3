Subject: Re: squid DoS in external auth header parser


: I noticed this on Debian's bts [1] and also on upstream's bugzilla [2]
: but no CVE has been assigned (not sure if one has been requested or not,
: but I've not seen a request come through here).
: 
: By the initial looks of things, it seems to be a fairly low severity
: issue and may not be easy to duplicate/trigger.  The reporter didn't really
: provide much in the way of a reproducer or relevant configs (and the
: reference to zope auths makes me not even want to touch it).
: 
: Has anyone taken a look at this or has a CVE been requested for it?
: Upstream has done nothing with this despite it being reported two weeks
: ago.

Were these fixed with the recent release?

http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2009_2.txt

The creditee section does not mention Bastian Blank (original) or Luigi 
Gangitano (Debian, reported upstream). The related Squid bug report (2704) 
is still marked UNCONFIRMED and has no resolution.

I'm guessing this is still an outstanding issue.
