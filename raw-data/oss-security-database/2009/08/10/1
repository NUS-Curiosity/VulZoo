Subject: CVE request: kernel: parisc: isa-eeprom missing lower bound check

loff_t is a signed type. If userspace passes a negative ppos, the
"count" range check is weakened. If ppos is negative, the readb() later
in the function will poke in random memory. Only affects if you are
using a PA-RISC kernel with CONFIG_EISA set.
