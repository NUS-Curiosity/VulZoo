Actually, that's a duplicate (yikes).  I'll reject that one.

CVE-2009-2768 was already assigned, use it instead.  See below.

The load_flat_shared_library function in fs/binfmt_flat.c in the flat
subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc6 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash)
or possibly have unspecified other impact by executing a shared flat
binary, which triggers an access of an "uninitialized cred pointer."
