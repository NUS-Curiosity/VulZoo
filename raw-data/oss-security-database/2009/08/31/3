Introduced in 1.14, unless I'm mistaken:

  http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/SULLR/IO-Socket-SSL-1.14/Changes

It may be good to have this listed in the CVE description.

Anyway, prefix requirement is another mitigation, as one may not be
able to get valid certificate for a prefix of arbitrary host name
(though it may be easier for TLDs as .com and .net via .co and .ne).

Speaking of prefixes, has anyone checked IO-Socket-SSL for
CVE-2009-2408-like issues?  If there is an issues, should it get fixed
in IO-Socket-SSL or in Net-SSLeay?
