There isn't really a place in CVE to do this.  The description is
primarily to describe the problem in a way that allows us to distinguish
this issue from other issues.  I've included your post as a reference,
however.

The verify_hostname_of_cert function in the certificate checking
feature in IO-Socket-SSL (IO::Socket::SSL) 1.14 through 1.25 only
matches the prefix of a hostname when no wildcard is used, which
allows remote attackers to bypass the hostname check for a
certificate.
