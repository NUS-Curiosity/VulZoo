Subject: CVE-2009-2698 kernel: udp socket NULL ptr dereference

A flaw was found in the udp_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel 
when using the MSG_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user 
could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their 
privileges. This was fixed by Herbert Xu in v2.6.19-rc1, and reported by 
Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team.
