Are you sure?

According to MITRE's descriptions, CVE-2009-2621 deals with a lack of
enforcing "buffer limites and related bound checks", and CVE-2009-2622
deals with malformed requests.  When I was looking, it didn't seem like
either of these were the issue noted in the Debian bug.  Bug #2704 on
the squid site is still UNCONFIRMED with no additional comments made to
it, so I don't think this is fixed in the latest upstream release (and
wouldn't fall under one of these CVE's).

I don't think a CVE has been assigned to this issue, and I don't think
it has been fixed.
