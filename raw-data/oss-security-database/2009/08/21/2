Subject: expat bug 1990430

Hello,

we have learned that expat fixed a crash issue in June 2008, but never 
released an update. The bug was apparantly intended to be kept private, 
but the bug changes were mailed to a public mailing list and Python 
developrs menitoned the bug fix in their public svn (including NEWS 
file, and reproducers):

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/expat-bugs/2009-January/002781.html
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1990430&group_id=10127&atid=110127
http://svn.python.org/view?view=rev&revision=74429
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615

While the expat bug was reported by Peter Valchev of Google, Python 
credits Ivan KrstiÄ‡ of Apple with the patch (submission).
It might also be related to CVE-2009-2625 / FICORA #245608:
https://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2009/vulnerability2009085.html

As CERT-FI never released any details or test cases, I have no idea if 
we need a new CVE of if those two issues are the same.
