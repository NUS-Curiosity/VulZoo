That's actually a pretty good question.  This problem was first
presented for Firefox/NSS and got assigned CVE-2009-2408.

Similar problem also affects GnuTLS and some changes are being
discussed on the -devel mailing list, with some changes and tests
already in git.  This should deserve a separate CVE.

And than there is OpenSSL, which, as I've been told, expects
applications to do name checking.  So it's probably safe to assume that
many / majority of client applications using OpenSSL are likely to be
affected by some variant of this problem (either via CommonNames or
subjectAltNames).  I'm not sure if single CVE should be used here for
all, or dozens of CVEs, one for each.  It's likely going to be mess
either way.  I'm adding CC on Steven for advice.  Steven, at least one
CVE has already been allocated privately for similar case.
