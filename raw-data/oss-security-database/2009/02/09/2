I've just added a direct link to the file in the SVN repository, as well
as the Debian Wiki link above, to the "patch-finding" section for Debian
on the oss-security wiki here:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/distro-patches

This is not exactly "patch-finding", but it is closely related - and it
may be of help to security teams of other distros as well.

Thanks,

Alexander
