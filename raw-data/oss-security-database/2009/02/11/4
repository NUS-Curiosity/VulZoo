Oh, forgot to ask.  It looks like this would have been introduced in
1.3.1.  Is that correct?  So the affected versions would be
1.3.1 to 1.3.2rc2.

Also, as I was looking at the Gentoo report, I noticed bug #3173 which
likely also needs a CVE name (for the "encoding-dependent SQL injection
vulnerability").

Thanks.
