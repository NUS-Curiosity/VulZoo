Heap-based buffer overflow in the qtdemux_parse_samples function in
gst/qtdemux/qtdemux.c in GStreamer Good Plug-ins (aka
gst-plugins-good) 0.10.9 through 0.10.11 might allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code via crafted Composition Time To Sample
(ctts) atom data in a malformed QuickTime media .mov file.


Analysis:
ABSTRACTION: The researcher lists three issues in the advisory, two
heap overflows and one array index error so these are SPLIT.

ABSTRACTION: One of the heap overflows affects different products than
the other, so they are SPLIT.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: The vendor states in release notes for 0.10.12: "Fix
for security advisory TKADV2009-0xx" which references the researcher,
who states "Vendor has released an updated version" and notes the
issue is resolved in the 0.10.12 release.

Array index error in the qtdemux_parse_samples function in
gst/qtdemux/qtdemux.c in GStreamer Good Plug-ins (aka
gst-plugins-good) 0.10.9 through 0.10.11 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via crafted Sync Sample (aka stss) atom data in a
malformed QuickTime media .mov file, related to "mark keyframes."


Analysis:
ABSTRACTION: The researcher lists three issues in the advisory, two
heap overflows and one array index error so these are SPLIT.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: The vendor states in release notes for 0.10.12: "Fix
for security advisory TKADV2009-0xx" which references the researcher,

Heap-based buffer overflow in the qtdemux_parse_samples function in
gst/qtdemux/qtdemux.c in GStreamer Good Plug-ins (aka
gst-plugins-good) 0.10.9 through 0.10.11, and GStreamer Plug-ins (aka
gstreamer-plugins) 0.8.5, might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via crafted Time-to-sample (aka stts) atom data in a
malformed QuickTime media .mov file.


Analysis:
ABSTRACTION: The researcher lists three issues in the advisory, two
heap overflows and one array index error so these are SPLIT.

ABSTRACTION: One of the heap overflows affects different products than
the other, so they are SPLIT.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: The vendor states in release notes for 0.10.12: "Fix
for security advisory TKADV2009-0xx" which references the researcher,
who states "Vendor has released an updated version" and notes the
issue is resolved in the 0.10.12 release.

WIKI: The MLIST:[oss-security] 20090129 indicates that vulnerability
[C] is about "QuickTime 'stts' Atom parsing" but then says "QuickTime
Sync Sample Atom parsing." This is incorrect. An stts atom is a
"Time-to-sample atom." (An stss atom is a "Sync Sample Atom.")

Array index error in the gst_qtp_trak_handler function in

0.6.0 allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a crafted
QuickTime media file.
