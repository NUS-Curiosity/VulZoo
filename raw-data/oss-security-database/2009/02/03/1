Subject: CVE Request: sblim-sfcb genSslCert.sh temp race

Hi folks, Steve,

We have identified and fixed a tmp race in the genSslCert.sh helper
script in sblim-sfcb.

The script is run just once as root making this a very small attack
window.

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2561165&group_id=128809&atid=712784

Can you please assign a CVE id?

Ciao, Marcus
