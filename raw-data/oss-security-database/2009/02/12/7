Steve,

  thanks for the assignment!

Yes, the fix looks strange, but it resolves the issue (checked for
net-snmp-5.4.2). Looks like net-snmp is mis-reporting
the results, so subsequent parsing performed by tcp_wrappers
fails so hosts, for whose the snmp responses should be
forbidden, are getting them regardless of /etc/hosts.deny
content.

More exact explanation from our pkg-maintainer:

<snip>

So... the bug is in net-snmp, it mixes source and destination IP 
addresses, which renders tcp_wrappers support in snmpd completely 
useless (it checks destination IP addr instead of source IP address).

</snip>

Not sure here, if the CVE description should be modified appropriately?

Regards, Jan.
