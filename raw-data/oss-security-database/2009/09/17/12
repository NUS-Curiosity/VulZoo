These flaws are not specific to Dovecot and exist in cyrus-imapd too.
Upstream already applied Dovecot fixes in their CVS:

https://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/sieve/sieve.y.diff?r1=1.40;r2=1.41;f=h
https://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/sieve/bc_eval.c.diff?r1=1.14;r2=1.15;f=h
https://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/sieve/script.c.diff?r1=1.68;r2=1.69;f=h

Sorry if my mail was confusing at that point.
