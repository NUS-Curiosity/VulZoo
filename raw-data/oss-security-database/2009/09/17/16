Subject: CVE request: VLC -- Stack-based buffer overflows in three demuxers

Hey,

just caught this at Secunia [1], can we please get a CVE?

"Some vulnerabilities have been reported in VLC Media Player, which can
be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a user's
system.

1) A boundary error exists within the "ASF_ObjectDumpDebug()" function
in modules/demux/asf/libasf.c. This can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted ASF file.

2) A boundary error exists within the "AVI_ChunkDumpDebug_level()"
function in modules/demux/avi/libavi.c. This can be exploited to cause
a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted AVI file.

3) A boundary error exists within the "__MP4_BoxDumpStructure()"
function in modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c. This can be exploited to cause
a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted MP4 file."
