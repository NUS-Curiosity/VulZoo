CVE-2009-3235 is the new one; CVE-2009-2632 has been updated to list

Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as
used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and
Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to
execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a
crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof
operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer
signedness error.

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot
1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve,
allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as
demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of
recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
