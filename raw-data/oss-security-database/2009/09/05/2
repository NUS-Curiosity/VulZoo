2.4 kernels appear to be affected as well, and moreover they appear to
require at least some of these older fixes as well:

http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=112002138324380

Specifically, in net/sched/sch_api.c both tc_fill_qdisc() and
tc_fill_tclass() are affected - the former was fixed in 2.6 in 2005,
the latter is being fixed now.

I'm not sure what this means for CVE.  Should there be another CVE id
for the issues fixed in 2.6 in 2005 (if one was not allocated at the
time), and 2.4 could reference both CVE ids now?

I did not check if any of the affected code is possibly normally only
available to root, but even if so the issue may be relevant on systems
with containers.
