Subject: Insecure pid directory permissions for postfix on Debian / Ubuntu

Wietse Venema discovered that Debian and Ubuntu set the permissions of
/var/spool/postfix/pid to be postfix:root 0755. This allows the postfix
user to manipulate pid files and overwrite arbitrary files via symlink
attacks. Arbitrary file overwrites are somewhat mitigated when using
chroot, which is the default on Debian and Ubuntu.

Currently supported versions of Debian and Ubuntu that are affected are
(earlier versions are likely affected, but not checked):
Debian: 4.0 (Etch) and later
Ubuntu: 6.06 LTS (Dapper) and later

The patch is attached. This is CVE-2009-2939.
