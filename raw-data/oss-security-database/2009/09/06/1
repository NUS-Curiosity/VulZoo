Sorry for being late in this discussion, I was absent for two weeks.

Hello Steven,

are you going to assign a new identifier for expat updatePosition crash? 
It seems to me the outcome of this discussion is that the issues 
discovered in 2009 by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing and in 2008 by Peter 
Valchev are identical, and that the CVE-2009-2625 wording is limited to 
the infinite loop in a Java codebase. As a supporting factor, 
CVE-2009-2625 is used by many to identify only the Java issues
(with Mandriva being an exception).
