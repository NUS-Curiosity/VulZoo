Hi Steve,

Can you give this a CVE id:
http://secunia.com/advisories/35205/
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=531631

The upstream patch can be found in our bug:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=504199

The link to the patch from Secunia doesn't seem to be working.

Thanks.
