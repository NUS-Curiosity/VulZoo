Subject: clamav CVE ids?

Hi,

Clamav 0.95.2 brings some fixes for Thierry Zollers issues,
which probably deserve (a) CVE id ...

Are there already some assigned?

--- from our bug:
( https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=688880&group_id=86638 )

These messages from the ChangeLog could have some security relevance, but I
haven't yet checked the mentioned bug reports:

 * libclamav: detect and handle archives hidden inside other files (eg.
images),
              which can be unpacked by WinZip, WinRAR and other tools (bb#1554)
              Reported by ROGER Mickael and Thierry Zoller

 * libclamav/mspack.c, cab.c: don't rely on file sizes stored in CAB headers
              (bb#1562) Reported by Thierry*Zoller <Thierry*Zoller.lu>

 * libclamunrar/unrarvm.c: fix handling of some broken rar files

 * libclamav/mbox.c: handle malformed emails with embedded \0s (bb #1573)

 * libclamav/readdb.c: add offset checks (bb#1615)
