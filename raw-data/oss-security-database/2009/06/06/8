The inode double locking code in fs/ocfs2/file.c in the Linux kernel
2.6.30 before 2.6.30-rc3, 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.24, 2.6.29 before 2.6.29.4,
and possibly other versions down to 2.6.19 allows local users to cause a
denial of service (prevention of file creation and removal) via a series
of splice system calls that trigger a deadlock between the
generic_file_splice_write, splice_from_pipe, and ocfs2_file_splice_write
functions.
