The expat XML parser in the apr_xml_* interface in xml/apr_xml.c in
Apache APR-util before 1.3.7, as used in the mod_dav and mod_dav_svn
modules in the Apache HTTP Server, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted XML document
containing a large number of nested entity references, as demonstrated
by a PROPFIND request, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
