Subject: libpng-1.2.37 fixes a security issue

Hello,

libpng-1.2.37 has been released and the site says that it is a security 
fix release (actually, 1.2.36 was as well, and 1.2.37 corrects the fix).

http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

I can't find a CVE on this, so somebody may need to assign one.

Thanks,

Pat
