Subject: CVE request: "billion laughs" attack against Apache APR

Hi, could a CVE name be allocated for this issue:

The expat XML parser is vulnerable to the "billion laughs" entity 
expansion attack.  This results in a denial of service vulnerability in 
any network-facing service which uses the Apache "APR-util" library's 
wrapper interface for expat to parse untrusted XML documents.  The 
Apache httpd WebDAV module "mod_dav" is such a service.
