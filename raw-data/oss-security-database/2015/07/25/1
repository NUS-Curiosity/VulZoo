There's this:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/luto/linux.git/commit/?h=x86/nmi-backport

which is a combined effort of me and Ben Hutchings.  It's not synced up
to the fixes in Linus' tree.

Note that even Linus' tree doesn't have the synchronous modify_ldt fix
yet.  I sent a hopefully final version of that out a few minutes ago.
