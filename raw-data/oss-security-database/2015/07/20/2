Hi folks,

Chiming in on behalf of Gentoo Security Team. Bug report here, see
comment 5: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=554914#c5

In sum, I also fail to see how this is a security issue. Does anybody
make siege SUID, or give it untrusted input, or anything like that?
@ago - what's the attack vector you have in mind with this bug? Feel
free to find me in #gentoo-security if you want to work out
conversationally what you have in mind with this finding.

Jason
