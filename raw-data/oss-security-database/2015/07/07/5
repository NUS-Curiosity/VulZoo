Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache Directory LDAP API 1.0.0-M31 released

The Apache Directory Team is proud to announce the availability of the
1.0.0-M31 version of the Apache Directory LDAP API.

The Apache Directory LDAP client API is an ongoing effort to provide
an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing
LDAPAPI (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).

This is a schema aware API, with some convenient ways to access a LDAP
server. This API is not only targeting the Apache Directory Server,
but should work pristine with any LDAP server.

It's also an extensible API : new Controls, schema elements and
network layer could be added or used in the near future. It's also
OSGi capable.


This release is fixing a security vulnerability : CVE-2015-3050, a
Timing Attack vulnerability.


Here is the list of the other fixed issues :
