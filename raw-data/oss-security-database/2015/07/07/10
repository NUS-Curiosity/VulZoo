Subject: CVE request CSRF in sogo

Hej,

I would like to request a CVE for a CSRF vulnerability in sogo, the open
groupware platform.

site: www.sogo.nu
Previously requested: no
Type: CSRF
Affected versions: up till 2.3.0 (current)
Description: The application does not protect against CSRF attacks for
most of its functions. Only change password seems to have some
protection. But functions such as sending email, setting up mail forward
and everything else is not protected.
