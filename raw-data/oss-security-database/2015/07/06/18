You told dash to interpret a command 2 gigabytes long, and it failed to
do so; additionally, the failure was a crash, not a deterministic
semi-graceful exit. That sounds like a bug.

However, to be a security vulnerability rather than "just a bug", a
buffer overflow is not enough; to be a security vulnerability, it would
have to be an *attacker-triggerable* buffer overflow.

Is there any circumstance under which an attacker - not you - can cause
this to happen, other than via an arbitrary-code-execution vulnerability
in some other component?

(If you are already vulnerable to attacker-controlled arbitrary code
execution, then dash crashing is the least of your worries.)
