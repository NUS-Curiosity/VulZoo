I would consider 80 bits insufficient for cryptography, but it's not
really exploitably weak (like, say, rand() would be). Whether or not
it warrants a CVE is obviously MITRE's discretion.

2^80 is out of reach for most people to brute force in 2015 (maybe
even for intelligence agencies), but 2^100 is generally the lower
bound of acceptable.

Just my $0.02.
