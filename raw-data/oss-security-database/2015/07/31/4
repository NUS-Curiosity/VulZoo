Subject: CVE for crypto_get_random() from libsrtp

Hello,

I've got question whether this bug 
(https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=793971) is 
CVE-worthy? Could it be classified as CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently 
Random Values?

According to the SRTP documentation 
(http://srtp.sourcearchive.com/documentation/1.4.2.dfsg/group__SRTP_g1d4c228c6a58096dfab3cefbabd66f17.html), 
it provides 80 bits of random data, which is quite a borderline.

Thanks.
