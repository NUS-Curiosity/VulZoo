Our current feeling is that it is best to have two CVE IDs: one for
the original "does not enforce the DNS protocol limit concerning
record set sizes" issue and one for the "Quotas were being bypassed"
issue. Is that OK?

The basic rationale is that the issues can be independently fixed,
i.e., regardless of how large a quota exists or whether that quota is
sensible, the "rendering loop in desginate-mdns can does not make
progress" behavior is still a relevant vulnerability. Also, even after
the loop is fixed, an installation may have its own reason for a small
quota, and thus any quota bypass is a vulnerability.

We feel that item 3, adding a timeout, can be considered a security
enhancement opportunity that should not have its own CVE ID, i.e.,
there is no report of a vulnerability that can be fixed only with a
timeout. Finally, our understanding is that multiple names are being
used to refer to the general
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Designate/Blueprints/MiniDNS concept,
i.e., we think "MiniDNS does not have a timeout" is an observation
about the Designate codebase, not a third-party DNS server such as
from the https://code.google.com/p/minidns/ site. Also, we think this
part of the Designate codebase is also called designate-mdns
(misspelled as desginate-mdns) and mDNS -- these are essentially
alternative names for Designate MiniDNS.
