Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel - information leak in md driver

Hello,

In the md driver of the Linux kernel itâ€™s possible to request a bitmap file for a device, but when bitmap is disabled only the first byte of the buffer is initialized to zero, and then it is copied in user space. This results in an information leak.

The patch for this issue was applied and committed in linux-next :
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=77ba0569d4c8389c0a2162ab0c7c16a6f3b199e4 <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=77ba0569d4c8389c0a2162ab0c7c16a6f3b199e4>
(+ merged: http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=348470064e7c42cb08f1c9d6e9f0a7d2865b3b79 <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=348470064e7c42cb08f1c9d6e9f0a7d2865b3b79>)

Could you please generate a CVE id for this?

Thanks.
