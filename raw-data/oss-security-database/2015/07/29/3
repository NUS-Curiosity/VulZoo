Subject: [BIND] CVE-2015-5477: An error in handling TKEY queries can cause
 named to exit with a REQUIRE assertion failure

A deliberately constructed packet can exploit an error in the
handling of queries for TKEY records, permitting denial of service.

CVE:                 CVE-2015-5477
Document Version:    1.0
Posting date:        28 July 2015
Program Impacted:    BIND
Versions affected:   9.1.0 -> 9.8.x, 9.9.0->9.9.7-P1, 9.10.0->9.10.2-P2
Severity:            Critical
Exploitable:         Remotely

Description:

   An error in the handling of TKEY queries can be exploited by an
   attacker for use as a denial-of-service vector, as a constructed
   packet can use the defect to trigger a REQUIRE assertion failure,
   causing BIND to exit.

Impact:

   Both recursive and authoritative servers are vulnerable to this
   defect.  Additionally, exposure is not prevented by either ACLs
   or configuration options limiting or denying service because the
   exploitable code occurs early in the packet handling, before
   checks enforcing those boundaries.

   All versions of BIND 9 from BIND 9.1.0 (inclusive) through BIND
   9.9.7-P1 and BIND 9.10.2-P2 are vulnerable.

   Operators should take steps to upgrade to a patched version as
   soon as possible.

CVSS Score:          7.8

   current version of BIND.  These can be downloaded from
   http://www.isc.org/downloads.

   +  BIND 9 version 9.9.7-P2
   +  BIND 9 version 9.10.2-P3
