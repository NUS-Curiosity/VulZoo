We think the vulnerability mappings are:

CVE-2015-5622 = https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33359

Note that the news URL says 'fixed by <a
href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>' and 33359 says
"Props miqrogroove."
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33359/trunk/tests/phpunit/tests/kses.php
has:

           array( 
               'a', 
               'href="javascript:alert(1)"', 
               'href="alert(1)"', 
           ), 

[ there has been discussion of 33359, although possibly not about any
remaining security problem - see
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15694#comment:24 ]


CVE-2015-5623 = https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33357

Note that
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/33357/trunk/src/wp-admin/post.php
makes a change to the "case 'post-quickdraft-save'" section of the
wp-admin/post.php file.
