Use CVE-2014-8878.

Other comments (probably irrelevant):

This general type of issue has been included in CVE before: see
CVE-2014-5369.

We feel that it is conceivable that this kmail behavior had been
intentional. Encrypting attachments to arbitrary recipients, simply
because a PGP key is known, has a usability problem. Some mail systems
automatically and silently remove attachments that can't be scanned
for malware (e.g., when the pre-encryption content type of the
attachment is one that can have malware). This has, in some sense, a
risk of "data corruption" because the meaning of a message can be
vastly different if the attachment doesn't arrive. If the sender
explicitly selects the "encrypt message" option, then that's a very
strong signal that encryption is required, and kmail did encrypt
attachments in that case. The "automatic encryption" implementation
might have made a different tradeoff between security and usability.
But, probably not. We decided to assign a CVE ID anyway because the
commit refers to the change as a bug fix, because there was apparently
no documentation of an intentional tradeoff, and because we're unaware
of any widespread acceptance of a need to avoid encrypted attachments
in some cases.
