Subject: CVE Request - Information Exposure Vulnerability in WordPress Mobile
 Pack Wordpress Plugin v2.1.2 (and certain versions of v2.1.3 - prior to June
 3, 2015)

Hi,

I discovered Information Exposure Vulnerability in WordPress Mobile Pack
Wordpress Plugin v2.1.2 which was responsibly disclosed to the vendor who
fixed the issues in v2.1.3. The vulnerability is also present in certain
versions of v2.1.3 (prior to June 3, 2015), hence users who have those
versions also need to upgrade/reinstall.

I request a CVE for the same.
