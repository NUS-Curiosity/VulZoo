Subject: The Census Project (CII)

Hi all,

It's today's news that the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) announced
The Census Project.

"A new program that analyzes popular open source projects to identify which
ones are critical to Internet infrastructure and also most in need of
additional support and funding"

Particularly for security testing, I think it's extremely important to
determine funding and resource allocation for the higher priority projects.
Another step in the right direction.

Cheers,
Luca
