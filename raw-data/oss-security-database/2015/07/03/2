Hi,

Even with the patch for CVE-2015-3258 in version 1.0.70 it was possible
to trigger an integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
using the same vector (specially crafted line sizes).

The integer overflow has been assigned CVE-2015-3279 and is fixed in
version 1.0.71. Apart from that, the patch also hardens against
possible crashes due to missing calloc() success checks.
