Description: Image Export plugin can help you selectively download images uploaded by an administrator .
Vulnerability:
The code in file download.php doesn't do any checking that the user is requesting files from the uploaded images directory only.  And line 8 attempts to
unlink the file after being downloaded.  This script could be used to delete files out of the wordpress directory if file permissions allow.
 
      1 <?php
      2 if ( isset( $_REQUEST['file'] ) && !empty( $_REQUEST['file'] ) ) {
      3         $file = $_GET['file'];
      4 
      5         header( 'Content-Type: application/zip' );
      6         header( 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $file . '"' );
      7         readfile( $file );
      8         unlink( $file );
      9
