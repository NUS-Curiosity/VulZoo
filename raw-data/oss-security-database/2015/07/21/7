Another fix noted in 5.6.11 / 5.5.27 / 5.4.43 is:

Mysqlnd: Fixed bug #69669 (mysqlnd is vulnerable to BACKRONYM). (CVE-2015-3152)

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=69669
http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=97aa752fee61fccdec361279adbfb17a3c60f3f4

It references a CVE that was assigned to MySQL / libmysqlclient.  As
the fix was applied to mysqlnd - re-implementation of the MySQL client
- can the original BACKRONYM CVE still be used here, or is a new CVE
id needed?

Thank you!
