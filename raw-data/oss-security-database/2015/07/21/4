Subject: CVE Request - Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability in Portfolio
 Plugin Wordpress Plugin v1.0

Hi,

I discovered Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability in Portfolio Plugin
Wordpress Plugin v1.0 which was responsibly disclosed to the vendor who
fixed the issues in v1.0.5.

I request a CVE for the same.
