Use CVE-2015-5607.

This part of the patch seems unusual, but we haven't researched it at all:

  host = self.request.headers.get("Host")
  origin = self.request.headers.get("Origin")

  # If no header is provided, assume it comes from a script/curl.
  # We are only concerned with cross-site browser stuff here.
  if origin is None or host is None:
     return True

Is this a case where it is safe to skip CSRF protection in all
situations where the client omits an Origin header?
