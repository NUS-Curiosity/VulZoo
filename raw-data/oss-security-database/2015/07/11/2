Subject: CVE Request - Cross-Site Request Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting and
 SQL Injection in CP Contact Form with Paypal Wordpress Plugin v1.1.5

Hi,

I discovered Cross-Site Request Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting and SQL
Injection in CP Contact Form with Paypal Wordpress Plugin v1.1.5 which was
responsibly disclosed to the vendor who fixed the issues in v1.1.6.

I request a CVE for the same.
