I concur.
The releasing of PoC's are very important, for many reasons. It allows,
as stated, the ability to pentest a system efficiently.

I think in this case, it is inappropriate for a PoC to be released on
the same day as the updates being pushed.
As everybody knows, there are a lot of hacked boxes on the internet. Now
someguy that has a botnet of local-users will be able to mass root all
the boxes while the owners sleep, because they have been given no
warning at all about this.. Even if 48 hours was waited before the PoC
was released, it would be much better.

That's just my 2cents anyways.
