Oh, hi there.

My views are not very arbitrary; rather they are based on years of
trying to defend big infrastructures.

As I see it, there are two reasons for releasing working exploits
without warning;

1) Forcing the hand of a non-responsive vendor,

2) Stroking a weak ego by showing off. (Or for marketing, but that comes
   to the same thing.)

Except for case 1, releasing a working exploit *does not help anybody*
except the kiddies. If there are other reasons, I'd like to be told
about them.

If Qualys had released a slightly less detailed advisory, or even just
left off the actual exploit, and given users a day or two to patch their
systems before going full disclosure, the risk to innocent bystanders
would have been much reduced.
