Actually, releasing a working exploit helps our customers more often
than not.
In professional pentesting, proof of exploitation is essential.
Most often than not, a real attacker will invest time and resources into
a working exploit, the customer will not feel the need to invest into it
just for simulation.

Moreover, as soon as systems can be patched, they should be.
Of course a few hours delay is not realistic, but I want to be sure that
everyone understands how much "releasing a working exploit *does not
help anybody*" is false.

I urge researchers to continue to release their exploits into the public
domain.
Do it "responsibly", maybe get help in order to do it correctly, but do
it, because it's beneficial more than harmful to any potential target.
