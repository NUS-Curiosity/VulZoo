Subject: CVE Request: kmail: Attachments are not encrypted when "automatic
 encryption" is selected

Hi

It was reported a while ago to the KDE Bugtracking System, that
attachments are not encrypted when "automatic encryption" is selected.

Upstream bugreport: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=340312
Fix: http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kdepim.git&a=commit&h=626c857eb30c0533a4de7836ee843caaa8c00a26
Debian Bug: https://bugs.debian.org/791800

I have not found a previous CVE request for this issue. Could a CVE be
assigned for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
