Subject: CVE request / Advisory: Floating Social Bar (Wordpress plugin) 1.0.1

I'd like to request a CVE ID for this issue. This is the first such
request; this message serves as an advisory as well.

Description: One of the plugin's unauthenticated AJAX action handlers

invoking the action with certain parameters, it is possible for
unauthenticated attackers to force the persistent injection of
arbitrary script across the site's post pages.
