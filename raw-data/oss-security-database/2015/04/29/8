Subject: Re: CVE request - TelescopeJS Information Leakage: User BCrypt password hash post-authentication

In this case, it appears that a primary developer of TelescopeJS (the
person at the top of the GitHub contributors list) is indicating that
the previous behavior was unsafe:

  https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues/838#issuecomment-85762182

Use CVE-2015-3454.

(In other cases, it is possible that an issue exploitable only after
"find a single cross-site scripting flaw" would not have a CVE ID
assigned.)

Also, as suggested by the
https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/issues/838#issuecomment-85734879
comment, lack of the HTTPOnly flag is not relevant to this product. There
is no CVE ID for that HTTPOnly issue.
