Subject: CVE request

Illumos bug #5853 (https://www.illumos.org/issues/5853), now fixed, can be exploited to escalate privilege.  It's not easy to do so, but it is enough to cause concern and ask for a CVE number.

At least two distros already have this fix in place.  I'd appreciate a CVE number (and if possible a way to request these on a non-public list... sorry if I missed the FAQ).

Thanks,
