"When applicable, the message Subject must include the name and
version(s) of affected software, and vulnerability type.  For example, a
Subject saying only "CVE request" or "CVE-2099-99999" is not appropriate,
whereas "CVE request - Acme Placeholder 1.0 buffer overflow" or
"CVE-2099-99999 - Acme Placeholder 1.0 buffer overflow" would be OK."

If you're OK with posting a CVE request in public, please do so - like
you did this time (just with a better Subject).  For other cases, see:

and the followups to that message (click "thread-next").
