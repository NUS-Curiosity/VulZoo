Subject: Corrections to CVE-2015-3297

The original report for CVE-2015-3297 incorrectly specified the
commit introducing the bug as a97b83b when it should actually have
been 7b518eeb. As a result the earliest affected version is actually
1.1.1 rather than 1.1.2 as was originally reported. A corrected
report can be found below.

Title: Read-only directory traversal in Etherpad Minify
Reporter: Tom Hunkapiller
Versions: 1.1.1 through 1.5.2

Description:
Tom Hunkapiller reported a vulnerability in the minify feature of
current Etherpad releases. Backslashes are replaced with slashes in
the path parameter of HTTP API calls after path normalization is
applied, allowing an attacker supplying specially-crafted requests
to remotely read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem with the
privileges of the account running the service.

Notes:
This bug was introduced in commit 7b518eeb which was initially
included in the 1.1.1 release, and is fixed in commit 9d4e5f6 which
appears in the 1.5.3 release.
