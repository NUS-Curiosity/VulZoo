Subject: CVE request: ntp-keygen may generate non-random symmetric keys on big-endian systems

Hi, the recent NTP update (ntp-4.2.8p2) contains a fix for the following
issue:

* [Bug 2797] ntp-keygen trapped in endless loop for MD5 keys on big-endian machines.
https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2797

Patch: http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-stable/?PAGE=patch&REV=55199296N2gFqH1Hm5GOnhrk9Ypygg

While the endless loop is not a security flaw per se, the fact that
ntp-keygen generates non-random keys is. If the lowest byte of the temp
variable happens to be between 0x20 and 0x7f and not #, the generated
MD5 key will consist of 20 identical characters, meaning only 93
possible keys can be generated.

Can a CVE be please assigned for this issue?

Thank you!
