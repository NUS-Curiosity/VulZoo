Subject: CVE request: Incorrect default permissions in Zarafa
 (zarafa-search-plus)

Good evening,

it was discovered that zarafa-search-plus (part of Zarafa >= 7.2.0) creates
the directory /var/lib/zarafa/search/ read- and writable for world, as well
as all sub-directories and files it creates afterwards:

 - https://forums.zarafa.com/showthread.php?11304-Zarafa-7-2-Problems-Bugs-with-the-new-search
 - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1206838
 - https://jira.zarafa.com/browse/ZCP-13160

In difference to the ZCP-13160 ("change this to the same permissions as the
other folders in the directory") the thus proposed 755 is not enough, it
must be e.g. 750, otherwise data is still readable for local system users.

As I unfortunately wasn't aware of the forum posting when I did my analysis
I also cross-checked releases before the rewrite (thanks Martin Prpiƒç). The
predecessors of zarafa-search-plus are creating the /var/lib/zarafa/search/
or /var/lib/zarafa/index/ directory with the correct permissions, however
some of the sub-directories and files (also created by the search daemon)
are world-readable (see comment #2 of RHBZ#1206838 for details) through. I
am not sure how this should be treated, given that all Zarafa search/index
daemons do not seem to have built-in permission checks (like e.g. fetchmail
has) and thus also accept an existing directory with incorrect permissions.


With kind regards

Robert Scheck
