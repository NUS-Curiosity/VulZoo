We were initially puzzled by "644 mode" in combination with "readable
to ... the same group." Possibly the unstated expectation is that user
home directories have 0750 permissions.

The security issue, in general, is that the file permissions are 644,
and the directory permissions (whatever they might be) do not
necessarily prevent read access to the file. Use CVE-2015-3010 for
this issue.
