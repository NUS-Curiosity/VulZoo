Subject: CVE request: XSS in WP Super Cache < 1.4.3

Hi,

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/changelog/

says this:

1.4.3
Security release fixing an XSS bug in the settings page. Props Marc
Montpas from Sucuri.

They don't seem to have a git repo or anything, so I can't link to a
commit. Still as this is a pretty popular plugin can I have a CVE?

cu,
