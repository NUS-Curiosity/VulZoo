Subject: CVE request: Buffer overflow in das_watchdog

This was privately reported to Debian, but the developer published a
fix before we could assign a CVE ID.

Adam Sampson discovered that das_watchdog, a daemon to detect and
pause real-time processes which are misbehaving, contains an
exploitable buffer overflow in the handling of the XAUTHORITY
environment variable.
