This doesn't seem to be the applicable documentation for your
reproducer. The documentation says:

   Lines that begin with the hash character "#" are considered
   comments, and are ignored. Comments may not be included on the same
   line as a configuration directive.

> MITRE, does this qualify for a CVE?

We can't make that decision without knowing the perspective of the
upstream vendor. Because the upstream vendor has a process for
assigning CVE IDs, we feel it would be simplest and best here to use
that process, even if it is often not used in cases of publicly known
vulnerabilities. See the security@...che.org address on the
http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html page. It's their
decision on how to proceed; possibilities include:

  - no CVE because the behavior with a # character is undefined

  - a single CVE for both because they intended "Comments may not be
    included" to only mean that a syntax error would be reported

  - a CVE only for mod_authz_host because they had actually wanted to
    support # comments for that one
