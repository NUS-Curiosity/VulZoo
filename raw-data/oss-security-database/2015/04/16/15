The upstream patch is here:
https://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/code/ci/f23bcd3ac6ddee5d0a48f9703007ccc738914791/

As linked from the commit, the (currently restricted) upstream bug is:
https://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/bugs/2615/

Although this leads to crashes at different locations, all of them can
be attributed to snmp_pdu_parse() leaving stale netsnmp_variable_list
items in the list, so I think one CVE should be enough.


In case anyone is interested, the Red Hat bug is:
