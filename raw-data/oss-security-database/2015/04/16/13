Hi,

it's definitely a different vulnerability, as CVE-2014-8810 regards a SQL
injection vulnerability in ajax/mail_functions.php whereas the problem I
discovered exists in a forum function. I received the following notification
from the plugin author:

I will post the changelog link and details of the vulnerability as soon as
the plugin page is online again.

By the way - what would be the best way to publish the vulnerability
details? A reply to this thread or posting it to Exploit-DB, Packet Storm or
other mailing lists like Fulldisc or Bugtraq? Any best practices?

Thank you very much!
