Subject: TCP Fast Open local DoS in some Linux stable branches

There is a local DoS triggered by use of the TCP Fast Open option,
specific to Linux stable branches, as a result of an incompletely
backported bug fix:

https://bugs.debian.org/782515
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/359588

The 3.16.7-ckt stable branch is definitely affected, and I believe but
haven't tested that the 3.10, 3.12, 3.13.11-ckt and 3.14 branches are
also affected.

Please assign a CVE ID for this.

Ben.
