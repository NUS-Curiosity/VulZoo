What Mailman version is this?

I don't think any recent version would add that address to a list
regardless of how it was attempted to be added.

And I think the only address refused was the one kurt@...fried.org/foo

SMTP transaction, not necessarily every list member.

What does your MTA log say about this delivery? And what does Mailman's
'smtp' log say?
