Hi. 

I had been wondering about the delays so many thanks for your email.

What's not entirely clear to me is how you're dealing with the existing
backlog. Are reporters expected to re-submit requests?

For example, I have two outstanding requests from mid-February:

  1. glibc http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/13/3
  2. xrdp http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/19/1

Are those still on MITRE's radar screen? Thanks.
