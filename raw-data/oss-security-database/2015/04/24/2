Subject: CVE request: X server crash by client

Hi,

We got notified that the fix for CVE-2014-8092 introduced the possibility
of a division by 0 when the "height" for the PutImage call is 0, leading
to X server abort.

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=928520

This was already fixed in January in X git.
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=dc777c346d5d452a53b13b917c45f6a1bad2f20b

As this is a local denial of service, but might be triggerable by images with 0 height
supplied externally, it might need a CVE.

Ciao, Marcus
