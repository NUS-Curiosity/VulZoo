Subject: REJECT CVE-2015-1861

Please REJECT CVE-2015-1861. Reason: Someone found something and sent it
to the distros list, I assigned a CVE, turns out this was a
re-discovery, it was already assigned a CVE previously by the vendor
(the vendor was also on distros, but this happened late at night).

Because this CVE has been widely sent out in private I think it's safer
to REJECT rather then hope nobody accidentally used it somewhere.
