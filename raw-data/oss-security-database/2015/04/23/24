 tls timestamps

This shows imho
that tlsdate is also not a very good idea.

I also don't get why it was invented, you jump from:

"hey our old timekeeping protocol
is totally insecure"
to:
"let's use this random protocol
which was never designed for timekeeping
but at least it's secure"

turns out this does not work.

kind regards

Sven
