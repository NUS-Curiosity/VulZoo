Nonsense, embargoes for local or remote privilege escalations are still
considered to be high priority and should be handled with an embargo.

Making this type of information public without giving the vendor a chance to
publish updates within a reasonable timeframe is a great disservice to users and
exposes them to great risk.

No they don't. They allow vendors time to develop a proper fix without exposing
users to unneeded risk. Yes, sometimes the fix is inadequate and needs to be
fixed, but publishing an exploit without a few days notice just makes matters
unbearable for users and encourages vendors to keep security issues secret.
