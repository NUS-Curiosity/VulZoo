Well, that's your opinion Marc, and I'd disagree!

Working in the shadows and keeping secrets does everyone a far greater
disservice.

Sure, that's the theory. It doesn't work that way in practice!

The history of Zardoz, vendor-sec and others are littered with doing
more harm than good. Frankly, they usually end up being secret feeds
of free exploits for attackers while their victims sit in blissful
ignorance.

Naturally, I think it makes things better. There are only two possible
states during an embargo, vulnerable and ignorant or vulnerable and
aware. I certainly prefer the latter, and I'm quite sure I'm not
alone. Information allows action to be taken, where as secrecy
requires hoping and praying that only one person is smart enough to
discover the problem.

There are so many advantages to discussing and developing software in
the open that it's tough to enumerate them all! Presumably you agree
this is true for software development in general (or why would you
care about free software?), but dismiss it when security is involved.
You get peer review, and you get to mitigate bugs as early as possible
- this is more important than ever when security is involved!

Nevertheless, I'm willing to do as you wish in future for other Ubuntu bugs.

Tavis.
