Hi Tavis,

What "vendors list" do you mean?  Do you possibly mean "vendor's" rather
than "vendors" - that is, upstream's list?  (I do not recall seeing this
on the linux-distros list.)

Either way, it sounds weird to keep a low severity issue private.  Low
severity usually means not needing an embargo in the first place.  But I
guess it was the vendor's preference?

Thanks,

Alexander
