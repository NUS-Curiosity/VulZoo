In this case, no, Ubuntu would have preferred several days embargo for
this issue. Hypothetically speaking, Monday would have been ideal, as
we prefer to not release updates on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

We treat local root escalation vulnerabilities with a high priority[1].

Please do inform us privately of further local root escalations in the
future, either via security@...ntu.com or filing "private security"
bugs against the corresponding package in Launchpad.

Thanks

1: Our priorities don't directly map to issue severities, but local root
escalations are treated highly:
