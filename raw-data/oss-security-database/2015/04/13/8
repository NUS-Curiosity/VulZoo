Subject: Re: CVE request: libksba version 1.3.3 fixes
 multiple security issues

Now also written up an advisory for these and other issues:
https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/7-Multiple-vulnerabilities-in-GnuPG,-libksba-and-GpgOL-TFPA-0032015.html

At least the GpgOL issue probably sould also get a CVE:
http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gpgol.git;a=commit;h=35e68591863b7da1698ddc24d8f035fc4c382b9a
http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gpgol.git;a=commit;h=eb1b9bfc088ce33c398dd6f6b7bf80797fbb9011

(same issue is in gpgparsemail, which is a command line mail parsing
tool shipped with gnupg)

I leave it up to MITRE whether to assign CVEs to the DoS issues. (In
the past they usually didn't get CVEs.)
