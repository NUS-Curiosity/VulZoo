Hello,

I have a question regarding the ABRT vulnerabilities. I don't particularly understand how an attacker can use /proc/pid/exe symlink to force ABRT to read an arbitrary file if the symlink cannot be changed and kernel refuses to create the process if the symlink's target is not executable.

Thank you for clarifying this for me.


Kind regards,
