Subject: double-free in gnutls (CRL distribution points parsing)

gnutls 3.3.14 fixes a double-free in parsing CRL distribution points.

It will affect applications which parse CRL distribution points or
print contents of certificates with gnutls-provided functions (e.g.
gnutls_x509_crt_print())

Usually a DoS under modern mem allocators, but creating something more
interesting using double-free exploitation techniques is not out of
the question
