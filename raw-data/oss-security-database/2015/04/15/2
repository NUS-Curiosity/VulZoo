Subject: proftpd: Unauthenticated copying of files via SITE CPFR/CPTO
 allowed by mod_copy

This sounds serious:
https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/pull/109
http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4169
https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2015040075

When the module mod_copy is enabled one can copy around files on the
server without any authentication.

(Not sure how widespread the use of this module is.)

There is no upstream release with a fix yet.
