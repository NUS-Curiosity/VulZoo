Hanno's trick of storing TLS packets as files is clever, but doesn't
scale far beyond testing handshakes of a handful of protocols, and that
with some effort.

If AFL could grow the ability to mangle socket-based inputs, it would
probably be more applicable to many more services, and beyond just
handshaking.

I realize it's asking for a unicorn when we've already been given a pony,
but there it is.

Thanks
