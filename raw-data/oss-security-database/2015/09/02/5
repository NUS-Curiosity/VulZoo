Subject: PowerDNS Security Advisory 2015-02

Hi all,

We'd like to make you aware of Security Advisory 2015-02 for PowerDNS.

A bug was recently found in our DNS packet parsing/generation code,
which, when exploited, can cause individual threads (disabling service)
or whole processes (allowing a supervisor to restart them) to crash with
just one or a few query packets.

* CVE: CVE-2015-5230
* Date: 2nd of September 2015
* Credit: Pyry Hakulinen and Ashish Shakla at Automattic
* Affects: PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.4.0 through 3.4.5
* Not affected: PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.4.6
* Severity: High
* Impact: Degraded service or Denial of service
* Exploit: This problem can be triggered by sending specially crafted
  query packets
* Risk of system compromise: No
* Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version
* Workaround: Run the Authoritative Server inside a supervisor when
  `distributor-threads`  is set to `1` to prevent Denial of Service.
  No workaround for the degraded service exists

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.4.0-3.4.5 are affected. No other
versions are affected. The PowerDNS Recursor is not affected.

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.4.6 contains a fix to this issue. A
minimal patch is available [1].

This issue is entirely unrelated to Security Advisory 2015-01/CVE-2015-1868.

We'd like to thank Pyry Hakulinen and Ashish Shakla at Automattic for
finding and subsequently reporting this bug.
