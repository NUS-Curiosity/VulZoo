Subject: CVE request: urlfetch range handling flaw in Cyrus IMAP

Hi, was a CVE ID assigned for the following issue?

"Security fix: handle urlfetch range starting outside message range"
[https://docs.cyrus.foundation/imap/release-notes/2.4/x/2.4.18.html]

Not many details seem to be available about this issue. Any pointers to
a patch that fixes this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
