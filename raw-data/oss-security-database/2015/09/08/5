Subject: CVE Request: libgcrypt hardening for RSA-CRT leak

Hi,

Redhat has published a paper on RSA-CRT keyleakage.

https://securityblog.redhat.com/2015/09/02/factoring-rsa-keys-with-tls-perfect-forward-secrecy/

There was a CVE assigned for this issue CVE-2015-5738, but the software scope of this assigned is not clear.

libgcrypt has published a hardening fix for the same issue.

Should it get a new CVE?

Ciao, Marcus
