Subject: [OSSA 2015-018] Neutron firewall rules bypass through port update
 (CVE-2015-5240)

================================================================
OSSA-2015-018: Neutron firewall rules bypass through port update
================================================================

:Date: September 08, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-5240


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Neutron: versions through 2014.2.3 and
           2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Kevin Benton from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Neutron. By
changing the device owner of an instance's port right after it is
created, an authenticated user may prevent application of firewall
rules and so avoid IP anti-spoofing controls. All Neutron setups using
the ML2 plugin or a plugin that relies on the security groups AMQP API
are affected.
