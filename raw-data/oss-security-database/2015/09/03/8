Subject: CVE Request: Memory corruption in libvncserver < 0.9.8

It seems this issue exists because libvncserver < 0.9.8 is not
thread-safe. "tightAfterBuf" etc are declared as a global variables.
rfbTightCleanup() which is responsible for freeing these variables, do
not reset them to NULL.

Consequently when other parts of the code use these variables. (For
example, realloc() after checking if they are NULL etc). It can cause
memory corruption.

This is specially possible, when multiple connections are made using
libvncserver library.

This issue has been fixed via:

https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/commit/804335f9d296440bb708ca844f5d89b58b50b0c6

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this issue.
