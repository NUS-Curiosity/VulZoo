Subject: Re: CVE request: zarafa-autorespond suffers from a
 potential local privilege escalation

Hi Martin,

as far as I know, this issue has already been assigned a CVE. I was
about to post the number here, but as the internal ticket IDs do not
match as I expected, I refrain from doing so in order to avoid confusion.

I am not sure if Zarafa contacts are on this list, but I will forward
this mail so that they can confirm/clarify publicly.

So, for now, I don't think a new CVE should be assigned. Either Zarafa
or me will send an update shortly.

Kind regards,

Christian
