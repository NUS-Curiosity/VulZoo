I haven't measured it, but I've considered trying it. The kernel tries
to keep stack usage very low so it seems like it wouldn't usually hurt
performance much, but that doesn't really hold up when functions are
called repeatedly. It can probably optimize out the zeroing in many
cases where it's not just an SSA value as long as everything is
initialized but padding will mess with that.

FWIW, spender posted a tiny patch extending the STRUCTLEAK plugin to
cover all structs declared in headers with 'uapi' in the name, which
should be most of the ones passed to userspace, although not in this 3.4
kernel for the S4 because it predates the uapi split. Might still be
useful to have the plugin trace back from copy_*_user but that's more
effort.
