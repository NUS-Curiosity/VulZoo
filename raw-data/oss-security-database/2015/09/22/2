Did you measure the performance impact of initializing *all* local
variables to zero?  If the variable is not addressible (that is, if it
is an SSA_NAME), this is essentially free.

In our testing, we only saw a performance loss in socket address
handling, where a large placeholder struct is allocated, and the
performance loss is quite noticeable when processing small packets.
Unfortunately, this is were information disclosure happens in the past,
so excluding this very spot for performance reasons is not very satisfying.

The GCC patch we used is here:
