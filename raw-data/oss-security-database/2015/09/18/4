Subject: CVE request - ldapauth-fork versions < 2.3.3 are vulnerable to ldap injection.

ldapauth-fork versions < 2.3.3 are vulnerable to ldap injection
through the username parameter. This issue was reported at
https://github.com/vesse/node-ldapauth-fork/issues/21 and was fixed in
https://github.com/vesse/node-ldapauth-fork/commit/3feea43e243698bcaeffa904a7324f4d96df60e4
. ldapauth-fork version 2.3.3 includes the fix.

Can a CVE be assigned for this issue?

Note: the node-ldapauth project found at
https://github.com/trentm/node-ldapauth, which node-ldapauth-fork was
forked from, is still vulnerable to this issue. I notified the owner
of the node-ldapauth repository but have no heard back.
