Security issues can be either predisclosed in a smaller circle (the term
is "responsible disclosure"), or published directly.

As Olaf mailed the issue to the linux-nfs list a while ago, and SUSE evaluated
and found the security impact only afterwards, the issue is considered already
"public" and so gets no embargo.

If the impact would be more obvious before it might have get a predisclosure.

There are no strict rules though, just common understanding.

Ciao, Marcus
