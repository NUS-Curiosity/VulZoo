Subject: CVE Request: Plone Privilege Escalation

Hi,

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue, please?

   https://plone.org/security/20150910/privilege-escalation-in-kupu

An incorrect security declaration would allow any authenticated user to
edit kupu settings--the wysiwyg editor for old versions of Plone. Versions
affected are all versions Plone 3 through 4.2. A hotfix has been posted
only as releases are not made of these versions any longer.

The relevant code is:

The vendor credits with the discovery: Richard Mitchell

Thanks, let me know if you'd like more information.

Nathan
