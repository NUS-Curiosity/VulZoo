Subject: CVE Request: Plone XSS

Hi,

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue, please?

    https://plone.org/security/20150910/non-persistent-xss-in-plone

Plone's URL checking infrastructure includes a method for checking if URLs
valid and located in the Plone site. By passing HTML into this specially
crafted url, XSS can be achieved. Versions affected are Plone 3.x, 4.1.x,
4.2.x, <4.3.7, <5.0rc1. A hotfix has been posted for earlier versions of
Plone that are no longer provided new releases.

The relevant commit is:

https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/commit/3da710a2cd68587f0bf34f2e7ea1167d6eeee087

The vendor credits with the discovery: Peter Uittenbroek

Thanks, let me know if you'd like more information.

Nathan
