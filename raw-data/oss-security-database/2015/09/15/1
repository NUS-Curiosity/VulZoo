Subject: CVE-2015-6584: XSS in DataTables

Hi,

CVE-2015-6584 was assigned to a cross-site scripting flaw in DataTables:

https://www.netsparker.com/cve-2015-6384-xss-vulnerability-identified-in-datatables/
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6584

Any pointers on which commit fixes this issue? The advisory linked above
only mentions it was fixed in 1.10.9, but the changelog for that version
does not mention the CVE, or any change that looks like XSS for that
matter.

https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.9/
https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables/commits/master

Thanks!
