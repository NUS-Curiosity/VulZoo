3.5 had the same issue before patching. But additional
fix was required for a secondary bug found once the main issue was
patched.

The released versions I am currently aware of having this issue are:
 3.4.4 -> 3.4.11 inclusive
 3.5.0.1 -> 3.5.1 inclusive

versions older than 3.4.4 have not been investigated yet to my knowledge
.
