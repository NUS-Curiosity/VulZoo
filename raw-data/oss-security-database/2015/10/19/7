I would say applying similar rules as encryption, e.g. strong encryption
for file encryption and weaker crypto may be ok for e.g. session data.
Where those dials get set is currently anyones guess (since we have no real
public data to support decisions strongly).

It's not as easy as that. Assuming people follow
http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf and get it
correct (and optionally certified) then yes it is "not hard" but one thing
that continues to worry me:

We have AFAIK no good test suites to ensure random numbers/primes are
cryptographically secure.

If we did we wouldn't have issues like CVE-2008-0166.
