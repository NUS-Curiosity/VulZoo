Should there be any middle-ground for how much use a specific value gets?
Part of the weakdh gift is the reconition that randomly generated 1024 bit
primes might be fine for one router or website to use but is terrible when
used by millions and might repay the cost to crack it.

Do we allow 1024-bit dhparams when they are randomly generated? Or do we
also want to move these to e.g. 2048 out of abundance of caution?

(I don't share Kurt's pessimism on generating DH primes, though that does
come with the caveat that they should only be generated on systems that
have been running long enough to collect enough entropy for random number
generation to work well.)

Thanks
