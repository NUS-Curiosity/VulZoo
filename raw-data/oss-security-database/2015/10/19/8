Subject: CVE Request: MediaWiki 1.25.3, 1.24.4 and 1.23.11

We recently released new mediawiki versions to address several security
issues in core an extensions. The relevant parts of the release
announcements are here. Can we get CVE's assigned?

* Wikipedia user RobinHood70 reported that the API failed to correctly stop
adding new chunks to the upload when the reported size was exceeded,
allowing a malicious users to upload add an infinite number of chunks for a
single file upload.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91203>

* Wikipedia user RobinHood70 also reported that a malicious user could
upload chunks of 1 byte for very large files, potentially creating a very
large number of files on the server's filesystem.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91205>

* Internal review discovered that it is not possible to throttle file
uploads.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91850>

* Internal review discovered a missing authorization check when removing
suppression from a revision. This allowed users with the 'viewsuppressed'
user right but not the appropriate 'suppressrevision' user right to
unsuppress revisions.

* Richard Stanway from teamliquid.net reported that thumbnails of PNG files
generated with ImageMagick contained the local file path in the image
metadata.

* Extension:PageTriage - MediaWiki user Grunny discovered a DOM-based XSS in
the way the extension handled page titles.

* Extension:Echo - Internal review discovered that Echo could display
deleted
or suppressed usernames when the username was previously used to Thank
users.

* Extension:OAuth - Wikipedia user Sitic discovered that the OAuth
extension did not correctly enforce the IP restrictions of a Consumer when
using previously negotiated credentials.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T103022>

* Extension:OAuth - Wikipedia user Sitic discovered that OAuth would accept
a valid signature from any Consumer when checking the authorization
signature. This allowed a registered Consumer who gained access to another
Consumer's users' access tokens and secrets to use those credentials.
