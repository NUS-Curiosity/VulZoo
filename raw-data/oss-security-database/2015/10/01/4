Subject: CVE request: Heap overflow with a gif file in gdk-pixbuf < 2.32.1

Hello,

We found a heap overflow in the gdk-pixbuf implementation triggered by the
scaling of gif file.These issues are only fixed in the recent release of
gdk-pixbuf 2.32.1 but affects older versions (we tested it in a fully
updated Ubuntu 14.04).

These issues were found using QuickFuzz.

Regards,
Gustavo.
