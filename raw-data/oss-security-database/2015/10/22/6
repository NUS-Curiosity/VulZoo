I still don't get why people are pushing for "non-standard" groups.
What you need is a good security margin...

No one should be using 1024bit DH groups anymore and 2048 bit groups
should have disappeared *before* ~2020

http://www.keylength.com/en/3/

If we want PFS to work in practice we need "auditable" deployments...
and that won't be possible with custom DH groups (verifying the
security/suitability of a group is non-straightforward as the rest of
the thread has pointed out).

Really, what are we after here?Â 
- Preventing pre-computation? Pick a larger group.
- Avoiding "massive" problems in case the standardized groups do turn
out to be unsuitable (sub-groups, ...)?
- Something else?
