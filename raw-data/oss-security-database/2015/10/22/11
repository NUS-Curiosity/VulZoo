Sorry when I said a "large" pool I meant more then the current 5 or so that
seem to be in popular use, but certainly not more than a few hundred.

Basically we're in agreement, I think nothing under 2048 should even be
considered, and we probably need to bump that up in a few years anyways.

I've also been going through source code to see how people use dh
params/treat them, and I have some worrying results (basically what I
expected though, everything is terrible as usual)

I'm going to be writing this up as an article rather than a long email as I
have a few more sticky points to raise (security rabbit holes are so much
fun).
