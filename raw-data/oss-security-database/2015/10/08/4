Subject: CVE request: Gummi

Hello,

I request a CVE for Gummi (LaTeX editor with preview pane) [1], the current
release is 0.6.5.

The program uses predictable filenames for files in /tmp, which produces a race
condition [2].

I'm Debian maintainer for this software.

Please assign a CVE as appropriate.

Thanks,
Daniel Stender
