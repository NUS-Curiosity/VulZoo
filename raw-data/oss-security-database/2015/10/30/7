There are several distributions including Alpine Linux, widely used in
container environments, which by default use busybox to provide the
unzip utility. Unzipping of any files downloaded by the user, possibly
from untrusted sources, may be affected. I believe CVE is appropriate
for user-facing programs commonly used to open untrusted files even
without an automated process accepting and processing
potentially-malicious files from a client.
