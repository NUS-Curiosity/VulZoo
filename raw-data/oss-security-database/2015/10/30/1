Although this research is enormously helpful to Zstandard development
(e.g., see the
https://github.com/Cyan4973/zstd/issues/49#issuecomment-150550342
comment), we feel that it may be outside the scope of CVE because
Zstandard cannot yet be considered a "product."

Also, we think that Zstandard is, for example, not shipped in any
well-known Linux distribution. When a piece of code is offered
primarily for testing, discoveries of exploitable problems often have
low interest among CVE consumers.
