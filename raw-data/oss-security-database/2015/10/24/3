Subject: Two out of bounds reads in Zstandard / zstd

https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/26-Two-out-of-bounds-reads-in-Zstandard-zstd.html

Zstandard or short zstd is a new compression algorithm and tool
developed by Yann Collet. Fuzzing zstd with american fuzzy lop and
address sanitizer uncovered two out of bounds reads.
