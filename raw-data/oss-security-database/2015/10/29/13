Use CVE-2015-8026 for the "AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ...
WRITE of size 110" report for the
exfatfsck-heap-overflow-write-verify_vbr_checksum file. If anyone
wants to show that another part of the
2e86ae5f81da11f11673d0546efb525af02b7786 commit fixed a different
vulnerability that wasn't reported in the
25-Heap-overflow-and-endless-loop-in-exfatfsck-exfat-utils.html post,
then a second CVE ID may be available.

We don't feel that this endless-loop issue should necessarily have a
CVE ID. There may be some environments in which the attacker can cross
a privilege boundary by inserting a flash drive to trigger CPU
consumption and/or inability to complete the boot process. Often,
shutting off the computer would be an equally effective DoS.
