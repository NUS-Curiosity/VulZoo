Actually, no: it's just a "generator", so it can be almost any small
prime number - say, 3 or 7 or whatever. It can even be just co-prime
to group modulo base.

However, the value 2 is the default in OpenSSL, so there may be some
space for experiments with birthdays paradox... especially when the
modulo is small.

All implementations I know of simply use the randomized algorithms
with Miller-Rabin primality test.

There's the Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena primality test, but I'm unaware of
any attempts to use it for checking the prime candidates which passed
the Miller-Rabin primality test.
