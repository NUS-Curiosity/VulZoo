Subject: CVE request: libxslt xsltStylePreCompute() type confusion DoS

Hi,

A type confusion error within the libxslt "xsltStylePreCompute()"
function in preproc.c can lead to a DoS. Confirmed in version 1.1.28,
other versions may also be affected.

Red Hat bug:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1257962

Proposed patch (afaik, not yet committed upstream, but I believe that
it'll happen soon):
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1086465

Thanks and kind regards,
