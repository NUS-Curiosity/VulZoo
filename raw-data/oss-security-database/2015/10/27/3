Description
================
By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack
a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies. This means that the
malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate
the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

Technical Details
================

   1. Visit the following page on a site with this plugin installed.
   http://yourwordpresssite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bulletproof-security/admin/db-backup-security/db-backup-security.php

   2. Modify the value of DBTablePrefix variable with
*"></script><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
   *payload and send the request to the server.
   3. Now, the added XSS payload will be echoed back from the server
   without validating the input. It also affects wp-config.php file,
*$table_prefix
   *and corrupts the database connectivity.
