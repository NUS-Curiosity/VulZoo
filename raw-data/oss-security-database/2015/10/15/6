As far as we can tell, you are reporting an issue in functionality
that was developed for a Red Hat product. Because identical
functionality is not currently offered elsewhere, a CVE ID can be
assigned without considering the details of the securelevel behavior
that may later be implemented (or considered optimal) outside of Red
Hat. In other words, within (at least) the Red Hat product, "If the
kernel is not booted via the EFI stub, securelevel is not set even if
UEFI Secure Boot is enabled" is unquestionably incorrect behavior.

Use CVE-2015-7837.
