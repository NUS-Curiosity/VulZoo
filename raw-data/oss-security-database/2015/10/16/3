When the root user reads from /sys/kernel/debug/omap_iommu/mmu*/tlb
this leads to a corruption of the SLUB allocator control structures.
Later use of the SLUB cache causes a kernel panic, and the machine stops
responding.

As triggering the bug, causes the machine to stop responding,
the issue impacts the availability of the whole machine and its services,
that's why I consider requesting a CVE.
