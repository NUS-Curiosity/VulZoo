Subject: CVE request: lldpd crash in lldp_decode due large management address

Upstream commit:

<https://github.com/vincentbernat/lldpd/commit/dd4f16e7e816f2165fba76e3d162cd8d2978dcb2>

If compiled with effective source fortification, the vulnerability is
just a crash and not exploitable for anything else, as a result of the
compiler-emitted length check for memcpy inside the PEEK_BYTES macro.
