Subject: CVE Request: Openpgp.js Critical vulnerability in S2K

Hi,

A vulnerability in the S2K function of OpenPGP.js allows to produce a
predictable session key without knowing the passphrase.

An attacker is able to create a private PGP key that will decrypt in
OpenPGP.js regardless of the passphrase given.

Also using this flaw it is possible to forge a symmetrically encrypted PGP
message (Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Tag 3)) that
will decrypt with any passphrase in OpenPGP.js. This can be an attack
vector if successful decryption of such a message is used as an
authentication mechanism.

The bug is fixed with a strict check on unknown S2K types.

Fixed by:
https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/commit/668a9bbe7033f3f475576209305eb57a54306d29

Fixen in:

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?
