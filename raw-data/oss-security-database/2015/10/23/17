Not to beat a dead thread, but no one seems to have given a specific
example.

Imagine that you're unpacking a distribution tarball of some software in
your home directory to take a look at it, and that distribution contained
the file ../../.bashrc.  You don't want it to be able to overwrite your
.bashrc; consider the interesting things that it could do with creative
aliases, such as emailing the contents of any file you cp or rm to some
random email address.

That's an example for an individual user.  If you're unpacking things as
root (more typical for the BusyBox use case), there are much worse things
that one can do, such as overwriting /etc/shadow with known hashes or
replacing /usr/sbin/sshd with a version that has a back door.

That's why tar programs work hard to keep the contents below the directory
into which they were unpacked, and require that you unpack from / (or use
some equivalent, like -C /) if you really want to give the archive
unlimited write access to the file system.
