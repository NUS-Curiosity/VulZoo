Sorry, I didn’t mean to imply that Red Hat should do this first.   I’m also sorry if this came across as antagonistic: my intention was to try to find a way forward that would be beneficial to us both and to everyone else.

There is no reason at all why I should not do this, but I would rather do it with broad agreement.   There is also absolutely no way this could be done as closed-source and I’m not sure why you think I could or would do that.

If both Red Hat have customer requests then that would help everyone would it not?
