What you're saying simply is "what you asked me is to hard, so I won't
do it, heck I won't even try it". This is not the Open Source way.

My experience is a lot of people propose a LOT of things on email lists,
but when it actually comes down to them doing the work, nothing happens
because quite often the people proposing the work don't have the
expertise or ability to do it. oss-security@ archives are littered with
such examples (e.g. the whole code audit thing).

So it's not that I'm unwilling, I simply don't see why you need massive
corporate/community buy in at this point, premature optimization and all
that. Build a solution, or more than one solution and try them out, then
report back to oss-security@ with what works/doesn't work. In general
the best way to determine what the best solution is for a problem is to
try several solutions out. Prototype code and experimental data is worth
1000 meetings.

Come back to us with data/a working solution and then I'd be willing to
consider investing some time/energy into this, but until then this is
simply an experimental project that may not even be needed (who knows,
we don't because we're basically holding a useless meeting right now via
email).
