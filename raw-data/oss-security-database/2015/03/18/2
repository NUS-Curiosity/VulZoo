Mark -

It was suggested to me off-list that it'd be helpful to publicly specify
not only the date, but also the time (and timezone) of the forthcoming
OpenSSL releases.  Can you?

Mark's reply:

<@iamamoose> @Sh1bumi those are all "low severity" classification, previously committed issues, which will be included in roll up on Thursday too.

<@iamamoose> @Sp1l As per the security policy, low severity issues (and some moderates) get fixed in public as and when -- those issues are known public
<@iamamoose> @Sp1l CVE-2015-0285 is https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=e1b568dd2462f7cacf98f3d117936c34e2849a6b CVE-2015-0288 https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=28a00bcd8e318da18031b2ac8778c64147cd54f9

On vendor notifications so far:

<iamamoose> Per https://www.openssl.org/about/secpolicy.html we've provided details of the #openssl vulns to distros@ vendors on request, also now to LibreSSL.
<@iamamoose> @iamamoose we've also provided details today to Apple and IBM who are not currently distros@ members #openssl

BTW, OpenSSL Security Policy at
https://www.openssl.org/about/secpolicy.html specifies what kind of
issues the three severity classifications may correspond to.
