You can to accompany the package with Release{,.gpg} (or just InRelease) 
files. Kinda fat detached signature. I do it when I download files like 
hd-media/boot.img.gz for installer.

I'm not sure what you mean here. Presumably you can have any subset of 
the packages and they will be happily verified against Release file?
