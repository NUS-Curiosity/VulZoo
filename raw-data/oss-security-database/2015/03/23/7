As far as we can tell, what you mean is that
https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html says "the default settings
of the ssl module are not necessarily appropriate for your
application" and therefore it was the responsibility of the restkit
developer to handle validation, because the goals of restkit include
completely general access to all https URLs. In other words, it
appears that your position is that it is acceptable for
ssl.wrap_socket to have cert_reqs=CERT_NONE as a default, because this
is fully documented and because there's an easy-to-notice "Warning"
paragraph. This seems reasonable (although potentially controversial).

Use CVE-2015-2674.

Also, our understanding is that this does not overlap CVE-2014-9365:
the CVE-2014-9365 changes did not have any effect on whether
ssl.wrap_socket uses CERT_NONE.

Finally, your message didn't explain why https://tv.eurosport.com/ was
used: apparently, tv.eurosport.com is an example of a live web site
with a certificate-name mismatch.
