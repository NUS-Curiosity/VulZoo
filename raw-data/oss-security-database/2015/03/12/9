Subject: Assign a CVE for Python's restkit Please

Pythons Restskit[1][2][3][4] does not properly validate TLS
(see https://github.com/benoitc/restkit/issues/140). It appears to simply use
ssl.wrap_socket from the standard library, which does not do any validation
by default. This can be verified by doing:

    >>> from restkit import request
    >>> r = request("https://tv.eurosport.com/")
    >>> r.body_string()
    '<HTML><HEAD>...'

Can a CVE be assigned for this?
