(Full disclosure, while I am sending this from my personal mail
account, I'm on distros@ representing Amazon Linux AMI)

I have noticed that there are two types of disclosures on distros.
Most disclosures are sent directly to the list with or without an
embargo date attached.  These are usually low impact.  The second are
higher impact and typically sent as "there is a vulnerability in X,
please contact this person directly for more information."  The recent
OpenSSL disclosure fell into the later category.

I actually like this model a lot.  I think more upstreams will be
inclined to use distros@ if they can maintain veto power over who
actually gets the disclosure.  I also think that this allows distros@
to increase its membership in a reasonable way while not making the
list not useful.

I think it might even make sense to have a stated policy that high
impact vulnerabilities should be sent to the list in such a way.
There have been a number of issues sent to the list where I explicitly
did not request more details because I knew we were not affected
because of what we package.  I would prefer not to be disclosed on
things that we do not need to take action on (and I suspect upstreams
prefer this too).

Definitely not good.

I think this is fair.  If we do this, I think having clear guidelines
on what is required to be on linux-distros is helpful although I can
see being a long and difficult discussion.

I have to object to being labelled with either of those tags :-)

I think the alternative is to formalize what already appears to be the
existing practice: disclose distros@ on the existence of a
vulnerability but require direct contact for the details of the
vulnerability if the submitter/upstream thinks the impact is high.

I think this is both simple and defers decisions on scope of
notification to upstreams which are both seemingly good goals.
