We believe that this report can have at least one CVE ID for a fixed
issue.

Does anyone have a preference for two CVE IDs divided in this way:

  - one CVE ID for the
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=f31a9f7c71691569359fa7fb8b0acaa44bce0324
    change that was introduced in 3.17. Our incomplete understanding
    from http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/18/6 is that
    this change had security-relevant value even though it was later
    determined to be mis-protecting.

  - a second CVE id for the
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=06c8173eb92bbfc03a0fe8bb64315857d0badd06
    change

? Otherwise, we will assign only the latter.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/17/462 is about "This is to prevent
future misuses of the __ex_table entry like there was for
xsaves/xrstors." Typically, code improvements for "prevent future
misuses" purposes would not lead to additional CVE IDs.
