Digging up patches from 2011?  Why?  It should have long-ago been
backported to all relevant kernel releases from any company that has a
kernel that is still supported today that is older than the 3.2 release
and newer than 2.6.28.

And if you are a company that is ignoring stable kernel patches for
their old kernel releases, well, that's just not very wise :)

What does asking for a CVE for such an old issue help with?
