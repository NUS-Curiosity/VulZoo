Yes, there was -- the comment in the bug report does not take into
account the fact that the open-ils.pcrud endpoint supports anonymous,
unauthenticated retrieval of database objects under pcrud's purview if
a user permission for retrieval is not explicitly specified in
fm_IDL.xml.

Almost -- per my response above, unauthenticated users could also gain
access to a setting's history as, prior to the patch, anonymous
retrieval was possible via open-ils.pcrud.

Correct, and I agree with the implication that bug 1206589 would
therefore warrant two CVE numbers.
