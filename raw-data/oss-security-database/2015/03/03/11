Subject: CVE request

Hi,

As a committer for the Evergreen integrated library system project,
I'd like to request CVE number(s) for the following issues in today's
security releases.

Release announcement:

http://evergreen-ils.org/security-releases-evergreen-2-7-4-2-6-7-and-2-5-9/

Security issues resolved with the release:

[1] Org Unit Setting View Permissions Can Be Bypassed

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1424755

[2] Credit Card Processor settings visible in LSE History

https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1206589

Both bugs had permitted remote unauthenticated access of confidential
application configuration settings.

Regards,

Galen
