There's some discussion on the Debian bug about whether this should be
considered to be a security vulnerability, or just a bug. Not every
buffer overflow is a vulnerability: it can only be a vulnerability if an
attacker can trigger it.

Is there any reason why it would be useful/sensible to pass untrusted
(pseudo-terminal filename, fd) pairs to the -S option? It seems to me
that if you're passing partially or entirely attacker-controlled
filenames to this option, you have probably already lost.
