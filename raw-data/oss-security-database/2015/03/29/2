Use CVE-2014-9713 for this Debian specific issue.

We think there might be a need for a second CVE related to this
upstream issue, because the recommendation is contained in a file
bundled with the upstream software distribution, i.e.,
doc/guide/admin/access-control.sdf in the
ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/openldap-release/openldap-2.4.40.tgz
file.

(Admittedly, CVEs for documentation are infrequent. CVE-2010-4179 is
one example.)

The essence of the issue is that it's easy for documentation readers
to infer that the Basic ACLs section, as well as essentially all of
the access-control.sdf file, is suggesting that "access to * by self
write" (with no earlier write restrictions) is a typically correct or
recommended design. It seems very unlikely that only Debian is facing
a related security impact.

On the other hand, if upstream believes that its existing
documentation is completely reasonable, then having a CVE for it could
be counterproductive.
