Use CVE-2015-2780 for this "didn't require authentication" issue.

The above CVE ID only applies, of course, to the "Downloaded Berta"
product, not the very similar "Hosted Berta" product.

There is currently no CVE ID for this issue that apparently remains
within the patched code: the issue that an authenticated user can
upload a .php file. As far as we can tell, Berta implements only one
account, and this account (for the Downloaded Berta product) is
authorized to modify any file. For example, see the
http://support.berta.me/discussions/questions/21957-comment-box and
http://support.berta.me/discussions/questions/23756-php support
questions.

The ability to bypass image validation by using certain .php files
that begin with a "GIF89" substring might be considered a bug, but is
perhaps not a security bug. The getimagesize test may be present for
functionality reasons, e.g.,

  - Berta is typically used by non-experts who would simply
    be confused if they uploaded a malformed file

  - if getimagesize didn't succeed, then Berta probably wouldn't be
    able to create a thumbnail or do other image scaling

and not for security reasons.

In any case, the vendor might decide to make an announcement that
authenticated upload of .php files was actually not within the
bounds of their security model, and in that case a second CVE ID
would probably be assigned.
