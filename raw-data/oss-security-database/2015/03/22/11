Securely distributed md5 and sha1 hashes are just fine against third-party
attackers unless you can think of a way in which an attacker could set up a
collision ahead of time.

There have been attacks against dpkg that work prior to GPG sig checks,
as well as attacks against GPG itself.   But then again, TLS stacks aren't
exactly bug-free.

If any of those circumstances come up, I expect CVEs to be assigned,
but other than that any changes here are just hardening.  Something like
http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/#downloads-1 might be a good start, but I
don't know what the browser takeup is.
