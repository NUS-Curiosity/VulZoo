I think I need to add that Cygwin's setup-*.exe was special, and that it
actually needed the switch to https.  (In addition to having proper
signatures for it.)  Thank you, David!

Other software downloads also benefit from https slightly - not only in
the way I mentioned (partially hiding from some observers which exact
software is being downloaded), but also through providing some limited
security from MITM attacks for people's manual downloads even when those
people wouldn't bother to verify signatures.  This is not limited to
just Cygwin, although with Cygwin's setup-*.exe I think it mattered more
than for most other software.

However, I think this is an operations best practices issue and not a
software issue, whereas lack of proper signatures in a software update
mechanism is much closer to being an issue with the software itself.
