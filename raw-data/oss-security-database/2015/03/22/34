It's not this bad for a notable FOSS project if they're willing to put
in some work. CryptoCat and the Tor project have their keys pinned here
and they're probably in Firefox too (don't feel like checking):

https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json

If major Linux distributions wanted to put in this effort, they'd have
it too. It does mean staying on top of managing certificates, as the pin
needs to be dealt with a few months in advance of switching.

This can't scale which is the main problem with it, but I doubt that
Google or Mozilla would turn away a Linux distribution with a
significant userspace if they wanted to do this. There's little doubt
that they'd pin a key for Debian or Fedora... and it would allow a sane
bootstrap for the distributions GPG keyring.
