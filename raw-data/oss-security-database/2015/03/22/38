And the repository signing key is hopefully also published to a
well-known keyserver network along with signatures from maintainers
of the primary distribution repository, some of whom may be known
(either directly or transitively via other key signatures) to the
end user. And repository signing keys can be gradually replaced by
generating new keys well in advance and signing them with the old
keys as a transition, then adding them to the trust keyring long
enough before the current key is retired that clients already have
it once it starts to get used.
