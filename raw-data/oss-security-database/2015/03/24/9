Subject: CVE-2015-1779 qemu: vnc: insufficient resource limiting in VNC
 websockets decoder

It was found that the QEMU's websocket frame decoder processed incoming
frames without limiting resources used to process the header and
payload. An attacker able to access a guest's VNC console could use this
flaw to trigger a denial of service on the host by exhausting all
available memory and CPU.
