Subject: CVE-2014-8172

Hello All,

Recently Red Hat released an update that covers CVE-2014-8172, a
potential soft lockup when performing async io due to files_lock
excessive locking.  The fix for this is given as
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eee5cc2702929fd41cce28058dc6d6717f723f87

Neither the patch author (Al Viro) nor our kernel security team can see
how this patch prevents the async io related soft lockup.

Is there any more information about this that can be shared here or
elsewhere?
