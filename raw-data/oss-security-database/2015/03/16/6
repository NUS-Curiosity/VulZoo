That's not correct.
It wasn't fixed until 0.9.8k.

The release it appeared in was 0.9.8f.
Introduced to 0.9.8 branch by:

commit 865a90eb4f0b0e3abbdd9dc2d3a4d57595575315
Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@...nssl.org>
Date:   Sun Aug 12 18:59:03 2007 +0000

    Backport of TLS extension code to OpenSSL 0.9.8.
