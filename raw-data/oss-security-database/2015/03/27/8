spender's criticism, off Twitter:

<grsecurity> This new ASLR "weakness" with big 87.5% claims is a comedy of errors
<grsecurity> doesn't get the entropy count right for 32-bit in the email, copy+pasted the wrong entropy counts for grsec/PaX (it's 16, not 8)
<grsecurity> Further, the "fix" does absolutely nothing for local attackers and likely nothing for remote attackers either
<grsecurity> One leak of *any* library address from *any* service during the boot lifetime gives away the values
<grsecurity> And on vanilla kernels which still have no bruteforce protection whatsoever, this is less than a non-issue, & not worth dignifying in grsec
