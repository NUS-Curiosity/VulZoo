Subject: CVE-Request: AMD Bulldozer Linux ASLR weakness: Reducing entropy
 by 87.5%.

Hi,

A bug in Linux ASLR implementation which affects some AMD processors has been 
found. The issue affects to all Linux process even if they are not using shared 
libraries (statically compiled). Grsecurity/PaX is also affected.

The total entropy for the VVAR/VDSO, mmapped files and libraries of a processes 
are reduced by eight. The number of possible locations where the mapped areas 
can be placed are reduced by 87.5%.

On 32-bit systems, for example, the entropy for libraries is reduced from 28 to 
25, which means that libraries only have 32 different places where they can be 
loaded.
