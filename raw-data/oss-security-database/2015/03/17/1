I think the limited public info on this should be in here ASAP, hence
the forward.  Another bit of public info so far is, off Twitter:

<@solardiz> @joshbressers @hanno @iamamoose Maybe the posting could be worded better, if the "high" severity vuln affects only some of the versions.
<@iamamoose> @solardiz @joshbressers @hanno right, the new High is 1.0.2 only, other versions new issues just Moderate and Low
