As far as we can tell, this can be interpreted as a request for CVE
IDs for vulnerabilities in Mono, which has its own independent SSL/TLS
implementation.

The message is about three patches, but the patches are mentioned with
inconsistent terminology. What we think was meant is:

https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/1509226c41d74194c146deb173e752b8d3cdeec4

The commit message says "TLS protocol: add handshake state validation"
but this is also referenced as "The Impersonation patch" and "A TLS
impersonation attack was discovered in Mono's TLS stack by researchers
at Inria." Although there isn't a description of what impersonation
vulnerability existed, almost certainly it is "SKIP-TLS ... Mono:
default TLS library vulnerable to client impersonation. Version 3.12.1
prevents the attack" as listed on the https://www.smacktls.com web
site.


https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/9c38772f094168d8bfd5bc73bf8925cd04faad10

The commit message says "Remove the EXPORT ciphers and related code
path" - this directly matches "The EXPORT cipher removal patch" but it
is apparently also referenced as "FREAK patch" and "vulnerability to
FREAK." (It is conceivable that
1509226c41d74194c146deb173e752b8d3cdeec4 would also be applicable to
FREAK attacks.)


https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/b371da6b2d68b4cdd0f21d6342af6c42794f998b

The commit message says "Remove the client-side SSLv2 fallback," which
apparently matches both "SSLv2 support" and "SSLv2 patch." MITRE does
currently accept reports from authors of SSL/TLS code who want to
characterize their own SSLv2 support, after a recent drop of support,
as a vulnerability (i.e., "These vulnerabilities affect ..." in
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/07/2 together with
https://uk.linkedin.com/in/directhex).


Use CVE-2015-2318 for the https://www.smacktls.com SKIP-TLS issue in
Mono.

Use CVE-2015-2319 for the https://www.smacktls.com FREAK issue in
Mono.

Use CVE-2015-2320 for b371da6b2d68b4cdd0f21d6342af6c42794f998b.
