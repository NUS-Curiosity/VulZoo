How is this different from a any other compiler bug?  They can be abused
in similar ways by crafted code, and we don't treat them as
vulnerabilities (unless there is actual application impact beyond
synthetic test cases).

Note that I'm not saying this isn't a nice find, I'm just not sure if it
should be considered as a security by itself.
