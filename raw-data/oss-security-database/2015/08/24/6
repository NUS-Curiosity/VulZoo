Subject: Re: CVE request: uglify-js node.js module <2.4.24 incorrectly handles
 non-boolean comparisons during minification

This also affects the uglifier ruby gem as well, which is a "Ruby wrapper

No fixed version released yet, but I submitted a PR to fix in
https://github.com/lautis/uglifier/pull/86.
