Subject: CVE Request: devscripts: licensecheck: arbitrary shell command
 injection

Hi

devscripts[0,1] contains a utility licensecheck, a simple license
checker for source files. It is as well included at least in Ubuntu
and Fedora[2].

Jonas Smedegaard[3] (and Jakub Wilk with a follow-up message) reported
that licensecheck is prone to arbitrary shell command injection via
shell metacharacters in filenames. The issue was introduced in
devscripts v2.15.5[4] and fixed in v2.15.7[5].

Could you please assign a CVE to identify this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
