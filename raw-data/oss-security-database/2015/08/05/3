Subject: CVE Request: PCRE Library Heap Overflow Vulnerability

PCRE is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression
capabilities in the Perl programming language. The PCRE library is
incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash,
Apache, Nginx, PHP.

PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow.
During the compilation of a malformed regular expression, more data is
written on the malloced block than the expected size output by
compile_regex. Exploits with advanced Heap Fengshui techniques may allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the
affected application.

Thank you && Regards.
