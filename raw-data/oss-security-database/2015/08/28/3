Subject: CVE request: XSS vulnerability in jsoup related to incomplete tags at
 EOF

Described in this pull request by Tommy Johansen:

“
We use Hibernate Validator (HV) and the @SafeHtlm annotation to validate
input from users. During a security review we discovered that an unsafe
XSS vector slipped by the validator. During debugging HV we discovered
that the source of the problem was related to how Jsoup handled tags
without a closing > when reaching EOF.
