Subject: CVE Request: Request Tracker: cross-site scripting in cryptography
 interface

Hi

Could you please assign a CVE for the second cross-site scripting
issue mentioned in
http://blog.bestpractical.com/2015/08/security-vulnerabilities-in-rt.html

> RT 4.2.0 and above are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
> attack via the cryptography interface.  This vulnerability could
> allow an attacker with a carefully-crafted key to inject JavaScript
> into RT's user interface. Installations which use neither GnuPG nor
> S/MIME are unaffected.

Fixed by:
https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/36a461947b00b105336adb4997d1c7767d8484c4

According to Shawn M. Moore (Cc'ed) for this second issue there was
not requested a CVE.

Regards,
Salvatore
