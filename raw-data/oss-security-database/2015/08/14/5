Subject: Alleged libstdc++ vulnerabilities

Does anybody know what this is about and can point to the relevant PRs?

“discovered serious security bugs in […] libstdc++”

<http://www.news.gatech.edu/2015/08/13/georgia-tech-finds-11-security-flaws-popular-internet-browsers-using-new-analysis-method>

The USENIX paper
<https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-lee.pdf>
does not back up this claim.
