We contacted the administrators of the web page that Florian identified
as the origin of the error and asked them about it.  I include their
response, which confirms that it was an inadvertent typo.

If you spot "CVE-2015-4650" (the typo'ed number) in use elsewhere,
please either inform the page owner of the error or inform
security-officer@....org if you think that people will be significantly
mislead by the error.

Thank you,
