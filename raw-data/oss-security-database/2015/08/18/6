Subject: CVE Request for glusterfs:  fuse check return value of setuid

Problem description from the bug: 

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1254488

setuid() sets the effective user ID of the calling process.  
If the effective UID of the caller is root, the real UID and
saved set-user-ID are also set. On success, zero is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

Note: there are cases where setuid() can fail even when the 
caller is UID 0; it is a grave security error to omit checking
for a failure return from setuid(). if an environment limits 
the number of processes a user can have, setuid() might fail if
the target uid already is at the limit.

Can we have CVE assigned to this ?
