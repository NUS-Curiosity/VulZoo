Blimey, but this thread takes me back to the 70s/80s, when we used to send 
ASCII bombs around on the Amateur ("Ham") packet radio network.

Send a sequence to program a function key (such as F1) with "FORMAT C: /Y" 
(or whatever the syntax was).

For belt'n'braces, include the sequence that hit F1...

Remember when DOS was not a mere denial of service?  Well, some could 
argue that it was, even back then...
