Could you assign CVEs for the other two issues as well?

  * sshd(8): fix circumvention of MaxAuthTries using keyboard-
    interactive authentication. By specifying a long, repeating
    keyboard-interactive "devices" string, an attacker could request
    the same authentication method be tried thousands of times in
    a single pass. The LoginGraceTime timeout in sshd(8) and any
    authentication failure delays implemented by the authentication
    mechanism itself were still applied. Found by Kingcope.

  * sshd(8): OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be world-
    writable. Local attackers may be able to write arbitrary messages
    to logged-in users, including terminal escape sequences.
    Reported by Nikolay Edigaryev.

Or have they CVEs already?

Thanks.
