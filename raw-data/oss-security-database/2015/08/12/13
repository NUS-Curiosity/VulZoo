Far more important than having CVEs would be to know when (in what
version) these bugs were introduced, with what commits, and what commits
fix them.  For checking derived versions, and for backports.

Would you share this info, please?

(I guess I could find it myself, but I think it's preferable to have it
posted to oss-security anyway, so I prefer to ask you.)

Thanks,

Alexander
