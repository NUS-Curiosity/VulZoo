Subject: CVE request - Processor side channels using out of order execution

Hi,

I would like to request a CVE for a processor side channels using out of order execution. 

Past discussion of this includes: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/11/16 <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/11/16>

Previously requested: no
Type: Side Channel Vulnerability

Affected versions: up till current processor architecture 

Brief Description: 
Simultaneous multi-threading on current processors allows for one process to exploit out-of-order execution optimizations to leak information from co-executed processes. Conversely, this same setup allows for one process to force an increase or a decrease in out-of-order-execution optimizations in the other process, thereby effecting its computed values and control flow.
