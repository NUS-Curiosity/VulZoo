Can I get CVE for WordPress 4.2.3 and earlier multiple vulnerabilities, thank
you.

https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/

"""
WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a security release for all previous
versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a
site, which were discovered by Marc-Alexandre Montpas of Sucuri, Helen Hou-Sand√≠
of the WordPress security team, Netanel Rubin of Check Point, and Ivan Grigorov.
It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by
Johannes Schmitt of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post
from being edited, discovered by Mohamed A. Baset.

Our thanks to those who have practiced responsible disclosure of security
issues.
"""
