Subject: Terminal escape sequences - the new XSS for admins?

So we've had a bunch of this stuff over the years:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=terminal+escape

And now more recently:

http://turbochaos.blogspot.ca/2014/08/journalctl-terminal-escape-injection.html
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1084577

And we have at least one more coming down the pipeline that's pretty
widespread.

Also I'm thinking of all those docker apps that log to STDOUT.

So the basic TL;DR: please don't use really ancient terminal programs that
are vulnerable to this stuff. It appears in testing that most (all?) of the
Red Hat stuff is ok, but I can't speak for other vendors.
