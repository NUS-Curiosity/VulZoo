I find this an interesting stance. Don't you decide on your own
whether your customers are impacted by a bug sufficiently to require
a fix (security vulnerability or otherwise)? It seems reasonable to
me that you would choose whether or not to ship a patch
independently of how MITRE chooses to classify (or not) the
associated bug... and vice versa, if a CVE is assigned for a bug you
consider to have minimal impact, do you release a patch for it
anyway just because there's a CVE?
