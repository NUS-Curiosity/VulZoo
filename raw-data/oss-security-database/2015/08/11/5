This has nothing to do with us not fixing flaws just because they don't 
get a CVE. I assure you that we've fixed security flaws that had no CVEs 
before. And if you look through our CVE database, you'll find many 
examples of simple crashers that unfortunately got a CVE, which we did 
not fix.
The main reason for not fixing it for now is that we think 80 bits of 
randomness is enough for most applications up to this day, especially if 
it's session data and not permanent storage, etc. Therefore we classify 
this issue as having a Low security impact. If a CVE is assigned for 
this issue, we will create an entry in our CVE database but the end 
result will likely be the same, wontfix.
