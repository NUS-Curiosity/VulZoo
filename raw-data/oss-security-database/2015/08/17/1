Last time I ran zzuf on jasper there were plenty of crashes and bugs
that triggered a high resource consumption - pretty much like the ones
I found on openjpeg at work. They looked less severe, however.

I should still have some samples in another machine, if anyone is
interested in taking a look at those and/or using them as a base for
further fuzzing.
