The bsdtar issue looks like this one:
https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/515

I have reported ~20 such issues in libarchive in the past months.
Unfortunately there are still some open issues, I was hoping to create
an advisory once everything is done, but it has taken much longer than
expected.
