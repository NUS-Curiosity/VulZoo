> PCRE is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression
> capabilities in the Perl programming language. The PCRE library is
> incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash,
> Apache, Nginx, PHP.
>
> PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow.
> During the compilation of a malformed regular expression, more data is
> written on the malloced block than the expected size output by
> compile_regex. Exploits with advanced Heap Fengshui techniques may allow an
> attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the
> affected application.
