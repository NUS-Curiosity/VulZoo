Stupid question but who is "We"? I mean it's your list and if you want me
to definitely not post these, I can respect that no problem, OTOH if you're
looking for community consensus I doubt that'll happen in any meaningful

sufficient if I privately inform you of such CVE rejects so they can be put
int he database?
