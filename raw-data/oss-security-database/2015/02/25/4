What about things like -Wl,-rpath=/tmp ?

That one is particularly egregious and, as Casper mentioned, there are
other ways of getting stupid RPATHs.  I've seen a fair number of them :)

Would it be useful to check to see if and rpath directory is not
writable by the someone other than the uid/euid?  Of course, it does
nothing for an RPATH that goes over NFS.

The Fedora packaging guidelines forbid the use of rpath completely
which is beginning to look more and more attractive.
