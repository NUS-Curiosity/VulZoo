We think this requires one CVE ID for jabberd2 and one CVE ID for
libidn, because the issues could be addressed independently. For
example, if only jabberd2 is changed, then libidn still has an
out-of-bounds read issue with input from other programs. If only
libidn were changed and (for example) the change was to fail on
invalid UTF-8 data, then that would have a DoS effect on jabberd2.

Did you believe that libidn does not have a vulnerability on
its own?
