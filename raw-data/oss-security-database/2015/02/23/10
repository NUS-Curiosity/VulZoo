The code corresponding to:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=959433

is gone from newer release. You should upgrade, since we don't support
old releases.


As for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=959434

"Fixing it would not change anything. Xlet (that requests the mount, or is
being executed from the mount) could as well uncompress the files by self
where it wants, even download other files from internet."

So, maybe you want to have a full Xlet sandboxing? Or is it something
else?
