Subject: CVE-2015-0275 -- Linux kernel: fs: ext4: fallocate zero range page
 size > block size BUG()

Currently there is a bug in zero range code which causes zero range
calls to only allocate block aligned portion of the range, while
ignoring the rest in some cases.

In some cases, namely if the end of the range is past isize, we do
attempt to preallocate the last nonaligned block. However this might
cause kernel to BUG() in some carefully designed zero range requests on
setups where page size > block size.

Proposed upstream patch:
