Subject: CVE request: novnc: session hijack through insecurely set session
 token cookies

Hello,

Paul McMillan reported that noVNC prior to this patch:
https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/commit/ad941faddead705cd611921730054767a0b32dcd
allows an attacker to steal insecurely set session token cookies, hijacking active or inactive VNC sessions.

Can a CVE be assigned to this please?

Thanks.
