Subject: Re: workaround for GHOST glibc vulnerability CVE-2015-0235

Added static, thank.

You are right, gethostbyname is vulnerable too, but less.
gethostbyname is implemented in
http://osxr.org/glibc/source/nss/getXXbyYY.c?v=glibc-2.17#0101
It allocates buffer from heap, not stack, which is less danger.

Actually the bug is in __nss_hostname_digits_dots @
http://osxr.org/glibc/source/nss/digits_dots.c?v=glibc-2.17#0036.
Is it much more complex and dangerous to overload
__nss_hostname_digits_dots. Better upgrade to newer glibc.

Thanks
