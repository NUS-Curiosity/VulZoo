Subject: CVE request: heap buffer overflow in glibc swscanf

Greetings,

https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16618
is almost 1 year old, and still not fixed in glibc trunk.

I have verified that the test case from it fails with libc6
2.19-0ubuntu6.5 and current trunk glibc.

Don't know if it's exploitable, but it seems like it could easily be.

(I'll see if I can fix it in the mean time.)

Thanks,
