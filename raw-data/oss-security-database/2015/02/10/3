Subject: CVE-Request -- Linux kernel - panic on nftables rule flush

Gday,

I'd like to request a CVE for a denial of service attack found here here https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91441.

A remote attacker with the NET_CAP_ADMIN capability could use this to panic (denial of service) a system if they were able to flush a chain with a jump target.

More info: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1190966

Thanks

Wade Mealing
