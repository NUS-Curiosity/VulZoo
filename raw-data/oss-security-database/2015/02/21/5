> I'm not actually sure what "types of attacks" are blocked

The vendor can expand on this if they wish. At present, the available
information is this statement:

  In 1.3, cabacdc2 + 3d0625d8 together form at least a *partial* fix

in the http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/16/7 post. The
concept of a code change with a "partial fix" ordinarily means that at
least one attack vector is blocked by that code change, such as an
attack vector that relied on a specific code path that was affected by
the change.
