And as with nginx and OpenSSL s3_srvr.c, there's no retval check on
RAND_pseudo_bytes() when creating the IV to encrypt the session
ticket.

This isn't exploitable with the default RNG (you won't get this far
without a working RNG), but be careful if your engine is flaking out -
 you could be sending something else out with your IVs...

For the record:
-1 : Error, buffer not filled
 0 : Buffer filled with potentially predictable entropy (unless an
engine aliased their RAND_bytes interface to RAND_pseudo_bytes!)
 1 : Success
