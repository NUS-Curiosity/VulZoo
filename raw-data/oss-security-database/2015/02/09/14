Subject: Re: CVE-Request -- Google Email App 4.2.2 remote denial of service

:A bug in the stock Google email application version 4.4.2.0200 has been 
:found. An attacker can remotely perform an Denial Of Service attack by 
:sending a specially crafted email. No interaction form the user is 
:needed to produce the crash just receive the malicious email.
:
:When the victim receives the malicious email, the application crashes 
:while trying to download the email.The email application can not be used 
:until the offending email is removed.
:
:The email version 4.2.2.0200 running on a Samsung Galaxy 4 mini fully 
:updated (19 Jan 2015) is vulnerable. Newer versions 4.2.2.0400 are not 
:affected.

FWIW, Android 5.0/Lollipop has removed this Email app and merged its
functionality with the Gmail app.  I would argue that your calling the
app the "Google email app" versus the "Android email app" would confuse
things, but Google's done enough confusing here by having their Gmail
app now do more than Gmail.  :)
