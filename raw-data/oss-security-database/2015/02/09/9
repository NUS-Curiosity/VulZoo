Subject: Re: CVE-2013-4578 OpenJDK: jarsigner does not detect
 unsigned bytecode injected into signed jars

Hi Kurt,

This issue was addressed in Java 7U51 as a security-in-depth fix because
of CVSS 0 score. Oracle doesn't assign CVEs to CVSS 0 issues.

Please note: the correct email address to contact Oracle Security Alert
team is secalert_us@...cle.com.

Thanks,
-Ritwik
