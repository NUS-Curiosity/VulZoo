Subject: CVE-Request: Linux ASLR mmap weakness: Reducing entropy by half

Hi,

A bug in Linux ASLR implementation for versions prior to 3.19 has been 
found. The issue is that the mmap area for processes is not properly 
randomized on some architectures.

Affected systems have reduced the mmap base area entropy of the 
processes by half.


Details at:

Could you please assign a CVE-ID for this?
