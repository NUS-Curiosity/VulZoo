It is probably at least a design flaw (and a reasonably
well-documented one at that [0]).  Bash on the other hand is not
vulnerable to the same class of problems:

$ cat testme
testme() {
   x=backfromthedead
   local x
   echo $x
}
testme

$ bash testme

$ dash testme
backfromthedead

Best wishes,
Mike

[0] $ man dash
