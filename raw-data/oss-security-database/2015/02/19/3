Our perspective at this point is that FreeBSD-CURRENT is not a
"software product" and typically should not have CVE assignments. If
anyone on the FreeBSD Security Officer Team believes that this, for
whatever reason, is a case where FreeBSD-CURRENT should have a CVE, we
are willing to go with their preference.

A project on github can be a software product if the developers choose
to use github that way. FreeBSD-CURRENT is, for example, advertised as
"any given commit is just as likely to introduce new bugs as to fix
existing ones"
(https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/current-stable.html).
The defined use cases for FreeBSD-CURRENT don't suggest that it has
any expected behavior, security-wise or otherwise: it is just a point
in the development process. Also, we don't happen to know of
situations where third parties repackage and support FreeBSD-CURRENT
code (e.g., as the embedded OS of an appliance).
