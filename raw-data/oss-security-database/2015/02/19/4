I respectfully disagree due to the fact that FreeBSD gives explicit
instructions on running current:

https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html

and even places it above using -stable in the order in the book. Looking
at the instructions:

To track FreeBSD-CURRENT:

Join the freebsd-current and the svn-src-head lists. This is essential
in order to see the comments that people are making about the current
state of the system and to receive important bulletins about the current
state of FreeBSD-CURRENT.

if you look at those mailing lists you will see there are a ton of
posters, so obviously more than a few people are using this.

Any ways just my 5 cents, I don't think it's a good precedent to set
that "oh the vendor says this is beta/not supported/etc so no CVE" when:

1) a lot of people use it (e.g. Google Chrome was a "beta", but it  had
several million users so it got CVEs)
2) the affected timeframe was quite significant (4 months, so for yearly
key roll over that's 1/3 of the population affected)
3) the problem can linger on despite the system being updated (e.g. any
certs/keys need to be re-generated).
