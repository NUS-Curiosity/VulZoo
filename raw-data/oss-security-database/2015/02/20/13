But wouldn't that make the libraries and executables less reliable?

They can pick up random libraries or cause some delays when one of the 
relative paths points to a NFS mounted directory.

Any reason you can't change to using LD_LIBRARY_PATH for testing?

I've run into relative directories and even /net/xxx/ search paths but I 
believe these should never be used as part of a binary distribution.
