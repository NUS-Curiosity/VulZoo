Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
oss-security@...ts.openwall.com mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at oss-security-owner at lists.openwall.com.

I'm sorry, I've been unable to carry out your request,
since the address

   constantine.shulyupin@...il.com

was not on the oss-security mailing list when I received
your request and is not a subscriber of this list.

If you unsubscribe, but continue to receive mail, you're subscribed
under a different address than the one you currently use.
Please look at the header for:

'Return-Path: <oss-security-return-1234-user=host.dom@...ts.openwall.com>'

This shows that the subscription address is ``user@...t.dom''.
The unsubscribe address for this user would be:
'oss-security-unsubscribe-user=host.dom@...ts.openwall.com'.

Just mail to that address, adjusted for the real subscription address.

If the message has a ``List-Unsubscribe:'' header, you can send
a message to the address in that header. It contains the subscription
already coded into it.

For some mail programs, you need to make the headers visible to
see the return path:

For Eudora 4.0, click on the "Blah blah ..." button.
For PMMail, click on "Window->Show entire message/header".

If this still doesn't work, I'm sorry to say that I can't help you.
Please FORWARD a list message together with a note about what you're
trying to achieve and a list of addresses that you might be subscribed
under to my owner:

    <oss-security-owner at lists.openwall.com>

who will take care of it. My owner is a little bit slower than I am,
so please be patient.


--- Administrative commands for the oss-security list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

For help and a description of available commands, send a message to:
   <oss-security-help@...ts.openwall.com>

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <oss-security-subscribe@...ts.openwall.com>

To remove your address from the list, just send a message to
the address in the ``List-Unsubscribe'' header of any list
message. If you haven't changed addresses since subscribing,
you can also send a message to:
   <oss-security-unsubscribe@...ts.openwall.com>

For addition or removal of addresses, I'll send a confirmation
message to that address. When you receive it, simply reply to it
to complete the transaction.

If you need to get in touch with the human owner of this list,
please send a message to:

   <oss-security-owner at lists.openwall.com>

Please include a FORWARDED list message with ALL HEADERS intact
to make it easier to help you.
