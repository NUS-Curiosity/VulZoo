A build-packet.c report says "Use after free" but the listed commit
is for an invalid memory read that was fixed in two other .c files.

The keybox_search.c report says "memcpy with overlapping ranges" but
the listed commit apparently fixes "sign extension on shift" issues.

We suspect that what you mean is that the commits are directly
applicable as listed, and the difference is that your report states
the ultimate impact found by afl-fuzz, and your report isn't intended
to directly show how that ultimate impact results from the code
problem.

With this interpretation:

  CVE-2015-1606 - Use after free, resulting from failure to skip
                  invalid packets

  CVE-2015-1607 - memcpy with overlapping ranges, resulting from
                  incorrect bitwise left shifts

There's currently no information suggesting that the NULL pointer
dereference issues could have a security impact; they currently do not
have CVE IDs.
