Subject: CVE-Request -- Landsknecht Adminsystems v.4.0.1 (DEV, beta version)
 -- Reflecting XSS, unrestricted file-upload and underlaying CSRF

Hi Steve, Josh, vendors, list.

I found reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities, a unrestricted file-upload and
underlaying CSRF-vulnerabilities in CMS Landsknecht Adminsystems v. 4.0.1
(DEV, beta version).

Technical details:

=======================
Reflecting XSS-vulnerabilities
=======================

A reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the index.php and can be
abused via the vulnerable "page"-parameter. See the following example,
including exploit-example:

http://
{TARGET}/index.php?page=home%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&lang=de%27

Another reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the system.php-file
and can be exploited via the vulnerable "id" parameter:

http://
{TARGET}/asys/site/system.php?action=users_users&mode=edit&id=1%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

==================================
Unrestricted file-upload / Underlaying CSRF
==================================

Registered users and administrators are able to upload arbitrary files via
the following upload-form, located here:

http://{TARGET}/asys/site/files.php?action=upload&path=/

As there seems not be an existing permission-model, users can read/execute
files  an administrator/user uploaded and vice versa.

This issue includes an underlaying CSRF-vulnerability, as a user is able to
upload a malicious file and trick another user or the administrator into
visiting the link to the file.

All files get uploaded here without being renamed:

http://{TARGET}/upload/files/{UPLOADED_FILE}


Can I please have a CVE-ID / CVE-IDs for this issue?

Thank you very much.

Greetings from Germany.
