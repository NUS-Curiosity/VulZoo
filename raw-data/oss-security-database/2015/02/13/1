Why does sudo run the target program with both effective and real ids
set to root? Why not run with only the effective uid set to root? Then
the program would know that it's being run by an unprivileged user
with elevated privileges (and its libc would restrict or ignore
environment variables for internal libc use). Does such invocation
break too many programs?
