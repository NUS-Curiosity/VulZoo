Can you provide more information about a scenario in which a GnuPG
NULL pointer dereference has a security impact? A typical use case of
GnuPG is a single session with a single command line. The code in
question is not part of Libgcrypt, which may be used for long-running
processes.

Do you mean that:

  1. it is possible to create the problematic keyring
     using --import commands, e.g., the user has
     imported normal keys for years and now imports
     a crafted key

  2. the problematic keyring makes the product largely
     unusable, e.g., there is a crash with a common
     command such as --list-keys

  3. it is not possible to fix the problematic keyring
     with any available commands such as --delete-keys

  4. therefore, the product remains unusable unless the
     user obtains other code to correct the keyring, and
     thus there is a denial of service

?

If the situation were something like:

  1. the problematic keyring cannot be created using
     --import commands; the issue is specific to a
    new keyring that a user obtains from an untrusted
    source

  2. there is a crash in some situation

  3. the user can avoid the impact by discontinuing
     use of this new keyring

then we think that a CVE ID may not be applicable.

Also, access to each of your four crashes.fuzzing-project.org URLs
currently fails with a 403. We can probably provide at least two CVE
IDs in total after those URLs are available.
