> This may need 2 CVE's

We think there should be zero CVEs because the report is apparently
about a developer's debugging code that was never shipped.

> ./channels/drdynvc/tsmf/tsmf_media.c
> "/tmp/FreeRDP_Frame_%d.ppm"

As far as we can tell, this code has been in an "#if 0" starting from
when the code was originally added to FreeRDP in:

  https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/commit/dadb94a1e343648503949094a50053d81212a153

In other words, we don't think this code would ever have been
reachable by an end user. The "#if 0" also apparently exists in the
freerdp-1.0.2.tar.gz that's included in the
freerdp-1.0.2-5.el7.src.rpm file.

> ./libfreerdp-gdi/gdi.c
> #ifdef DUMP_REMOTEFX_TILES
>                        sprintf(tile_bitmap, "/tmp/rfx/tile_%d.bmp",

As far as we can tell, there is no build option for
DUMP_REMOTEFX_TILES or documentation recommending that an end user
define DUMP_REMOTEFX_TILES, either in the upstream distribution or in
a source RPM.

Even if there were a different SPLIT/MERGE process for less important
cases, a single CVE ID for issues reported in different versions would
be among the harder process changes because it affects whether (or
how) the CVE ID could be used on the cve.mitre.org web site, and
complicates some types of patch-based remediation.
