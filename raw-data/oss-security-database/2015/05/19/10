Subject: Re: Re: CVE Request + Advisory: PHP str_repeat() sign
 mismatch based memory corruption

At companies that host php for customers and use apparmor to jail the
customers, this type of attack would allow a customer to possibly take off
their apparmor hat and gain elevated privileges.  That is, being able to
execute arbitrary code outside of the php runtime in the context of the
apache process would allow the attacker to call change_hat().
