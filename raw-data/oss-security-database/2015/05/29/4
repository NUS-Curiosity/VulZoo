Both of these CVEs are addressed in a single commit, that also covers
few other functions not mentioned in either of the two bug reports
(dir()/opendir() and chroot()).  Which CVE do those additional fixes
fall under?  They are not 5.4 regressions, so probably not
CVE-2015-4025, but maybe not under CVE-2015-4026 either given that bug
68598 only mentions pcntl_exec().


I think there are few fixes in 5.4.40 / 5.5.24 / 5.6.8 that should have
CVEs assigned:

More CVE-2015-4025 / CVE-2015-4026 / CVE-2006-7243 like issues.  More
notes on what got changed is in RHBZ:

Can CVEs be assigned for these?  Thank you!
