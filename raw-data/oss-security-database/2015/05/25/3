Subject: CVE request for attic : encrypted backups attack

Hello,

attic is a deduplicating backup program written in Python.
It features encrypted remote backups.

Unfortunately :
https://github.com/jborg/attic/issues/271
allow an attacker able to modify a remote encrypted directory to cause the
client to send unencrypted data on the next backup run.

It was fixed in this commit :
https://github.com/jborg/attic/commit/78f9ad1faba7193ca7f0acccbc13b1ff6ebf9072

Could a CVE be assigned ?

Regards,
Raphaël
