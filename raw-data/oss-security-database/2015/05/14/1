Yes, the prime minister rejected the software but their argument is that it's open source and anyone can verify the code.

I will try to find some. So far the software was used in the university elections (across Greece for important decisions, within universities for dean / ...)

Of course not, their argument is that "It is mathematically proven that nobody can alter the votes" yet they forget the huge stack from processor errors all the way up to code errors (as I have proved to exist).

I believe in the website https://zeus.grnet.gr/ there are emails but since it's Open Source and you offer your services for free, I believe it is a lot better if you do this on GitHub repo because:

1. Everybody can see that you have contributed to this.
2. Everybody can see your findings and do not use this software unless all bugs are closed. 
3. They are easily trackable and assignable to their developers. 
4. If they don't do it, people can fork the code and use your opened issues to make a secure copy of it.
5. [...]
