We do not feel that a CVE is required; however, Harlan can choose to
have a CVE ID if the undocumented risky behavior is going to be
announced as a vulnerability.

More specifically, it appears that mode 7 itself is, in some sense,
deprecated (e.g., "mode7 ... Enables processing of NTP mode 7
implementation-specific requests which are used by the deprecated
ntpdc program" on the
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/miscopt.html page and
"functionally deprecating ntpdc" on the
http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SoftwareDownloads page). If so,
then we do not feel that there is a requirement for the documentation
to precisely specify the effect of a command-line option on a
deprecated feature. The -A documentation doesn't directly make a false
statement about authentication within mode 7; it simply does not
discuss mode 7.

If mode 7 itself isn't deprecated, and there is a supported use case
in which the user may choose to enable both mode 7 and the -A option,
then announcing the behavior/documentation mismatch as a vulnerability
is probably more useful.
