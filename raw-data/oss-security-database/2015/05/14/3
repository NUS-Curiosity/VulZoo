Subject: Cross-site scripting flaw in AskBot

Hi,

It was reported to us that certain versions of AskBot are vulnerable to
a cross-site scripting flaw. It is unclear which version fixed this flaw
and what the actual patch was.

Red Hat assigned CVE-2015-3169 to this flaw; Red Hat bug is filed at:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1221616

If anyone wants to dig through https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel
and find the root cause and the patch, please post your findings here.

Thanks!
