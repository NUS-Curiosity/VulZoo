I kicked off my post mentioning DDoS mitigation was one of the reasons
services contract with CDNs such as CloudFlare.

I agree achieving end-to-end (E2E) security with interposition is an
interesting security research area. In fact, it would be great if as a
result of this thread more members of the infosec and oss communities
were motivated to tackle that.

Dean Pierce points out that outsourcing across national borders can have
legal implications but this is outside of my area of expertise.

I've already alluded to the general security issues that arise in MITM
setups. More specifically, breaking E2E security with interposition adds
well-known complications/issues: rogue employees at the interposing
service, increased attack surfaces, more points of failure, inability to
verify path integrity, inability to verify content integrity,
misconstruing of communications as E2E-secure by non-experts, among many
others. 

As you said, lots of people are interested in ways of achieving E2E
security with intermediation - precisely because there is recognition
current TLS interposition models are not satisfactory. 

My specific interest is how OSS projects (e.g. browsers, TLS stacks,
etc.) can address security issues that arise from SSL/TLS interposition.
Also of interest is leveraging the intersection of infosec/oss/crypto to
develop related innovations (e.g. interposition that coexists with
uncompromised E2E security).
