Despite whatever infrastructure and other real world challenges a 
company/organisation faces, what you write above is the most important 
issue. When we all see the lock in the URL bar, we expect and hope that 
the communications between our browser and the company/organisation is 
encrypted *all the way* to the company/org we identify in the URL.

This is a fundamental issue of trust which cannot be broken at all 
costs, even if it means more disruption to services. There is very 
little trust left out there and we cannot afford to erode it further, as 
this is more damaging than less service availability.

Apologies for continuing the off topic nature of this thread.
