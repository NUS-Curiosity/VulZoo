Subject: CVE request: vulnerability in wpa_supplicant and hostapd

Hi, I don't see a CVE assigned for this anywhere:

http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/eap-pwd-missing-payload-length-validation.txt

"EAP-pwd missing payload length validation

A vulnerability was found in EAP-pwd server and peer implementation used
in hostapd and wpa_supplicant, respectively. The EAP-pwd/Commit and
EAP-pwd/Confirm message payload is processed without verifying that the
received frame is long enough to include all the fields. This results in
buffer read overflow of up to couple of hundred bytes."

Patches are included in: http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/

Thank you!
