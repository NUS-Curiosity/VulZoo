It appears that the critical issue you've identified is execution of
code found in an untrusted location under /tmp. Use CVE-2015-3649.

In most cases, this specific class of /tmp misuse issues is unrelated
to Symlink Following. However, when such an issue exists, it is
conceivable that a Symlink Following vulnerability also exists, could
be fixed independently, and would be of interest to an attacker who
has a goal of overwriting a file rather than directly executing code.
The MITRE CVE team has not done any original research to check for a
Symlink Following vulnerability. If a Symlink Following vulnerability
were to exist, it would not be within the scope of CVE-2015-3649.

Also, the message refers to "usage of YAML in a insecure way." We have
not done any original research to determine whether, in a scenario
where the "untrusted location under /tmp" were no longer used, a
YAML-related vulnerability would still be exploitable. If an
independent "YAML misuse" vulnerability were to exist, it would not be
within the scope of CVE-2015-3649.
