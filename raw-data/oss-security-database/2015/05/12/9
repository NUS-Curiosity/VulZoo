Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Horizon

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Persistent XSS in Horizon metadata dashboard
Reporter: Sunil Yadav (IBM)
Products: Horizon
Affects: version 2015.1.0

Description:
Sunil Yadav from IBM Security Services reported a persistent XSS in
Horizon. An authenticated user may conduct a persistent XSS attack by
setting a malicious metadata to a Glance image, a Nova flavor or a Host
Aggregate and tricking an administrator to load the update metadata
page. Once executed in a legitimate context this attack may result in a
privilege escalation. All Horizon setups are affected.
