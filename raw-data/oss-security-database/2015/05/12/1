Subject: CVE request: libinfinity did not correctly check certificates for
 validity

Hi,

Debian bug #783601[1] reported that Gobby - a collaborative text editor
- silently accepted expired certificates. The upstream bug report is
[2]. The bug is actually in libinfinity and the fix is available on [2].

libinfinity does support certificate pinning and hence contains the
ability to disable some checks like trusted issuer and hostname
verification. However the catch-all validity check was in the wrong
location.

Please assign a CVE ID for this.

Kind regards and thanks
Philipp Kern
