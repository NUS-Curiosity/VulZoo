Subject: CVE Request - CSRF and XSS in Encrypted Contact Form Wordpress Plugin v1.0.4

Hi,

I discovered CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in the Encrypted Contact Form
Wordpress Plugin v1.0.4 which was responsibly disclosed and patched by the
vendor in v1.1.

I request a CVE for the same.

Thanks & regards,
