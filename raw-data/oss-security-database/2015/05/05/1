I've been thinking for a while that in the non-HTTPS world, it would
be useful to have some kind of content verification without
encryption, through hashes in URLs or the like. But the logical
conclusion from this thread is that it's also useful in the encrypted
context as well, as not all endpoints may be equally trusted.

Having said that, what you do if the content you get back isn't as
expected isn't totally clear.
