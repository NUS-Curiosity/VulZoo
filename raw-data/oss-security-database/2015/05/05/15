Thanks Florian, this looks great. I'm just looking at the new ccpp, Is
it intentional that os-release and so on are still copied from the
process root? I realize now the dump directory is owned by root, so
there's no direct way to read it, but it seems like asking for trouble
to have a copy of /etc/shadow in there or something.

Tavis.
