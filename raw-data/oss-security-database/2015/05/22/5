> Fix remote crash - invalid packet order causes lookup of NULL pointer. Not exploitable, just DoS.

Use CVE-2015-4054.

issues/42 says "we're suffering from a segmentation fault every now
and then on CentOS6 x86_64 with pgbouncer 1.5.4. The instance is
dying" and lists 5 different PIDs. As far as we can tell, this means
that each segmentation fault caused a complete pgbouncer outage, and
pgbouncer was then restarted manually or with a third-party monitoring
program. We don't think the report means that an "instance" crashed
and pgbouncer itself continued with no outage (that type of issue is
often outside the scope of CVE, if it means that a single client is
essentially conducting a DoS attack against its own service). Also, as
far as we can tell, an outage doesn't depend on whether -d was used.
