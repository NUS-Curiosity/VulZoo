As far as we know, this affects only Ubuntu, and although people from
Ubuntu discussed the announcement here, apparently nobody from Ubuntu
sent a message here stating that they concluded it was a single
vulnerability that didn't yet have a CVE ID. We found that that's the
state by reading:

  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~usb-creator-hackers/usb-creator/trunk/revision/470

Use CVE-2015-3643.

As far as we can tell, this followup post doesn't announce an
additional vulnerability. Apparently, the goal of that post was to
describe how to check for some of the exploitation preconditions, and
suggest the possibility of bypassing a precondition.
