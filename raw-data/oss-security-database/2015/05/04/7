There now is a pull request on Github [1] to get this issue fixed in  
Caja. I just (a minute ago) received notification from upstream that  
the PR will get merged ASAP.

So upstream plans to fix this with the next release of caja (probably  
1.10) and it is considered an issue (similar to how it was considered  
an issue in the nautilus browser where Caja has been forked from).

light+love,
Mike (from the Debian MATE Packaging Team)
