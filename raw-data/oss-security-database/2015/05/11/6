Subject: CVE Request: Insufficient TLS Protection in Composer (PHP)

Hi all,

A brief update to clarify this is a CVE request in the subject line
and copy the guys at MITRE. Also to clarify that this vulnerability
occurs from relying the PHP openssl extensions default configuration.
That default configuration disables peer verification on PHP versions
less than PHP 5.6 (when it was significantly reworked to be more
secure by default).
