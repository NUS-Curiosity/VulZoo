Subject: CVE request for BZ

http://www.bugzilla.org/security/4.0.15/

one has a CVE, and this one does not:

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.23.3 to 4.0.15, 4.1.1 to 4.2.11, 4.3.1 to 4.4.6, 4.5.1 to
4.5.6
Fixed In:    4.0.16, 4.2.12, 4.4.7, 5.0rc1
Description: Using the WebServices API, a user can possibly execute imported
             functions from other non-WebService modules. A whitelist
has now
             been added that lists explicit methods that can be executed
via the
             API.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1090275

was this classed as hardening hence no CVE? E.g. has no exploit been
found, or?
