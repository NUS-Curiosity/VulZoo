Subject: Re: CVE request for BZ

Sorry not explicit in the sec adv but you are correct. No exploit has been reported
regarding the webservices changes and was  just to prevent such problems in the
future. The methods that were unintentionaly accessible were all relatively harmless.
We added the safeguard in case other modules were imported in the future which could
possibly give out sensitive data unintentionally.

Thanks
