Subject: CVE request: httpd: IP address spoofing in mod_remoteip

It was reported [1] that mod_remoteip does not properly filter the IP addresses supplied in HTTP headers, which can allow a remote attacker to hide his real IP address, or bypass IP based restrictions.
This issue is fixed upstream:
https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1564052

Additional information can be found at the below bugreports:
- https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54651
- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179306

Can a CVE be assigned to this please?

Thanks.
