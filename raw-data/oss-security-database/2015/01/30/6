thanks for this writeup, Hanno.  you wrote:

I don't know about RHEL, but Debian's security tracker does actually try
to do this, and to coordinate it with the CVEs.  For example:

  https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/php5

It ain't pretty, but it's there.  If you (or anyone) is interested in
working on this sort of tracker, or integrating between this and other
trackers, please talk to the debian security team:
