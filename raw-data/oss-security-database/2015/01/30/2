As a moderator for oss-security, I'd appreciate it if you cry alarm in
here.  And if this ever becomes too noisy, that would be an interesting
problem to have and we'll find a way to deal with it then. :-)

Actually, Chrome OS is listed as a member of linux-distros here:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros

and the person subscribed on behalf of Chrome OS is Kees Cook
(previously representing Ubuntu).  Given your comment above, we have to
double-check whether this is currently correct.  Is Kees Cook currently
representing Chrome OS on linux-distros?  If so, why were you not aware
of that?  (I think this is unrelated to the handling of GHOST, but since
this was brought up we just have to deal with it as well.)

Thank you!

Alexander
