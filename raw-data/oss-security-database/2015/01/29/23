Subject: CVE request: xchat/hexchat don't properly verify SSL certificates

As reported [1]:

XChat did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in 
the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509 
certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an 
SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name.

The same code is used in hexchat.

This was initially reported to hexchat in 2013 [2] and fixed last 
November [3].  I'm not sure if it should receive a 2013 or a 2014 CVE.  
Can one be assigned to this?

Thanks.
