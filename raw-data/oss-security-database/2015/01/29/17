I'm not on any closed list either, but I agree chrome os people
probably should be on the distros list :-)
I think Solar Designer is the responsible person that manages this.

On the alarm crying it depends. In this case it already was pretty much
public, so forwarding the info here would be appropriate I think. I
assume that's also true for all too-minor-to-worry-too-much-issues.
If these become too much we can always think about another public "post
minor maybe-security-issues-here"-mailing-list. But a lot of minor
issues get posted here already and I think people are fine with it
right now.
