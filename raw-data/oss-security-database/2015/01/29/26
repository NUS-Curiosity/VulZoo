I do not have access to either of the private upstream bugs to know if
any resource consumption attacks are mentioned there.  My understanding
is that the fix aims to ensure that lengths / operands / indexes do not
exceed 2^24.

I'm guessing, but complexity may refer to exceeding the limit with
short patterns as well.  This issue was fixed in the same Chrome update
(CVE-2014-7923 or CVE-2014-7926), short patterns cause generation of
invalid opcodes because of operands exceeding 2^24:

That's what can be done based on the information public at the moment.
This may not be perfect, but still significant improvement from having
this grouped with 30+ other, likely unrelated, issues under single CVE.
