Which we do... when we find out about them. That's sort of the problem
here. People are fixing security flaws, and as Michael Zalewski's post
eloquently points out, a lot of them are not treated as security bugs
for various reasons, and thus all the vendors backporting may not find
out about them. We do monitor quite a few sources but the Open Source
world is rather massive and the number of commits daily is on the large
side.

This is why for example I've been trying to make CVE's easily available
so people are more likely to come to us with borderline issues ("I'm not
sure but this looks weird and may be security related"). I'm also
working on a set of examples for the CVE HOWTO so again developers will
hopefully be able to realize when things look weird and may be a
security issue and not just a flaw. I'm trying to find ways to help
educate people/make it easier for them to report security issues but
this is a non trivial problem.

We also are willing to help people coordinate disclosure/inform
upstreams (this is quite often a more difficult task than it should be),
again to minimize the chances of things being missed and people being
impacted.

Solving it is easy. Solving it in an economic manner that doesn't cost
an obscene amount of money is another matter. This also ignores the
simple fact that even with an unlimited supply of money the number of
security skilled developers is not currently that huge. Witness the
number of people participating on this list, or finding security bugs,
or doing security research.

Having it at least be accessible to many people (e.g. the public) would
probably be better than not I suspect. The bad guys will find out
regardless if they really want to find a vuln to exploit, at least we
can give the good guys a chance. But my concern is still "who does the
work with all these alarms to confirm if they are in fact security or
just a flaw" so we don't just end up with a huge pile of "maybe".

TL;DR: The tragedy of the commons, we're knee deep in sheep poop. Some
of it may be on fire.
