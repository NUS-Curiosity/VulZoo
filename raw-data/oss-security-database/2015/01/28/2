You can add squid, its bundled plugin helpers, squidpurge, and
cachemgr.cgi to that list as not vulnerable. gethostbyname() use is
protected by filters on remotely provided inputs.

The squidclient tool version 3.0 and older may be vulnerable if the
bad value is provided through the command line -l  or -h parameters.
This may be a problem for any scripted products using the tool as a
backend. Version 3.1 and newer of this tool are not vulnerable.
