What?!  No idea where this image came from, who created it, or why, or
when.  What is absolutely certain is that October 2 has nothing to do
with this bug, simply because the first time someone here had the idea
of calling it "GHOST" was on Friday evening!  Yes, Friday, January 23,
2015!

Exactly, thank you!  And if some of you conspiracy theorists need more
proof, even SuSE's Bugzilla entry is still referencing the original name
of our proof-of-concept (charged-ghbn.c), which appeared in the advisory
draft we sent to the linux-distros mailing-list last week:

https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=913646

In the end, some information was leaked before the Coordinated Release
Date (which was January 27, 2015 at 18:00 UTC), but it was just a few
hours early.  And again, we sincerely apologize.

Please please please, less pointless bickering, more code auditing.
Thank you.
