Subject: the other glibc issue

Hi,

Not sure why solardesigner didn't post this himself, but he tweetet
yesterday:
glibc "getaddrinfo() writes DNS queries to random file descriptors
under high load" https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15946
… "Fixed in 2.20", reopened, CVE?

The corresponding bug title says most of it. It's supposed to be fixed
in glibc 2.20, however there is a comment saying it is not.

cu,
