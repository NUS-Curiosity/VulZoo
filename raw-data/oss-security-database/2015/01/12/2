Subject: CVE-Request -- CMS Croogo v.2.2.0 -- Reflecting XSS in filemanager in
 the administrative backend

Hi Josh, Steve, vendors, list.

I found a reflecting XSS vulnerability in the filemanager of the CMS Croogo
v. 2.2.0.

The filemanager is located here in a common Croogo installation:

http://
{TARGET}/admin/file_manager/file_manager/editfile?path=%2FApplications%2FXAMPP%2Fxamppfiles%2Fhtdocs%2Fcroogo-2.2.0%2Fpackage.json

By appending arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScriptcode to names of existing
files, the XSS gets executed. However it does not work by appending the
code to names of directories.

Example:

http://{TARGET}/admin/file_manager/file_manager/editfile?path=%2FApplications%2FXAMPP%2Fxamppfiles%2Fhtdocs%2Fcroogo-2.2.0%2Fpackage.json<script>alert("XSS
in filemanager functionality of CMS Croogo 2.2.0")</script><!--

Could you please assign a CVE-ID for that issue?

Thank you!

Greetings

Steffen Rösemann
