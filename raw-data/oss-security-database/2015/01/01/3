Subject: CVE Request: xdg-utils: xdg-open: command injection vulnerability

Hi

>From the references it is not clear, if a CVE was already requested in
past, but I have not found a reference here. xdg-open has a command
injection vulnerability, which was reported on [1] and [2]. The
Freedesktop.org Bug entry contains also a patch[3]. The issue was
hilighted again on the fulldisclosure list in [4].

In case it is not yet assigned, could you please assign a CVE for this
RCE for xdg-open in xdg-utils?
