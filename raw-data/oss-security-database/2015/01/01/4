Attached patch seems to deal with absolute paths only. What about 
relative ones?

$ touch ../file

$ zip test.zip ../file
   adding: ../file (stored 0%)

$ rm ../file

$ miniunzip test.zip
MiniUnz 1.01b, demo of zLib + Unz package written by Gilles Vollant
more info at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html

test.zip opened
  extracting: ../file

$ ls ../file
../file
