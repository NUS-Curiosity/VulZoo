Usually I ask fordebian graphickmagick to check the code condition.
But to my best knowledge they do not backport, except if you ask. So
you should try your image on graphicmagick and check if it crash

BTW one patch was not correct please found updated patch queue here:
http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/imagemagick.git/log/?h=debian-patches/6.8.9.9-5

I have backported to 6.7.7.10 here
http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/imagemagick.git/log/?h=debian/6.7.7.10-5%2bdeb7u4
(not yet fully tested)

And i plan to backport to 6.6.0.4
