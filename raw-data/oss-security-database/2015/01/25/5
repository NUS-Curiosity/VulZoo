 Vulnerabilities

Hi,

Can I get 2014 year CVEs for following vulnerabilities in WordPress plugin
pixabay-images, thanks.

Original advisory: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Jan/94

"""
1) Authentication bypass
The plugin does not correctly check if the user is logged in. Certain
code can be called without authentication

2) Arbitrary file upload
The plugin code does not validate the host in the provided download URL,
which allows to upload malicious files, including PHP code.

3) Path Traversal
Certain values are not sanitized before they are used in a file operation.
This allows to store files outside of the "download" folder. 

4) Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
The generated author link uses unsanitized user values which can be
abused for Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. 
"""

Fixed in 2.4 version.
