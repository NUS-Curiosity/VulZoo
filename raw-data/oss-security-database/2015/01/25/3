Subject: CVE for SEANux 1.0?

Hello CVE folks,
I am wondering if the recent vulnerability in SEANux 1.0 I posted should have a CVE assigned for the Apache mis configuration that allows remote access to the SEA's tools and apparently the web shells bundled with it?  What do you think

Thank you.
Larry
