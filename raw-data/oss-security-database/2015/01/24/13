Actually, I worked it out:

if you edit the isinsets function,

with this:

        register unsigned uc = (unsigned char)c;
        printf("ncols: %d\n", ncols);

        for (i = 0, col = g->setbits; i < ncols; i++, col += g->csetsize) {
        printf("inside isinsets2: %d\n", col[uc]); 
                if (col[uc] != 0)
                        return(1);
        }

you'll see  that 'isinsets' is false on a normal run of ereg(which is
extended POSIX regex by default)
and when running ereg, it'll printf 'ncols: 0' constantly.

I don't know how 'sets' are done in PHP ereg, however.


Thanks,
