Subject: CVE Request: kwallet: incorrect CBC encryption handling

Hi

The following KDE Project Security Advisory was issued at
https://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20150109-1.txt .

> Title:          Fix kwalletd CBC encryption handling
> Risk Rating:    Low
> Platforms:      All
> Versions:       kwalletd < Applications 14.12.1, KF5::KWallet < 5.6.0
> Author:         Valentin Rusu <kde@...u.info>
> Date:           9 January 2015
> 
> Overview
> ========
> 
> Until KDE Applications 14.12.0, kwalletd incorrectly handled CBC encryption blocks when
> encrypting secrets in kwl files. The secrets were still encrypted, but the
> result binary data corresponded to an ECB encrypted block instead of CBC.
> 
> Impact
> ======
> 
> The ECB encryption algorithm, even if it'll scramble user data, it'll produce
> same encrypted byte sequence for the same input text. As a result, attackers
> may eventually find-out the encrypted text.
> 
> Solution
> ========
> 
> For kde-runtime KWallet upgrade to KDE Applications 14.12.1 or apply the following patch:
>   http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kde-runtime.git&a=commit&h=14a8232d0b5b1bc5e0ad922292c6b5a1c501165c
> 
> For KDE Frameworks 5 KWallet upgrade to 5.6.0 or apply the following patch:
>   http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kwallet.git&a=commit&h=6e588d795e6631c3c9d84d85fd3884a159b45849
