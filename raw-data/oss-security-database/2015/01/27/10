Hi,

The person behind this anticipated disclosure admitted failing at time
management a few messages later.
Basically, this was not a volunteered anticipated disclosure.
As reference: http://frsag.org/pipermail/frsag/2015-January/005727.html
"I'll keep you informed in the next hours. I've sent the bulletin too
early.
Big fail from me. Stay tuned."

With my best regards,
