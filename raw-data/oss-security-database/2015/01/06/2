Subject: Re: CVE request: Concrete5 XSS vulnerability

This has been fixed in 5.7.3 for some time
https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5-5.7.0/commit/e3d47d2af88ddef36deaf754ef22f1f39b9b623b

We have a security disclosure program for this so any disclosure
outside of our program is very irresponsible and unprofessional. You
end up with outdated information and leave us unable to fix the issue
in a secure way since we cannot see it until it's brought to our
attention through our disclosure program.
