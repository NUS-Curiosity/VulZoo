Here is the response from Werner:

Could be triggered due to an out of memory condition or a wrong use of a
functions.  Hard to exploit I guess.

That may happen if iconv_open fails.  Memory error or utf-8 not
available.  Note that the buffer is allocated in out secure memory and
thus the gcry_free() zeroes the memory.  I can't see how this can be
exploted but I am not an expert for this.

Hopefully that answers the question,
