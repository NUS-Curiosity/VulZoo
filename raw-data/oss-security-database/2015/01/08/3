Subject: CVE request

Hi

I'd like a CVE for the following security issue:
https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser/issues/550

And in text:
Security advisory: XSS vulnerability in login redirect param

ZfcUser version 1.2.2 has been released and includes a security for this
vulnerability. Fix has been applied in @baf0e46
<https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser/commit/baf0e460>
Affected versions

All versions below 1.2.2 are affected. dev-master is fixed starting from @
2cc167a <https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser/commit/2cc167a>
Exploits

Because of missing escaping of the URL param redirect a XSS attack is
possible.
For example: Setting the redirect param to "><a%20href="http://github.com
">GitHub.com</a><inpu%20type="hidden"%20" would result in a link added to
the login page.
Resolution

If you are using any version of ZfcUser below 1.2.2 please upgrade
immediately by running composer update.
