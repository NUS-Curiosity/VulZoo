Subject: CVE request: grep heap buffer overrun

Invoking grep with a carefully crafted combination of input and regexp
can cause a segfault and/or reading from uninitialized memory.

Here's how it evolved: http://bugs.gnu.org/19563
Here's the upstream fix:
http://git.sv.gnu.org/cgit/grep.git/commit/?id=83a95bd8c8561875b948cadd417c653dbe7ef2e2

This is particularly relevant for those who do not exec grep directly,
but rather embed parts of grep in another tool.
