        Assign a CVE Identifier <cve-assign@...re.org>, report@...esecurity.io
Subject: Node.js "serve-static" module Open Redirect

https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/serve-static-open-redirect

Says CVE pending, no idea where/whom they asked, I assume Mitre?

Also if nodesecurity.io could post these advisories to oss-security that
would be helpful, thanks!
