Subject: CVE Request: gcab: directory traversal

Hi

Jakub Wilk reported a directory traversal vulnerability due to cab not
filtering leading slashes from paths in CAB files.

Debian bug: https://bugs.debian.org/774580
Upstream bugreport: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742331

Could you assign as CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
