Except that https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/syntaxchange.html
says they won't wait that long, and will issue a 5 digit CVE ID in
the next couple of weeks.

(Even without that, CVE ID's aren't strictly issued in order, as blocks
  of id's go out to each numbering authority for them to assign as needed.)
