Subject: CVE Request: Linux kernel information leak in event device handling

Hi,

This needs a CVE, information leak out of the kernel.

This probably was introduced by commit 483180281f0ac60d1138710eb21f4b9961901294
in Linux 3.9.

Ciao, Marcus

https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=904899

Input: evdev - fix EVIOCG{type} ioctl

The 'max' size passed into the function is measured in number of bits
(KEY_MAX, LED_MAX, etc) so we need to convert it accordingly before
trying to copy the data out, otherwise we will try copying too much
and end up with up with a page fault.
