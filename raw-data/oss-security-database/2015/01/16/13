Just wanted to ask back, can a CVE be assigned for this xdg-open
issue? Is anything required missing? Important: Note that the
referenced upstream approach is still beeing worked on. In Debian the
following patch was applied:

http://sources.debian.net/src/xdg-utils/1.1.0~rc1%2Bgit20111210-7.3/debian/patches/xdg-open-safe.diff/

Regards,
Salvatore
