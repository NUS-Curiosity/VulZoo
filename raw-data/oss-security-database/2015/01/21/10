There have been a couple postings of a similar patch set [1] by Jan
Kara, although I don't believe that series addressed chown().

If I am reading the patches correctly, they (correctly) don't affect
SELinux or Smack labels; they are just calling the existing
security_inode_killpriv() hook, which is only implemented for the
capability module to remove the security.capability xattr.
