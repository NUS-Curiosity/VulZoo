Is a bit troubling, because it seems to rely on the Subject: line for
necessary context in interpreting the signed message.

An attacker could take this signed message, and replay it "From" you
with a changed subject line to try to indicate that you think some other
bug was fixed in some other piece of software, version 5.2.1.

You can avoid this kind of problem by ensuring that the messages you
sign are context-independent (e.g. including the information currently
in this message's subject line in your message body directly as well).

Regards,
