=====================================================================================
OSSA-2015-002: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal through filesystem:// scheme
=====================================================================================

:Date: January 15, 2015
:CVE: Requested


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Glance: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Jin Liu from EMC reported that path traversal vulnerabilities in
Glance were not fully patched in OSSA 2014-041. By setting a malicious
image location to a filesystem:// scheme an authenticated user can
still download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the
Glance process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API
are affected by this flaw.

- https://review.openstack.org/145916 (Juno)
- https://review.openstack.org/145640 (Kilo)

Notes
~~~~~
- This fix was included in the kilo-1 development milestone and will be
  included in future 2014.2.2 (juno) and 2014.1.4 (icehouse) releases.
- The OpenStack VMT recommends revoking all credentials stored in files
  accessible by Glance as a precautionary measure.
- A CVE has been requested for this issue, the OpenStack VMT will issue an
  errata with the correct CVE number assigned once this information is
  available.
