Subject: CVE-2014-8148: midgard-core configures D-Bus system bus to be insecure

[Re-posting with upstream list addresses spelled correctly. People on
oss-security: sorry for the noise, and please send any replies to this
one, not to the previous attempt.]

Type of vulnerability: CWE-284 Improper Access Control
Exploitable by: local users
Impact: could allow arbitrary code execution as root (dependent on
installed D-Bus system services)
Reporter: Simon McVittie, Collabora Ltd.
Upstream notified: 2014-12-19

Midgard2 is an open source content repository for data-intensive web and
desktop applications.

While checking Debian for incorrect/dangerous D-Bus security policy
files (found in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/*.conf) I found this access control
rule in midgard2-common/10.05.7.1-2, part of the upstream project
midgard-core:

<policy context="default">               <==== "applies to everyone"
  <allow own="org.midgardproject" />     <==== probably undesired
  <allow send_type="method_call"/>       <==== definitely bad
  <allow send_type="signal" />           <==== not good either
</policy>

This is analogous to an overly permissive "chmod": it allows any process
on the system bus to send any method call or signal to any other process
on the system bus, including those that are normally forbidden either
explicitly or via the system bus' documented default-deny policy. Some
D-Bus system services perform additional authorization checks, either
via Polkit/PolicyKit or internally, but many services rely on the system
bus to apply their intended security model.

For instance, depending on installed software, this vulnerability could
allow unprivileged local users to:

* invoke Avahi's SetHostName() method
* communicate with bluetooth devices using BlueZ
* install printer drivers using system-config-printer
* run NetworkManager "dispatcher" scripts
* ...

It seems likely that at least one of these services can be used for
arbitrary code execution as root, making this a severe vulnerability.
