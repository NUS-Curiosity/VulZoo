Original advisory in http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2014/Dec/53 says following:

"""
Disclosure time-line
02 November 2014: Discovery.
03 November 2014: Initial report sent.
11 November 2014: Second contact.
No response.
09 December 2014: Public disclosure.
"""

I do not know how author of that advisory tried to contact Concrete5. For
future cases: https://www.concrete5.org/developers/security/

I only requested CVE for coordination purposes. In this case CVE is used to
notify end-users to actually update their software so that they are not affected
by this vulnerability. If you want more details please contact me off-list.

Would it be possible for Concrete5 to request CVEs in the future as part of your
security disclosure program?
