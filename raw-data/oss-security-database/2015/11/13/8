The patch[1] attached to that JIRA report would disable serialization by
default. Any application that needs it would require a code change to
re-enable it. This would break existing applications.

+                    "Serialization and deserialization of
InvokerTransformer are disabled for security reasons. " +
+                    "To re-enable it set, system property '" +
DESERIALIZE + "' to 'true'." +
+                    "See
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-580 for details.");
