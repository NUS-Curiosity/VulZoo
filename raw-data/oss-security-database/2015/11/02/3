Subject: tlsfuzzer - new tool

I've been working on a tool aimed at reproducing, testing and (in the 
future) automatically finding issues in TLS implementations.

The tool is fully open source (GPLv2), and I'm using it for testing 
OpenSSL, NSS and GnuTLS. It has minimal requirements (just Python 2.6 or 
3.2 or later).

You can find slides from my latest presentation at Ruxcon 11, showing 
some reasons for creating this tool as well as showing some of the 
features it has here:
https://github.com/tomato42/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/docs/ruxcon2015-kario-slides.pdf

You can find the project itself here:

Please direct responses at my email address as I'm not subscribed to 
list.
