Subject: CVE request for keepassx password database export

Hi,

it seems that keepassx 0.4.3 export function are a bit buggy. Starting an
export (using File / Export to / KeepassX XML file) and cancelling it leads to
KeepassX saving a cleartext XML file in ~/.xml without any warning.

This was reported privately to the Debian security team today, but it was
actually reported publicly earlier in the Debian BTS [1]. Unfortunately the
maintainer didn't acknowledge the bug or forwarded it upstream, apparently.

It's not a terrible bug per se because leaking a user password file on purpose
would still require a lot of social engineering skills, but it still look like
it should get a CVE (an user explicitly cancelling the export surely doesn't
expect its passwords to be there in a hidden file.

Can a CVE be assigned for this?
