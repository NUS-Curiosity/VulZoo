It's the first step of a very long road.

This attitude is quite pervasive across security people, and it's not a
very good one. Just because the first iteration of a technology isn't
perfect, or the ideas have room for improvement is no reason to go all
negative.

Sometimes great ideas start out like this. If it's a bad idea, it won't
stick around for long. There are few instances where doing nothing is
better than doing something.
