Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Glance

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Use of MD5 in OpenStack Glance image signature
Reporter: Daniel P. Berrange (Red Hat)
Products: Glance
Affects: =11.0.0

Description:
Daniel P. Berrange from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Glance image
signature. Glance computes cryptographic signature using MD5 hash of the
image. By crafting a malicious image that produces a MD5 collision, a
Glance backend operator may subvert the signature verification process,
resulting in a corrupted image. All Glance setups are affected.
