Subject: CVE request: libpng buffer overflow in png_set_PLTE

I request a CVE for a vulnerability in libpng, all versions, in the
png_set_PLTE/png_get_PLTE functions.  These functions failed to check for
an out-of-range palette when reading or writing PNG files with a bit_depth
less than 8.  Some applications might read the bit depth from the IHDR
chunk and allocate memory for a 2^N entry palette, while libpng can return
a palette with up to 256 entries even when the bit depth is less than 8.

libpng versions 1.6.19, 1.5.24, 1.4.17, 1.2.54, and 1.0.64 were released
today (12 November 2015) to fix this vulnerability.  See
libpng.sourceforge.net
