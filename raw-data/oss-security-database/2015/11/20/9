Upstream indicated they preferred not to reset to make logout fast and
smooth.  They optimize for single user desktop use case, where this is
not a real concern.

A local user attack.  A local attacker logs in via LXDM.  After that,
they record current authentication cookie, or configure X server to
accept connections based on some other criteria (e.g. allowing all
connections from specific user regardless of whether valid cookie is
provided).  After logging out, attacker can still interact with the X
server - either while it's displaying login prompt, or later when a
different user logs in.  Attacker can monitor screen contents or
keystrokes, or try to make victim interact with their applications and
e.g. enter their credentials into spoofed password prompts.

Those I tested all started new X server after session logout.
