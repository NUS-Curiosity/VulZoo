This stored XSS was in a component (the built-in webserver) that
1) is disabled by default
2) should only be opened up on a non-public network (or with
   authentications in front)
3) serves a simple read-only webpage

To 'exploit' this XSS, someone with knowledge of the target's
infrastructure must send the target a malicious link (with the exploit
code embedded in the link). As this is built-in webpage is (should) only
accessible to the operators of the DNS server, the attack-surface for
this attack is very low.

We consider this XSS a very low risk vulnerability because of this and
suggest a CVE be not assigned.
