Subject: CVE request: libsndfile 1.0.25 heap overflow

Hi,

Has a CVE been assigned to this flaw yet?

http://www.nemux.org/2015/10/13/libsndfile-1-0-25-heap-overflow/
https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/133926/libsndfile-1.0.25-Heap-Overflow.html

The blog post mentions MITRE was notified but I don't see a CVE anywhere
for this issue.

I also don't see a patch for this issue (or an upstream bug). Any pointers
there would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
