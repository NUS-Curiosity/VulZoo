Subject: Heap Overflow in PCRE

https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/29-Heap-Overflow-in-PCRE.html

The Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) library has just
released a new version which fixes a number of security issues.

Fuzzing the pcretest tool uncovered an input leading to a heap overflow
in the function pcre_exec. This bug was found with the help of american
fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637 Upstream bug #1637 (PoC and
ASAN trace attached there)

This is fixed in PCRE 8.38. There are two variants of PCRE, the classic
one and PCRE2. PCRE2 is not affected.

Appart from that a couple of other vulnerabilities found by other
people have been fixed in this release:
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672
Heap overflow in compile_regex
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515
Stack overflow in compile_regex
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667
Heap overflow in compile_regex

If you use PCRE to parse untrusted inputs you should update immediately.
