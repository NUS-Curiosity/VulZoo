Subject: CVE request: Jenkins remote code execution vulnerability due to unsafe deserialization

Hello,

Please assign a CVE to this issue:

Remote code execution vulnerability due to unsafe deserialization in Jenkins remoting
Unsafe deserialization allows unauthenticated remote attackers to run arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.
This is tracked as SECURITY-218 in the Jenkins project. All current Jenkins releases are affected.

Public exploit:

Temporary workaround:

A related issue is being discussed here:
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/09/1
Jenkins is affected by both this and the Groovy variant in 'ysoserial'.

We plan to release a fix for this as part of our planned security update on Wednesday.

Thanks!
