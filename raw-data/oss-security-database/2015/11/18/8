Hi Jonathan,

We have a no-CFP policy here, with no exceptions at all.  Unfortunately,
you were on the moderation bypass list (not anymore).

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines

"Please don't post conference CFPs, (e-)magazine calls for articles, and
survey questionnaires.  (These are generally cross-posted to lots of
places, and oss-security list members have expressed that they do not
want to see them here.)"

I am posting this publicly to indicate that the policy is still in
effect, and to discourage further CFPs being sent to oss-security.

Relevant conference announcements may, with some limitations, be posted
to full-disclosure:
