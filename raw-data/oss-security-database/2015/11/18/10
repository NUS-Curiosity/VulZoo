Just for reference... There was an independent discovery earlier this
year, tracked in [1]. Even earlier discoveries ([2,3]) missed the
connection to AF_UNIX. [1] eventually lead to the incomplete patch [4]
and, after multiple non-public ineffective attempts on fixing the
issue, to the netdev posting [5]. That's where Jason and Rainer
started to post patches fixing the issue. However, none of the patches
has been applied yet.


Thanks,
Mathias
