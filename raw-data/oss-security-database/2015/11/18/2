Use CVE-2015-8103 for the vulnerability addressed by modifying Jenkins
to be safe in the presence of a problematic
webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/commons-collections-*.jar file.

As far as we know, "the Groovy variant in 'ysoserial'" means:

  https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/Groovy1.java

which is a CVE-2015-3253 exploit. Also, we are guessing that Groovy is
relevant because of:

  https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Groovy+plugin

If preventing the ysoserial Groovy attack against Jenkins only
involves updating the installed Groovy code to 2.4.4 or 2.4.5, and it
has never been necessary or recommended to change any component unique
to Jenkins, then we would recommend mapping to CVE-2015-3253. If it
were necessary or recommended to change any component unique to
Jenkins, then you can have an additional CVE ID for the ysoserial
Groovy aspect of SECURITY-218. (Our expectation is that separate CVE
IDs are needed because the Groovy plugin has own version numbering --
such as version 1.27 -- that's separate from the version numbering of
Jenkins core.)
