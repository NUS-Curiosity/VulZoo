No, more of a "we'd like to avoid a superfish" and then I realized we had
some legitimate certs/keys for sure (e.g. firefox/bind) and.... maybe other
stuff? who knows. As an industry we have very poor visibility/inventory of
what we ship/how we ship it/etc. Witness all the SSL/TLS config issues
where many vendors can't really answer in any sane time frame how badly
they are affected.
