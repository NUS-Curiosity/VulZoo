So in short: only stuff that is Open Source licensed. Definitely things
that are fully Open Sourced (e.g. upstream project, or distributions like
Red Hat or Debian). If a proprietary vendor uses some OpenSource bits then
I'd be interested if the upstream project also ships it, so it would go
under that upstream listing. If it's stuff the proprietary vendors are
adding I'm not really interested, for two reasons:

1) proprietary/closed source vendors have a long history of doing silly
things, so it's a given they'll have problems here
2) the chances of getting them to fix it are low, so I'm simply not
interested in spending any time/resources on it.

If you want to create a project in GitHub that covers OpenSource bits used
in mostly proprietary vendors (e.g. Mac OS X) then feel free to, but again
for  a multitude of reasons I'm not interested in that side of the problem.

Also as an example of what I am looking for I did an initial dump of Fedora
23 (all of it) we end up with about 83 packages containing certs/keys/etc.
Some are obvious (archlinux-keyring, debian-keyring, ca-certificates,
bind), some are embedded (mostly copies of the Mozilla CA cert stuff) and
some need more research. If anyone wants to add notes/data to them please
feel free.
