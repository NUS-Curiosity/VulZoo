Subject: Null pointer access in inflatehd tool (nghttp2)

https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/14-Null-pointer-access-in-inflatehd-tool-nghttp2.html

The nghttp2 library ships two tools to parse http headers packed with
the hpack algorithm. An invalid input file can crash the inflatehd
tool. This is a bug in the tool, there is no issue in the library.

This issue was fixed in version 0.7.15 of nghttp2.

One day of fuzzing both the inflatehd and deflatehd turned up no other
issues.
