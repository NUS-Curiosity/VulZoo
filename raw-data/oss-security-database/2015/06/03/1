What are the realistic scenarios in which this has a security impact?

For example, can any of these occur on actual systems?

1. The attacker e-mails a uuencoded file to their own mailbox on a
web-based mail service. This service has a feature in which decoded
data is presented to the recipient. (The server operates on the data
with the uudecode program, not with any other implementation of the
uudecode algorithm. The attacker gains read access to unintended parts
of the server's memory.)

2. A web site allows users to do HTTP uploads of data in uuencoded
format, and supports requests for decoded versions of the data. Same
parenthesized description as above.

3. The attacker composes a news article with crafted uuencoded data
and posts it to the alt.sources Usenet newsgroup. The attacker is
subscribed to this newsgroup in their own account on a web-based
Usenet news reading service. Same parenthesized description as above.
