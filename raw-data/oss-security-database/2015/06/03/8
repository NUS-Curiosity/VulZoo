Subject: CVE Request: mime-support

Hi,

This bug https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=589384 deserves
a CVE.  Basically, in the default configuration of apache + mod_php +
mod_mime, files like test.php.blah will be executed as PHP code.  The
expected behavior is that only test.php will be executed as PHP.  Yes, it
was fixed 5 years ago, but I am seeing it actively utilized against Ubuntu
12.04 (which did not get the fix), specifically against Wordpress plugins
that allow file uploads.

Thanks,
Dennis
