I believe you are correct.

I don't believe that they were different, having read the public 
information. I've asked for clarification from the vendor, though.

If anything, my logic for including the information about credit was to 
emphasise that it was one issue reported by two people and make us both 
searchable, in case there is confusion if one or both of us write up the 
issue in future.

Thanks,

Matt
