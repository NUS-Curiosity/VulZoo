Use CVE-2015-5081 for the CSRF issue.

The cms.changelist.js and cms.toolbar.js changes include a comment
"send post request to prevent xss attacks." The "xss" word choice
might be a mistake. We are not currently assigning a CVE ID for a
separate XSS issue.

CVE IDs were not assigned on a per-discoverer basis here because there
was no available information suggesting that different persons
independently discovered different CSRF problems.
