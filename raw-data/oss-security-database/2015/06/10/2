Description:
This plugin enables users to upload files to a wordpress-instance and
share it with the wordpress-admin. Through insufficient input validation
an unauthenticated attacker is able to bypass the restriction and upload
arbitrary content. This uploaded content can be executed by calling the
url of the file in the public available upload directory.


Best regards,
