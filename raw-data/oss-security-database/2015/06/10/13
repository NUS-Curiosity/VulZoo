Subject: CVE ID Request: Buffer overflow in ArduinoJson when parsing crafted
 JSON strings

I recently discovered a buffer overflow weakness in the open source ArduinoJson library.
Several IoT projects are using this library, and a CVE number would help ensure traceability of the issue abroad.

This issue has already been made public, and a fix has been released by the project maintainer.
