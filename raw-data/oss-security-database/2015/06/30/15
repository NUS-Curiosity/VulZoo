Subject: Re: Question about world readable config files and commented warnings

So in past these got CVE's, e.g.

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=config+file+permissions
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=weak+permissions+password

and so on.

So has policy changed for the specific case of:

Configuration file takes a password and has world readable permissions
by default (and let's assume no explicit warning in the comments in the
config file).

Thanks
