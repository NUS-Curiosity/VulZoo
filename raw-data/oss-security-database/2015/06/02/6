Subject: CVE request Linux kernel: fs: udf kernel oops

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the UDF file system(CONFIG_UDF_FS) support is 
vulnerable to a crash. It could occur while fetching inode information from a 
corrupted/malicious udf file system image.

An unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in 
DoS.

Upstream fix:
