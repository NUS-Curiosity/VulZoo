Subject: CVE request Linux kernel: fs: udf heap overflow in
 __udf_adinicb_readpage

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the UDF file system(CONFIG_UDF_FS) support is 
vulnerable to a crash. It could occur while reading from a corrupted/malicious 
udf file system image.

An unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in DoS.
