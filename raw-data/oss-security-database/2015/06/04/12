The Ben Murphy advisory has a long discussion of many software and
deployment issues. Do you have a specific viewpoint about what the CVE
ID should be for? In particular, is the essence of the request that
the Redis upstream vendor believes that loading Lua bytecode was, by
itself, inherently an implementation mistake in Redis, and is now
fixed by the
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/fdf9d455098f54f7666c702ae464e6ea21e25411
change?

By way of background: we have previously tried to gather information
for assigning CVE IDs to the underlying bytecode security concerns in
Lua (see the http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/27/2
post), but this was unsuccessful. If the currently needed CVE ID should
be only about Redis, as mentioned in the above paragraph, then we will
not be revisiting those Lua issues now.
