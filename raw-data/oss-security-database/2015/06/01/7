Subject: CVE-2015-3210: PCRE Library Heap Overflow Vulnerability

Can't figure out what's going on with the text format, what a mess :( 
 So here is short version, hopping everything goes well. 
 PCRE is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression capabilities in the Perl programming language. The PCRE library is incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash, Apache, Nginx, PHP. 
 PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow. During the compilation of a malformed regular expression, more data is written on the malloced block than the expected size output by compile_regex. Exploits with advanced Heap Fengshui techniques may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application.

 Please note that this (and couple of other issues discovered by fuzzing) is fixed in the source tree. 
 Wen Guanxing from Venustech ADLAB is credited for this vulnerability.
