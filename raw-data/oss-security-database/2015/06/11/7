I can certainly understand that. However, I looked back at my pending
requests and found them rather unextraordinary. Unless I am missing
something, there doesn't appear to be anything particularly complex in
my reports that would merit extended internal MITRE discussion let alone
four months of discussions.

I'm not the only reporter awaiting feedback/response from MITRE. This is
why a public status update from MITRE is a lot more valuable to the
oss-sec community (and beyond) than are updates provided privately to
individual reporters.
