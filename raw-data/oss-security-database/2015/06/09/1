These two bugs I would describe as fixing the *same* problem
in two different ways.

By "substantial restrictions" you're thinking of things like SELinux policy
domains?  Currently, polkit is not ready to perform compartmentalization
of that form - it treats equal uids as equal security domains.

(Most importantly, uid 0 is treated as privileged, even if it's in a confined
 domain)

That sounds right to me.  I see uid matching as a fix for the wraparound.
The default authority already restricts agents to only be able to
register for subjects of matching uid.  Or to turn it around, polkit
in many places matches uids, this adds another one to fix a bug
with cookie handling.
