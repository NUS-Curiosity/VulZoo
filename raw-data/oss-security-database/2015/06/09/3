Subject: Secure Socket Funneling: a new network tool

Secure Socket Funneling (SSF) is a network tool and toolkit.
The main purpose was initially to extend SSH network features and solve
some performance issues we had while using SSH on high bandwidth networks.

Currently, it is difficult to forward DNS, VoIP and other widely used UDP
based protocols. Moreover, we often needed a simple way to relay traffic
over multiple nodes to comply with security policies while administrating
medium size networks.

These are two of the main features of SSF. It allows simple automatic
traffic relay and UDP forwarding through encrypted tunnels. Of course, SSF
also provides basic SSH network features like TCP forwarding and remote
forwarding, SOCKS proxying (and remote proxying which is not provided by
SSH). SSF command line is similar to SSH so that DevOps can benefit from
performance and security enhancements without the learning curve of a new
tool.

To ensure the best performances, SSF takes advantage of the multicore,
multithreaded architectures by using modern asynchronous APIs based on
Boost.asio.

The project provides an easy to use build system which automatically builds
third-party libraries (Boost, OpenSSL and GoogleTest). Moreover, the code
is 100% compatible with C++11 which made it portable over many platforms.
Currently, the build has been tested against Windows, MacOS X and Linux.

SSF is using latest OpenSSL version with perfect forward secrecy enabled by
default.
