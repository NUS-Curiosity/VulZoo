In this type of situation, CVEs are assigned on a per-discoverer basis.
CVE-2015-4025 is for thoger@...hat.com discoveries, whereas
CVE-2015-4026 is for yohgaki@....net. See:

  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4025
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4026

> dir()/opendir() and chroot()

Four weeks ago, we asked security@....net to contact us if those other
changed functions were associated with vulnerability fixes. They have
not contacted us about this.

Are you reporting that some or all of them had vulnerabilities?

For example, is it reasonable to expect that a PHP application may
want the client to make a choice of a chroot directory, and the
intended behavior is to restrict the choice to a name ending in ".d"
but this can be bypassed by something like a
"/usr/local/var/x/does-not-end-in-dot-d\0.d" value?
