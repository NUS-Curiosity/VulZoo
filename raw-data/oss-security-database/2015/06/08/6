Subject: CVE Request: WebKitGTK+ performs DNS prefetch when a proxy is
 configured

It was discovered that WebKit's libsoup network backend, as used in
WebKitGTK+, performs DNS prefetch even when a proxy has been
configured. An attacker could use this flaw to determine which hosts a
browser has prefetched.

For example, this is problematic when using Tor as a proxy.

Please assign a CVE for this issue.

Thanks,
