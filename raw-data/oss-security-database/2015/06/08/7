Hi oss-sec readers!

Earlier this year, we decided to start a curated list for learning
about application security and host it on Github.

Currently, we have a good spread of general topics and
PHP-specific security pitfalls, but we'd like to gather more
resources to help developers with experience in a particular
language learn how to build more resilient applications.
https://github.com/paragonie/awesome-appsec

The list lives at that URL, please send pull requests. It's as easy
as creating a .json file somewhere appropriately within the data/
directory; I'll take care of the rest.

Is this intended just for programmers or also system administrators?

if so, you might want to add the recommendations ofhttps://bettercrypto.org

their recommendations can be found here as a
pdf:https://bettercrypto.org/static/applied-crypto-hardening.pdf

and on github as latex source (I believe).

if this is not about save configuration of services, please feel
free to ignore this message.

kind regards

Sven

My intended audience at the outset was programmers. However, the reality of
the situation is that programmers are often responsible for configuring
systems.

So thank you. I'll check it out tonight and consider its inclusion.
