Your message seems to be about various security analysis posted to a
mailing-list thread with about 10 messages, accompanied by at least
two bug reports:

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90837
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90832

with a total of about 15 comments. In this situation, we're not sure
that there's any practical way for us to distill that into a consensus
statement of what the CVE or CVEs would be for.

The original 2015-05-29 message seems to be about clients whereas the
first 2015-06-03 message seems to be about users or uids. Is there any
polkit documentation that suggests that two clients are allowed to
interfere with each other as long as they have the same uid? (This is
in the general case where at least one of the two clients is executing
with substantial restrictions.)

For purposes of CVE, we may be able to model this as a situation in
which the (realistically exploitable) counter wraparound is a clear
implementation error and can have a CVE ID, but the concept of uid
matching is a design change that is essentially outside the scope of
CVE. Would that be OK?
