Subject: CVE request: Stack overflow in redcarpet's header_anchor

After examining the redcarpet source code, I noticed that header_anchor uses variable length arrays (VLA) without any range checking.

This is conducive to a stack overflow, followed by the potential for arbitrary code execution.

Redcarpet is a Markdown parser library.

I'm requesting a CVE number for this vulnerability.

Products: redcarpet
Affects: v3.3.0 - v3.3.1
