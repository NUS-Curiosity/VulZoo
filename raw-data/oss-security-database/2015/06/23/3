 pairs (CVE-2015-3221)

===========================================================================
OSSA-2015-012: Neutron L2 agent DoS through incorrect allowed address pairs
===========================================================================

:Date: June 23, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-3221


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Neutron: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3 and 2015.1.0 version


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Darragh O'Reilly from HP reported a vulnerability in Neutron. By
adding an address pair which is rejected as invalid by the ipset tool,
an authenticated user may crash the Neutron L2 agent resulting in a
denial of service attack. Neutron setups using the IPTables firewall
driver are affected.

Notes
~~~~~
- This fix will be included in future 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.1 (kilo)
  releases.
- Zero prefixed address pairs are no longer accepted by the Juno API, users
  need to use 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.1/1 or ::/1 and 8000::/1 instead. The
  fix_zero_length_ip_prefix.py tool is provided to clean ports previously
  configured with a zero prefixed address pair
