Subject: CVE Request: PCRE Library Heap Overflow Vulnerability in find_fixedlength()

Hi,

PCRE is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression
capabilities in the Perl programming language.
The PCRE library is incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such
as Adobe Flash, Apache, Nginx, PHP.

PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow.
During subpattern calculation of a malformed regular expression, an offset
that is used as an array index is fully controlled and can be large enough
so that unexpected heap memory regions are accessed.
One could at least exploit this issue to read objects nearby of the
affected application's memory.
Such information discloure may also be used to bypass memory protection
method such as ASLR.

Would you please allocate a CVE-ID for this?

Thank you.
