> Doesn't this fall under different code base?

No. There would be separate CVE IDs if it were a conceptually
identical vulnerability in different code found in different
codebases. We do not assign multiple CVE IDs to the same vulnerability
in the same piece of code, regardless of how or why that code has been
copied into different projects. This is a case with reuse of an entire
substantial function: the function name is the same, the code
structure is the same, names of variables and structure members are
largely the same, etc. The reuse extends to pit_ioport_write as well.
