Hi,

+CC openstack-security

I see that this is being brought to oss-sec', but seemingly not via the
OpenStack Security Group or Vulnerability Management Team.

CVE-2015-1850 is referenced in your mail, are you saying that this has been
assigned to this issue? I cannot easily find any other reference of its
allocation.

You said that this was raised upstream on 2015-01-27, do you have a
Launchpad bug number or information on this discourse as to what was the
outcome?

Thanks
