Vulnerabilities with different disclosure dates aren't merged. (This
doesn't mean that we would want to have separate CVEs for a
developer's efforts to completely fix one type of problem in a single
piece of code, before any changes were in a release, even if the
efforts took a while. However, even in the case of a single piece of
code, multiple CVEs can occur if there is a CVE assignment at a time
when development work seems finished, and then this work continues.)

> issue affecting different module of the code base
> is not a typical reason for split.

"different module" would be relevant if it were known that the code in
one module was originally introduced in one version, and this was not
the same version as for the other code.
