Subject: CVE request: pure-ftpd denial of service in glob_()

Hello,

Version 1.0.40 of pure-FTPd fixes a potential denial of service issue.

From the NEWS file:

 - The process handling a user session could be crashed by trying to
 match a file pattern longer than the maximum length for a path. This
 has been fixed. Upgrading is recommended.

Upstream commit that fixes this:
https://github.com/jedisct1/pure-ftpd/commit/0627004e23a24108785dc1506c5767392b90f807

References:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1233267

Can a CVE be assigned to this please?

Thanks.
