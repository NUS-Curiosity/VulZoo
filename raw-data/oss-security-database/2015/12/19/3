Subject: CVE-2009-0689 discovered in Mono prior to 4.2

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Dear all,

Security researchers at NCC Group have discovered that CVE-2009-0689, a
definite DOS (and possible arbitrary code execution) in various
applications' string-to-double parser implementations, also applies to
Mono versions prior to 4.2.

A fix is available
at https://gist.github.com/directhex/01e853567fd2cc74ed39 and should
apply cleanly to all versions of Mono you might care about.

This fix should be applied to all Mono packages prior to 4.2 (everything
except Debian Unstable, Ubuntu 16.04, and Arch, from a quick look)

Attached is the disclosure as-received by us, which includes a minimal
test case to demonstrate the vulnerability.

Thanks to Peter McLarnan <Peter.McLarnan@...group.trust> and Andy
Schmitz <andy.schmitz@...group.trust>

Apologies for the lateness in sending this, I sent it to the wrong
list & didn't notice until pointed out to me recently.
