Subject: injecting environment variables into Phusion Passenger
 (CVE-2015-7519)

Hi,

Our OBS team found a problem with Phusion Passenger, that was not
filtering environment headers when using "_" instead of "-".

https://github.com/phusion/passenger/commit/ddb8ecc4ebf260e4967f57f271d4f5761abeac3e
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=956281

Mitre has assigned CVE-2015-7519 to this issue.

Ciao, Marcus
