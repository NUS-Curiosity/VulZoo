Subject: CVE request Qemu: acpi: heap based buffer overrun during VM
 migration

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the Q35 chipset based pc system emulator is 
vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow. It occurs during VM guest 
migration, as more(16 bytes) data is moved into allocated(8 bytes) memory 
area.

A privileged guest user could use this issue to corrupt the VM guest image, 
potentially leading to a DoS. This issue affects q35 machine types.

Upstream fix:
-------------
   -> http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=d9a3b33d2c9f996537b7f1d0246dee2d0120cefb
