Subject: CVE request: Remote DoS in Quassel

Dear all,

It was discovered and fixed [1] in Quassel, a DoS remotely triggerable
by any client on a Quassel core.

Any client sending the command "/op *" in a query will cause the Quassel
core to crash. I was able to reproduce it with Quassel 0.10.0.

No release has this fix in yet.

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue?

Cheers,
