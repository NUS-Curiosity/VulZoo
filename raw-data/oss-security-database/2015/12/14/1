Here they are. I have got feedback, that at least Suse is not affected
by that. As the affected configuration seems to not so common and also
impact is not really high - usually no user-controllable services are
run as user "man" - this should not be a great deal. It is just
something to fix sometime, which should be possible now for more
people as information now publicly available.
