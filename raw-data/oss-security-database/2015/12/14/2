Subject: CVE-2015-7549 Qemu: pci: msi-x: null pointer dereference issue

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the PCI MSI-X support is vulnerable to null pointer 
dereference issue. It occurs when the controller attempts to write to the 
pending bit array(PBA) memory region. Because the MSI-X MMIO support did not 
define the .write method.

A privileges used inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
resulting in DoS issue.
