Subject: CVE Request: Magento SWF XSS

Hi,

I couldn't find a CVE number for the following issue -
http://appcheck-ng.com/unpatched-vulnerabilites-in-magento-e-commerce-platform/

If there is not one please assign one.

I have confirmed this issue on an unknown version of Magento. Not sure in
which version it was patched, if any.

Thanks,
Ryan
