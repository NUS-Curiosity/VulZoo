Subject: CVE request: Qemu: ui: vnc: avoid floating point exception

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the VNC display driver support is vulnerable to an 
arithmetic exception flaw. It occurs on the VNC server side while processing 
the 'SetPixleFormat' messages from a client.

A privileged remote client could use this flaw to crash the guest resulting in 
DoS.
