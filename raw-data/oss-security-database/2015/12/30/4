Do you have any information about a scenario in which this bug crosses
a privilege boundary?

Do you mean that, because of the details of the SIGSEGV, there's a
reasonable likelihood of code execution when a victim runs unsquashfs
on an untrusted SquashFS filesystem image?

Other possibilities in which there could be a CVE ID assigned include:

  - if the affected unsquashfs code were also available as a library
    that was used to build a program that was supposed to remain
    running to handle multiple unsquash operations

  - if the affected unsquashfs code were also used to support a
    SquashFS filesystem that was mounted on a system, and an
    unprivileged user could crash the system by reading from the
    filesystem

  - (again for this use of the affected code) if a system exists that
    automatically mounts SquashFS filesystems found on removable
    media, and inserting removable media could crash the system

  - (again for this use of the affected code) maybe a scenario in
    which the SIGSEGV ultimately leads to disclosure of private data
    that wasn't contained in the SquashFS filesystem
