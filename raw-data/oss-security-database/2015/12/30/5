Subject: Re: CVE Request: Squashfs 4.2 Race Condition

Privilege boundary crossing does not necessarily happen. However, since unsquashfs is often run with sudo (Squashfs filesystem containing files owned by root), it is a possibility. I do not know if this bug can lead to code execution.

However, firmware upgrade procedures (remote or local) which uses unsquashfs, on devices such as network routers, could be crashed with an untrusted Squashfs filesystem image and lead to denial of service.
