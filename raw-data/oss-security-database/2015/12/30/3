Subject: CVE Request: Squashfs 4.2 Race Condition

A malformed Squashfs filesystem can cause a race condition in unsquashfs. Versions below 4.3 are affected.

This is caused by the decompress thread attempting to access a shared queue, resulting in a SIGSEGV.

    struct cache_entry *entry = queue_get(to_deflate);

I have attached a sample filesystem image illustrating this case.
