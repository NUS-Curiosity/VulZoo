Subject: CVE request Qemu: net: vmxnet3: host memory leakage

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with a VMWARE VMXNET3 paravirtual NIC emulator support is 
vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw. It occurs when a guest repeatedly tries 
to activate the vmxnet3 device.

A privileged guest user could use this flaw to leak host memory, resulting in 
DoS on the host.
