> PAM library should not operate on shadow writable by anyone else than root user.

In case there was interest in this report of a possibly unexpected PAM
behavior: the MITRE CVE team has no current plans to assign a CVE ID.
This seems to be essentially a design issue where multiple valid
opinions may exist. In other words, if /etc/shadow is in an incorrect
state, possibly the ideal outcome would be to halt the system until it
can be recovered using console access, possibly the ideal outcome is
to let the system continue running with otherwise normal software
behaviors in case an authorized user is relying on those behaviors to
fix the problem, or possibly it's something in between. Another
example would be a case where /etc/shadow is not critically
misconfigured (e.g., owned by the man account) but only slightly
misconfigured (e.g., the root group has read access). Some people may
prefer a design in which password-based authentication always fails
until the permissions are fixed; however, that's not necessarily the
prevailing opinion.
