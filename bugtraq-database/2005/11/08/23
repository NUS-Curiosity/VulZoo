Subject: Re: Hidden accounts on sony vaio laptops



Not a Sony issue.  This setup has been documented by MS 
since the release of Windows XP in 2001.

"Q: How can I add an Administrator password to make my 
computer more secure?

A: Another way to make your computer more secure is to 
assign a password to the Administrator account, which is 
blank by default. An Administrator account is a user account 
that has full permissions and control over a computer, can 
gain access to and modify all user accounts on a computer, 
and can only be accessed from safe mode."
