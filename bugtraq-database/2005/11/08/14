Subject: Hidden accounts on sony vaio laptops


Sony Vaio laptops require you to create a user account the first time you start your laptop. If the user you select is not "Administrator", Sony still goes ahead and creates a user "Administrator" with a blank password. 

This user does not show up in control panel under User Accounts but if you do start up in safemode the laptop allows you to login as Administrator. 

This gives an attacker an opportunity to gain administrative access to a computer and access to create add delete or modify user accounts.

This is basically a backdoor account that is hidden from the user and compromises the security of all Sony Vaio laptops.
