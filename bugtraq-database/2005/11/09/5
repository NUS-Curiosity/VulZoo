Product Overview:
=================

SAP Web Application Server is an open standard-based platform for
developing, and implementing Web applications. SAP Web Application
Server is a crucial component of mySAPÂ® Technology platform as it serves
as the underlying infrastructure for many SAP solutions (for example,
SAP Portal).

SAP WAS provides a development infrastructure on which to develop,
distribute, and execute platform-independent Web services and business
applications. SAP Web Application Server supports ABAP, Java, and Web
services.

The vulnerability discovered only applies to the BSP runtime of SAP WAS.

Vulnerability Description:
==========================

SAP Web Application Server was found to be vulnerable to HTTP Response
Splitting, in the parameter sap-exiturl. For further reference regarding
HTTP Response Splitting see the whitepaper "HTTP Response Splitting, Web
Cache Poisoning Attacks, and Related Topics" (available at:
http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/papers/general/whitepaper_httpresponse.pdf)


Exploit (PoC):
==============

If the string "%0a%0dHeader:+Value" is passed (omitting the double
quotes) as the value for the parameter sap-exiturl the string "Header:
value" (without the double quotes) is considered as another HTTP header,
indicating the presence of the vulnerability.

Solutions:
==========

The solution, provided by SAP, is to disable support for the parameter
in older 6.10 releases as well as SP's in 6.20 prior to SP54. For new
6.20 and 7.00 releases the sap-exiturl parameter will be submitted to a
customer configured white-list. For further information see SAP Note
887322.
