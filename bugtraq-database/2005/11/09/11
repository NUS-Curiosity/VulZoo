Subject: ASPKnowledgebase vulnerable to SQL-inject


ASPKnowledgebase found at: 
http://www.asp-programmers.com/download-freeware.asp, does not properly sanitise it's admin logon fields. Therefore an SQL-inject will bypass the entire authentication process, giving you administrative rights. 

PoC of SQL could be 1'or'1'='1 on the admin logon page: /adminlogin.asp
