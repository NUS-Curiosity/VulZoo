Subject: ASPKnowledgebase vulnerable to XSS injection.


ASPKnowledgebase, by www.asp-programmers.com is vulnerable to XSS in some of it's input fields. If you compromise it's logon, to gain administrative privileges as my previous advisory describes - you can inject the admin form-fields with XSS.  
This will result in automatic execution of script when a user visits that page.

This is highly dangerous as you can script what ever you like. Often these types of attacks are used for cookie thefts and so on.
