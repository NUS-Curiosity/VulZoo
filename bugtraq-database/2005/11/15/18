Synopsis
========

Sylpheed and Sylpheed-Claws contain a buffer overflow vulnerability
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Sylpheed is a lightweight email client and newsreader. Sylpheed-Claws
is a 'bleeding edge' version of Sylpheed. They both support the import
of address books in LDIF (Lightweight Directory Interchange Format).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                     /  Vulnerable  /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/sylpheed             < 2.0.4                 >= 2.0.4
  2  mail-client/sylpheed-claws     < 1.0.5-r1             >= 1.0.5-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Colin Leroy reported buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Sylpheed and
Sylpheed-Claws. The LDIF importer uses a fixed length buffer to store
data of variable length. Two similar problems exist also in the Mutt
and Pine addressbook importers of Sylpheed-Claws.

Impact
======

By convincing a user to import a specially-crafted LDIF file into the
address book, a remote attacker could cause the program to crash,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the software.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Sylpheed users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/sylpheed-2.0.4"

All Sylpheed-Claws users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=mail-client/sylpheed-claws-1.0.5-r1"
