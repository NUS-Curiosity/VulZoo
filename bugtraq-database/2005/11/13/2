Synopsis
========

PHP suffers from multiple issues, resulting in security functions
bypass, local Denial of service, cross-site scripting or PHP variables
overwrite.

Background
==========

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language widely used to develop
web-based applications. It can run inside a web server using the
mod_php module or the CGI version and also stand-alone in a CLI.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/php         < 4.4.0-r4                      *>= 4.3.11-r4
                                                           >= 4.4.0-r4

                                                           >= 4.4.0-r8
  3  dev-php/php-cgi     < 4.4.0-r5                      *>= 4.3.11-r5
                                                           >= 4.4.0-r5
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     3 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found and fixed in PHP:

* a possible $GLOBALS variable overwrite problem through file upload
  handling, extract() and import_request_variables() (CVE-2005-3390)

* a local Denial of Service through the use of the session.save_path
  option (CVE-2005-3319)

* an issue with trailing slashes in allowed basedirs (CVE-2005-3054)

* an issue with calling virtual() on Apache 2, allowing to bypass
  safe_mode and open_basedir restrictions (CVE-2005-3392)

* a problem when a request was terminated due to memory_limit
  constraints during certain parse_str() calls (CVE-2005-3389)

* The curl and gd modules allowed to bypass the safe mode
  open_basedir restrictions (CVE-2005-3391)

* a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpinfo()
  (CVE-2005-3388)

Impact
======

Attackers could leverage these issues to exploit applications that are
assumed to be secure through the use of proper register_globals,
safe_mode or open_basedir parameters. Remote attackers could also
conduct cross-site scripting attacks if a page calling phpinfo() was
available. Finally, a local attacker could cause a local Denial of
Service using malicious session.save_path options.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround that would solve all issues at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php

All mod_php users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/mod_php

All php-cgi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php-cgi
