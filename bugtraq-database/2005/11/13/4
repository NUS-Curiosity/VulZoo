Synopsis
========

RAR contains a format string error and a buffer overflow vulnerability
that may be used to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

RAR is a powerful archive manager that can decompress RAR, ZIP and
other files, and can create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/rar       < 3.5.1                               >= 3.5.1

Description
===========

Tan Chew Keong reported about two vulnerabilities found in RAR:

* A format string error exists when displaying a diagnostic error
  message that informs the user of an invalid filename in an UUE/XXE
  encoded file.

* Some boundary errors in the processing of malicious ACE archives
  can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a
user to:

* decode a specially crafted UUE/XXE file, or

* extract a malicious ACE archive containing a file with an overly
  long filename.

When the user performs these actions, the arbitrary code of the
attacker's choice will be executed.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All RAR users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/rar-3.5.1"
