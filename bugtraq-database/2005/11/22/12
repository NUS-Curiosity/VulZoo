There's a huge difference between a financial crime committed by an 
individual and a crime committed by a corporation.

Let me know if the distinction confuses you and we'll discuss this more 
privately. You are aware that not every action of a person employed by a 
corporation is considered an action of the individual, right?

No individual programmer who writes spyware will ever be prosecuted for 
doing his or her job on behalf of a corporation. No exec who instructs 
said programmer to author said spyware will ever have personal criminal 
liability for giving said instruction.

If you don't like the world you live in, change it or get out.
