Synopsis
========

The Horde Application Framework is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting
vulnerability which could lead to the compromise of the victim's
browser content.

Background
==========

The Horde Application Framework is a general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP, providing classes for handling preferences,
compression, browser detection, connection tracking, MIME, and more.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/horde       < 2.2.9                             >= 2.2.9

Description
===========

The Horde Team reported a potential XSS vulnerability. Horde fails to
properly escape error messages which may lead to displaying unsanitized
error messages via Notification_Listener::getMessage()

Impact
======

By enticing a user to read a specially-crafted e-mail or using a
manipulated URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts running in
the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to a compromise of
the user's browser content.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Horde Application Framework users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-2.2.9"
