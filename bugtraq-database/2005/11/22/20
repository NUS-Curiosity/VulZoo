AFFECTED APPLICATION OR SERVICE
  VHCS
  http://www.vhcs.net/

  VHCS, the Virtual Hosting Control System, is a virtual
  hosting management application.



AFFECTED VERSIONS
  Version 2.2.0 up to and including 2.4.6.2


BACKGROUND
  Cross Site Scripting, also known as XSS or CSS, describes
  the injection of malicious content into output produced
  by a web application. A common attack vector is the
  inclusion of arbitrary client side script code into the
  applications' output. Failure to completely sanitize user
  input from malicious content causes a web application
  to be vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.

  http://www.cgisecurity.net/articles/xss-faq.shtml


ISSUE
  VHCS is subject to a XSS vulnerability on its HTTP error
  messages. This issue is caused by lack of input sanitation
  in vhcs/gui/errordocs/index.php which returns unfiltered
  web server environment variables.

  Successful exploitation may allow for impersonification
  through session stealing attacks.

  The following URL demonstrates this issue:

[vhcs_basedir]/dev/inputvalidation%3Cscript%3Ealert(window.location.hash)%3B%3C/script%3E#XSS


WORKAROUND
  Client: Disable Javascript.
  Server: Prevent access to vulnerable file(s).


SOLUTIONS
  Moritz Naumann IT Consulting & Services has crafted a
  unified diff patch against VHCS 2.4.6.2 which is available at
    http://moritz-naumann.com/adv/0006/vhcsxss/patch/index.php.diff

  VHCS developers may provide a fix in the 2.6 release. A release
  date is not currently set.
