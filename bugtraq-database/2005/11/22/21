Synopsis
========

eix has an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability, potentially
allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

eix is a small utility for searching ebuilds with indexing for fast
results.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-portage/eix     < 0.5.0_pre2                    >= 0.5.0_pre2
                                                          *>= 0.3.0-r2

Description
===========

Eric Romang discovered that eix creates a temporary file with a
predictable name. eix creates a temporary file in /tmp/eix.*.sync where
* is the process ID of the shell running eix.

Impact
======

A local attacker can watch the process list and determine the process
ID of the shell running eix while the "emerge --sync" command is
running, then create a link from the corresponding temporary file to a
system file, which would result in the file being overwritten with the
rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All eix users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose app-portage/eix

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
