Not just SOX.  HIPAA and GLB will do the same thing.  HIPAA will hold an 
individual practioner liable for security failures, if the corp had an 
acceptable plan but the implementation either never took place or was done 
shoddily.  If the plan isn't in place, then the admins are liable - 
personally liable.
