And yet, Jason has a deep point - corporations have more rights than
citizens. There is no jail time (freezing of assets and suspension of
sales, perhaps?) or death penalty (forced liquidation of assets,
distribution of proceeds to bond/stock owners - outside of bankruptcy
court) for them, and it's unlikely there ever will be, because they have
the money. The penalties should exist and be enforced, IMHO.


But this is political discussion, and perhaps not completely relevant to
this forum.
