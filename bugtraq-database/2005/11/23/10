>The IE bug shown in the advisory here http://www.computerterrorism.com/research/ie/ct21-11-2005 seems to have a DDOS like effect on mozilla sending pc usage to 99 % until mozilla either crashes or gives way.

This bug seems to make Safari 2.0.2 on MacOS 10.4.3 unuseable and slows 
down the system significantly, but Safari can be killed to regain 
control of the system.
