APPLE-SA-2005-11-29 Security Update 2005-009

Security Update 2005-009 is now available and delivers the following
security enhancements:

Apache2
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2088
Available for:  Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Cross-site scripting may be possible in certain
configurations
Description:  The Apache 2 web server may allow an attacker to bypass
protections using specially-crafted HTTP headers.  This behavior is
only present when Apache is used in conjunction with certain proxy
servers, caching servers, or web application firewalls.  This update
addresses the issue by incorporating Apache version 2.0.55.

apache_mod_ssl
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2700
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  SSL client authentication may be bypassed in certain
configurations
Description:  The Apache web server's mod_ssl module may allow an
attacker unauthorized access to a resource that is configured to
require SSL client authentication.  Only Apache configurations that
include the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive may be affected.
This update address the issue by incorporating mod_ssl 2.8.24 and
Apache version 2.0.55 (Mac OS X Server).

CoreFoundation
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2757
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Resolving a maliciously-crafted URL may result in crashes or
arbitrary code execution
Description:  By carefully crafting a URL, an attacker can trigger a
heap buffer overflow in CoreFoundation which may result in a crash or
arbitrary code execution.  CoreFoundation is used by Safari and other
applications.  This update addresses the issue by performing
additional validation of URLs.  This issue does not affect systems
prior to Mac OS X v10.4.

curl
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-3185
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Visiting a malicious HTTP server and using NTLM
authentication may result in arbitrary code execution
Description:  Using curl with NTLM authentication enabled to download
an HTTP resource may allow an attacker to supply an overlong user or
domain name.  This may cause a stack buffer overflow and lead to
arbitrary code execution.  This update addresses the issue by
performing additional validation when using NTLM authentication.
This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.4.

iodbcadmintool
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-3700
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Local users may gain elevated privileges
Description:  The ODBC Administrator utility includes a helper tool
called iodbcadmintool that executes with raised privileges.  This
helper tool contains a vulnerability that may allow local users to
execute arbitrary commands with raised privileges.  This update
addresses the issue by providing an updated iodbcadmintool that is
not susceptible.

OpenSSL
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2969
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Applications using OpenSSL may be forced to use the weaker
SSLv2 protocol
Description:  Applications that do not disable SSLv2 or that enable
certain compatibility options when using OpenSSL may be vulnerable to
a protocol downgrade attack.  Such attacks may cause an SSL
connection to use the SSLv2 protocol which provides less protection
than SSLv3 or TLS.  Further information on this issue is available at
http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20051011.txt.  This update
addresses the issue by incorporating OpenSSL version 0.9.7i.

passwordserver
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-3701
Available for:  Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Local users on Open Directory master servers may gain
elevated privileges
Description:  When creating an Open Directory master server,
credentials may be compromised.  This could lead to unprivileged
local users gaining elevated privileges on the server.  This update
addresses the issue by ensuring the credentials are protected.

Safari
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2491
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Processing a regular expressions may result in arbitrary
code execution
Description:  The JavaScript engine in Safari uses a version of the
PCRE library that is vulnerable to a potentially exploitable heap
overflow.  This may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  This
update addresses the issue by providing a new version of the
JavaScript engine that incorporates more robust input validation.

Safari
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-3702
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Safari may download files outside of the designated download
directory
Description:  When files are downloaded in Safari they are normally
placed in the location specified as the download directory.  However,
if a web site suggests an overlong filename for a download, it is
possible for Safari to create this file in other locations.  Although
the filename and location of the downloaded file content cannot be
directly specified by remote servers, this may still lead to
downloading content into locations accessible to other users.  This
update addresses the issue by rejecting overlong filenames.

Safari
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-3703
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  JavaScript dialog boxes in Safari may be misleading
Description:  In Safari, JavaScript dialog boxes do not indicate the
web site that created them.  This could mislead users into
unintentionally disclosing information to a web site.  This update
addresses the issue by displaying the originating site name in
JavaScript dialog boxes.  Credit to Jakob Balle of Secunia Research
for reporting this issue.

Safari
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-3705
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Visiting malicious web sites with WebKit-based applications
may lead to arbitrary code execution
Description:  WebKit contains a heap overflow that may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.  This may be triggered by content
downloaded from malicious web sites in applications that use WebKit
such as Safari.  This update addresses the issue by removing the heap
overflow from WebKit.  Credit to Neil Archibald of Suresec LTD and
Marco Mella for reporting this issue.

sudo
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-1993
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.3.9, Mac OS X Server v10.3.9, Mac OS X
v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  Local users may be able to gain elevated privileges in
certain sudo configurations
Description:  Sudo allows system administrators to grant users the
ability to run specific commands with elevated privileges.  Although
the default configuration is not vulnerable to this issue, custom
sudo configurations may not properly restrict users.  Further
information on this issue is available from:
http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/path_race.html
This update addresses the issue by incorporating sudo version
1.6.8p9.

syslog
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-3704
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.4.3, Mac OS X Server v10.4.3
Impact:  System log entries may be forged
Description:  The system log server records syslog messages verbatim.
By supplying control characters such as the newline character, a
local attacker could forge entries with the intention to mislead the
system administrator.  This update addresses the issue by specially
handling control characters and other non-printable characters.  This
issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.4.  Credit to
HELIOS Software GmbH for reporting this issue.
