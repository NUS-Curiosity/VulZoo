My DNS servers were attacked the similar way in the beginning of this year. 
All queries were originated from a lot of sources. Senders of these packets 
were not bogus obviously, because after firewalling incoming requests from 
any of them, the rate of flooding became lower. All requests were made to one 
of my domains.

Daily DNS traffic was about 400-500 Mb.

To automate the firewalling process I wrote a program, that sniffed DNS 
traffic and automatically added to firewall DROP rules.
