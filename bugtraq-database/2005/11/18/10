3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Mail Enable
Professional/Enterprise, which can be exploited by malicious users to
cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and to compromise a vulnerable system.

1) A boundary error exists in the IMAP service (MEIMAPS.EXE) when
handling an overly long mailbox name passed to "select", "create",
"delete", "rename", "subscribe", and "unsubscribe" commands. This can
be exploited by a malicious user to cause a stack-based buffer
overflow and allows arbitrary code execution.

2) Directory traversal error exists in the IMAP service (MEIMAP.EXE)
when handling specially crafted mailbox name passed to the "create"
and "rename" commands. This can be exploited by a malicious user to
create arbitrary directories on the server, or to cause a DoS by
renaming the mail directories of other users.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Apply cumulative update (ME-10008):
http://www.mailenable.com/hotfix/ME-10008.EXE

The vulnerabilities have also been fixed in MailEnable Professional
Edition version 1.7.
