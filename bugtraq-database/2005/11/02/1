Summary
=======

The CiscoWorks VPN/Security Management Solution (VMS) is a network
management application that includes Web-based tools for configuring,
monitoring, and troubleshooting VPNs, firewalls, network intrusion
detection systems (NIDSs), network intrusion prevention systems (NIPSs)
and host intrusion prevention systems (HIPSs). CiscoWorks VMS also
includes network device inventory, change audit, and software
distribution features.

An issue exists in one of the components of the Cisco Management Center
for IPS Sensors (IPS MC) v2.1 during the generation of the Cisco IOS
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) configuration file that may result in
some signatures belonging to certain classes being disabled during the
configuration deployment process.

Cisco has made a free software patch available to address this
vulnerability for affected customers.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20051101-ipsmc.shtml.

=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

  * Cisco IOS IPS devices that have been configured by IPS MC v2.1.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Cisco IOS IPS devices that have NOT been configured by IPS MC v2.1.
    This category includes Cisco IOS IPS devices that have been
    configured by using any of the following methods:
      + Cisco IDS MC (Management Center for IDS Sensors)
      + Cisco SDM (Security Device Manager)
      + Cisco IOS CLI (Command Line Interface)

Details
=======

Some Cisco routers running Cisco IOS include a feature called Cisco IOS
IPS. The Cisco IOS IPS acts as an in-line intrusion protection sensor,
watching packets and sessions as they flow through the router and
scanning each packet to match any of the Cisco IOS IPS signatures that
have been enabled on the device configuration. When it detects
suspicious activity, it responds before network security can be
compromised and logs the event through Cisco IOS syslog messages or
Security Device Event Exchange (SDEE). The network administrator can
configure Cisco IOS IPS to choose the appropriate response to various
threats.

Customers can use multiple methods, including Cisco IPS MC, Cisco IDS
MC, Cisco SDM and the Cisco IOS CLI, to enable, disable and configure
Cisco IOS IPS signatures. Some signatures dealing with TCP or UDP
traffic analyze traffic destined to specific ports. Those ports are
pre-configured with default values, and some signatures might allow
changes to the list of ports to be monitored.

If the Cisco IOS IPS devices have been configured by using the Cisco
IPS MC v2.1, the Cisco IPS MC might download a configuration file to
the device that does not contain a value for the port field in one or
more signatures, resulting in the affected Cisco IOS IPS device
disabling those signatures. Only signatures using either the STRING.TCP
or STRING.UDP signature micro-engine (SME) are affected by this
vulnerability. Additionally, this behavior only happens if those
signatures were enabled and configured from the Cisco IPS MC GUI ;
signatures belonging to the STRING.TCP or STRING.UDP SMEs that were
previously configured on the device and imported into the Cisco IPS MC
will not experience this issue.

The list of signatures currently loaded into a Cisco IOS IPS device and
their status can be obtained by executing the "show ip ips signatures"
command. The following abbreviated output shows signatures currently
loaded into the device, both enabled and disabled:

 Router#show ip ips signatures
 Builtin signatures are configured

Any signature with a capital N under the 'On' column is DISABLED, while
any signature with a capital Y under the same column is ENABLED. In
this example, signatures 4608:0 and 11000:0 (belonging to the
STRING.UDP SME), and signature 3117:0 (belonging to the STRING.TCP SME)
are listed as disabled. For each signature listed as disabled in the
output of the "show ip ips signatures" command, a corresponding 
"ip ips signature <SigID> <SubsigID> disable" command should be visible 
on the running configuration. This is an example of the 
"show running-configuration" command, using a filter to only display
configuration lines belonging to signatures that have been disabled:

    Router#show running-config | include ip ips signature .* disable
    ip ips signature 11000 0 disable
    ip ips signature 4608 0 disable
    ip ips signature 3117 0 disable
    Router#


This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID
CSCsc33696. 

Impact
======

While this is not a vulnerability in the Cisco IOS IPS code itself, in
the processing performed by Cisco IOS IPS on traffic traversing the
device, or in the Cisco IPS MC v2.1, this vulnerability might result in
an incomplete analysis of network traffic traversing the Cisco IOS IPS
device, which could allow some attacks to go unnoticed.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, please also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisories_listing.html
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") for assistance.

Cisco has developed a software fix for this vulnerability. Once the fix
is applied to a VMS server running IPS MC v2.1, the IPS MC will
correctly populate the port field attached to a signature using either
the STRING.TCP or STRING.UDP SME. Additional steps will be required to
be performed. Please read the README file published together with the
software fix.

In order to obtain this software fix, customers should access the VMS
Software download page for IDS MC and IPS MC, available at 
http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/mgmt-ctr-ids-app. 
The fix consists of the following three files:

  * idsmdc2.1.0-win-CSCsc336961.tar - this file contains the fix itself
    for IPS MC v2.1 running on the Windows operating system.
  * CSCOids2.1.0-sol-CSCsc336961.tar - this file contains the fix
    itself for IPS MC v2.1 running on the Solaris operating system.
  * CSCsc33696-README.txt - this file contains instructions on how to
    apply the software fix to an affected IPS MC v2.1 installation
    (either Windows or Solaris) and any needed pre and post
    installation tasks to be carried out by the user.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third-party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for assistance with the upgrade,
which should be free of charge.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of
this notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
"security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.
