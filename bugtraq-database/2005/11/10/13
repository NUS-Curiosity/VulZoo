Subject: Folder Guard exe files protection bypass


There is a protection of the software "Folder Guard" that protects against localy running exe files, which can by bypassed by:
running the exe files from the "Temperory internet files/xxxxx" directory, xxxxx stands for the randomal name granted by IE to the directory.
u can also install programs to this directory, and have no restricions.
