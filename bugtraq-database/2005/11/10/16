Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in
RealPlayer. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to reliably
overwrite stack memory with arbitrary data and execute arbitrary code in
the context of the user who executed the player.

This specific flaw exists in the first data packet contained in a Real
Media file. By specially crafting a malformed .rm movie file, a direct
stack overwrite is triggered, and reliable code execution is then
possible.

Technical Details:
The vulnerability is triggered by setting the application specific
length field of the [data packet + 1] to 0x80 - 0xFF this will cause a
stack overflow.
The value is sign-extended and passed as the length to memcpy.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.
Blink End Point Protection proactively protects against this
vulnerability

Vendor Status:
RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the "Check for Update" menu item under Tools on the
RealPlayer menu bar or from
