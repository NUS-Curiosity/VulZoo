Synopsis
========

fetchmailconf fails to properly handle file permissions, temporarily
exposing sensitive information to other local users.

Background
==========

fetchmail is a utility that retrieves and forwards mail from remote
systems using IMAP, POP, and other protocols. It ships with
fetchmailconf, a graphical utility used to create configuration files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/fetchmail     < 6.2.5.2-r1                 >= 6.2.5.2-r1

Description
===========

Thomas Wolff discovered that fetchmailconf opens the configuration file
with default permissions, writes the configuration to it, and only then
restricts read permissions to the owner.

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit the race condition to retrieve sensitive
information like IMAP/POP passwords.

Workaround
==========

Run "umask 077" to temporarily strengthen default permissions, then run
"fetchmailconf" from the same shell.

Resolution
==========

All fetchmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.2.5.2-r1"
