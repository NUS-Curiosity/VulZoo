Synopsis
========

ClamAV has many security flaws which make it vulnerable to remote
execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration with mail
servers to perform attachment scanning. ClamAV also provides a command
line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the virus database.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.87.1                      >= 0.87.1

Description
===========

ClamAV has multiple security flaws: a boundary check was performed
incorrectly in petite.c, a buffer size calculation in unfsg_133 was
incorrect in fsg.c, a possible infinite loop was fixed in tnef.c and a
possible infinite loop in cabd_find was fixed in cabd.c . In addition
to this, Marcin Owsiany reported that a corrupted DOC file causes a
segmentation fault in ClamAV.

Impact
======

By sending a malicious attachment to a mail server that is hooked with
ClamAV, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service or the
execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.87.1"
