Subject: XSS in PBLang 4.65 Profile.php/UCP.php

Excuse me for posting again (within minutes) but I did not properly check the other forms.

In UCP.php, when editing your profile, in several fields you can inject code into the page, just as in the SendPm.php.

EX: Input table: "URL"
'';!--"<script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83));   </script>

The reason we cannot just do alert("sometext"); here is because this time our input is filtered and the quotes have \'s before them (single or not).

All field areas (besides password) are useable. I could not try alias as the board would not allow me to do so.
Even the email field is vulnerable, so long as you put an email first (like dude@...t.com'';!--"<mycode>).

In "User Options", signature or 'saying' are not vulnerable, but URL Avatar is.

Again,
