I didn't miss the point. He's actually just inserting
malformed data that the browser doesn't know what to
do with. Isn't that what I said? I only intended to
point out what the problem really was. It's not
injecting scripts to run under Yahoo's priveledges, no
information is passed to a third party, and either
some very simple social engineering or a real XSS vuln
would need to be employed to pass any information.
Calling out moron web devers is useless, I agree. But
it's just as pointless as pointing out that
incorrectly using tags is a way of troubleshooting. I
had a point with the original statement, but it
escapes me.

Anyway, a solution is really quite simple. Allow users
to disable HTML in their email, or why not by default?
