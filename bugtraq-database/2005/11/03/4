BLACK HAT JAPAN 2005 PODCASTS
The presentations from the recent Black Hat Japan Briefings are now on-line. We are also experimenting with new ways to share our content with the community, and the first of these is to release some of the audio recordings as �pod casts� in .m4a format through our RSS feed.
 
BLACK PAGE UPDATE
Early next week you will see my first written statement regarding the Cisco/ISS incident that occurred at the summer Black Hat in Las Vegas. The issues brought up last summer are important to the entire security community and I invite the community to read and reflect on my thoughts, as well as those of other security experts.

FEDERAL 2006 CALL FOR PAPERS
Black Hat is proud to return to Washington D.C. after its last Briefings in 2003. For 2006 there will be expanded training offerings, focused presentations, and a convenient central location two metro stops from the Pentagon.
 
Black Hat Federal 2006 is a unique show specifically crafted to look at issues important to those charged with protecting critical networks and information from the most sophisticated adversaries. Submissions should be very technical and specific to threats and defenses that surround the challenging security problems facing hosts and networks today. We hope to offer a federal perspective on security issues and new directions to further security trade craft.
 
The Federal Government faces different threat models than the corporate community, with adversaries having different motivations, resources, and tools. Submissions should reflect this difference, with suggested topics including the current state of root kits and their detection, network IDS evasion & detection, covert communications, reverse engineering / anti-reverse engineering, defeating biometric systems, and the current state of the exploit development life cycle.

WHAT IS THE BLACK HAT BRIEFINGS?
The Black Hat Briefings fill the need for computer security professionals to better understand the security risks and potential threats to their information infrastructures and computer systems. Black Hat accomplishes this by assembling a group of vendor-neutral security professionals and having them present candidly about the problems businesses face and their solutions to those problems. No gimmicks - just straight talk by people who make it their business to explore the ever-changing security space.
