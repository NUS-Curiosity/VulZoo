	Overflow in Veritas Netbackup Enterprise Server


Stack Overflow in Veritas Netbackup Enterprise Server 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 11.10.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=336&type=vulnerabilities
November 10, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

VERITAS NetBackup Enterprise Server delivers mainframe-class data 
protection for the largest UNIX, Windows, Linux, and NetWare enterprise 
environments, especially for corporate data centers. 

http://veritas.com/Products/www?c=product&refId=2

VERITAS NetBackup Server software is cost-effective heterogeneous backup and
recovery solution designed for mid-size organizations, workgroups, and
remote
offices. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Veritas Netbackup
could lead to a remote Denial Of Service or remote code execution. The
Veritas Netbackup Volume Manager keeps track of the location of volumes 
(tapes) needed for backup or restore. 

By sending a specially crafted packet to the Volume Manager stack overflow
occurs.
This is caused by improper bounds checking. 

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation does not require authentication, thereby allowing any remote
attacker to take over the entire system or to disrupt the backup
capabilities. 

IV. DETECTION

The following versions are confirmed vulnerable:

- Veritas Netbackup 5.0 with MP1 (vmd.exe 5.0.0.370) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.0 with MP2 (vmd.exe 5.0.0.372) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.0 with MP3 (vmd.exe 5.0.0.377) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.0 with MP4 (vmd.exe 5.0.0.382) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.0 with MP5 (vmd.exe 5.0.0.387) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.1 without MP (vmd.exe 5.1.0.135) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.1 with MP1 (vmd.exe 5.1.0.140) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.1 with MP2 (vmd.exe 5.1.0.146) 
- Veritas Netbackup 5.1 with MP3A (vmd.exe 5.1.0.150) 

V. WORKAROUND

Use a firewall to restrict incoming connections to trusted workstations
running the Backup Exec client software, which uses port 13701 TCP.
Latter details released by Symantec state that the vulnerable code may
be able to be exploited through other NetBackup ports/services.
