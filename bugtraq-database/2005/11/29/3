Subject: Panda Remote Heap Overflow


Date
November 29, 2005

Vulnerability
The Panda Antivirus Library provides file format support for virus analysis. During decompression of ZOO files Panda is vulnerable to a heap overflow allowing attackers complete control of the system(s) being protected. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without user interaction in default configurations through common protocols such as SMTP. 

Impact
Successful exploitation of Panda protected systems allows attackers unauthorized control of data and related privileges. It also provides leverage for further network compromise. Panda implementations are likely vulnerable in their default configuration.

Affected Products
Due to the library’s modular design and core functionality: it is likely this vulnerability affects a substantial portion of Panda’s gateway, server, and client antivirus enabled product lines on most platforms.

Note: this library is also licensed to other venders with implementations that are likely affected, refer to Panda for specifics.
