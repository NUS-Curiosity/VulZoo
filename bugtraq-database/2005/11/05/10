Subject: I-Saudi.Com First K-S-A WarGamE


This War Game is the first Saudi War Game. 

we tried to make the War- Game levels so easy as

possible to make sure that experts and even 

newbies can join us and have a good time.

The WarGame requires the basics of programming, 

security bugs and needs some thinking. Many of 

those people who played the WarGame said that 

it's wonderfull because (almost) every body can 

play it, we have just 2 or 3 persons has 

completed the levels, can you be one of them ;)
