Subject: Apache Tomcat 5.5.x remote Denial Of Service



Apache Tomcat is the famous servlet container for Java Servlet and JSP 
technologies released under ASL.
Version 5.5.x is intented for servlet/jsp specification 2.4/2.0.
More information on http://tomcat.apache.org/

Description:

Many time consuming directory listing requests can cause a denial of service. 

Detection/PoC:

On Linux:
Vulnerable version tested are 5.5.0 to 5.5.11.
5.5.12 and 5.0.28 seems not to be impacted.

A easy way to test :
-Download Tomcat package from Tomcat archive
-Unpack it, use default configuration
-In webapps example dir, add some empty files (enough for the dir listing 
request to be long)
-Thread many listing access on this directory

Workaround:

Upgrade to linux version 5.5.12

PS: Secunia team have done more test available on
