What exactly is so special about it?

Free web hosting is available for many years and can be used to share
content with the world. Free unlimited web email is also available for
quite some time and can be used to store (encrypted) information for
internal use. There are a lot of free spots for forums and blogs in
internet. Keywording (tagging) URLs is not new either (see, e.g.,
<http://del.icio.us/>).
