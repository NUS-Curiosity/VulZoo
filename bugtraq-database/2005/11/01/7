If you had read the above page more carefully, you would have seen these
paragraphs:

"The values in the following list may be constants within an
implementation or may vary from one pathname to another. For example,
file systems or directories may have different characteristics.

"A definition of one of the values shall be omitted from the <limits.h>
header on specific implementations where the corresponding value is
equal to or greater than the stated minimum, but where the value can
vary depending on the file to which it is applied. The actual value
supported for a specific pathname shall be provided by the pathconf()
function."
