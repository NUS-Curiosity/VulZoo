Subject: [tool] multispoof - parallel spoofing for throughput increase


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I am pleased to announce multispoof, a tool that demonstrates
effectiveness of automated mass mac-spoofing in Ethernet networks.
- From the web page:

What is multispoof?

Multispoof is an application, which exploits weak, address based
authentication very frequently implemented by ISPs in Ethernet networks.
In such networks customers are identified with IP-MAC address pairs, and
only those paying ISP are granted access to the Internet.

Multispoof uses IP and MAC spoofing to impersonate legitimate customers.
The idea is not new, but multispoof does it in a smart way. As it
impersonates only inactive customers, there is no address conflicts.
And using multiple addresses in parallel in combination with load
balancing allows to achieve much higher transfer rates.

It could be compared with download accelerating software, because higher
throughput is achieved with multiple transmissions. The difference is
that multispoof operates on layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model.
In contrast, download accelerator uses multiple TCP streams - the fourth
layer of OSI model.
