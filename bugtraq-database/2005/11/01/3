 (XSS)	Vulnerability in phpinfo()


Hello Matthew,

Mr. Murphy, I don't know what your problem is, but the bug you refer to
and that is described in the bug tracker post is not the bug the
advisory contains. Just because you reported some XSS vulnerability in
phpinfo() does not mean that you can claim credit for every phpinfo()
XSS vulnerability that exists. So please simply shut up and go cry
elsewhere.

Yeah well... If you report the bug first you can get credit.
