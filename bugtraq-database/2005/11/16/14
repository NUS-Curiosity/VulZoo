Synopsis
========

The GdkPixbuf library, that is also included in GTK+ 2, contains
vulnerabilities that could lead to a Denial of Service or the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GTK+ (the GIMP Toolkit) is a toolkit for creating graphical user
interfaces. The GdkPixbuf library provides facilities for image
handling. It is available as a standalone library and also packaged
with GTK+ 2.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/gtk+              < 2.8.6-r1                 >= 2.8.6-r1
                                                         *>= 2.6.10-r1
                                                                 < 2.0
  2  media-libs/gdk-pixbuf      < 0.22.0-r5               >= 0.22.0-r5
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

iDEFENSE reported a possible heap overflow in the XPM loader
(CVE-2005-3186). Upon further inspection, Ludwig Nussel discovered two
additional issues in the XPM processing functions : an integer overflow
(CVE-2005-2976) that affects only gdk-pixbuf, and an infinite loop
(CVE-2005-2975).

Impact
======

Using a specially crafted XPM image an attacker could cause an affected
application to enter an infinite loop or trigger the overflows,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GTK+ 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose x11-libs/gtk+

All GdkPixbuf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gdk-pixbuf-0.22.0-r5"
