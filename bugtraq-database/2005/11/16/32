Summary
=======

The Cisco 7920 Wireless IP Phone provides Voice Over IP service via IEEE
802.11b Wi-Fi networks and has a form-factor similar to a cordless phone. This
product contains two vulnerabilities:

The first vulnerability is an SNMP service with fixed community strings that
allow remote users to read, write, and erase the configuration of an affected
device.

The second vulnerability is an open VxWorks Remote Debugger on UDP port 17185
that may allow an unauthenticated remote user to access debugging information
or cause a denial of service.

Cisco has made free software available to address these vulnerabilities for
affected customers. There are workarounds available to mitigate the effects of
the vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20051116-7920.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

  * Cisco 7920 Wireless IP Phone, firmware version 2.0 and earlier

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Cisco 7920 Wireless IP Phone, firmware version 2.01

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities, including other IP telephony products.

Details
=======

Fixed SNMP Community Strings
+---------------------------

The Cisco 7920 Wireless IP Phone provides an SNMP service with fixed read-only
and read-write community strings of "public" and "private", respectively. These
strings cannot be changed by the user and will allow remote users to issue an
SNMP GetRequest or SetRequest to the phone. SNMP can be used to retrieve and
modify the device configuration, including stored user data such as phone book
entries. To address this vulnerability, Cisco has provided updated software
that removes the SNMP functionality from this product.

This issue is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsb75186 ( registered customers
only) .

VxWorks Debugger Port (wdbrpc, 17185/udp)
+----------------------------------------

The Cisco 7920 Wireless IP Phone listens on UDP port 17185 to allow connections
from a VxWorks debugger. This port may allow remote users to collect debugging
information or conduct a denial of service attack against an affected device.
To address this vulnerability, Cisco has provided updated software that closes
UDP port 17185.

This issue is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsb38210 ( registered customers
only) .

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in information
leakage or denial of service attacks against an affected device. In the case of
the Fixed SNMP Community Strings vulnerability, an attack may take the form of
erasure or modification of the device configuration and personal user data.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Cisco has provided free software to address these vulnerabilities; please
consult the chart below for details.

When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade
solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be
upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software
configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If
the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center
("TAC") or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.

+---------------------------------------------+

Workarounds
===========

  * For sites that restrict Cisco 7920 phones to one or more known subnets,
    Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be used to deny traffic to the affected
    ports.

    The following extended access-list can be adapted to your network. This
    example assumes that all Cisco 7920 phones are connected to the
    192.168.10.0 network and that all SNMP access is to be restricted to a
    management station with the IP address of 10.1.1.1:

        access-list 101 permit udp host 10.1.1.1 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 
	  range 161 162
        access-list 101 permit udp host 10.1.1.1 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 
	  port 17185
        access-list 101 deny udp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 range 161 162
        access-list 101 deny udp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 port 17185
        access-list 101 permit ip any any


    The access-list must then be applied to all interfaces using configuration
    commands such as:

        interface ethernet 0/0
        ip access-group 101 in


  * Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)
    Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your network, it
    is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to target
    your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your
    network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best
    practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network
    security as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white
    paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access
    Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques
    for iACLs:
    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability for
affected customers. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult their
maintenance provider or check the software for feature set compatibility and
known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they have
purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise using such
software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by the terms of Cisco's software
license terms found at http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com" for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their regular
update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades should be
obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide website at 
http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third-party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior or
existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as Cisco
Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
support organization for guidance and assistance with the appropriate course of
action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific customer
situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and
organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,
customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to
ensure any applied workaround or fix is the most appropriate for use in the
intended network before it is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco service
contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should get
their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC
contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this notice as
evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract
customers must be requested through the TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
additional TAC contact information, including special localized telephone
numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various languages.
