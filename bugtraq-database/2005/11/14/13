Subject: fipsCMS light - vulnerable to script injection.


fipsCMS lights is a freeware product of fipsasp.com. If you log on as admin, you can generate new pages in the CMS system.

If you inject the "headline" field with scriptingcode like <script>alert(�code executed�)</script>, this will automaticly launch when a users visits that site.
