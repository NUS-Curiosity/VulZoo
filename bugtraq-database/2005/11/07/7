Suresec Security Advisory - #00008

07/11/2005

Mac OS X (xnu) - Multiple information leaks.
Advisory: http://www.suresec.org/advisories/adv8.pdf

Description:
The Mac OS X kernel has several information leaks.

In certain cases this might be sensitive information, such as portions 
of
the file cache or terminal buffers. This information might be directly 
useful,
or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated privileges in some way. For
example, a terminal buffer might include a user-entered password.

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Ilja van Sprundel.
