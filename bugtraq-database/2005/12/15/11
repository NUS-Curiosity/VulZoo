Synopsis
========

OpenLDAP and Gauche suffer from RUNPATH issues that may allow users in
the "portage" group to escalate privileges.

Background
==========

OpenLDAP is a suite of LDAP-related application and development tools.
Gauche is an R5RS Scheme interpreter.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-nds/openldap      < 2.2.28-r3                    >= 2.2.28-r3
                                                         *>= 2.1.30-r6
  2  dev-lang/gauche       < 0.8.6-r1                      >= 0.8.6-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Gentoo packaging for OpenLDAP and Gauche may introduce insecure paths
into the list of directories that are searched for libraries at
runtime.

Impact
======

A local attacker, who is a member of the "portage" group, could create
a malicious shared object in the Portage temporary build directory that
would be loaded at runtime by a dependent binary, potentially resulting
in privilege escalation.

Workaround
==========

Only grant "portage" group rights to trusted users.

Resolution
==========

All OpenLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-nds/openldap

All Gauche users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/gauche-0.8.6-r1"

============
