Subject: Re: RLA ("Remote LanD Attack")

     Agreed, this and all attacks like this, fall under DoS.  The
reason I originally classified this attack as a Remote LanD, was I was
originally testing a un-patched Windows SP2 machine, locally, and of
course watching the box lock up for 30 seconds or so.  I then thought,
there has to be a way for this to work remotely.  I started testing,
this was about four (4) months ago.  I knew then that it worked, but I
really wanted to find out what devices are susceptible to such
attacks.  I knew it, seeing as it was both the Linksys and Westell it
was more then just two vendors.

     So, from there I just called it Remote LanD attack.  As I
literally just tried sending LanD packets across the Internet.  (To a
second party who was helping me test the exploit/vuneribity.  I did in
fact have permission, with all the test I performed.)  It was then I
discovered the packets were lagging my colleges network.  I started
messing with an array of flag combinations, almost all caused some
reaction, mainly latency.  I then found the ASPU combination which
caused the most damage.

     Thanks :-) I really took the time to make this write-up organized
and understandable.   Hopefully the device vendors can more from here
and fix the problem, a simply drop of LanD packets would do it.

     Again, thanks for you comments.  If you have have anything else,
please feel free to reply.
