below.

B.11.00 install PHNE_33395 or subsequent, then run "sqmax 1000"
B.11.04 install PHNE_33427 or subsequent, then run "sqmax 1000"
B.11.11 install PHNE_31091 or subsequent, then run "sqmax 1000"
B.11.23 install PHKL_31500, sqmax not required

The patches are available from http://itrc.hp.com

An alternative to installing PHKL_31500 for B.11.23 is to
install IPF-HP revision A.03.05.10.02 or subsequent.

IPF-HP is available from: http://www.hp.com/go/softwaredepot

For B.11.00, B.11.04, and B.11.11:
After the patches listed above are installed an internal system
parameter must be set. A utility, sqmax, has been provided to set
the parameter.  The parameter must be set whenever the system is
rebooted.

The parameter is set as follows:

/usr/contrib/bin/sqmax 1000

The sqmax utility is available via ftp:
System: hprc.external.hp.com (192.170.19.100)
Login: sqmax
Password: sqmax

FTP Access:
ftp://sqmax:sqmax@...c.external.hp.com/
or:
ftp://sqmax:sqmax@....170.19.100/

   1. Download sqmax.tar from the ftp site
      into a secure directory.
   2. Verify the cksum or md5sum:

      md5sum 23211654ef947e9cbf389b88f5b0cde6
   3. Unpack the archive:
      tar -xvf sqmax.tar
   4. Refer to sqmax.readme for further instructions.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
B.11.00, B.11.04, B.11.11 - After installing patch,
