Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xpdf, GPdf, CUPS and
Poppler potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Xpdf and GPdf are PDF file viewers that run under the X Window System.
Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on Xpdf code. The Common UNIX
Printing System (CUPS) is a cross-platform print spooler. It makes use
of Xpdf code to handle PDF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/xpdf          < 3.01-r2                       >= 3.01-r2
  2  app-text/gpdf         < 2.10.0-r2                    >= 2.10.0-r2

  4  net-print/cups        < 1.1.23-r3                    >= 1.1.23-r3
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     4 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

infamous41md discovered that several Xpdf functions lack sufficient
boundary checking, resulting in multiple exploitable buffer overflows.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially-crafted PDF file
which would trigger an overflow, potentially resulting in execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Xpdf, CUPS, GPdf or
Poppler.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/xpdf-3.01-r2"

All GPdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/gpdf-2.10.0-r2"

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.4.2-r1"

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.1.23-r3"
