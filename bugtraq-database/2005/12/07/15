Potential Security Impact: Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company,
        HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY

A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX
running TCP/IP. This vulnerability could be remotely exploited by
an unauthorized user to cause a Denial of Service(DoS).

References: NISCC VU#532967, CAN-2004-0790, CAN-2004-0791,
            CAN-2004-1060

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.

HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.04, B.11.11, B.11.22, B.11.23 running TCP/IP.
HP-UX B.11.11 and B.11.23 running TOUR (Transport Optional Upgrade
Release).

BACKGROUND

As reported in NISCC VU#532967:
http://www.uniras.gov.uk/niscc/docs/al-20050412-00308.html?lang=en

RESOLUTION

HP has made the following patches, updates, and binary
files available to resolve the issue.

Patches are available for the core network product from
http://itrc.hp.com :

B.11.00 PHNE_33395 or subsequent

B.11.04 PHNE_33427 or subsequent

B.11.11 PHNE_33159 or subsequent

B.11.23 PHNE_32606 or subsequent


 ->TOUR revision 3.0 is available from:
 ->http://www.hp.com/go/softwaredepot

 ->Binary files are available for B.11.22. Please write to
 ->security-alert@...com for more information.

Optionally set ip_pmtu_strategy=0 to work around CAN-2004-1060.
However, this may not be necessary:

Although changes in the binary files and patches for CAN-2004-0790
and CAN-2004-0791 do not prevent the exploit of CAN-2004-1060,
they do make it less likely to succeed. The sequence number check
suggested in section 5.1 of 'ICMP attacks against TCP' has been
implemented. The Internet Draft of 'ICMP attacks against TCP' can
be found here:
http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/icmp-attacks-against-tcp.html
Customers should consider whether this check reduces the risk of
the exploit to the point that setting ip_pmtu_strategy=0 is not
required.

Note: ip_pmtu_strategy=0 sets the PMTU to 576 bytes and clears the
"Don't Fragment" bit. This disables PMTU discovery. For IPv4 the
Next-Hop MTU may be as low as 68 bytes. Therefore setting
ip_pmtu_strategy=0 may cause performance to decrease.

To set ip_pmtu_strategy=0:

Edit /etc/rc.config.d/nddconf to add the following:

TRANSPORT_NAME[n]=ip
NDD_NAME[n]=ip_pmtu_strategy
NDD_VALUE[n]=0

where 'n' is the next available index value as described in the
nddconf comments.

This value will take effect when the system is rebooted.
Until the system can be rebooted use the following command to read
the /etc/rc.config.d/nddconf file and set the tunable parameters:
/usr/bin/ndd -c

The ip_pmtu_strategy parameter can be displayed by the following
command:
/usr/bin/ndd -get /dev/ip ip_pmtu_strategy

Note: Since open connections will remain potentially vulnerable
until they are closed and certain internal data structures are
released it is recommended that the system be rebooted.

Note: There is a defect that will cause "ndd -c" to fail if there
are more than 10 directives in /etc/rc.config.d/nddconf. That
defect is fixed in the following patches:

B.11.11 PHNE_25644 or subsequent

B.11.04 PHNE_26076 or subsequent

B.11.00 PHNE_26125 or subsequent


MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
Optionally set ip_pmtu_strategy=0
