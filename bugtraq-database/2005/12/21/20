To address and fix this vulnerability, you must remove the obsolete
JSP files from your CAM as they are no longer needed. You can either:

1. Install the patch on your CAM, as described in "Patch Installation Intructions" below, or

2. Apply the workaround, as described in "Workaround Solution" below.

Caveat CSCsc85405 will be resolved in the following future releases:

Patch Installation Instructions
===============================

To install this patch:

1. Download the Patch-CSCsc85405.tar.gz file from the Cisco Clean
Access Patches folder
(http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/cca-patches) under Cisco
Secure Software
(http://www.cisco.com/kobayashi/sw-center/ciscosecure/cleanaccess.shtml).

2.  Open an SSH terminal and copy the patch file into your Clean
Access Manager (CAM) using WinSCP, SSH File Transfer or PSCP, as
described below.

  If using WinSCP or SSH File Transfer: 

        a. Copy Patch-CSCsc85405.tar.gz to the /store directory
           on the Clean Access Manager. 

  If using PSCP: 

        a. Open a command prompt on your Windows computer. 

        b. Cd to the path where your PSCP resides 
            (e.g, C:\Documents and Settings\desktop). 

        c. Enter the following command to copy the file to the CAM:

           pscp Patch-CSCsc85405.tar.gz root@...ddress_manager:/store


3. From the SSH terminal, untar the patch file on the CAM:

        cd /store
        tar xzvf Patch-CSCsc85405.tar.gz

4. Cd to the Patch-CSCsc85405 directory:

        cd Patch-CSCsc85405

5. Execute the patch file upgrade on the CAM:

         ./patch.sh


=========================
Workaround Solution
=========================

The following workaround steps remove the affected .jsp files from the
CAM, as they are no longer needed.

1. Open an SSH terminal, and login to the CAM shell.

2. Change directory as follows:

        cd /perfigo/control/tomcat/webapps/admin/

3. Remove the uploadclient.jsp and ieee8021x.jsp files:

        rm -f uploadclient.jsp ieee8021x.jsp

4. Change directory as follows:

        cd /perfigo/control/tomcat/work/Standalone/localhost/admin

5. Remove the cached jsp sources:

        rm -f uploadclient_jsp.* ieee8021x_jsp.*

6. Remove any file in the "installer/window" directory, this will be
useful for any exploited machine.

        rm -f /perfigo/control/tomcat/normal-webapps/installer/windows/*
