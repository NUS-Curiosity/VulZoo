Subject: oracle not only offeder - researchers NOT responsible?


The following is a very well researched text from Matthew Murphy's blog 
discussing the matter of disclosing vulnerabilities to many vendors (and 
specifically Microsoft). Further, as I understand it, he shows how 
vendors today use terms such as "responsible disclosure" to scare 
researchers and claim they are NOT responsible if they don't do it their 
way.

While I certainly did not dispute the facts that David Litchfield showed 
of Oracle's behaviour, I did not agree with how he did it or that Oracle 
is alone.

Oracle is not the only offender, and while I agree that Microsoft has 
come a LONG way and takes security a whole lot more seriously than they 
used to.. they still seem to not understand the security community and 
treat security as a PR problem.

He shows specific cases and vulnerabilities, and is worth a read. Quite 
Refreshing and very informative.
