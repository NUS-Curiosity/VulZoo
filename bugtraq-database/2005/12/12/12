Subject: Guestserver guestbook system vulnerabilities



The poor security and input validation at Guestserver versions below 5 ( there are still lots of them out there ) allow all HTML tags inside a message and it can be exploited as much as you want to.

A Google Search for "Guestbook by  Guestserver - v4.12" for example comes up with tons of vulnerable sites.
