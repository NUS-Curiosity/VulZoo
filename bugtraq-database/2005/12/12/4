Synopsis
========

Openswan and IPsec-Tools suffer from an implementation flaw which may
allow a Denial of Service attack.

Background
==========

Openswan is an implementation of IPsec for Linux. IPsec-Tools is a port
of KAME's implementation of the IPsec utilities, including racoon, an
Internet Key Exchange daemon. Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1),
a derivate of ISAKMP, is an important part of IPsec. IPsec is widely
used to secure exchange of packets at the IP layer and mostly used to
implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

Affected packages

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.

Description
===========

The Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) discovered that
various ISAKMP implementations, including Openswan and racoon (included
in the IPsec-Tools package), behave in an anomalous way when they
receive and handle ISAKMP Phase 1 packets with invalid or abnormal
contents.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can create a specially crafted packet using 3DES with
an invalid key length, resulting in a Denial of Service attack, format
string vulnerabilities or buffer overflows.

Workaround
==========

Avoid using "aggressive mode" in ISAKMP Phase 1, which exchanges
information between the sides before there is a secure channel.

Resolution
==========

All Openswan users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openswan-2.4.4"

All IPsec-Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-firewall/ipsec-tools
