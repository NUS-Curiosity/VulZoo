Subject: IMOEL CMS Sql password discovery


IMOEL CMS 
has the weakness to download the plain text sql password in the setting.php file 
*/*************************************
	$setting['host']['username'] = 'sqlusername';
	$setting['host']['password'] = 'sqlpassword';

***************************************
so u can download the setting.php file & view the plain text password

as the default imoel cms set the administrator user name and password same as sql password
u can access the setting.php file from this url

http://[site]/include/setting.php
