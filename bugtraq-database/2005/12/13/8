Dear Marc Ruef,

Note: This is a device which costs 44,44€

You fail to say whether this is done from INSIDE -> OUTSIDE or vice
versa, which really is the point which makes this a "vulnerability"
instead of a simple bug.

I found countless other Gateways "vulnerable" to this, most SHO DSL gateways even
crash when you run Emule for 24hours (same cause). The reason is that
with the NAT functions they simply can't handle a larger NAT Table
(which grows quite rapidely with SYN scanning..).

I never reported this issue because I thought and I still think this
is not really an security issue.

Who will use an RP114 (44€) for in an high availability environment?



PS. Don't do Pentests over SOHO DSL gateways... it is a baaaad idea.
