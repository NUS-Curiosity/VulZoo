Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [0], a Denial of Service (DoS)
  vulnerability exist in "libcurl", the underlying library of the cURL
  [1] networking tool.
  
  Two off-by-one errors in libcurl's URL parser allow a buffer overflow
  and cause a DoS via certain URLs that (1) are malformed in a way
  that prevents a terminating NUL byte from being added to either
  a hostname or path buffer, or (2) contain a "?" separator in the
  hostname portion, which causes a "/" to be prepended to the resulting
  string.
  
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2005-4077 [2] to the problem.
