Synopsis
========

Local users could gain root privileges by chrooting into arbitrary
directories.

Background
==========

rssh is a restricted shell, allowing only a few commands like scp or
sftp. It is often used as a complement to OpenSSH to provide limited
access to users.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-shells/rssh       < 2.3.0                            >= 2.3.0

Description
===========

Max Vozeler discovered that the rssh_chroot_helper command allows local
users to chroot into arbitrary directories.

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root
privileges by chrooting into arbitrary directories.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All rssh users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-shells/rssh-2.3.0"
