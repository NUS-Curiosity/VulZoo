Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're internet router is dropping spoofed
packets, as they should be, this attack will not work.

     I agree that this is in fact a DoS, however it is using the old
LanD attack (from 1997) syntax/style.  That fact that it is a packet
to itself, from it's self, obviously spoofed.  As this was the same
way it was done back in the 90's.  The difference here, is the fact
that the LanD attack can be performed remotely, whereas before the
attack was only a Local (LAN) attack.

     Also note that this is an attack on devices, not OS's.  Also let
me note that the device is unusable until it is physically reset. 
Eitherway, I am fine by this being consedered a DoS, it is.  It will
shut doen your switch (rendering your network usaless) or your router
(keeping you from access the internet etc.).

If you have any other questions, or comments please let me know. 
Thanks for the input, I think I did infact not state that the attack
was a DoS.
