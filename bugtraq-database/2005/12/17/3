Subject: Update on the PGP NTFS File Wipe Issue, 16 Dec 2005


We have verified the problem; with an NTFS volume and Windows XP,  
free space wiping of slack after the end of a file but before the end  
of the cluster does not occur correctly with Windows XP and NTFS. It  
does work correctly with NTFS under Windows 2000, or with Windows XP  
and another file system such as FAT32. It also works correctly when  
using the file shredding functionality. This issue affected only the  
volume-level free space wiping.

We have created a fix for this issue, and the fix has pass both our  
own tests and independent testing by Vinnie Liu. We are now preparing  
PGP Desktop 9.0.4 that includes this fix. We expect to release PGP  
Desktop 9.0.4 next Wednesday, 21 Dec 2005.
