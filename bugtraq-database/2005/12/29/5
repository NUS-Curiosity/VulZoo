Subject: RE: WMF Exploit


CERT now has posted Vulnerability Note VU#181038, "Microsoft Windows may
be vulnerable to buffer overflow via specially crafted WMF file"
(http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/181038). The note provides additional
details about the exploit and its effects. Very few workarounds have
been proposed other than blocking at the perimeter and possibly
remapping the .wmf extension to some application other than the
vulnerable Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (SHIMGVU.DLL).

Another quick observation, again, I apologize if this information has
already been posted; I haven't been able to read all the posts today.
The thumbnail view in Windows Explorer will parse the graphics files in
a folder, even if the file is never explicitly opened. This is enough to
trigger the exploit. Even more frightening is that you don't have to use
the thumbnail view for a thumbnail to be generated. Under some
circumstances, just single-clicking on the file will cause it to be
parsed.
