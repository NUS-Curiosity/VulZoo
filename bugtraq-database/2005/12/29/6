Indeed, this is quite an annoyance. Buytoolbar.biz/xpl.wmf also works. I
sent it to Microsoft a few days ago and they're looking into it. It looks
like it's going to be a bad week at MSRC :(

I whoised the owners of a couple domains who host the image and got the
following information:

The name Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev that this domain is registered to
leads me to believe that it is registered with false information (for those
of you who don't know, Gorbachev was a former Soviet president).

This information does look promising. Iframeurl.biz is also registered to
the same individual. Perhaps the Polish authorities could apprehend this
culprit (either that, or a Polish reader of full-disclosure could pay him a
visit ;). That is, of course, assuming he is stupid enough to use his real
name to register a domain for illegal use.

In reference to:
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/420288/30/0/threaded

I ported the exploit to the Metasploit Framework in case anyone wants to

test it without installing a thousand spyware apps...

Available from 'msfupdate' for MSF users, or in the 2.5 snapshot:

--http://metasploit.com/projects/Framework/exploits.html#ie_xp_pfv_metaf
ile
--http://metasploit.com/tools/framework-2.5-snapshot.tar.gz

Tested on Win XP SP1/SP2 and Windows 2003 SP0/SP1.
