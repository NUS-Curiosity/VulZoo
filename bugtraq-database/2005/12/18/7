               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated enscript package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152892
Issue date:        2005-12-17
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2004-1184 CVE-2004-1185 CVE-2004-1186

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated enscript package that fixes several security issues is now
available.

GNU enscript converts ASCII files to PostScript.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Enscript has the ability to interpret special escape sequences. A flaw
was found in the handling of the epsf command used to insert inline EPS
files into a document. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
ASCII file which made use of the epsf pipe command in such a way that it
could execute arbitrary commands if the file was opened with enscript by
a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-1184 to this issue.

Additional flaws in Enscript were also discovered which can only be
triggered by executing enscript with carefully crafted command line
arguments. These flaws therefore only have a security impact if enscript
is executed by other programs and passed untrusted data from remote
users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2004-1185 and CVE-2004-1186 to these issues.

All users of enscript should upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
