---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated lynx package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152832
Issue date:        2005-12-17
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core

CVE Names:         CVE-2005-2929 CVE-2005-3120
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated lynx package that corrects security issues is now available.

Lynx is a text-based Web browser.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

An arbitrary command execute bug was found in the lynx "lynxcgi:" URI
handler. An attacker could create a web page redirecting to a malicious
URL which could execute arbitrary code as the user running lynx. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name
CVE-2005-2929 to this issue.

Ulf Harnhammar discovered a stack overflow bug in Lynx when handling
connections to NNTP (news) servers. An attacker could create a web page
redirecting to a malicious news server which could execute arbitrary
code as the user running lynx. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project assigned the name CVE-2005-3120 to this issue.

Users should update to this erratum package, which contains backported
patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
