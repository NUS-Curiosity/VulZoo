Subject: [FLSA-2005:152870] Updated a2ps package fixes security issue

---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated a2ps package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152870
Issue date:        2005-12-17
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2004-1170
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated a2ps package that fixes a security bug is now available.

The a2ps filter converts text and other types of files to PostScript
format.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

A problem was discovered in the way a2ps handles filenames that include
shell metacharacters. An attacker could use this flaw to execute
arbitrary commands by providing a filename that includes metacharacters
as an argument. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-1170 to this issue.

All users of a2ps should upgrade to this updated package, which includes
a patch to correct this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
