               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated gtk2 packages fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:155510

Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2004-0753 CVE-2004-0782 CVE-2004-0783

1. Topic:

Updated gtk2 packages that fix several security flaws are now available.

The gtk2 package contains the GIMP ToolKit (GTK+), a library for
creating graphical user interfaces for the X Window System.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

During testing of a previously fixed flaw in Qt (CVE-2004-0691), a flaw
was discovered in the BMP image processor of gtk2. An attacker could
create a carefully crafted BMP file which would cause an application to
enter an infinite loop and not respond to user input when the file was
opened by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-0753 to this issue.

During a security audit Chris Evans discovered a stack and a heap
overflow in the XPM image decoder. An attacker could create a carefully
crafted XPM file which could cause an application linked with gtk2 to
crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when the file was opened by a
victim. (CVE-2004-0782, CVE-2004-0783)

Chris Evans also discovered an integer overflow in the ICO image
decoder. An attacker could create a carefully crafted ICO file which
could cause an application linked with gtk2 to crash when the file was
opened by a victim. (CVE-2004-0788)

A bug was found in the way gtk2 processes BMP images. It is possible
that a specially crafted BMP image could cause a denial of service
attack on applications linked against gtk2. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CVE-2005-0891 to this issue.

Users of gtk2 are advised to upgrade to these packages which contain
backported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
