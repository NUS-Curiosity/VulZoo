Thanks for the response,

That was a good idea, I hadn't thought of it; however, I turned off 
MultiViews, and it still behaves the same way.

I also tried adding more extensions, just out of curiosity.  The 
following files also run as .php files:
   http://www.javaop.com/~iago/test.php.cpp.java
   http://www.javaop.com/~iago/test.php.a.a.a.a.b.b.b.b.c.d.e.f

Interestingly, these files are NOT affected, and don't parse the .php:
   http://www.javaop.com/~iago/test.php.jpeg.bmp.rar
   http://www.javaop.com/~iago/test.php.jpeg.rar

The first of those two behaves as a .bmp, and the second one behaves as 
a .jpeg.

It seems that it uses the last recognized extension when parsing files, 
ignoring everything after it.

Any other ideas?  At this point, I'm unsure whether to call it a bug or 
a feature, and whether to alert Apache about it.  Unless somebody posts 
soon, I'll send a bug report to Apache.

Ron
