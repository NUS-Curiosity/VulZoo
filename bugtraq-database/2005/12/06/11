Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 12.05.05: Multiple
	Vendor xpdf StreamPredictor Heap Overflow Vulnerability


Multiple Vendor xpdf StreamPredictor Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.05.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=344&type=vulnerabilities
December 5, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Xpdf is an open-source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in 
xpdf, as included by various vendor's software distributions, could 
allow attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, 
potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to insufficient input 
validation in the Predictor stream parsing code. The 
StreamPredictor::StreamPredictor function from xpdf/Stream.cc takes the 
value of numComps from user-controllable data from within the PDF file. 
The numComps value is used in a series of calcualations within the 
StreamPredictor function. Using specially crafted values, a call to 
gmalloc can be forced to allocate the minimum number of bytes, which 
may later be overrun with user-supplied data from the PDF file leading 
to corruption of heap memory that might result in a DoS condition or 
arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution with privileges 
of the xpdf process. Currently, exploitation resulting in code 
execution is theoretical and dependant on the process memory layout. A 
typical exploitation attempt would require an attacker to supply a 
malicious pdf to the victim. The victim would need to open the corrupt 
pdf file in xpdf. Only then would the vulnerability be triggered. 

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in xpdf 
3.01. All earlier versions of xpdf are suspected vulnerable.

The following vendors include susceptible xpdf packages within their 
operating system distributions:

    . The Debian Project: Linux 3.0 and 3.1 

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this 
vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

A patch for this vulnerability is available at:
  
  ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.01pl1.patch

Updated binaries (version 3.01pl1) are available at:
