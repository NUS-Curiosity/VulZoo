Description:
  Multiple vulnerabilities were recently found in the PHP [1] web
  scripting language:

  1. The "exif_read_data" function in the EXIF module in PHP before
  4.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS)
  through an infinite recursion via a malformed JPEG image. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2005-3353 [2] to the problem.

  2. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "phpinfo"
  function in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.0 and 5.x up to 5.0.5 allows remote
  attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted URL
  with a "stacked array assignment". The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CVE-2005-3388 [3] to the
  problem.

  3. The "parse_str" function in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.0 and 5.x up to
  5.0.5, when called with only one parameter, allows remote attackers
  to enable the "register_globals" directive via inputs that cause a
  request to be terminated due to the "memory_limit" setting, which
  causes PHP to set an internal flag that enables "register_globals" and
  allows attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in PHP applications that
  would otherwise be protected. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CVE-2005-3389 [4] to the problem.

  4. The RFC1867 file upload feature in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.0 and 5.x up
  to 5.0.5, when "register_globals" is enabled, allows remote attackers
  to modify the "GLOBALS" array and bypass security protections of PHP
  applications via a "multipart/form-data" POST request with a "GLOBALS"
  "fileupload" field. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the id CVE-2005-3390 [5] to the problem.

  5. Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP before 4.4.1 allow remote
  attackers to bypass "safe_mode" and "open_basedir" restrictions
  via unknown attack vectors in the "curl" and "gd" extensions. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2005-3391 [6] to the problem.

  6. The additionally discovered issue CVE-2005-3392 doesn't affect PHP
  under the OpenPKG platforms.
