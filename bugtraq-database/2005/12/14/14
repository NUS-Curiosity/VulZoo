 ServerProtect EarthAgent Remote DoS Vulnerability


Trend Micro ServerProtect EarthAgent Remote DoS Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.14.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=356&type=vulnerabilities
December 14, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Trend Micro Inc.'s ServerProtect provides antivirus scanning with
centralized management of virus outbreaks, scanning, patter file
updates, notifications and remote installations. More information about
the product set is available at:

 www.trendmicro.com/en/products/file-server/sp/evaluate/overview.htm

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in Trend Micro
Inc.'s ServerProtect EarthAgent daemon allow attackers to cause the
target process to consume 100% of available CPU resources.

The problem specifically exists within ServerProtect EarthAgent in the
handling of maliciously crafted packets transmitted with the magic value
"\x21\x43\x65\x87" targeting TCP port 5005. A memory leak also occurs
with each received exploit packet allowing an attacker to exhaust all
available memory resources with repeated attack.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of the described vulnerability allows
unauthenticated remote attackers to consume 100% CPU resources,
increasingly consume memory resources and potentially crash the
underlying operating system. Full CPU utilization can be achieved with a
single packet, memory consumption occurs incrementally on subsequent
attacks.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Trend
Micro ServerProtect for Windows Management Console 5.58 running with
Trend Micro Control Manager 2.5/3.0 and Trend Micro Damage Cleanup
Server 1.1. It is suspected that earlier versions and versions for other
platforms are vulnerable as well.

V. WORKAROUND

Employ firewalls, access control lists or other TCP/UDP restriction
mechanisms to limit access to vulnerable systems on TCP port 5005.
