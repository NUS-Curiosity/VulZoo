I would think this is related to "Options MultiViews", where a file 
generally has many suffixes (file type, language, compression, ...). 
Does this also happen to you (yes, I'm too lazy to try right now) if you 
turn MultiViews off?

Nevertheless, good idea that script authors should possibly be aware 
that any suffix, not just the last, is interpreted.
