Source: Hewlett-Packard Company,

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with
HP Systems Insight Manger (SIM) for HP-UX.
This potential vulnerability may prevent users from logging into
HP SIM using Microsoft Internet Explorer after the Microsoft
security update MS04-025 for Internet Explorer is installed.

References: Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-025

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.

BACKGROUND

The Microsoft MS04-025 security update for Internet Explorer
changed the way that Internet Explorer treats scripting and binary
objects.  Attempts to log onto HP Systems Insight Manager with the
updated Internet Explorer will result in the apparent "hang" of
the browser prior to the login prompt for credentials.

To determine if an HP-UX system has an affected version,

for one of the filesets listed below. For affected systems
verify that the recommended action has been taken.
