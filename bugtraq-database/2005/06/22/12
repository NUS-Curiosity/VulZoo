Synopsis
========

Cacti is vulnerable to several SQL injection and file inclusion
vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

Cacti is a complete web-based frontend to rrdtool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/cacti      < 0.8.6e                        >= 0.8.6e

Description
===========

Cacti fails to properly sanitize input which can lead to SQL injection
as well as PHP file inclusion.

Impact
======

An attacker could potentially exploit the file inclusion to execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the web server. An attacker
could exploit the SQL injection to gain information from the database.
Only systems with register_globals set to "On" are vulnerable to the
file inclusion bugs. Gentoo Linux ships with register_globals set to
"Off" by default.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.6e"

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
