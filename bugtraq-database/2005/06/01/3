Author: Trash-80 - dpangalos@...e-h.org

Vendor: http://www.nextweb.gr & http://www.isite.gr



Description

***********

Zone-H Security Team has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in (i)Site website management system. An expensive web application with high-profiled customers. Unsafe directories, SQL injection vulnerabilities, failures to validate user inputs and to handle exceptional conditions were found in (i)Site.


Details

******* 


1. SQL injection in login.asp

You are able to bypass the authentication process by sending a crafted
username and password that changes the SQL query in login.asp and thus
grants you with access to the administration of (i)Site.


e.g. www.victim.com/admin/login.asp
usename: attacker
password: ' or 'a'='a


2. Databases are not located in a safe directory. Remote scanners used for malicious intends are checking for unsafe database directories. Locating the databases out of the webroot is a good solution. Thus, downloading Users.mdb file discloses me the administrator's username and password.


e.g www.victim.com/databases/Users.mdb


3. Failure to handle exceptional conditions and validating user inputs. The following will cause an error 500 for a few minutes.


e.g. www.victim.com/isite/page/*.asp?mu=&cmu='


Solution:

*********
