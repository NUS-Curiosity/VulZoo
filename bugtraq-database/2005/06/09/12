Synopsis
========

libextractor is affected by several overflow vulnerabilities in the
PDF, Real and PNG extractors, making it vulnerable to execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libextractor is a library used to extract meta-data from files. It
makes use of Xpdf code to extract information from PDF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libextractor       < 0.5.0                    >= 0.5.0

Description
===========

Xpdf is vulnerable to multiple overflows, as described in GLSA
200501-28. Also, integer overflows were discovered in Real and PNG
extractors.

Impact
======

An attacker could design malicious PDF, PNG or Real files which, when
processed by an application making use of libextractor, would result in
the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libextractor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libextractor-0.5.0"
