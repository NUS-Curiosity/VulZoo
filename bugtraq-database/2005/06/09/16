Subject: drone armies C&C report - May/2005


Below is a periodic public report from the drone armies / botnets
research and mitigation mailing list.
For this report it should be noted that we base our analysis on the data
we have accumulated from various sources.

According to our incomplete analysis of information we have thus far, we
now publish our regular two reports.


This month we would especially like to commend Staminus, who contacted 
us and have since made incredible efforts to deal with the threat. Also, 
we'd like to mention Internap for their continuous efforts.


The ISP's that are most often plagued with botnet C&C's (command &
control) are, by the order listed:
