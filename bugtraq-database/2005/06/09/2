Subject: Re: Re: IpSwitch IMAP Server LOGON stack overflow

Hello dave, thanks for the reply. Feels good to have an established name in the security field
comment on my exploit as artwork :)

I did consider going after the STATUS overflow. This is the one you were talking about right? The
only downside is you need legit credentials for the mailserver first. While It's not too difficult
to brute force one, It just seemed easier to start on the LOGON one. As far as exploit writing
difficulty level, STATUS would have indeed been easier :>
