Subject: Re: Advisory 02/2005: Remote code execution in Serendipity


"[2] that leads to remote code execution. Unfortunately, this vulner-
   ability also exists in the PEAR XMLRPC implementation, and GulfTech 
somewhat
   neglected to notify the vendors in question."

This is a very unfair statement as I did my best to hunt down everyone 
using the vulnerable libraries. Both the PEAR guys and the PHPXMLRPC 
guys were contacted several days ago, and I also took the time to 
personally  contact everyone I could find using the vulnerable XMLRPC 
libraries. I think it would be impossible for anyone to hunt down every 
application using these libraries.

In regards to the vulnerabilities: No technical details will be released 
by GulfTech until both libraries are updated because the holes are 
identical and it would cause more harm than good. Anyone using either 
vulnerable library should visit the official website pertaining to the 
library and download any updated version. Again, technical details of 
the vulnerabilities in these two libraries will be released in the future.
