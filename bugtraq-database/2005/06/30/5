Two excellent resources for securing Oracle databases includes the
Center for Internet Security benchmark (www.cisecurity.org) and the
"Securing Oracle: Step-by-Step" book at the SANS School Store
(https://store.sans.org/store_item.php?item=80).

Also, the SANS Institute recently started offering a 6-day class on
Securing Oracle database written by Oracle security expert Pete
Finnigan.  More information is available at
http://www.sans.org/washington2005/description.php?tid=168.

I've also been very happy with "Oracle Security Handbook" by Theriault
and Newman (although a bit dated now) and "Effective Oracle Database 10g
Security by Design" by Knox (both published by Oracle Press).

NB: I work for the SANS Institute, and I am an instructor for the
Securing Oracle class.
