Subject: RE: Publishing exploit code - what is it good for


This argument has gone on for decades at least; you hear very similar things
from the feds about homeland security as well, to pick one of the more prominent
other sources.

We are engaged, when trying to defend systems, in a design contest with attackers,
trying to keep our fortresses from being breached.

While it is temporarily embarrassing and more dangerous that someone publishes
the exact defect that allows the enemy's artillery to penetrate our armor,
I must point out that when trying to design better armor, that design is driven
by knowing precisely what characteristics attacks have. This information is most
honest, when discussing code, when working code can be examined.

If you stop your analysis at the point when you consider the greater ease of more
attackers to duplicate successful attacks, it may appear revealing the attacks
is a problem. (This is even easier if the fact that those attackers have been
much better at sharing such information clandestinely than most defenders have been
with defensive information.)

If you continue to the (necessary) creation of new defenses, though, it is clear that
the defenses cannot be designed without knowing the attacks, and starting from real
attacks and having the designer do his own abstraction is arguably a less error
prone process than having some other "experts" try to produce a summary of a method,
which may leave out precisely the details needed to show the correct broader pattern.

The above is itself pretty abstract, just like the questions asked. It might
be fair to ask the person who advocates keeping attacks secret, though, how many
new defenses he / she has designed. Maybe the world will get some new designers...

Hi Aviram,

  There are two main problems with your analyst friend's position. The 
first is that he has no business deciding for me or anyone else as to 
whether or not my needs are legitimate. I get to decide if I need/want 
something (like exploit code) or not, his arrogance notwithstanding.

 The second point is that he, like most software vendors, have to yet to
figure out that their products are consumer products and should be treated
just like automobiles and toys. Consumer product testing is very public.
Software is the same. We all want to know *exactly* how the product fails,
just like any other consumer product, no exceptions.

 It is no longer about "full disclosure", it's about being just like 
everyone else. There is no difference between how my software gets 
exploited and how my child safety seat fails.

                 cheers, bob
