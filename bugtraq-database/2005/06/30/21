Subject: Re: Publishing exploit code - what is it good for


Here is my quick $0.02:

In a lot of environments (including the one that I work on/in) we make 
our own modifications to software to get them to work in such a way that 
is more beneficial to our organization. Because we make modifications to 
the way software works we don't always know if the software we are using 
is actually vulnerable to exploits based upon version number. In some 
cases we have actually fixed a security problem without realizing it 
before any known vuln was released. It's also possible to open up older 
problems through patching and coding. Having exploit code available is a 
huge plus as it lets us test our software. Without it we wouldn't know 
(as quickly) if our in house version of XYZ is exploitable to the newest 
vuln release.

In a nutshell, exploit code allows people to easily find out if they are 
vulnerable to a specific problem without spending lots of time looking 
into it. After all, I'd rather exploit my own code and fix it as opposed 
to having someone else do it while I try to scramble to figure it out.
