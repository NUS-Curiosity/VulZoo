Subject: Re: Publishing exploit code - what is it good for



Hi Aviram,

  There are two main problems with your analyst friend's position. The 
first is that he has no business deciding for me or anyone else as to 
whether or not my needs are legitimate. I get to decide if I need/want 
something (like exploit code) or not, his arrogance notwithstanding.

 The second point is that he, like most software vendors, have to yet to
figure out that their products are consumer products and should be treated
just like automobiles and toys. Consumer product testing is very public.
Software is the same. We all want to know *exactly* how the product fails,
just like any other consumer product, no exceptions.

 It is no longer about "full disclosure", it's about being just like 
everyone else. There is no difference between how my software gets 
exploited and how my child safety seat fails.

                 cheers, bob
