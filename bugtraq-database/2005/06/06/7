Synopsis
========

Wordpress contains SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based content management and publishing
system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress      < 1.5.1.2                      >= 1.5.1.2

Description
===========

Due to a lack of input validation, WordPress is vulnerable to SQL
injection and XSS attacks.

Impact
======

An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerabilites to gain
information from the database. Furthermore the cross-site scripting
issues give an attacker the ability to inject and execute malicious
script code or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials,
potentially compromising the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wordpress users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-1.5.1.2"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
