Subject: SquirrelMail "vendor" notification feeler


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi Guys,

This is a general feeler email. Due to the popularity of SquirrelMail,
and the fact it is packaged with quite a few distributions, the
SquirrelMail administration team are looking to setup a "vendor"
notification list to work in conjunction with vendors, and major users
(ISPs, large corporations etc) on releases of updates, and security
issues, to ensure, or help reduce, the possible impact of security
issues.

Would vendors/large users/corporations find this useful? If so, please
contact myself off-list, and I shall gauge the feasibility, and
usefulness of such a list. This list will work something similar to
vendor-sec and have a limited subscription list, and will most likely
be very quiet.
