Subject: Re: [NGSEC] AntiPharming v1.00 FREE


This technology can be thwarted by any malware that has access to the 
Layered Service Provider using the service provider interface. That and 
client side malware will also target the anti-pharming tool to modify or 
break the program. What happens if the target can not reach the "3 
secure" dns servers? Do we successfully DoS the user?

Thoughts?
