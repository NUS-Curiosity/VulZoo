Subject: Re: File Upload Manager Sploits


after some digging on google, I've found that this refers to the "File
Upload Manager" at
http://www.mtnpeak.net/webdev/index.php?pg=php
rather than any number of other File Upload Managers. It's a common
name, please include a url or at least vendor name in future.
