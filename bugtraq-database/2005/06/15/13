Beware that 0.0.0.1 is also adressable, as the whole /8 has been
issued for the same thing :-)


If you wish to use a very complete list of "unlikely" IPv4 adresses, 
you're looking for the bogons list at http://www.cymru.com/Bogons/.

A short list on "special" IPv4 adresses can be found in RFC 3330; 
so you might also wish to add

0.0.0.0/8 (RFC1700)
127.0.0.0/8 (loopback, RFC1700)
169.254.0.0/16 (LINKLOCAL)
192.0.2.0/24 (NET-TEST, "for documentation only")
198.18.0.0/15 (network device testing, see RFC 2544)

... and possibly more or less the complete RFC1918-space (10.0.0.0/8,
172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), too.


For IPv6, at least

0000::/8 (loopback)
FE00::/9 and FF00::/8 (multicast, see RFC3513)
2001:DB8::/32 ("documentation-only", RFC3849)

are quite clear to reject.
