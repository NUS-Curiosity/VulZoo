Synopsis
========

Executable files with insecure permissions can be modified causing an
unsuspecting user to run arbitrary code.

Background
==========

SilverCity provides lexical analysis for over 20 programming and markup
languages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/silvercity     < 0.9.5-r1                    >= 0.9.5-r1

Description
===========

The SilverCity package installs three executable files with insecure
permissions.

Impact
======

A local attacker could modify the executable files, causing arbitrary
code to be executed with the permissions of an unsuspecting SilverCity
user.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SilverCity users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/silvercity-0.9.5-r1"
