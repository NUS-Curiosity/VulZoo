                          CALL FOR PAPERS
                              for the
13TH ANNUAL NETWORK AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM SECURITY SYMPOSIUM (NDSS'06)

February 1st, 2006 - Pre-Conference Workshop
February 2-3, 2006 - Symposium
Catamaran Resort Hotel, San Diego, California

IMPORTANT DATES
     * Paper and panel submissions due: 11:59pm PDT, Monday, August 22,
       2005. (This deadline is firm--no extensions will be granted except
       in the most extreme circumstances.)
     * Author notification: Friday, October 7th, 2005.
     * Final version of papers and panels due: Sunday, November 6, 2005.

GOAL:
     The symposium fosters information exchange among research scientists
     and practitioners of network and distributed system security
     services. The target audience includes those interested in practical
     aspects of network and distributed system security, with a focus on
     actual system design and implementation (rather than theory). A
     major goal is to encourage and enable the Internet community to
     apply, deploy, and advance the state of available security
     technology. The proceedings are published by the Internet Society.

HOW TO SUBMIT:
     Submission instructions will be available at
          http://www.cs.umd.edu/NDSS-06 .

SUBMISSIONS:
     Both technical papers and panel proposals are solicited. Technical
     papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
     published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
     conference with proceedings. All papers from authors perpetrating
     such "double submissions" will be immediately rejected from the
     conference. The Program Committee reserves the right to share
     information with other conference chairs and journal editors so as
     to detect such cases.

     Technical papers should be at most 12 pages excluding the
     bibliography and well-marked appendices (using 11-point font,
     single column format, and reasonable margins on 8.5"x11" or A4
     paper), and at most 20 pages total. Committee members are not
     required to read the appendices, so the paper should be
     intelligible without them. Technical papers will appear in the
     proceedings. Panel proposals should be one page and must describe
     the topic, identify the panel chair, explain the panel format, and
     list three to four potential panelists. A description of each
     panel will appear in the proceedings, and may, at the discretion
     of the panel chair, include written position statements from the
     panelists.

     Submissions are solicited in, but not limited to, the following
     areas:

     * Integrating security in Internet protocols: routing, naming,
       TCP/IP, multicast, network management, and the Web.
     * Intrusion prevention, detection, and response: systems,
       experiences and architectures.
     * Privacy and anonymity technologies.
     * Network perimeter controls: firewalls, packet filters, application
       gateways.
     * Virtual private networks.
     * Security for emerging technologies: sensor networks, specialized
       testbeds, wireless/mobile (and ad hoc) networks, personal
       communication systems, RFID systems, peer-to-peer and overlay
       network systems.
     * Secure electronic commerce: e.g., payment, barter, EDI,
       notarization, timestamping, endorsement, and licensing.
     * Supporting security mechanisms and APIs; audit trails;
       accountability.
     * Implementation, deployment and management of network security
       policies.
     * Intellectual property protection: protocols, implementations,
       metering, watermarking, digital rights management.
     * Fundamental services on network and distributed systems:
       authentication, data integrity, confidentiality, authorization,
       non-repudiation, and availability.
     * Integrating security services with system and application security
       facilities and protocols: e.g., message handling, file
       transport/access, directories, time synchronization, data base
       management, boot services, mobile computing.
     * Public key infrastructure, key management, certification, and
       revocation.
     * Special problems and case studies: e.g., tradeoffs between
       security and efficiency, usability, reliability and cost.
     * Security for collaborative applications: teleconferencing and
       video-conferencing, electronic voting, groupwork, etc.
     * Software hardening: e.g., detecting and defending against
       software bugs (overflows, etc.)
     * Security for large-scale systems and critical infrastructures.

     Each submission must be accompanied by a separate, electronically
     submitted Submission Overview specifying the submission type (paper
     or panel), the title or topic, author names with organizational
     affiliations, and must specify a contact author along with
     corresponding phone number, FAX number, postal address and email
     address.

     Submissions must be received by 11:59pm PDT, August 22rd, 2005, and
     must be made electronically in PDF format (for example, by using
     pdflatex). Each submission will be acknowledged by e-mail; if
     acknowledgment is not received within seven days, contact a program
     co-chair (see below). Authors and panelists will be notified of
     acceptance by October 7th, 2005, and given instructions for
     preparing the camera-ready copy. The camera-ready copy must be
     received by November 5th, 2005.
