Subject: singapore v0.9.11 cross site scripting and path disclosure


Because of singapores heavy use of classes it has multiple path disclosure occurences. The following pages all produced class related errors when navigating directly to them in your browser.

gallery/includes/admin.class.php
templates/admin_default/ all the .tpl.php files
templates/default/ all the the .tpl.php files

Also the gallery $_GET parameter on www.site.com/index.php is not properly checked leading to cross site scripting.  We used http://www.site.com/index.php?gallery=%3Cimg%20onmouseover=%22alert('hi')%22%20style=%22position:%20absolute;%20top:0px;%20left:%200px;%20width:%201000%;%20height:%201000%;%22%3E
and other similar scripts to produce the xss.
