Package:             cvs
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= cvs-1.12.11-20050408   >= cvs-1.12.11-20050504
OpenPKG 2.3          <= cvs-1.12.9-2.3.0       >= cvs-1.12.9-2.3.1
OpenPKG 2.2          <= cvs-1.12.9-2.2.0       >= cvs-1.12.9-2.2.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a Debian bug report [0], a Denial of Service (DoS)
  vulnerability exists in the embedded ZLib [1] compression logic of
  the Concurrent Versions Systems (CVS). The problem involves incorrect
  error handling in the inflate() and inflateBack() functions. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  identifier CAN-2004-0797 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q cvs". If you have the "cvs" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.3, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.3/UPD
  ftp> get cvs-1.12.9-2.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig cvs-1.12.9-2.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild cvs-1.12.9-2.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/cvs-1.12.9-2.3.1.*.rpm
