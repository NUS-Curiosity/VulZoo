Subject: [DRUPAL-SA-2005-001] New Drupal release fixes
	critical security issue

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drupal security advisory                                  DRUPAL-SA-2005-001
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advisory ID:    DRUPAL-SA-2005-001
Date:           2005-jun-01
Security risk:  highly critical
Impact:         system access
Where:          from remote
Vulnerability:  privilege escalation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------
The Drupal Security Team has found that the privilege system of Drupal can 
be circumvented in a very special case because an input check is not 
implemented properly.

Versions affected
-----------------
Drupal 4.4.0, 4.4.1, 4.4.2
Drupal 4.5.0, 4.5.1, 4.5.2
Drupal 4.6.0

Impact
------
If public registration is allowed then it is possible for an attacker
to obtain additional user roles. As a result, an attacker could grant 
himself administration privileges.

Solution
--------
Either upgrade or disable public registration:  
- If you are running Drupal 4.4.x, then upgrade to Drupal 4.4.3.
- If you are running Drupal 4.5.2, then upgrade to Drupal 4.5.3.
- If you are running Drupal 4.6.0, then upgrade to Drupal 4.6.1.
- If you cannot upgrade immediately, you can secure your site by 
  disabling the public registration of Drupal accounts from Drupal's user
  administration screen. Log-in as an administrator, go to "administer >> 
  users >> configure" and set the "Public registrations" option to "Only 
  site administrators can create new user accounts".
