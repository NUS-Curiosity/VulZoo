While this is definitely so, in the real world we do not always have
complete control over who has physical access to our devices.  We may,
for example, have co-located devices in a facility managed by some
other entity.

Some PC manufacturers have a jumper on the motherboard which can be
used to reset BIOS passwords/defaults, which requires that the machine
be taken out of service in order to be reset (or tampered with).  I
think this is a much better model for device recovery than a default
password on a console login...  We are probably a lot more likely to
notice our firewall being taken out of service than we are to notice
someone tampering with the console...
