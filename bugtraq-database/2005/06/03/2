I fail to see how this is a "backdoor".

This is how one would reset their master password on the device.

Physical access always trumps all other forms of security.

Cisco routers can have their password reset if you gain physical access to them as well.

And (if nothing else), this method is not new, and is well documented by Fortigate.
