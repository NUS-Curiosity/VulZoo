Remote Buffer overflow in WebSphere Application Server Administrative
Console

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory WEBSP05-V0098
http://www.appsecinc.com/resources/alerts/general/WEBSPHERE-001.html
June 07, 2005

Risk level: HIGH

Credits: This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban
Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.

Affected Versions:
IBM WebSphere Application Server 5.0

Background:
The Administrative Console is a web-based tool used to manage the IBM
WebSphere Application Server administrative server. The Administrative
Console supports a full range of product administrative activities.

Details:
There is a Unicode buffer overflow in the WebSphere Application Server
Administrative Console. The security vulnerability exists in the
authentication mechanism. The authentication process takes place only
when the 'global security option' is enabled in the server. The
vulnerability can not be exploited if the security option is disabled.
The default TCP ports where this vulnerability can be exploited
include 9080 (HTTP), 9090 (HTTP) and 9043 (HTTPS).

Impact:
Unauthenticated attackers may execute arbitrary code in the context of
the server process.

Workaround:
There is no workaround. The attack surface can be reduced by denying
access to untrusted users on TCP ports 9080, 9090 and 9043.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
Apply the WebSphere Application Server 5.0.2 Cumulative Fix 11. The
patch can be found here:
