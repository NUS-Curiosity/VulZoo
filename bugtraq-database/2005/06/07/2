Subject: remote command execution in 'tattle'


Hello, a recent bugtraq posting by CISSP C.J. Steele contains a vulnerability which will leave
a box possibly open for remote command execution.  There are many ways to exploit this, but I
chose logging in through ftp with username like

sshd rhost 9 10 11 |rm${IFS}-rf${IFS}/|echo'1.1.1.1'

because of poor input validation and improper use of system calls in tattle this will execute
the rm -rf / and echo'1.1.1.1' commands.  I would assume that in many cases tattle would be
running as root.  The problem is in the getemails subroutine on the line my $whois =
`/usr/bin/whois $tld`;

Author not notified.  I believe he reads this list.
Suggested workaround.  Disable tattle until patch.
