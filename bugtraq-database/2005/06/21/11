Synopsis
========

A flaw in Tor may allow the disclosure of arbitrary memory portions.

Background
==========

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/tor     < 0.0.9.10                           >= 0.0.9.10

Description
===========

A bug in Tor allows attackers to view arbitrary memory contents from an
exit server's process space.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the memory disclosure to gain sensitive
information and possibly even private keys.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.0.9.10"
