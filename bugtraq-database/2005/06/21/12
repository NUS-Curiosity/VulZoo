Synopsis
========

Squirrelmail is vulnerable to several cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities which could lead to a compromise of webmail accounts.

Background
==========

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP and
SMTP protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/squirrelmail       < 1.4.4                   >= 1.4.4
                                                               < 1.4.0

Description
===========

SquirrelMail is vulnerable to several cross-site scripting issues, most
reported by Martijn Brinkers.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to read a specially-crafted e-mail or using a
manipulated URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts running in
the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to a compromise of
the user's webmail account, cookie theft, etc.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.4"

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
