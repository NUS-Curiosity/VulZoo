Hello,

NGSEC is proud to announce the new release of our new product 
AntiPharming v1.00 [1] TOTALLY FREE for non-commercial use.

What is Pharming?

"(...)Pharming is the exploitation of a vulnerability in the DNS 
server software that allows a hacker to acquire the Domain Name 
for a site, and to redirect traffic to that web site to another 
web site. DNS servers are the machines responsible for resolving 
internet names into their real addresses - the "signposts" of the 
internet.

If the web site receiving the traffic is a fake web site, such 
as a copy of a bank's website, it can be used to "phish" or steal 
a computer user's passwords, PIN number or account number.

AntiPharming Configuration For example, in January, 2005, the Domain 
Name for a large New York ISP, Panix, was hijacked to a site in 
Australia. In 2004 a German teenager hijacked the eBay.de Domain Name. 
Secure e-mail provider Hushmail was also caught by this attack on 
24th of April 2005 when the attacker rang up the domain registrar 
and gained enough information to redirect users to a defaced 
webpage(...)" (Source WikiPedia).

What is AntiPharming?

AntiPharming uses active and passive protections for identifying and 
stopping Pharming (Phising variant) attacks.

AntiPharming will actively protect your windows server from pharming 
attacks by:

    * Denying any user (even Administrator) to write to the hosts file.
    * Denying any user (even Administrator) to change your DNS settings.

AntiPharming will passively protect your windows server from pharming 
attacks by sniffing on each netowrk interface for DNS replies (both 
TCP and UDP) and recheck them against at least with three secure DNS 
nameservers.

AntiPharming is TOTALLY FREE for non-commercial use.
