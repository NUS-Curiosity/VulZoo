Hi,

thank you everybody writng me mails. I got about 50 mails pointing to the 
official web site of the airport and the contact site. Well, of course I 
checked out all (!) the addresses listed on that site BEFORE posting to this 
list.

No reaction! Best result: "aeroportidiroma@....it" returns that the mailbox is 
full. So much for their IT dept ...

Thanks anyway.
