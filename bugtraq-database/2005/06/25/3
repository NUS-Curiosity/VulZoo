Subject: Re: Bluetooth SIG Denial of Service vulnerability


I just checked it out with my Nokia 6310i, firmware 5.51 (an old firmware, I know).

a) if the phone is not paired with the BT dongle I used, it asks for pairing

b) even though the screen shows "connecting" with the moving bar, I can use one of the blue buttons to cancel this screen a do something else. l2ping reports no losses why I can use the phone normally. (browsed through menu, read messages).


All in all, no harm done.
