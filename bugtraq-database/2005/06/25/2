Subject: Phishing - feature or flaw


Hi,

Regarding certain vulnerabilities that are being discovered such as 
http://secunia.com/multiple_browsers_dialog_origin_vulnerability_test

Are these really features, or are they flaws now because of the phishing 
threat vector. Originally javascript/DHTML/DOM is pretty powerful and 
can do a lot of nasty stuff if someone were inclined. But phishing has 
caused us to take a look at the once dubbed features of DHTML, and 
possibly put responsibility onto the browser vendors for fixing these 
now dubbed "flaws".

For example, is this a flaw - 
https://slam.securescience.com/threats/mixed.html (some mozilla browsers 
don't like Thawte yet so you will get a warning). This is a standard 
frame with the URL domain as https://slam.securescience.com, but the 
body is https://www.bankone.com - take a look at the lock icon - it will 
only verify the url domain - is that a browser issue, a CA issue, or a 
feature?

As we all have seen, one can use DHTML to create a popup and replace a 
mimicked address bar if one were so incline (dirty rendition at 
http://ip.securescience.net/exploits/ (popup blockers off and it was 
designed for IE). Feature, or flaw?
