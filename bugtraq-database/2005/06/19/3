Synopsis
========

PeerCast suffers from a format string vulnerability that could allow
arbitrary code execution.

Background
==========

PeerCast is a media streaming system based on P2P technology.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/peercast      < 0.1212                      >= 0.1212

Description
===========

James Bercegay of the GulfTech Security Research Team discovered that
PeerCast insecurely implements formatted printing when receiving a
request with a malformed URL.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request
with a specially crafted URL to a PeerCast server to execute arbitrary
code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PeerCast users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/peercast-0.1212"
