Page Hijack: The 302 Exploit, Redirects and Google

302 Exploit: How somebody else's page can appear instead of your page
in the search engines.
By Claus Schmidt.

Abstract:
An explanation of the page hijack exploit using 302 server redirects.
This exploit allows any webmaster to have his own "virtual pages" rank
for terms that pages belonging to another webmaster used to rank for.
Successfully employed, this technique will allow the offending
webmaster ("the hijacker") to displace the pages of the "target" in
the Search Engine Results Pages ("SERPS"), and hence (a) cause search
engine traffic to the target website to vanish, and/or (b) further
redirect traffic to any other page of choice.
