Hey BugTraq,

I just wanted to let you know we got some new content on-line as well as a reminder about upcoming registration deadlines. Hope to see you there!

REMINDER: Register before July 1st to take advantage of the earlier pricing!

Speakers are selected for the USA summer show, July 27th and 28th. The speaking selections were the most difficult this year due to a large number of excellent submissions. Unfortunately we only have so much space and time, so some tough decisions were made. Check it out:

Black Hat's Training line up for this summer is also the largest ever.
