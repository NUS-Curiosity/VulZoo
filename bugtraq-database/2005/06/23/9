Subject: Vulnerability Statements


Hi All,

Wanted to quickly apologise for being not quite on top of things in terms of 
releasing my vulnerability statements over the last 4 weeks.

In case you have not upgraded your iTunes, would recommend doing so - 
http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301596  (File format over 
flow)

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-025.mspx - Remote 
Format String Vulnerability

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-028.mspx - Remote 
Stack Overflow

I will update our web site accordingly with the advisories.

All the best

Mark Litchfield

(If anyone would like to meet up for a few beers at Blackhat Vegas please 
send me an email :)
