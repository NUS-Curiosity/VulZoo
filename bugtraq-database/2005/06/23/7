Subject: Remote Unauthenticated Heap Overflow VERITAS Backup Exec Server for Windows


Mark Litchfield of NGSSoftware has discovered a high risk vulnerability in 
the
Veritas Backup Exec Server for Windows which can allow remote code 
execution.

Affected Products include -
Backup Exec 10.0 for Windows Servers rev. 5484
Backup Exec 9.1 for Windows Servers rev. 4691
Backup Exec 9.0 for Windows Servers rev. 4454
Backup Exec 9.0 for Windows Servers rev. 4367

A Patch can be obtained from -

Please note that the documentation provided by this link is partially 
incorrect
and I believe it will be updated very shortly.

** Email Extract

In 9.x, the Admin Plus Pack has to be installed in order for the
vulnerability to exist.  You are correct in 10.x it is vulnerable whether
the Admin Pack is installed or not.

So the workaround to disable the Admin Pack Option is only valid for a 9.x
installation.   On 10.0, applying the patch is required

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details of this flaw for three months.
Full details will be published on the 23rd of September 2005. This three 
month
window will allow users of Veritas Backup Exec Server the time needed to 
apply the patch
before the details are released to the general public. This reflects
NGSSoftware's approach to responsible disclosure.
