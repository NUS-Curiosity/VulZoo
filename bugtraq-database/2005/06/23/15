High (Code Execution)

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in RealPlayer. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to reliably overwrite heap memory with arbitrary data and execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who executed the player.

This specific flaw exists within the vidplin.dll file used by RealPlayer. By specially crafting a malformed .avi movie file, a direct heap overwrite is triggered, and reliable code execution is then possible.  This vulnerability can be trigger when a user views a webpage, or opens an .avi file via email, instant messenger, or other common file transfer programs.

Technical Details:
When processing AVI files RealPlayer calls upon a specific DLL, vidplin.dll, where the vulnerability lies.  Realplayer relies
on a strf structure value and allocates a fixed memory space of 0x428 that can be overflowed with values greater than the fixed buffer size causing arbitrary code to be executed.

Protection:
Retina - Network Security Scanner - has been updated to identify this vulnerability.
Blink - End-point Vulnerability Prevention - protects from this vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability.
