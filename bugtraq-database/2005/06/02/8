Subject: CastleCops phpBB bbcode Input Validation Disclosure


*CASTLECOPS.COM SUMMARY

bbcode input validation

Severity: High
CastleCops: http://castlecops.com/t123194-.html
CVE: CAN-2005-1193
phpBB Security ID#: 266
Bugtraq ID#: 13545
Secunia #: 15298
US-CERT VU#: 113196
SecurityTracker #: 1013918

Vulnerable: viewtopic.php, privmsg.php for phpBB 2.0.14 (possible all
lower versions too), and other files that rely on bbcode.php

Fix: Upgrade to 2.0.15


*INTRODUCTION

phpBB is a popular bulletin board system based on PHP. There is a lack of
filtering for the BBCODE URL. Initially discovered: encapsulating a
specially crafted URL, a user caught clicking on the resulting hyperlinks
can have their registry entries modified without their knowledge [huge
hazard!], among other things. Originally successfully tested with
"javascript://", but subsequent discovery showed that "applet://",
"about://", "activex://", "chrome://", and "script://" may be able to get
thru as well with the URL enclosure or not (of course, browser dependant).

It is recommended that these types of URIs not be allowed to render at all
in the phpBB system as the possible user computer hijacking can be
gargantuan. There is enough hijacking in spyware products (ref:
http://castlecops.com/f67-Hijackthis_Spyware_Viruses_Worms_Trojans_Oh_My.html
).


*PROOF OF CONCEPT

This POC uses the URL encapsulation:

[url=javascript://%0ASh=alert(%22CouCou%22);window.close();]Alert box with "CouCou"[/url]

[url=javascript://%0ASh=new%20ActiveXObject(%22WScript.shell%22);Sh.regwrite(%22HKCU%5C%5CQQQQQ%5C%5Cqq%22,%22CouCou%22);window.close();]Create registry entry: HKCU\QQQQQ\qq = "CouCou"[/url]

[url=javascript://%0Awindow.opener.document.body.innerHTML=window.opener.document.body.innerHTML.replace(%27Hi%20Paul%27,%27Hi%20P.A.U.L%27);window.close();]Modify opener page: Paul -> P.A.U.L[/url]


If you click on the second link, be sure to find and remove the "QQQQQ"
entry in your Windows Registry. However, we recommend you do not click
expect for developer testing and patching.


*FIX

The CastleCops suggested patch was integrated into bbcode.php. That
suggested patch is within the includes/bbcode.php file,
bbencode_second_pass function, after the global line (and a second
location):

+ $text = preg_replace('#(script|about|applet|activex|chrome):#is',"\\1&#058;",$text);

This particular patch replaces the colon with its decimal equivalent and
will bypass hyperlink creation on viewing a topic or a private message.
Both the POC and patch have been tested on some sites with success.

This patch has been included in the phpbb 2.0.15 release.  Please be sure
to read the release in its entirety for the precise update:

*COMMENTARY

Possible alternative patches? 

Modsecurity adds a nice layer of security in filtering requests to a
website. However, the links above in the POC clearly show the web server
may not process them as they are client side driven.  Modsecurity would
not help in the examples above.

Whitelisting is another method, however it was decided to utilize the
blacklist above by phpbb.


*WEB BROWSERS USED

Basic tests were done using Firefox and Internet Explorer.  Your own 
mileage may vary.
