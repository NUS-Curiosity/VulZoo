  Fascinating.  This appears to be a *very* precisely-targeted request:
according to google, there are only three websites on the entire web that
use the software you're trying to exploit.

  As if by an astonishing coincidence, they're all zionist-related sites, so
I suppose must be considered politically controversial.

  And you did make a post to the hackresi list back at the start of May
claiming to be an Israeli libertarian-communist with anarcho-Kropotkinist
leanings and wanting to make contact with other hacktivists.

  Are you planning a skiddie-style defacement spree?  Can we all watch as
you get busted because you've left your fingerprints all over it before you
even get started?

    cheers,
