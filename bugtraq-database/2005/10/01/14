Subject: Security Advisory for Bugzilla 2.18.3, 2.20rc2, and 2.21


Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers two security bugs that have recently been
discovered and fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ config.cgi exposes information to users who aren't logged in, even
  when "requirelogin" is turned on in Bugzilla.

+ It is possible to bypass the "user visibility groups" restrictions
  if user-matching is turned on in "substring" mode. 

All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.20.

Development snapshots of 2.21 before 2.21.1 are also vulnerable. If you are
using a development snapshot, you should upgrade to 2.21.1, use CVS to update,
or apply the patches from the specific bugs listed below.

None of these vulnerabilities affect the old Bugzilla 2.16 branch.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
-------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.18rc1 - 2.18.3, 2.19 - 2.20rc2, 2.21
Description: config.cgi gives JavaScript and RDF information about Bugzilla
             to third-party clients, including a list of products in the
             Bugzilla installation. The "requirelogin" parameter requires
             that all people be logged into Bugzilla before seeing any data,
             as a security measure.
             In affected versions, config.cgi is always accessible, and 
             always contains information to non-logged-in users, even when 
             "requirelogin" is turned on, possibly exposing product names 
             that administrators expected to be confidential.

Issue 2
-------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.19.1 - 2.20rc2, 2.21
Description: Bugzilla contains features to prevent users from "seeing" other 
             users, enabled by the "usevisibilitygroups" parameter. Bugzilla
             also contains a feature called "user matching," which enables
             users to type in part of a username and get back a list of
             possible matches.
             If user matching is turned on and is in "substring" mode,
             all matching users will be returned to a query, regardless
             of the visibility groups settings, exposing users who should
             be invisible.
