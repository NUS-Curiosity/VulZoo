Subject: Different Claims by ZoneLabs on the "Bypassing
	PersonalFirewall (Zone Alarm Pro) Using DDE-IPC" issue


Note: 
This respose is especially towards Zone Labs Advisory on "Bypassing
PersonalFirewall (Zone Alarm Pro) Using DDE-IPC" issue. 


Hi,
In your advisory
(http://download.zonelabs.com/bin/free/securityAlert/35.html) regarding this
issue, you have mentioned that only the Free Version of ZA is vulnerable and
ZA Pro is in the un-affected list. Without downplaying your advisory on this
issue, I want to confirm that I have tested this for ZA Pro 3.7.159 and
found vulnerable. Although the current version (6.0) is not vulnerable. 

IMHO It will be a big mistake to conscider all versions of Zone Alarm Pro is
un-affected. ZoneLabs advisory on this is only valid for the current version
(6.0) of ZA Pro which I have tested and found it to be unaffected. 

There are many who uses previous versions of ZA Pro (3x, 4x, 5x) and the
Zone Labs advisory seems to be covering the issue by saying that ZA Pro is
un-affected (**subjective statement**). I am not making any accusition, it
might be a mistake but defenitely needs to be addressed in the advisory. I
can keep silent on this issue and so as you but then it is very important
that the users of previous version must know that they are prone to such
attacks. 

Besides this, I just came across the news @ news.com where as per the news
Zone Labs have given a different statement - 
http://news.com.com/Malicious+code+could+trick+ZoneAlarm+firewall/2100-1002_
3-5886488.html

<news @ news.com>
The issue affects the popular free ZoneAlarm firewall and default
installations of version 5.5 and earlier of the paid product, maker Zone
Labs said in a security advisory on Thursday. Default installations of the
Check Point Integrity Client are also affected, but the paid ZoneAlarm 6.0
products, released in July, are not, Zone Labs said.

Well, the statement given to news.com by Zone Labs seems to be contradicting
your own advisory. As per the statement to news.com -> 
The affected versions are : 
free ZoneAlarm firewall and 
default installations of version 5.5 and 
earlier of the paid product
Default installations of the Check Point Integrity Client are also affected

This statement contradicts the advisory released by you....I can see a huge
gap between the statement and advisory....


Request you to clarify and update the advisory if there is a mistake. Incase
you require more info from me then feel free to mail. 


Thanks & Regds...

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Zone Labs response to "Bypassing PersonalFirewall
(Zone Alarm Pro) Using DDE-IPC"

Zone Labs response to "Bypassing Personal Firewall (Zone Alarm Pro) Using
DDE-IPC"

Overview: 

Debasis Mohanty published a notice about a potential security issue with
personal firewalls to several security email lists on 
September 28th, 2005.   Zone Labs has investigated his claims 
and has determined that current versions of Zone Labs and Check Point
end-point security products are not vulnerable.


Description: 

The proof-of-concept code published uses the Windows API function
ShellExecute() to launch a trusted program that is used to access the
network on behalf of the untrusted program, thereby accessing the network
without warning from the firewall.


Impact: 

If successfully exploited, a malicious program may be able to 
access the network via a trusted program.   The ability to 
access the network would be limited to the functionality of the trusted
program.


Unaffected Products: 

ZoneAlarm Pro, ZoneAlarm AntiVirus, ZoneAlarm Wireless Security, 
and ZoneAlarm Security Suite version 6.0 or later automatically 
protect against this attack in the default configuration.

ZoneAlarm Pro, ZoneAlarm AntiVirus, ZoneAlarm Wireless Security, 
and ZoneAlarm Security Suite version 5.5 are protected against 
this attack by enabling the "Advanced Program Control" feature.

Check Point Integrity client versions 6.0 and 5.5 are protected 
against this attack by enabling the "Advanced Program Control" feature. 


Affected Products:

ZoneAlarm free versions lack the "Advanced Program Control"
feature and are therefore unable to prevent this bypass technique.


Recommended Actions:

Subscribers should upgrade to the latest version of their 
ZoneAlarm product or enable the "Advanced Program Control" feature.
