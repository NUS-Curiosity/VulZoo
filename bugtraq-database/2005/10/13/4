Subject: honeypot and honeynet as IDS


Hi,

I am puzzled with this idea: Can we use Honeynet and Honeypot as IDS? One 
can definately use the output or the result of Honey net and honey pot and 
train IDS to watch out for the attacks, that were gathered in Honey net and 
pot. However, how can honey net be IDS?

Please help me with this topic. If anyone has good information or resource 
on this, please forward me the info. I would really appreciate it.

Any ideas, suggestions or comments are welcome.

Thank you everyone in advance,

Sincerely,

Krish
