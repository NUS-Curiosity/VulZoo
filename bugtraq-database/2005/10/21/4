3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in ZipGenius,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system. 

1) A boundary error exists in "zipgenius.exe", "zg.exe", "zgtips.dll",
and "contmenu.dll" when reading the filename of a compressed file
from a ZIP archive. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow when a malicious archive containing a file with an
overly long filename is read either in ZipGenius or from Windows
Explorer.

2) A boundary error exists in "zipgenius.exe" when handling the 
original name of a UUE/XXE/MIM encoded file. This can be exploited
to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when a malicious UUE/XXE/MIM 
archive containing an encoded file with an overly long filename is 
opened.

3) A boundary error exists in "unacev2.dll" when extracting an ACE 
archive containing a file with an overly long filename. This can be 
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when a malicious
ACE archive is extracted using "zipgenius.exe" or "zg.exe".

Vulnerability #3 is related to:
SA14359
