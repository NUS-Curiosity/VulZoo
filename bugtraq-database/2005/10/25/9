Synopsis
========

phpMyAdmin contains a local file inclusion vulnerability that may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code, along with several cross-site
scripting issues.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the web.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.6.4_p3                      >= 2.6.4_p3

Description
===========

Stefan Esser discovered that by calling certain PHP files directly, it
was possible to workaround the grab_globals.lib.php security model and
overwrite the $cfg configuration array. Systems running PHP in safe
mode are not affected. Futhermore, Tobias Klein reported several
cross-site-scripting issues resulting from insufficient user input
sanitizing.

Impact
======

A local attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious
requests, causing the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of
the user running the web server. Furthermore, the cross-site scripting
issues give a remote attacker the ability to inject and execute
malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround for all those issues at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.4_p3"
