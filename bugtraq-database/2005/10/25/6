Subject: Flat Nuke Cross Site Scripting


Web Site: 

Vulnerable: FlatNuke <= 2.5.6 

This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks

Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX,  into a vulnerable application to fool a user in order to gather data from them.

The script has been tested with these POST variables: 

op=login&nome=<script>alert('LOL');</script>&regpass=1&reregpass=1&anag=1&email=1&homep=http%3A%2F%2F&prof=1&prov=1&ava=1&url_avatar=1&firma=1
