	Setuid ppp prompt Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


SCO Unixware Setuid ppp prompt Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 10.24.05
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?type=vulnerabilities
October 24, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

SCO UnixWare is a UNIX operating system.

More information is available at:

  http://www.sco.com/products/unixware714/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ppp binary,

as included in multiple versions of The SCO Group Inc.'s Unixware, 
allows attackers to gain root privileges.

The vulnerability specifically exists because of a failure to check the 
length of user input. If the user running the ppp program enters an 
argument to the "prompt" or "defprompt" command that exceeds 256 bytes
in 
length, a stack based overflow occurs. This leads to the execution of 
arbitrary code with root privileges, as ppp is setuid root by default.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that user have 
local access to the system; it would allow the user to gain superuser 
privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in SCO 
Unixware versions 7.1.3 and 7.1.4. All versions of SCO Unixware are 
suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

As a workaround solution, remove the setuid bit from the backupsh binary

until a vendor patch can be applied.

  # chmod u-s /usr/bin/ppp 

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor has released the following advisory for this issue:
