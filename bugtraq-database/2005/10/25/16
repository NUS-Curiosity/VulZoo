Vendor description:
---------------

RSA Authentication Agent software intercepts access requests—whether
local or remote—from users or groups of users and directs them to the
RSA Authentication Manager program for authentication. Once verified,
permission to access protected resources is granted.

---------------

RSA Authentication Agent for Web 5.1 is prone to a Cross site scripting
vulnerability. Please note that this is issue is different from
CAN-2003-0389.


Vulnerability details:
---------------

Due to missing input validation it is possible to inject client side
scripts into the "image" - parameter.

---cut here---


Recommended fixes

Vulnerable versions:

would not inspire them to do further investigation on the flaw.
