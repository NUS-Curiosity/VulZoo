Synopsis
========

RealPlayer and Helix Player are vulnerable to a format string
vulnerability resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

RealPlayer is a multimedia player capable of handling multiple
multimedia file formats. Helix Player is an open source media player
for Linux.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/realplayer       < 10.0.6                   >= 10.0.6
  2  media-video/helixplayer       < 1.0.6                    >= 1.0.6
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

"c0ntex" reported that RealPlayer and Helix Player suffer from a heap
overflow.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to play a specially crafted realpix (.rp) or
realtext (.rt) file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All RealPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/realplayer-10.0.6"

All Helix Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/helixplayer-1.0.6"
