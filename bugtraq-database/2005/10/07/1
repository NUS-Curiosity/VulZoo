Subject: MailEnable W3C Logging Remote Buffer Overflow
	Proof of Concept

Attached is a proof of concept for the MailEnable W3C Logging
vulnerability. It features a special type of patching shellcode designed
to quickly and easily secure this vulnerability across your network.

I am releasing this in hopes that other POC writers will follow suit,
releasing exploits that patch the vulnerability rather then exploit it for
a malicious purpose. The reason this is being done is to support the admin
rather then to support the hacker.
