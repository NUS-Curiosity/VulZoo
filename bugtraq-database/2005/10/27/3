Hi Andreas Marx,

It is ironic that now the AV programs implemented the "smart" file format
checking, but "forgot" about file extensions :)
I think, that "smart" file format checking must be complemented with the
"smart" file extension checking.

Regards,
Andrey Bayora.

infected .BAT, .VBS and .COM files will be missed if they have non-standard
extensions. This happens when the scanner checks the file extension, not the
content, in order to scan solely for this kind of virus. It would be a good
idea for vendors to make a "smart" scan to find out the (hopefully) correct
file format. If there is more than one possibility (like ASCII text or a
.COM file), all possible supported formats should be scanned. [...]"
