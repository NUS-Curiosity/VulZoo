Subject: Announcement : Core Banking Application Security List



Hello, 

Bankinfosecurity.com is creating a banking core application security
mailing list. 

Much like Bankinfosecurity.com's content, the mailing list will serve as
a reference tool for the banking information security community.
Industry experts, vendors, and even people who are new to the Banking
information security world can join. List members will be able to share
knowledge, comments, and concerns about core banking applications, and
others will therefore be able to benefit from this knowledge base.

If you are interested in joining, please e-mail
coreappsecurity@...kinfosecurity.com. There will be no charge for this
service. 


Regards,
 
Lila Buchalski
