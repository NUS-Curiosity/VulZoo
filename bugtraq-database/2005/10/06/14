Subject: aspReady FAQ  -  open for SQL-injections


The free, open source project called "aspReady FAQ" is open for SQL-injection. 

This results is admin access with the ability change/delete the entire database.

An example on SQL-inject that works could be:
1'or'1'='1


After doing a google search, I've found out that some companies are actually using this free aspReady FAQ.
