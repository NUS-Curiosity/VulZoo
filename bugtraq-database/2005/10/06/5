Synopsis
========

Improperly sanitised data in Dia allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Dia is a gtk+ based diagram creation program released under the GPL
license.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/dia      < 0.94-r3                          >= 0.94-r3

Description
===========

Joxean Koret discovered that the SVG import plugin in Dia fails to
properly sanitise data read from an SVG file.

Impact
======

An attacker could create a specially crafted SVG file, which, when
imported into Dia, could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Dia users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/dia-0.94-r3"
