vulnerability:XSS ( Forum , Topsites , Directory )
XSS Vulnerability in multiple PHP pages that may allow
a remote user to launch cross-site scripting attacks.
A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that,
when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary
scripting code to be executed by the target user's
browser. The code will originate from the site running
the software and will run in the security context of
that site. As a result, the code will be able to
access the target user's cookies (including
authentication cookies), if any, associated with the
site, access data recently submitted by the target
user via web form to the site, or take actions on the
site acting as the target user.
