Synopsis
========

The pnmtopng utility, part of the Netpbm tools, contains a
vulnerability which can potentially result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Netpbm is a package of 220 graphics programs and a programming library,
including pnmtopng, a tool to convert PNM image files to the PNG
format.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/netpbm       < 10.29                          >= 10.29

Description
===========

RedHat reported that pnmtopng is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious PNM file and entice a user to run
pnmtopng on it, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running pnmtopng.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Netpbm users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/netpbm-10.29"
