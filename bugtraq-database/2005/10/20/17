Symantec Norton AntiVirus DiskMountNotify Local Privilege Escalation

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 10.20.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=325&type=vulnerabilities
October 20, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Symantec's Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh is an antivirus solution for
the Mac OS X environment. More information is available at the link
shown:

  http://www.symantec.com/nav/nav_mac/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a design error in the DiskMountNotify component
of Symantec Corp.'s Norton Antivirus 9.0 for Macintosh may allow a user
to gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability specifically exists in
failing to specify an explicit PATH for the "/Library/Application
Support/Norton Solutions Support/Norton
AntiVirus/DiskMountNotify.app/Contents/MacOS/DiskMountNotify" binary.

This binary is setuid, meaning it will run with the permissions of the
owner, and is owned by the System Administrator, which is equivalent to 
the Unix root user. A user can simply add a directory they control to
the beginning of the PATH environment variable and DiskMountNotify will
call 'ps' or 'grep' from that directory with root level privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as the System Administrator user. This allows complete system
compromise including the installation and removal of applications, and
ability to read and write any file on the system.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed this vulnerability exists in version 9.0.3 of
Norton Antivirus for Macintosh.

V. WORKAROUND

Unsetting the setuid bit from the "/Library/Application Support/Norton
Solutions Support/Norton
AntiVirus/DiskMountNotify.app/Contents/MacOS/DiskMountNotify" binary
will prevent exploitation, but may prevent automatic scanning on 
mounting by non-administrator users.
