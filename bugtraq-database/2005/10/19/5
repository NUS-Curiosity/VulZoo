Subject: Multiple Critical and High Vulnerabilities in Oracle Database Server


David Litchfield of NGSSoftware has discovered discovered multiple critical 
and high risk vulnerabilities in the Oracle Database Server. These 
vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to gain complete control of 
the database server. Versions affected include

Oracle Database 10g - All Releases
Oracle9i Database Server - All Releases

The vulnerabilities include a buffer overflow vulnerability and seventeen 
PL/SQL injection vulnerabilities and Oracle has released a patch set to deal 
with these issues. It is understood that this patch set fixes a number of 
other flaws found by seven other security researchers. Oracle database 
administrators are urged to download, test and install the patch set as soon 
as possible. See 
http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpuoct2005.html for 
more details.

NGSSQuirreL for Oracle, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment 
scanner and security manager for Oracle, has been updated to check for and 
positively identify these flaws in Oracle database servers on the network. 
More information about NGSSQuirreL for Oracle can be found at 
http://www.ngssoftware.com/squirrelora.htm.

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about these flaws for three 
months. Full details will be published on the 18th of January 2006. This 
three month window will allow Oracle database administrators the time needed 
to test and apply the patch set before the details are released to the 
general public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible 
disclosure.
