Synopsis
========

uw-imap is vulnerable to remote overflow of a buffer in the IMAP server
leading to execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

uw-imap is the University of Washington's IMAP and POP server daemons.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/uw-imap       < 2004g                           >= 2004g

Description
===========

Improper bounds checking of user supplied data while parsing IMAP
mailbox names can lead to overflowing the stack buffer.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation requires an authenticated IMAP user to request
a malformed mailbox name. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code
with the permissions of the IMAP server.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All uw-imap users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/uw-imap-2004g"
