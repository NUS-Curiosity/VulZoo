Subject: Looking for a security contact at Macrovision/InstallShield


Hi,

I need a security contact at the InstallShield division of Macromedia.  I
have found a very serious privacy leak bug in one of their ActiveX controls.

PS. If your company uses InstallShield, you might also want to drop me a
line.
