Well said. I don't see anyone complaining that MSIE allows you to
click-through the warning that the presented cert doesn't match the
hostname and carry on and get compromised. Same with signing executables.

Users don't know what it means - and they "just want it to work!".
Frankly, there is only so much technology can do. At some stage people
have to start taking responsibility for their choices (shall we measure
the IQ of people who open GIF-file based password protected zip files
and run the contents!?!?!? Sheesh)

Actually I'm glad you can click-through and ignore cert mismatches.
Without it I couldn't read many self-signed Web sites where they use
certs just to protect their data in transit. It would smack of  monopoly
practices if only Verisign-signed sites/whatever worked within browsers.
