Below I copied Trend Micro's response to the "magic byte" vulnerability in 
their products:

========================================
Dear Valued Client,

Greetings!

My name is <removed>. I will be the one handling your case.

Please correct me if I left some issues or if I misunderstood your 
concern.

Trend Micro is aware of a potential vulnerability related to the "forged 
magic byte" in certain file types. Based on our analysis, this 
vulnerability is limited in our products to one specific type of potential 
virus file which is not commonly allowed in most IT systems and needs to 
be executed manually. Trend Micro customers are currently able to detect 
such files -- should they be created -- through our virus pattern file, 
2.915.00.

Please make sure that you regularly update your virus definitions. Hope 
this information helps.

========================================


Any comments on their response?
