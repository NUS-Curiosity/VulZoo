1. The bug is over a year old (see bid 10760).
2. The bug was fixed in 1.1.5, so that version is not vulnerable.
3. It was discovered by Radek Hulan, not "RoDheDoR".
4. The exploit detailed is copied directly from the old bid so "RoDheDoR" was obviously aware of it.

The nerve of some of these reporters never seizes to amaze me.
