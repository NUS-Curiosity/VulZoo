Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.28.05: Multiple
	Vendor chmlib CHM File Handling Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Multiple Vendor chmlib CHM File Handling Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
 
iDefense Security Advisory 10.28.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=332&type=vulnerabilities
October 28, 2005
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
chmlib is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files.
 
II. DESCRIPTION
 
Remote exploitation of a stack overflow vulnerability in chmlib as 
included in various Linux distributions allows attackers to execute 
arbitrary code.
 
The vulnerability specifically exists due to an unchecked memory copy 
while processing a CHM file. The vulnerability exists in the following 
code, which is found in chm_lib.c: 
 
static UChar *_chm_find_in_PMGL(UChar *page_buf,
                                UInt32 
block_len,
                                const 
char *objPath)
{
[...]
  char buffer[CHM_MAX_PATHLEN+1];    
    /* figure out where to start and end */
    cur = page_buf;
    hremain = _CHM_PMGL_LEN;
    if (! _unmarshal_pmgl_header(&cur, &hremain, &header))
        return NULL;
    end = page_buf + block_len - (header.free_space);
    
    /* now, scan progressively */
    while (cur < end)
    {
        /* grab the name */
        temp = cur;
        strLen = _chm_parse_cword(&cur);
        if (! _chm_parse_UTF8(&cur, strLen, buffer))
            return NULL;
[..] 
 
_chm_parse_cword can be forced to return a value larger than 
CHM_MAX_PATHLEN. This value is then used while copying user controlled 
data into a CHM_MAX_PATHLEN sized stack buffer. This allows the attacker

full control over execution flow by overwriting the saved return address

on the stack.
 
III. ANALYSIS
 
Exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the 
privileges of the user processing the CHM file. Remote exploitation can 
be achieved by sending a malicious file in an e-mail message to the 
target user.
 
IV. DETECTION
 
iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in chmlib 
0.35. It is suspected that all versions of chmlib are vulnerable. 
 
The following vendors distribute susceptible chmlib packages within 
their respective operating system distributions:
 
 FreeBSD Project:
   FreeBSD 5.4 and prior
 Gentoo Foundation Inc.:
   Gentoo Linux 1.1a, 1.2, 1.4, 2004.0, 2004.1 and 2004.2 
 
V. WORKAROUND
 
Do not open CHM files sent from an untrusted source.
 
VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
 
chmlib-0.36 addresses this vulnerability and is available for download
at:
 
   http://freshmeat.net/projects/chmlib/
 
VII. CVE INFORMATION
 
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2005-2930 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.
