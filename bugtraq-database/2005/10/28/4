Synopsis
========

Mantis is affected by multiple vulnerabilities ranging from information
disclosure to arbitrary script execution.

Background
==========

Mantis is a web-based bugtracking system written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/mantisbt      < 0.19.3                         >= 0.19.3

Description
===========

Mantis contains several vulnerabilities, including:

* a remote file inclusion vulnerability

* an SQL injection vulnerability

* multiple cross site scripting vulnerabilities

* multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit the remote file inclusion vulnerability to
execute arbitrary script code, and the SQL injection vulnerability to
access or modify sensitive information from the Mantis database.
Furthermore the cross-site scripting issues give an attacker the
ability to inject and execute malicious script code or to steal
cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially compromising the
victim's browser. An attacker could exploit other vulnerabilities to
disclose information.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mantis users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mantisbt-0.19.3"
