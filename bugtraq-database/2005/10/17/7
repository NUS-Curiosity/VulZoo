Synopsis
========

Lynx contains a buffer overflow that may be exploited to execute
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Lynx is a text-mode browser for the World Wide Web. It supports
multiple URL types, including HTTP and NNTP URLs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/lynx     < 2.8.5-r1                        >= 2.8.5-r1

Description
===========

When accessing a NNTP URL, Lynx connects to a NNTP server and retrieves
information about the available articles in the target newsgroup. Ulf
Harnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in a function that handles the
escaping of special characters.

Impact
======

An attacker could setup a malicious NNTP server and entice a user to
access it using Lynx (either by creating NNTP links on a web page or by
forcing a redirect for Lynx users). The data returned by the NNTP
server would trigger the buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running Lynx.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Lynx users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/lynx-2.8.5-r1"
