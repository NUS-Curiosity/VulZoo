Subject: Kaspersky Antivirus Remote Heap Overflow


Date
October 3, 2005

Vulnerability
The Kaspersky Antivirus Library provides file format support for virus analysis. During analysis of cab files Kaspersky is vulnerable to a heap overflow allowing attackers complete control of the system(s) being protected. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without user interaction in default configurations through common protocols such as SMTP, SMB, HTTP, and FTP. 

Impact
Successful exploitation of Kaspersky protected systems allows attackers unauthorized control of data and related privileges. It also provides leverage for further network compromise. Kaspersky Antivirus Library implementations are likely vulnerable in their default configuration.

Affected Products
Due to the library’s OS independent design and core functionality: it is likely this vulnerability affects a substantial portion of Kaspersky’s gateway, server, and client antivirus enabled product lines on most platforms.
