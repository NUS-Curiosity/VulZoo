Synopsis
========

Under certain conditions, applications linked against Uim suffer from a
privilege escalation vulnerability.

Background
==========

Uim is a multilingual input method library which provides secure and
useful input method for all languages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-i18n/uim      < 0.4.9.1                            >= 0.4.9.1

Description
===========

Masanari Yamamoto discovered that Uim uses environment variables
incorrectly. This bug causes a privilege escalation if setuid/setgid
applications are linked to libuim. This bug only affects
immodule-enabled Qt (if you build Qt 3.3.2 or later versions with
USE="immqt" or USE="immqt-bc").

Impact
======

A malicious local user could exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code with escalated privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Uim users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-i18n/uim-0.4.9.1"
