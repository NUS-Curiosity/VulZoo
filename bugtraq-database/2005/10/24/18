Subject: Zomplog Script Injection Vulnerability =>3.4 (all versions
 vulnerable)


zomplog is prone to xss injection attacks. It is possible for a malicious zomplog user to inject hostile xss and script code into the commentary via form fields. This code may be rendered in the browser of a web user who views the commentary of zomplog.
zomplog does not adequately filter xss tags from various fields. This may enable an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into pages that are generated by the blog.
example:
put <script>alert('test')</script> in http://localhost/zomplog/detail.php?id=1#comments

Zamplog home page: http://zomplog.zomp.nl/
