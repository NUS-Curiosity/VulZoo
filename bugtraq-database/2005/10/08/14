Package        : shorewall
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2317
Debian Bug     : 318946

"Supernaut" noticed that shorewall, the Shoreline Firewall, could
generate an iptables configuration which is significantly more
permissive than the rule set given in the shorewall configuration, if
MAC verification are used in a non-default manner.

When MACLIST_DISPOSITION is set to ACCEPT in the shorewall.conf file,
all packets from hosts which fail the MAC verification pass through
the firewall, without further checks.  When MACLIST_TTL is set to a
non-zero value, packets from hosts which pass the MAC verification
pass through the firewall, again without further checks.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your shorewall package.
