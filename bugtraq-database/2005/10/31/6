Objective

The primary objective of the Beta-Announce list is to provide the
SecurityFocus community access to upcoming security tool and product beta
trials. In the same vein it will provide access to tool authors and vendors
to announce their beta programs and get valuable feedback from the community
which will ultimately use and in some cases, buy, their offerings.

Background

There are an overwhelming number of security tools and products available
today. Many, if not most, have limited beta trials because of lack of access
to an informed, qualified community. By providing a list such as this we
hope to help authors provide stronger offerings to the community and we hope
to allow the community an opportunity to stay abreast of the most recent
security technologies.
