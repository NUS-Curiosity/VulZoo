Subject: Announcement: The Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria v1


The Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria project is proud
to announce its first public release.

The goal of the project is to develop a detailed web application
firewall evaluation criteria; a testing methodology that can be
used by any reasonably skilled technician to independently assess
quality of a web application firewall.

The primary purpose of this release is to solicit comments from the
public. You can download the current version of the evaluation
criteria from the project home page:

  http://www.webappsec.org/projects/waf_evaluation/

The project is open to contributors. Please join the project
mailing list if you would like to comment on the draft release,
or to participate in our future efforts.

Regards,
