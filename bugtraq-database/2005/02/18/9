Subject: Re: Permission problem in Skype BETA for linux


Update (February 2005):

The issue described below has re-appeared in the official (non-BETA)
version released on Feb 1, 2005. Skype were notified on Feb 10, and a
fixed version was released on Feb 14.

Vulnerable: skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm (but see below)
Fixed:      skype-1.0.0.7-suse.i586.rpm

NB: it seems that a fixed version skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm was
    made available on Feb 11, but without modifying the version number.
    The difference can only be seen with "rpm -qi ..." - :

conrad@...ms:~> rpm -qip skype-1.0.0.1-suse.i586.rpm | grep Release
Release     : suse               Build Date: Mon Jan 31 19:00:45 2005
conrad@...ms:~> rpm -qip skype-1.0.0.1b-suse.i586.rpm | grep Release
Release     : suse.hotfix1       Build Date: Fri Feb 11 14:18:39 2005
