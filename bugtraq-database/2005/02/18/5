Refusing to address a point in an argument and responding with "then 
someone else would have" is, by definition, conceding the point.

It's not a preposterous point.  Why should Symantec use their AV product 
to police the CA market?  How about their other products?  It would only 
happen when it benefits them to do so, and that will only happen if the 
CAs completely fail to do their duties.

Yes, you did say that.  Look back in the thread.  You were saying "The 
market will provide a solution".  I said that that was naive.  Your 
retort was "didn't say that".

Are you conceding more points or just ignoring your own arguments?

The same pressures that affected Symantec would affect them.

All markets have the potential to be distorted.  And any sober review of 
any market will find most of these practices in place to one degree or 
another.

Sure, they didn't know the best way to cheat people at first.  All 
solutions are better managed after trial and error.  The problem with 
your argument is that there is corruption in the markets, or are you 
arguing that corruption is dead and all markets fix themselves?  That 
would seem a bit assinine to me.  I guess you'll just respond with "I 
never said that markets correct themselves..." :)

Correction: until it materially harms the user enough to address the 
issue.  All decisions have a cost/benefit basis to them.

Because you're neglecting to consider important factors in the markets 
that are affected by this particular bug and, in fact, all CA root cert 
revocations on the part of browser producers and when I bring them up, 
you ignore them.  Ignoring them makes it appear that you're being 
selective in your positions.

Of course not - I can only speculate based on factors at work at the 
time.   The same goes for yourself.

Whoa whoa whoa.  We're not talking about CAs creating a situation where 
things don't "just work".  Not in the least.

We're talking about the current IDN "bug" and the CAs dealing with 
that.   Someone else already answered that point by (correctly) stating 
that it is not the responsibility of the CAs to protect people from 
things like that.

My point is that even if it were their responsibility, you can't just 
explicitely trust them to do so.  Their accountability in dealing with 
it is limited because as long as they are providing their service, they 
won't be harmed.

If that situation became the norm, obviously - over time - that CA would 
be obsoleted.

However, in the current context we're not talking about the CA system 
failing.

The average person doesn't have a choice.  The MPAA is, effectively, a 
trust and a control for the movie industry.  Looking through my own 
movie collection, I don't have many movies that aren't associated with 
the MPAA and I think I'd be hardpressed to find more than five.

The average person doesn't have a trust relationship with the MPAA.  
It's more of a dictatorial relationship.  People buy or go watch movies 
and, if the product is defective, they return it.  There's not much of a 
trust relationship there to speak of.

Hell, most people don't even trust the MPAA to properly rate movies.

Yes, they have an interest in providing their services in the way that 
is economically feasible to achieve their best goals.  Obviously, they 
don't want to see their customers harmed by their actions.   However, 
it's a leap of faith to go from that to "they will provide the best 
service ever possible".
