Hello Adrian,

Very interesting indeed Adrian.
So to sum it all up just for now, the advisories are two.
One for users, one for developers of MUAs.

Users: Beware of the fact that automatic discarding of duplicated messages
       may result in you not getting the original mail in case someone exploits
       the effect Adrian depicted.

Developers: Consider using checksum of the email messages, not only the
            Message-ID to distinguish between duplicated messages.

Am I correct?
            
Fortunately I was never using this MUA feature - I just take care of the
duppies manually, which is not a big chore for me I must say.
