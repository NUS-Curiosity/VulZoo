	What?! I did nothing of the sort. My "then" follows his "if". It does not
concede that his "if" is true, in fact I think it's preposterous.

	Didn't say that.

	Lavasoft, Computer Associates, Bazooka, Webroot, Zone Labs, and pretty much
every other computer security vendor.

	First of all, the unusual circumstances have occured in distorted markets.
Second, it took awhile for people to learn that these strategies almost
never work and to figure out precisely under what circumstances they do
work. As for a number of economists, anyone can find economists to defend
his pet view or pet law.

	Right, until it harms the users.

	How so?

	Or people set up that CA to a lower level of trust where they know the
certificate has come from a CA they don't fully trust. Or maybe they
download a list of certificates manually from that CA and don't trust
unknown CAs without querying them with a third party. Or maybe, ...

	You can't predict how the market will work.

	Or someone creates a product that does this for them. You might as well
argue that people can't buy well made cars because they're not mechanics.

	There is a market in keeping users ignorant. So long as things "just work"
users can stay ignorant, and I assure you, if CAs create a situation that
doesn't "just work", someone else will work hard to come up with a solution
to keep things that way.

	No, the issue (with the MPAA, I'm not sure how the RIAA got into this) is
not that people trust or don't trust them, the issue is that all they have
to sell is their trust. For the vast majority of people, trusting the MPAA
has never caused them a problem. So the alternatives to the MPAA only target
very specialized markets.

	That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying CAs have a huge interest in making
sure their customers don't get harmed by their actions.
