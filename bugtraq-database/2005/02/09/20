  He's already shown the POC "To raise awareness to this issue", and I have
no complaint about that.  But to continue and develop it into an actual
usable production-level tool serves no further purpose in raising awareness
and seems to me to be crossing the line into malware authoring; it's like
the difference between writing a POC showing a bug in SQL server and writing
MSBlast.
