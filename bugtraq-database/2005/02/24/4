1. Topic:

Updated gdk-pixbuf packages that fix several security flaws are now
available.

The gdk-pixbuf package contains an image loading library used with the
GNOME GUI desktop environment.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Thomas Kristensen discovered a bitmap file that would cause the
Evolution mail reader to crash. This issue was caused by a flaw that
affects versions of the gdk-pixbuf package prior to 0.20. To exploit
this flaw, a remote attacker could send (via email) a carefully-crafted
BMP file, which would cause Evolution to crash. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0111 to this issue.

During testing of a previously fixed flaw in Qt (CAN-2004-0691), a flaw
was discovered in the BMP image processor of gdk-pixbuf. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted BMP file which would cause an
application to enter an infinite loop and not respond to user input when
the file was opened by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0753 to
this issue.

During a security audit, Chris Evans discovered a stack and a heap
overflow in the XPM image decoder. An attacker could create a carefully
crafted XPM file which could cause an application linked with gtk2 to
crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when the file was opened by a
victim. (CAN-2004-0782, CAN-2004-0783)

Chris Evans also discovered an integer overflow in the ICO image
decoder. An attacker could create a carefully crafted ICO file which
could cause an application linked with gtk2 to crash when the file is
opened by a victim. (CAN-2004-0788)

Users of gdk-pixbuf are advised to upgrade to these packages, which
contain backported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

     rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

     sha1sum <filename>
