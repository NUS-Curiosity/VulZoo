  Yes, but no spammers actually do so.  For experimental proof of this
claim,

http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml

" But none of the addresses that were obscured, whether in "human-readable"
or "HTML-obscured" form, received a single piece of spam, leading us to
conclude that e-mail address "harvesters" are not presently capable of
collecting such addresses. While this may change as time passes and
technology develops, for the time being it appears that obscuring an e-mail
address is an effective means of avoiding spam. "

  The harvesters don't bother because there are so many un-obfuscated email
addresses out there, enough to keep them busy for a lifetime of spamming,
anyway.

  Why?  You hoping to sell it to spammers?  Obfuscating *works*; if YOU
break it, that makes YOU a spamming motherfucker.  Why don't you go fuck
yourself instead?

  Oh, and by the way
