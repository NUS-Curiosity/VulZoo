Portcullis Security Advisory

AREAS UPDATED: VENDOR RESPONSE.

VENDOR RESPONSE:

The product vendor, Bottomline Technologies has provided Portcullis with
the following response to the security advisory. It should be noted that
the resolution of this issue has not been verified by Portcullis:

Bottomline acknowledge that there is a slight risk of exposure of data
via unauthorised report generation. In order to further enhance the
security of the system a service pack will be released in Q1 2005. This
ensures the reporting module no longer passes the path and report
information on the URL line. This information is kept on the server and
passed using the database and additionally the report being executed is
validated against the user entitlements.
