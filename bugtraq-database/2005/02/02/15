Subject: High Risk Vulnerabilities in Eudora Mail Client

John Heasman of NGSSoftware has discovered multiple high risk
vulnerabilities in the Windows version of Eudora.
Versions affected include:

Eudora 6.2.0 and below

The flaws permit execution of arbitrary code via:

1) previewing or opening a specially crafted email
2) opening specially crafted stationary or mailbox files

These issues have been resolved in Eudora 6.2.1 as detailed at
http://www.eudora.com/security.html

It can be downloaded from:

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details of this flaw for three months.
Full details will be published on the 2nd of May 2005. This three month
window will allow users of Eudora the time needed to apply the patch before
the details are released to the general public. This reflects NGSSoftware's
approach to responsible disclosure.
