Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2187

1. Topic:

Updated freeradius packages that fix a number of denial of service
vulnerabilities as well as minor bugs are now available.

FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free RADIUS
server designed to allow centralized authentication and authorization
for a network.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

A number of flaws were found in FreeRADIUS versions prior to 1.0.1. An
attacker who is able to send packets to the server could construct
carefully constructed packets in such a way as to cause the server to
consume memory or crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0938,
CAN-2004-0960, and CAN-2004-0961 to these issues.

Please note that the pam config file included in these packages was
renamed to /etc/pam.d/radiusd.

Users of FreeRADIUS should update to these erratum packages that contain
FreeRADIUS 1.0.1, which is not vulnerable to these issues and also
corrects a number of bugs.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

5. Bug IDs fixed:

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

     rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

     sha1sum <filename>
