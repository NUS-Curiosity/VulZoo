Portcullis Security Advisory

AREAS UPDATED: VENDOR RESPONSE.

VENDOR RESPONSE:

The product vendor, Bottomline Technologies has provided Portcullis with
the following response to the security advisory. It should be noted that
the resolution of this issue has not been verified by Portcullis:

Bottommline acknowledges that there is a theoretical threat to the
system via this vulnerability, however would point out it would require
two trusted users to collude in order for any changes to take effect and
both would need to have a good understanding of the software beyond that
usually available to end users. This of course does not take into
account any of the customers' internal security processes and
procedures, which would typically be surrounding software.

In order to further enhance the security of the system a service pack
will be released in Q1 2005 which will check entitlements prior to
invoking any user function, an error message will be logged and the user
will be logged off and disabled until re-enabled.
