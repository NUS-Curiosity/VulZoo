Subject: Symantec UPX issue solution


Per Symantec, if you update signatures via the normal LiveUpdate
automatic process, your product should not be vulnerable. Updated
signatures were released two days ago.  Threats with the UPX exploit
code will be detected as:

http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/venc/data/bloodhound.exploit.26.html

This works because the signature detection engine can examine the code
first, before exposing the vulnerable part of the UPX decomposer to the
exploit.  Of course, you probably still need to upgrade your software to
the appropriate version, but it is not as bad as some have claimed (mea
culpa)
