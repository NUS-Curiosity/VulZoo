Go back and read the original post.

Whether or NOT this is a true vulnerability....

"VENDOR RESPONSE
This issue was reported to Microsoft on Feb 11, 2005, acknowledged by
support, and as of today our best efforts to get a hotfix (or even a
commitment to produce a hotfix at some later date) have been fruitless. "

So let's see email sent 2/10 to secure@...rosoft.com [you did contact 
secure@ right?] and on 2/23 since you received no patch [13 days for 
patch testing...dude...get real] you blasted this to a listserve?

I emailed Sonny on the 23rd asking if he wanted a fast patch that broke 
stuff or a tested patch.  He's yet to respond to me on that question.

"If" this is a issue, "If" it needs a patch, Sonny didn't even let a 
"Patch Tuesday" go by before blasting.

Whether or not you want to cut Microsoft some slack... there's a process 
of ethical and responsible disclosure that I would expect Sonny as a 
representative of a governmental agency would understand.  He not only 
put his own government computers at risk but others in this disclosure, yes?

How about cutting us Admins some slack even if you "don't" cut Redmond some?
