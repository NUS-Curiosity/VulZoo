 	Why?  I'm not even replying to the original post.  I couldn't give 
a good rip about the original post.

 	First mistake.  I take every vendor response with a grain of salt 
since it's always run through their PR department and their corporate 
lawyers before we ever get treated to the watered-down (and usually 
fact-free) missive that they design to toss at us like so many table 
scraps.  Those of us who have been around long enough will starkly recall 
the "vendor response" that Ford Motor Company had when its Pintos 
developed a penchant for exploding when rear-ended.  Nufsed.

 	In my book, Microsoft is the entity that put those systems at risk 
with their shoddy malware.  Sonny only showed that the flaw existed.  I'll 
leave it to the philosophy majors to debate the ethics of the issue. 
Personally, I believe in full disclosure.  And considering that Microsoft 
has (for want of a better expression) money coming out of its butt, I 
should think they'd be able to spend that money in a fashion that would 
put security first...and quick.

 	And I'm glad your SP2 implementation went well.  I had to deal 
with VPNs when SP2 rolled out.  If you'd had to, your outlook on that 
service pack would be decidely less than cheery.
