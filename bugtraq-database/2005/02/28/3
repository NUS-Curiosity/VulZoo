Subject: [USN-88-1] reportbug information disclosure

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-88-1		  February 28, 2005
reportbug information disclosure
https://bugzilla.ubuntulinux.org/6600
https://bugzilla.ubuntulinux.org/6717
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

reportbug

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 2.62ubuntu1.1.  In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes. However, if your users
already have ~/.reportbugrc files with SMTP passwords, you need to
manually change their permissions with

  chmod 600 .reportbugrc

Details follow:

Rolf Leggewie discovered two information disclosure bugs in reportbug.

The per-user configuration file ~/.reportbugrc was created
world-readable. If it contained email smarthost passwords, these were
readable by any other user on the computer storing the home directory.

reportbug usually includes the settings from ~/.reportbugrc in
generated bug reports. This included the "smtppasswd" setting (the
password for an SMTP email smarthost) as well. The password is
now hidden from reports.
