I just hope it won't disappoint you in some way, but using a policy 
setting that would advise Windows Explorer to hide drives from users 
does not necessarily mean, users can't access the underlying devices 
anymore.

The setting you used to prevent access is not a security feature but 
rather a convinience setting. It will always be possible to go to the 
command shell and view the drives from there. Or to use any third-party 
file manager (or even the file manager out of Windows NT 4) to bypass 
the Windows Explorer setting to hide drives.

If you want to _really_ prevent access to data, either use appropriate 
ACLs (when using fixed drives) or use appropriate third-party-software 
which will run as a driver and have hooks into filesystem calls in order 
to *really* prevent acces to unwanted media.
