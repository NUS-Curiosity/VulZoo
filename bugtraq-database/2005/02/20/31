                Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated cdrtools packages fix a security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:2058
Issue date:        2005-02-20
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2058
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0806
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated cdrtools packages that fix a privilege escalation vulnerability
are now available.

Cdrtools is a collection of CD/DVD utilities.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Max Vozeler found that the cdrecord program, when is set suid root,
fails to drop privileges when it executes a program specified by the
user through the $RSH environment variable. This can be abused by a
local attacker to obtain root privileges. In the default configuration
of Red Hat Linux 9, the cdrecord program is not set suid root and this
attack is not possible. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0806 to this issue.

Users of cdrtools are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which
contain a backported patch correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
