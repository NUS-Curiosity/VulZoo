It's not. It's just backwards compatible with buffer sizes for programs 
that already handle SHA-1 (and presumably also MD5) hashes so that less 
and smaller changes are required to the code.

It's really quite clever, since the input would have to collide in both 
MD5 and SHA1 for it to collide in the final output.
