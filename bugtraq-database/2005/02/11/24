Subject: insecure temporary file creation in kdelibs 3.3.2

The `dcopidlng' script in the KDE library package 
(kdelibs-3.3.2/dcop/dcopidlng/dcopidlng)
creates temporary files in a unsecure manner.

This bug has been fixed in 32 minutes (!) by Stephan Kulow, the KDE team 
leader. Here you can found the official patch:
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97608

Note: This bug has been find by `autospec', the work-in-progress tool used by 
the QiLinux team to (semi)automatically create specfiles from tarballs and 
update/check rpm packages. It's released under GPL and not QiLinux specific.
The latest release can be found at the URL:
