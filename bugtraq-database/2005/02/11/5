---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated gaim package resolves security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:2188
Issue date:        2005-02-10
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2188
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0891
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated gaim package that fixes security issues and various bugs is
now avaliable.

The gaim application is a multi-protocol instant messaging client.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the MSN protocol handler. When
receiving unexpected sequence of MSNSLP messages, it is possible that an
attacker could cause an internal buffer overflow, leading to a crash or
possible code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0891 to this
issue.

This updated gaim package also fixes multiple user interface, protocol,
and error handling problems, including an ICQ communication encoding
issue.

Users of gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package which
contains gaim version 1.0.2 and is not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
