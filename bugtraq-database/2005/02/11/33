Symantec UPX Parsing Engine Heap Overflow 

Revision History
2/9/2005 - Updated Vulnerability details and mitigations. Updated CVE Candidate Number
2/11/2005 - Configuration modifications tested and added to disable vulnerable module in SAVCE and SCS. 
URL to Technical Support KB with details.

Risk Impact
High

Overview
Symantec resolved a potential remote access compromise vulnerability reported by ISS X-Force.  The vulnerability was identified in an early version of a Symantec antivirus scanning module responsible for
parsing UPX compressed files that is still in limited use in some Symantec security products.  
The vulnerable component fails to do proper bounds checks when analyzing certain container files for
virus content. An attacker sending a specifically crafted UPX file could potentially compromise the
targeted system. 
 
NOTE:  Users of affected products should ensure they are running a non-vulnerable product build or have
installed recommended hotfixes.
If unable to update at this time, customers may implement the configuration procedures to disable the
affected DEC2EXE module in those products, Symantec BrightMail, Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition and
Symantec Client Security that are configurable as documented in this advisory and associated product
support Knowledge Base.

Symantec has NOT seen any active attempts against or organizations impacted by this issue.  However,
Symantec Security Response created Bloodhound.Exploit.26, a heuristic detection for attempts to exploit the DEC2EXE.dll heap overflow vulnerability.  Virus definitions version 70209af (extended version 2/9/2004 rev. 32) or greater contain this heuristic and are available through Symantec LiveUpdate or Symantec's Intelligent Updater.

Details
ISS X-Force notified Symantec of a vulnerability discovered in the DEC2EXE parsing engine module used in
earlier versions of the Symantec scan engine.  The vulnerable DEC2EXE engine contained a heap overflow 
that could be initiated by sending a specifically crafted UPX file that would be parsed by the vulnerable
DEC2EXE engine. If successfully exploited, the attack could potentially result in remote arbitrary code
execution and possible compromise of the targeted system.  

Symantec Response
Symantec confirmed the vulnerability ISS identified in the original DEC2EXE engine.  The DEC2EXE engineis no longer required to parse compressed files. Prior to ISS contacting Symantec with this vulnerability, Symantec had already removed the DEC2EXE engine from the scan engine upgrades implementedin the majority of Symantec products.  
Recommended Upgrades:

As a part of normal best practices, users should keep vendor-supplied patches for all application software and operating systems up-to-date.  Symantec strongly recommends customers, if they are not already running a current non-vulnerable product version/build, upgrade to their appropriate product update immediately to protect against these types of threats.
Symantec product engineers have developed and released updates or Maintenance Releases for all impacted product versions that were not already upgraded in the latest product build release.   Updates and Maintenance Releases are available either through Symantec's LiveUpdate for those products that have LiveUpdate capability or from the Symantec Product Support site at http://www.symantec.com/techsupp.

Symantec Gateway Security 5300/5400 Series:

Symantec has tested and posted hotfixes to address this issue for the affected Symantec Gateway Security 5300/5400 Series.  The hotfix removes the DEC2EXE engine from the affected products and upgrades the scan engine to a new version. Product specific hotfixes are available through the Symantec Enterprise Support site
http://www.symantec.com/techsupp.

Symantec strongly recommends customers, if they are not already running a current non-vulnerable product
version/build, upgrade to their appropriate product update immediately to protect against these types of 
threats. 

Mitigation

Symantec BrightMail AntiSpam versions 4.0 and 5.5

The DEC2EXE module can be easily and safely disabled through the brightmail.cfg file on Solaris, Linux and Windows platforms.  

For Solaris and Linux:

1. Locate brightmail.cfg  
   The default location for this file is /opt/mailwall

2. Edit brightmail.cfg in the following way:
   In the section labeled "Symantec 3 decomposer", remove the following line:
   blsymdec3Engine: libdec2exe.so|5

3. Restart BrightMail to reload the config file: 
                /etc/init.d/mailwall restart  


For Windows:

1. Close any open instance of the Brightmail Administration Console.
2. Locate brightmail.cfg 
   The default location for this file is c:\program files\brightmail\config

3. Edit brightmail.cfg in the following way:
   In the section labeled "Symantec 3 decomposer", remove the following line:
   blsymdec3Engine: dec2exe.dll|5

4. Restart the Brightmail AntiVirus Cleaner and the Brightmail Server services.
