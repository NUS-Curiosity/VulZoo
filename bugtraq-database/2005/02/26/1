Confirmed Exploit works in Firefox 1.0, however on a side note Microsoft
Anti-spyware prevented the script from executing.

Subject: Firescrolling [Firefox 1.0]

__Summary

Remember my Internet Explorer "scrollbar exploit" based on http-equiv's
"What a Drag"? When will people ever learn that "unusual user
interaction" 
can be hidden by common tasks...

Let's combine fireflashing, firetabbing, xul and javascript to run
arbitrary code by dragging a scrollbar two times.

__Proof-of-Concept

http://www.mikx.de/firescrolling/

__Status

The exploit is based on multiple vulnerabilities:

bugzilla.mozilla.org #280664 (fireflashing) bugzilla.mozilla.org #280056
(firetabbing) bugzilla.mozilla.org #281807 (firescrolling)

Upgrade to Firefox 1.0.1 or disable javascript.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2005-0527 to this issue.

__Affected Software

Tested with Firefox 1.0 on Windows and Linux (Fedora Core)
