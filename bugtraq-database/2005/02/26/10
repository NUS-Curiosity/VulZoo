 	Just one question: what could possibly compel someone to drag a 
broken image into their browser's location bar?  I'm not trying to be a 
wiseguy.  I'm honestly puzzled as to why anyone would take an obviously 
broken image and drag it into the browser location bar.

 	Side note: the behavior you describe is the same if one 
right-clicks Javascript "image" and selects "View Image" from the pop-up 
dialog.

 	...or hyperlinks.  Those too can be obfuscated via Javascript, and 
they can also be dragged into the location bar.
