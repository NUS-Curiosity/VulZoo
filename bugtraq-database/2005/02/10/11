Subject: Re: International Domain Name [IDN] support in modern browsers allows
    attackers to spoof domain name URLs + SSL certs.


We have tried to play with this trick to see if it is usable for spam or 
phishing via email. Unfortunately most browsers display the punycoded 
address in the address bar like you will see if you click the link here:
http://www.ѕimon.com/index2.html

But with a frontpage containing a meta refresh tag with the UTF-8 
encoded domain name like this:
<META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh content="0; 
URL=http://www.&#1109;imon.com/index2.html">
the address bar will also show the UTF-8 encoded text.

Punycoded address bar:
http://www.ѕimon.com/index2.html

UTF-8 address bar for phishers:
http://www.ѕimon.com/

  It is a book about a Spanish guy called Manual. You should read it.
