MSN 7 is not affected as the vulnerability was reported to Microsoft
before it's beta release, hence it was fixed in MSN 7 before MS05-009
was released. The beta of MSN Messenger 7 was released back in November
2004 so it's taken a few months to patch this for the remaining affected
products.

Vulnerability Details, PNG Processing Vulnerability in MSN Messenger,
FAQ:

"Is the MSN Messenger 7.0 beta affected by this vulnerability?
No. This vulnerability was reported prior to the release of the MSN
Messenger 7.0 beta, and is therefore already incorporated into that
product version."
