IBM AIX ipl_varyon Local Buffer Overflow Vulnerability 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.10.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=196&type=vulnerabilities
February 10, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The ipl_varyon program is a setuid root application, installed by 
default under multiple versions of IBM AIX, which can be used to set the

default physical boot volume. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ipl_varyon 
command included by default in multiple versions of IBM Corp.'s AIX 
Operating System could allow for arbitrary code execution as the root 
user. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to an unbounded 
string copy operation. When provided with a long argument to the -d 
option, the ipl_varyon process will overwrite stack memory with the user

supplied string. This allows for overwriting of the saved return address

on the stack, which in turn allows for complete control over execution 
flow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability is simple for a skilled attacker, 
however gid "system" is required in order to execute the vulnerable 
binary. Successful exploitation yields root access on the system.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in IBM AIX 
version 5.2. It is suspected that previous versions are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Only allow trusted users local access to security critical systems; only

allow trusted users access to the "system" group.  Alternately, remove 
the setuid bit from netpmon using chmod u-s /usr/sbin/ipl_varyon
