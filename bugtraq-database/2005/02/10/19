Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.09.05: CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup v11 Discovery Service Remote Buffer Overflow


Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup v11 Discovery Service
Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.09.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=194&type=vulnerabilities
February 09, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

BrightStor ARCserve Backup for Windows delivers backup and restore 
protection for all Windows server systems as well as Windows, Linux, 
Mac OS X and UNIX client environments.

http://www3.ca.com/Solutions/ProductFamily.asp?ID=115

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Computer 
Associates International Inc's BrightStor ARCserve Backup v11 Discovery 
Service may allow execution of arbitrary code.

The BrightStor software will automatically detect other BrightStor 
(ARCserve) servers on the local network. It does this by sending UDP 
probe messages to the broadcast address on the network. Each system 
running the BrightStor software listens for these probes and replies 
back to IP address embedded in the data of the packet. The Discovery 
service listens on UDP port 41524 for these probe requests.

III. ANALYSIS

When a UDP probe is received by the Discovery Service, a stack overflow 
can occur if the data is larger than the temporary buffer. The 
recvfrom() call made by the service accepts up to 4096 bytes, however 
the buffer it is copied to is slightly less than 1000 bytes. The return 
address can be overwritten by sending a message that is at least 967 
bytes long. As the service runs as 'Local System', exploitation of  this
vulnerability allows running arbitrary code with superuser  privileges.

IV. DETECTION

Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup v11 (Win32) has been 
confirmed vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employ firewalls, access control lists or other TCP/UDP restriction 
mechanism to limit access to systems and services.
