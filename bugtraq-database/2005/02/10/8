               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated abiword resolves security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1906
Issue date:        2005-02-08
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1906
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0645
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated abiword packages that fix a security vulnerability are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

AbiWord is a cross-platform, open-source word processor.

A buffer overflow in the wv library included in abiword allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a document with a long DateTime
field.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a 
backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Marc Deslauriers for reporting this issue,
and Dave Botsch and Marc Deslauriers and preparing updated RPMs.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is 
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or 
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
