Subject: yet another DSL modem backdoor - Mentor (Conexant)


Amazingly, despite numerous reports of backdoors in these Conexant DSL 
routers, they are *still* being shipped with the port 254 backdoor menu 
enabled...

I've just switched ADSL provider, and the new modem they sent me was a 
"Mentor MR4C/UK". It appears to be another conexant clone, and if you 
telnet to port 254 you get the familiar:

01/01/99                   CONEXANT SYSTEMS, INC. 
00:00:38
              ATU-R ACCESS RUNNER ADSL TERMINAL (Annex A) 3.27

and options to set password, reset router to default values, etc. etc. 
As before, you cannot change the login password on this interface, which 
is, in this case, "conexant".

Although this fault and the fix have been posted before, I report this 
as a reminder, and a nag to those feeble manufacturers that haven't got 
their act together...

To work around, set up virtual servers that send the port to a black hole.

If your ISP has shipped you one of these, *TELL* them! Maybe they have 
enough purchasing power to get it sorted...

cheers,
Adam
