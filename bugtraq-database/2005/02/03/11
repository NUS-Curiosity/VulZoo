Subject: New presentation: Advanced SQL Injection in Oracle databases


Hi,

this is to announce the release of a presentation called "Advanced SQL
Injection in Oracle databases". This presentation shows, with many examples,
how the SQL Injection vulnerabilities in applications that use Oracle
databases can be exploited and how to prevent this.
The topics also include buffer overflow attacks and examples using some of
the recently discovered vulnerabilities in Oracle software.

It can be downloaded from the following link:
