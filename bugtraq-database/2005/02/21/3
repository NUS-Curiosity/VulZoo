Subject: Arkeia Network Backup Client Remote Access


Anyone able to connect to TCP port 617 can gain read/write access to the 
filesystem of any host running the Arkeia agent software. This appears to 
be an intentional design decision on the part of the Arkeia developers. A 
long-winded description of this issue, complete with screen shots, 
demonstration code, and packet captures can found online at:
