What about Word documents? PDF files? Executable code? Depending on the
context the meaning of "valid" will differ greatly. So you would have to
supply a validation engine together with the signed data.

I do not know enough about the characteristics of the MD5 attack to
judge if using Base64-encoding beforehand would strongly mitigate it,
however, an abstraction layer of encoding in a well-known format would
make validation of the encoded stream easier. The big question is if
there is a gain at all when using this validation - we still do not
validate the original data, just the abstraction layer.
