Hey, Nick.  I want to confirm that I've installed GPG correctly.  Would 
you mind signing some random text, say, "sdf86*&6989h,mni lkj99j", so I 
can test it?

I'll admit I agree with your point, though.  The demonstrated collisions 
in MD5 (none have been demonstrated in SHA-1 yet) varied four high-order 
bits.  So it'd be fairly unrealistic (in the real world) to generate a 
useful collision.  Here I define "useful" to mean at least one side has 
to be intelligible (as opposed to your definition of having both sides 
be intelligible).
