Hi,

I think that kind of collision affects the "non-repudiation" property of 
digital signatures. In court, A produces message "I owe you 1 million 
dollars" signed by B. B says, "No... I signed a random string provided 
by A to prove my identity, I've been setup to sign this colliding message".

Regards,

Paul
