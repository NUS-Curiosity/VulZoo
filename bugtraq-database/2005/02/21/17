So if you want to share a secret amount 28 people such that any 15 are needed to know it, just make the secret the coefficients of a 15th order polynomial and compute 28 points that satisfy the polynomial.

Math check here, wikipedia seems to think:

If the players store their shares on insecure computer servers, an
attacker could hack in and steal the shares. If it is not practical to
change the secret, the uncompromised (Shamir-style) shares can be
renewed. The dealer generates a new random polynomial with constant term
zero and calculates for each remaining player a new ordered pair, where
the x-coordinates of the old and new pairs are the same. Each player
then adds the old and new y-coordinates to each other and keeps the
result as the new y-coordinate of the secret.

I'm confused:  "polynomial with constant term zero" "The dealer encodes
the secret as the curve's y-intercept"

now after playing with my calculator I suddenly remember something about
any polynomial's Y intercept being the constant term.  See, if all the
coefficients are 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999,
multiplied by X=0, the result is still 0.

Is wikipedia wrong here?  Or do I have a misunderstanding of "constant
term"?

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
    new problems waiting out there.
