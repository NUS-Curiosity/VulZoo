	Then somebody else would. Market demand creates solutions. I can't see how
the legal issues are any different from the ones they face when they label
software as adware or spyware.

	No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying they might do it, and if they
do, the mechanisms will appear immediately to fix it.

	No, they never do so because such strategies only work in very unusual
circumstances. Nobody can make a person pay more for something than it is
worth.

	I'm not assuming anything, I'm making an argument why it would be
self-destructive for any CA to adopt such a strategy. That doesn't mean they
won't do it, people certainly do stupid things when they think they can get
away with it. But the fact is, CAs can't get away with it. So if they think
they can, they will quickly be proven wrong.

	I could not disagree more. All a CA has to sell is its trust. The trust is
its product. CAs sell trust, they are in the trust business. If a CA loses
the trust of browser vendors, it has nothing to sell. If a CA loses the
trust of users, pressure will be put on browser vendors.

	Except that it does. Especially when all a company has to sell is its
trust. This is true in many markets where companies have specifically set up
to sell trust. You don't see people bribing the MPAA or Consumer Reports.
Because such things could not possibly be hidden, and there's an immediate
market remedy (stop trusting).
