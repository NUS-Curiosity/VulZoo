One difference occurs to me immediately.
In the CC scheme, every legitmate participant (issuing, acquiring, cardholder,
merchant et al)  have knowingly agreed to a contract under a common structure.

In CA/PKI land, you may be legally and contractually obligated and have
certain rights defined (or restricted) as a 'relying party', despite having
have no prior commercial or contractual agreement with any other entity in the
PKI heirarchy, or even knowledge that these other entities exist.

Being bound by commercial contracts without prior knowledge is a serious
impediment in the 'trust' being discussed here, imho.
