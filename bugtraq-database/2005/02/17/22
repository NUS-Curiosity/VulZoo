Just like a NIC handle, a client certificate has no intrinsic value.  
People get a NIC handle to use it in a specific process. Just like NIC 
handles don't (anymore) work cross-registry, people will have to get 
specific certificates to use in specific processes. It is only then
that certificates, being a complex technology, actually work when they 
are dumbed down and sealed off sufficiently.
Server certificates are a slightly different thing, as their number is a 
few magnitudes lower than the number of client certificates. It is only 
economically viable to distribute knowledge if the number of ignorant 
people is low enough.
