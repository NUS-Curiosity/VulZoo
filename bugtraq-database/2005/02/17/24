Subject: Re: SHA-1 broken


The standard response to "where to now" seems to be Whirlpool
[http://planeta.terra.com.br/informatica/paulobarreto/WhirlpoolPage.html].
 That or Tiger [http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/].

The team which has cracked SHA1 is the same that cracked MD5 and
exposed weaknesses in the RIPEMD model.  They're good.  And they've
shown that what I would've thought to be the Next Best Thing - RIPEMD
- is yet another flawed system.
