I am feeling smug that in a project I am working on I earlier decided
our integrity hashes would be a concatenation of MD5 and SHA-1, not
that that's a fix, but it helps.

I am also appreciating that hashes are used (this project included)
for many different things, not all of which are directly affected by
this break.  Yes, this is a bad omen for the longevity of SHA-1 for
other uses, so we will keep an eye on it.

Something I am intrigued about is more sophiticated compositions of,
say, SHA-1 and MD5.
