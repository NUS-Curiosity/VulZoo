The key difference between a CA and a CC company is that the latter 
takes part in the actual business transaction between the parties.
The customer does not have to trust the CC company to certify the shop 
because he can demand the CC issuer to do a chargeback with almost no 
questions asked.

The CC system also works in a way that is safe as long as customers 
apply common sense, which they are expected to do. It still needs to be 
figured out how to make common sense work for public key crypto on the 
other hand.
