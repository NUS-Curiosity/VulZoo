Subject: RE: eBay Account Phishing with eBay Redirect



You may want to be careful about following links like this. I have read that
part of the problem is, even if you load bogus information or no information
at all, these sites will drop keyloggers, Trojans, etc. on your machine.
Just their way of saying 'Thanks for dropping by'....    :(

I just tried this out and it worked for me.  I got a page asking for a  
login name and made up a login name and password.  After ``logging  
in'', I got a page asking for my address, phone, CCN, bank information,  
etc.  (They ask for everything!  ATM PIN, SSN, DOB, etc... who would  
actually provide this to the real eBay!?)

After I submitted my fake data, it redirected me to the real eBay login.

Regards,
Jonathan Rockway
