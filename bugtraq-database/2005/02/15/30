Subject: Re: International Domain Name [IDN] support in modern browsers allows
 attackers to spoof domain name URLs + SSL certs.



A quick (and very non-scientific) thought: Do you have trust in the 
issuer of your CC?
Do you trust a shop that has "Your major CC accepted" posted on the door?
Do you trust someone that can't provide the means to verify that trust, 
with or without the sign?
Do you, as an average tourist, even know how you could check it?

I would think that the answer lies in one of those questions..
