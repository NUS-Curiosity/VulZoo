The BBB is certainly well known, but describing it as highly accountable
is certainly inaccurate.  A quick web search will inform you that the
BBB has local 'affiliates', and that the quality of these 'affiliates'
can vary dramatically from location to location.

There's no widely screened public discussion or understanding of the
function of the BBB - and their seal of approval certainly appears on
sites and businesses they've never heard of.

cheers!
