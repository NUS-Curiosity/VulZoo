Subject: Kayako eSupport v2.3.1 Support Tracker XSS
	Vulnerability

http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Powered+By+kayako+eSupport%22+%22search+the+entire+knowledgebase%22

1290 customers according to Google.

http://support.kayako.com/index.php?_a=knowledgebase&_j=questiondetails&_i=2&nav=[XSS]&nav2=General%20eSupport%20Q&A

Vendor notified by their access log files (and this email to their sales staff):

http://support.kayako.com/index.php?_a=knowledgebase&_j=questiondetails&_i=2&nav=%3Cscript%3Ealert('msg')%3C/script%3E

Keeping this short and sweet since XSS vulns aren't that big of a deal 
to find, even still.  Clients login with cookies with a "remember me" 
check box.  I thought it was at least significant because of what "nav" 
is for.  The "nav" value is inserted as a subheading of the main page 
node, and one website I saw this at inserted html code with a link in 
the nav argument.  Nice.  One of those "double take" moments.  This XSS 
was used as a "feature", leveraged by a customer: a hosting company.  I 
was in awe.  They should simply know better.  So should Kayako.

Now, let's see how fast Kayako can release a security bulletin to their 
customers.  Isn't a security audit a part of every release?

No fix yet, since the code is proprietary.  I always release fixes for 
free software / open source code.  I can't do that with proprietary 
code, though.

Cheers,

Seth

P.S.  Vendors have burned me and their users in the past for not fessing 
up or giving credit where due; I agree with Linus Torvalds, vendor-sec 
and ideas like it are a bad idea:

"I happen to believe in openness, and vendor-sec does not. It's that 
simple." ( http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3458961 )
