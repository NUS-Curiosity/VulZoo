Subject: RE: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer not
	seeing KB887742 and KB886185


These are not security updates.  KB887742 is for a stop error
(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887742) and  KB886185 is an update for
network scope on the Windows Firewall
(http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;886185) .

The MBSA scans for Security Updates only, not every hotfix ever
released.  Note that a "Critical" patch is not necessarily a "Security"
patch.  You may be thinking of the "Maximum severity" levels of the
MS*-xxx security bulletins which are not the same thing.

Subject: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer not seeing KB887742 and
KB886185

Subject line says it all....just did a fresh install of WinXP SP2....was
using MBSAFU to make sure it would patch...which it did.  However
Windows Update shows still needing KB887742 and KB886185.  MBSA shows no
critical patches need updated.  Systeminfo shows that both KB887742 and
KB886185 are NOT installed.  I'm using latest MBSA.  Anyone else see
this?  Kinda sucks :(
