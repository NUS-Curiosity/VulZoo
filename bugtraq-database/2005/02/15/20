Subject: Re: eBay Account Phishing with eBay Redirect


I just tried this out and it worked for me.  I got a page asking for a  
login name and made up a login name and password.  After ``logging  
in'', I got a page asking for my address, phone, CCN, bank information,  
etc.  (They ask for everything!  ATM PIN, SSN, DOB, etc... who would  
actually provide this to the real eBay!?)

After I submitted my fake data, it redirected me to the real eBay login.

Regards,
Jonathan Rockway
