Of course the CA has to gain the trust of the users... There are many uses 
for client-based certificates: code signing, user verification, email 
encryption, automatic mapping of user account to personal certificates, blah 
blah blah.  The business model of commercial CA's is most certainly not 
limited to server operators only.   While personal certificate stores come 
with pre-trusted root certificates from many CA's to automatically trust 
many server-based functions, there is a vast market for client certs.
