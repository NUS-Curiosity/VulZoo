Subject: Re: Arkeia Network Backup Client Remote Access


Just to clarify, the user manual *does* mention client security and gives 
instructions for locking down the Arkeia agent. Unfortunately this is not 
enabled by default and only restricts access on a per-host basis.

Appendix B: System Security (not sure how I missed this before)
