Enterprise Update Scan Tool:
http://support.microsoft.com/?id=894193

This tool seems to be a solution between MBSA releases. This tool may be 
what you need to detect those fixes. From the URL above:

"Why does this tool exist?
Microsoft delivers this tool for certain bulletins in an MSRC release 
cycle that cannot be detected by the MBSA or the ODT. Each tool is 
specific to an MSRC release cycle."

and

"Why do the MBSA and the ODT not detect this update?
The MBSA and the ODT may not offer full detection for certain bulletins 
in an MSRC release cycle. Full detection may not be available because of 
a limitation of the detection engine or because the product that is 
affected is not supported by the MBSA or the ODT. We are working to 
resolve this issue in future versions of the MBSA through the Windows 
Update Server infrastructure. In the meantime, the Enterprise Update Scan 
Tool is designed to complement the MBSA and the ODT for security update 
detection. Whenever MBSA or ODT cannot offer detection, we plan to 
release an Enterprise Update Scan Tool."

LINUX is only free if your time is worthless.

Fear my three minute POP time-out.

There is no WorldCom, only Zuul.

WorldCom...  it was all a bad dream.

What's $11 billion between friends?

Sprint, BP, WorldCom, Qwest, Verizon..  someone make the pain stop.
