	They don't have to. I don't understand how my supermarket gets their meat,
but I trust them to use safe sources because I know that if they didn't
those who do understand would tell me, and then I'd figure out a way to
avoid it.

	No CA wants to find out what market forces will appear as soon as they
prove to be untrustworthy. There are already many vehicles for immediately
deploying blacklists. For example, Symantec could release an update for any
of their security products that removed a root CA. It wouldn't take more
than a small percent of web users to have a problem with a CA before people
wouldn't want their certificates to be signed by that CA.

	The CA market is competitive.
