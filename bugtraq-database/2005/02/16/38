Subject: xprobe2 v0.2.2 released


The xprobe2 development team is pleased to announce the immediate 
availability of Xprobe2 v0.2.2. Xprobe2 is a remote active operating 
system fingerprinting tool which uses advanced techniques, some which 
where first to be introduced with Xprobe2, such as the usage of 
statistical analysis ('fuzzy logic') to match between probe response(s) 
to its signature database and others, in order to provide with accurate 
results regarding the underlying operating system of a probed 
element(s).

Version 0.2.2 fixes a number of bugs and introduces more features:

- Added a new fingerprinting module: TCP RST|ACK
- Added the keywords: 'icmp_echo_reply = [y,n]' and 'icmp_unreach_reply 
= [y,n]'
- Added TCP ports for the '-B' command line option which searches for 
an opened TCP port for the SYN|ACK module. The TCP ports queried are: 
80, 443, 23, 21, 25, 22, 139, 445, 6000. A SYN request will be sent to 
a TCP port on the list only if the previous TCP port on the list is 
closed or not responding.
- Added a new experimental module for the detection of network 
obstacles between the scanning system to the target. The module is used 
together with the port scanner, and is enabled with the usage of a the 
'-A' command line option.

Changes made to the signature DB:

- The signature DB was updated to reflect the new R|A fingeprinting 
module and the new keywords introduces
- Added signature for Linux Kernel 2.6.10
- Added signature for Foundry Networks IronWare based devices versions 
07.6.04aT51, 07.7.01eT53
- Added signatures for a number of HP JetDirect Printers

Unique abilities with Xprobe2 v0.2.2:
The ability to distinguish between the following groups of Linux 
Kernels:
2.4.0-2.4.3
2.4.4
2.4.5-2.4.18
