Vulnerable
==========
    Acrobat Reader 7.0.0 for Windows (English Version) -- latest version
    Acrobat Reader 6.0.3 for Windows (Simplied Chinese Version)
    ( Other versions are not tested. )

Description
===========
When the "Count" value of the root page node set to a negative digit, the Adobe Reader may not crash immediately,
but if the user used mouse to click the client rectangle of the Reader immediately,
then it died. I change the "PageMode" value of "Catalog" 
to "FullScreen"(that means display the document in full-screen mode),
then the Reader crashes immediately and automatically:).
