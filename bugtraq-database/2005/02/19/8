Not trying to defend M$, (I'm sending this from Mozilla Thunderbird 
after all), but isn't this also indicative of a problem with Firefox?  
You are going somewhere other than where the status bar is telling you.

"The problem is that, when we begin to realize the potential goodness in ourselves, we often take our discovery much too seriously.  We might kill for goodness or die for goodness; we want it so badly. What is lacking is a sense of humor. Humor here does not mean telling jokes or being comical or criticizing others and laughing at them. A genuine sense of humor is having a light touch: not beating reality into the ground but appreciating reality with a light touch.  The basis of Shambhala vision is rediscovering that perfect and real sense of humor, that light touch of appreciation."
