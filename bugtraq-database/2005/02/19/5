In the last trunk build I did of Firefox (win32 build roughly 2-3 nights
ago) I see "http://ebay.com/" in the lower status bar on the test page.
~ Clicking the link takes me to ebay.  I do not see
"http://spreadfirefox.com".

| Another major vulnerability has been found in Microsoft's Internet
Explorer and Outlook Express. The flaw is in the way that these
applications can be manipulated in simple HTML code to display an URL
other than the one specified in a link, to be displayed in the status bar.
|
| The status bar is the first place users look, or at least should look
when following any link in an email or on a website to ensure that the
link is taking them to where it says it is. HTML that utilizes this
vulnerability can change what is displayed in the status bar of these
applications, thus leading to a possible major phishing hole that can be
used in very serious ways.
