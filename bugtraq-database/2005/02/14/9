	Nonsense. The CA is asking for your trust and can only earn revenue based
upon the number of people who trust it.

	This is like asking why Burger King shouldn't just use sawdust instead of
beef if they can get away with it. The answer is that people will find out,
and they'll stop trusting Burger King.

	No. The browser companies don't care much about the CAs. They're to advance
the business interests of the browser authors/vendors. And if the browser
authors/vendors include CAs that aren't trustworthy, they'll either lose
business, or create a business oppurtunity for others to lock down their
browsers.

	This I do agree with.

	This is not so much a better system as a system with a different objective.
The object of the current PKI/SSL system is to prevent MITM attacks and
ensure that you get to the domain name you entered. It is not intended to
ensure that the end host is trustworthy in any way, just that you got the
end host you wanted.

	The reason this particular problem is interesting is because it reflects a
failure of the scheme to do precisely what it was intended to do.
