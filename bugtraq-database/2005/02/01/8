Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0104 CAN-2005-0152
Debian Bug     : 292714

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CAN-2005-0104

    Upstream developers noticed that an unsanitised variable could
    lead to cross site scripting.

CAN-2005-0152

    Grant Hollingworth discovered that under certain circumstances URL
    manipulation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with
    the privileges of www-data.  This problem only exists in version
    1.2.6 of Squirrelmail.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) the problem that affects unstable
has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.
