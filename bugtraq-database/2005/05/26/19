INITIAL RELEASE:
25 May 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Unauthorized Remote Access

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX
trusted systems where the vulnerability may be exploited to allow
remote unauthorized access.

BACKGROUND:

     AFFECTED VERSIONS

     Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
           search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
           for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
           recommended patch or update is installed.


     HP-UX B.11.00
     =============
     InternetSrvcs.INETSVCS-RUN
     OS-Core.CORE-SHLIBS
     action: install PHCO_29249 and PHNE_17030 or subsequent

     HP-UX B.11.11
     =============
     OS-Core.CORE-SHLIBS
     action: install PHCO_33215 or subsequent

     HP-UX B.11.22
     =============
     OS-Core.CORE2-SHLIBS
     action: disable remshd and avoid the telnet -t option

     HP-UX B.11.23
     =============
     OS-Core.CORE2-SHLIBS
     action: install PHCO_32926 or subsequent


     END AFFECTED VERSIONS

RESOLUTION:
HP patch kits to resolve this potential vulnerability are
available for download from:

   http://itrc.hp.com

For HP-UX B.11.00  -  PHCO_29249 and PHNE_17030
For HP-UX B.11.11  -  PHCO_33215
For HP-UX B.11.23  -  PHCO_32926


For HP-UX B.11.22 the issue can be worked around by disabling
remshd and avoiding the use of the telnet -t option.  To disable
remshd, comment out all lines in /etc/inetd.conf were remshd is
mentioned.  The telnetd line in /etc/inetd.conf should be edited
to remove the -t option if it is present.  After making the
changes to inetd.conf run "/usr/sbin/inetd -c" or reboot the
system.

MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - NonUpdate
For HP-UX B.11.22,
  disable remshd and avoid the telnet -t option.

For HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, and B11.23,
  there are no manual actions.
