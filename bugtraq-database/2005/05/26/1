Synopsis
========

A format string vulnerability in gxine could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

gxine is a GTK+ and xine-lib based media player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/gxine       < 0.4.4                      *>= 0.3.3-r2
                                                          *>= 0.4.1-r1
                                                              >= 0.4.4

Description
===========

Exworm discovered that gxine insecurely implements formatted printing
in the hostname decoding function.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a carefully crafted file
with gxine, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gxine users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose media-video/gxine
