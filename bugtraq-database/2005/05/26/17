Hi,

I think this is an old bug. Please take a look at:

http://lists.virus.org/full-disclosure-0309/msg01294.html 

"*** SID-2003-3312 [ Ipswitch ] IMail Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities"

Here you can find a description of this transversal directory bug from
October 2003. But it seems that some vendors only fix things which are
released by the big ones. It makes me a little bit sad, that such a trivial
bug wasn't fixed for about one and a half year. 

And under the aspect that it seems to be an old bug, I understand this
statement:

"The discoverer of this vulnerability wishes to remain anonymous."

With Regards
