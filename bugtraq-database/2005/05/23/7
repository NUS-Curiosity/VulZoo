Subject: Meteor FTP Server v1.5 Buffer Overflow




The overflow is triggered once a series of commands have been issued with specific criteria. In theory, using the USER command followed by a large amount of data will result in memory corruption as we have seen previously. However, if the PASS and PORT command are also issued with the right arguments, the memory corruption may be re-aligned to create a buffer overflow.

Psuedo Exploitation...

USER (A x 80) (Following 4 Bytes = New Return Point)
PASS 0wn3r
PORT 127,0,0,1,18,12 (Must be same as connecting IP)

At this point the server hangs. If the connection were manually disconnected, or left to time out on it's own (5 minutes by default), the violation will be thrown.
