GNU Mailutils 0.6 imap4d fetch_io Heap overflow Vulnerability 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 05.25.05
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?type=vulnerabilities
May 25, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The GNU mailutils package is a collection of mail-related
utilities, including local and remote mailbox access services.
More information is available at the following site:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/mailutils/mailutils.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow in the fetch_io
function of the imap4d server from the GNU Project's Mailutils
package error may allow an authenticated remote attacker to 
execute arbitrary code.

The imap4d server allows remote users to retrieve their email
via the Internet Message Access Protocol, version 4rev1 as
specified in RFC3501. This is a client/server protocol supported
by a large number of email clients on multiple platforms.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of partial
message requests. By supplying a value for the 'END' parameter
equal to 2 less than the largest value an integer on the
affected system can hold, it is possible to cause the server to
allocate a much smaller chunk of memory. An overflow can occur
when this memory chunk is referenced.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a
remote authenticated used execute arbitrary commands in the
context of the 'daemon' user. As the service is forked from a
parent process, it would be possible for a remote attacker to
attempt to exploit this vulnerability multiple times, although
each failed attempt which caused a crash would be logged.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs has verified the existance of this vulnerability
in versions 0.5 and 0.6 of the GNU Mailutils package. It is
suspected that any previous versions which contain the imap4d
server are also affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDEFENSE is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for
this issue. Access to the affected host should be filtered at
the network boundary if global accessibility is not required.
Restricting access to only trusted hosts and networks may reduce
the likelihood of exploitation.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

This vulnerability has been fixed in GNU mailutils 0.6.90 which is
available for download at:

   ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/mailutils/

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2005-1521 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.
