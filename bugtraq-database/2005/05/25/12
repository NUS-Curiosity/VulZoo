Subject: davfs2 does not honour Unix permissions

davfs2 is a user-space tool to mount DAV resources into the Unix
directory tree, using the Coda kernel filesystem as a backplane.
Unfortunately, Andrew Pimlott discovered that such a mounted
filesystem does not honour the Unix permissions that stat()
presents. Details are here:

  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=310757

If anyone knows how to fix this, please get in touch with me. Given
the impending Debian release, this is an urgent matter as davfs2
will have to be removed from Debian stable if no fix could be found
by Friday.

Cheers,
