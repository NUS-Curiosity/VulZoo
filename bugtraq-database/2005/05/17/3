Synopsis
========

The FreeRADIUS server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and an SQL
injection attack, possibly allowing the compromise of the system.

Background
==========

FreeRADIUS is an open source RADIUS authentication server
implementation.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dialup/freeradius     < 1.0.2-r3                  >= 1.0.2-r3

Description
===========

Primoz Bratanic discovered that the sql_escape_func function of
FreeRADIUS may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow (BID 13541). He also
discovered that FreeRADIUS fails to sanitize user-input before using it
in a SQL query, possibly allowing SQL command injection (BID 13540).

Impact
======

By supplying carefully crafted input, a malicious user could cause a
buffer overflow or an SQL injection, possibly leading to the execution
of arbitrary code or disclosure and the modification of sensitive data.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeRADIUS users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dialup/freeradius-1.0.2-r3"
