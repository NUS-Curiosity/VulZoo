Willings WebCam <= 2.8

CONTEXT
-------
In the option settings, you can define an administrator password to protect the local 
configuration access. If the password is forgotten, and that you decide to reinstall 
for re-initialize it... damned it doesn't work. This bug was discovered by Secubox Labs 
thanks to a customer who had lost his password. The recovery tool realisation allowed us 
to put the stress on a weakness software.


VULNERABILITY
-------------
The problem resides in the fact that the application will execute a function that loads 
the password in static memory before the user has even identified himself.
A simple read operation at this address will reveal the password.
