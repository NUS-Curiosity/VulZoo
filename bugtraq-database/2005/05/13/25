Subject: Re: Linux kernel ELF core dump privilege elevation

I wasn't able to make it work either, getting exactly the same output
(without GCC's warnings). I'm on a Debian 2.6.11-7 kernel. I just tested
but really didn't even look what it failed, not even gdb'ed the core.

If someone notices what's wrong on the POC please, let me know.

Thanks,
Pablo Fernandez
