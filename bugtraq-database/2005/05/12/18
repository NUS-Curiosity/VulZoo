Subject: Security Advisory for Bugzilla 2.18, 2.19.2, and 2.16.8




Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers two security bugs that have recently been
discovered and fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ In all versions of Bugzilla since at least 2.16, it is possible
  to guess the name of a hidden product and have Bugzilla confirm that
  you were correct.
+ In Bugzilla 2.18 and above, a user's username and password are
  sometimes exposed in the URL after generating a Report.

All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.18.1.

Development snapshots of 2.19 and above are also vulnerable. If you are
using a development snapshot, you should obtain a newer one (2.19.3)
or use CVS to update or apply the patches from the specific bugs listed
below.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
-------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.10 through 2.18, 2.19.1, 2.19.2
Description: If a user correctly guesses the name of a product that
             should be invisible to them, they will be specifically
             informed that they do not have access to it, thus letting
             them know that the product exists.
             Also, users can enter bugs into products that are closed for 
             bug entry, if they correctly guess the name of the product.

Issue 2
-------
Class:       User Password Embedded in URL
Versions:    2.17.1 through 2.18, 2.19.1, 2.19.2
Description: The user's password can be embedded as part of a report URL,
             and thus visible in the web server logs, if the user is
             prompted to log in while attempting to view a chart.
