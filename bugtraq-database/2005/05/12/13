Synopsis
========

Gaim contains two vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Gaim is a full featured instant messaging client which handles a
variety of instant messaging protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/gaim       < 1.3.0                                >= 1.3.0

Description
===========

Stu Tomlinson discovered that Gaim is vulnerable to a remote stack
based buffer overflow when receiving messages in certain protocols,
like Jabber and SILC, with a very long URL (CAN-2005-1261). Siebe
Tolsma discovered that Gaim is also vulnerable to a remote Denial of
Service attack when receiving a specially crafted MSN message
(CAN-2005-1262).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could cause a buffer overflow by sending an instant
message with a very long URL, potentially leading to the execution of
malicious code. By sending a SLP message with an empty body, a remote
attacker could cause a Denial of Service or crash of the Gaim client.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gaim users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/gaim-1.3.0"
