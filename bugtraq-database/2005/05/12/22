Subject: Acrowave AAP-3100AR authetication bypass


I have found that It's possible to bypass the authentication on the Acrowave
AAP-3100AR wireless router.
By telnet'ing to the device and hitting CTRL + C at either the user name or
password prompt, I crashed
the shell, it was restarted and I was dropped to a  prompt without entering
any user name or password.
