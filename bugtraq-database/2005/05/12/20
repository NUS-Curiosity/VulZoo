Hello, 

I hope this is not considered spamming the group. I just want to make sure the community has the correct information regarding our product ExpertEraser.

It is true as Vidstrï¿½m claims that EE version 2.0 lack support for DCO (as do most competing products).

When we became aware of this weakness (26.04.2005) we investigated, and corrected the problem. All versions shipped after this friday (13.05.2005) will support DCO.

Now one could (and should) argue that we should have known about DCO from the moment it was proposed in the t13 commitee. Our response to that is that we are not happy with allowing this miss to happen. In fact we are downright embarressed, and will make every effort to prevent anything similar from happening in the future.

So, even though we are not proud of our DCO miss, the fact is that ExpertEraser now supports DCO.
