On the SEC-1 web site, they are listed as a "RSA SecurWorld Select
Partner", an honor they've held since at least 2002.  Is RSA so
unresponsive to security flaw reports that they do not respond even to
their "select partners"?

I just now noticed Gary Oleary-Steele's Full-Disclosure+Bugtraq posts
of 18-Mar-2005 looking for a RSA security contact.  I wish I would
have noticed them at the time, but I filter both lists so I only see
messages containing certain keywords (such as "SecurID"), and thus I
missed reading that post.
