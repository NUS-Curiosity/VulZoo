Synopsis
========

A flaw in the decoding of network packets renders TCPDump vulnerable to
a remote Denial of Service attack.

Background
==========

TCPDump is a tool for network monitoring and data acquisition.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/tcpdump     < 3.8.3-r2                   >= 3.8.3-r2

Description
===========

TCPDump improperly handles and decodes ISIS, BGP, LDP (CAN-2005-1279)
and RSVP (CAN-2005-1280) packets. TCPDump might loop endlessly after
receiving malformed packets.

Impact
======

A malicious remote attacker can exploit the decoding issues for a
Denial of Service attack by sending specially crafted packets, possibly
causing TCPDump to loop endlessly.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TCPDump users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/tcpdump-3.8.3-r2"
