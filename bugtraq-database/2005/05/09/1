Synopsis
========

The GnuTLS library is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks.

Background
==========

GnuTLS is a free TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 implementation for the GNU
project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/gnutls       < 1.2.3                            >= 1.2.3
                                                            *>= 1.0.25

Description
===========

A vulnerability has been discovered in the record packet parsing in the
GnuTLS library. Additionally, a flaw was also found in the RSA key
export functionality.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability and cause a Denial
of Service to any application that utilizes the GnuTLS library.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuTLS users should remove the existing installation and upgrade to
the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --unmerge gnutls
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-libs/gnutls

Due to small API changes with the previous version, please do the
following to ensure your applications are using the latest GnuTLS that
you just emerged.

    # revdep-rebuild --soname-regexp libgnutls.so.1[0-1]

Previously exported RSA keys can be fixed by executing the following
command on the key files:

    # certtool -k infile outfile
