Subject: Re: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook


you can also do it with HTML.
eg. <a href="http://www.cybertrion.com">http://www.foo-labs.info</a>
and in addition u can change the text wich is shown when the cursor is
over the link:
<a href="http://www.cybertrion.com"
alt="http://www.foo-labs.info">http://www.foo-labs.info</a>

Sorry for my bad english.
