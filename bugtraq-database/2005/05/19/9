Subject: Re: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook


How is this any different than having the text of a link say something other
than the URL?  This is possible in HTML (in any application) and Microsoft
Office application.  For example, go into Word and type "some text" then
highlight it, and press Ctrl+K.  Then type in the URL you want.  This is now a
hyperlink.  Also note that the tool tip should show the correct link.

This is essentially the same as the following HTML:
<A HREF="http://evil">http://safe</A>
