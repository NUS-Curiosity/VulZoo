Try the following link:
/jgs_portal_statistik.php?meinaction=mitglieder&month=1&year=1&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;

JGS-Portal doesn't report an error and the year parameter is passed unfiltered. This is definitively the problem of JGS-Portal.


If a SQL-error occurs and the error message contains Cross Site Scripting code, than you're completely right.
