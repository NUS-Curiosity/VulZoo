Hi,

I cannot reproduce this using Outlook 2003. I tried it in several ways
(overwriting, inserting and deleting). The link always leads to the site
which is shown as link.

Regards,

Betreff: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook

An issue has been discovered in MS Outlook (All
Versions) where anyone can fake a URL & send it across.

How does it work:

Lets compose an email in MS Outlook, lets type


http://www.cybertrion.com & put a space after it to make it a link. Now
put your cursor just before cybertrion & type any URL for eg: 
http://www.foo-labs.info now send it to anyone. The receiver will see the
URL as http://www.foo-labs.info but when he clicks on it it will directly
take him to http://www.cybertrion.com

I am not sure how critical this is but it can fool alot of people & result
in download of a virus.
