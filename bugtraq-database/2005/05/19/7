Subject: RE: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook


Sorry to shoot you down, but this isn't a security issue at all. You can
do the same thing by typing some text, highlighting it, right-clicking,
clicking Hyperlink, and typing an address. 

On the receiving end, the client will get:
<a href="http://www.foo-labs.info">http://www.cybertrion.com</a>
which is perfectly fine. They'll see after they click on the link that
they're going to foo-labs. At that point, it's out of Outlook's hands.

Now, if Outlook showed in the mouseover the cybertrion.com link, then
they would be a problem, but it appears to be working fine on Outlook
2003. Haven't tested previous versions, but this seems like it's
"working as designed".

Subject: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook

An issue has been discovered in MS Outlook (All
Versions) where anyone can fake a URL & send it
across.

How does it work:

Lets compose an email in MS Outlook, lets type


http://www.cybertrion.com & put a space after it to
make it a link. Now put your cursor just before
cybertrion & type any URL for eg: 
http://www.foo-labs.info now send it to anyone. The
receiver will see the URL as http://www.foo-labs.info
but when he clicks on it it will directly take him to
http://www.cybertrion.com

I am not sure how critical this is but it can fool
alot of people & result in download of a virus.
