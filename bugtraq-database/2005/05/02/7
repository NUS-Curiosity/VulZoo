SIGKILL (Signal 9) cannot be blocked, so try:

kill -s SIGKILL <pid>
-or-
killall -KILL atac

It's an IRC bot, should be obvious, but just commenting...

Again, there is no way to block SIGKILL (signal 9) for any program

This is where things get really scary for you. DCC is the ability to
send files over IRC. The bot could have sent almost anything (within
certain permission ranges, we hope). Now is a very good time to
disconnect the server from the internet if you have not already done
so.

This line seems to indicate that this bot is only designed to be part
of a larger "bot-net" to DoS someone, but those DCC capabilities are
worrysome. So, in addition to investigating how this got into your
server, it would also be a good idea to check what might have gotten
out.

Good luck, and apologies if you already knew all of this.
