Subject: Can't trust COMODO


Hey List,

For a company that supposedly provides "Anti-fraud protection" and "identity
assurance" - why do they clearly plagiarise someone else's copyright
whitepaper material and present it as their own work?  So much for a
"security company" you can trust.

As many of you are aware, I produced a whitepaper mid-2004 called "The
Phishing Guide" (http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/NISR-WP-Phishing.pdf)
that covered in detail the phishing threat and reviewed some defences.  It
would now appear that COMODO (http://www.comodogroup.com/) in their infinite
wisdom think they can repackage the paper as their own work by calling it
"Identity Assurance in a Virtual World"
(http://www.vengine.com/pdfs/identity_assurance.pdf - dated 21/02/2005).

I can assure you that I never gave permission for their recycling of my
material.  In fact I'd never heard of them until someone researching
Phishing pointed out that COMODO illegally copied my paper.

The paper appears to have been "written" by Steve Roylance - Technical
Marketing Director (and the PDF details also refer to him).

Has anyone on the list had similar experience with them?

What should the next step be? 

Cheers,

Gunter
