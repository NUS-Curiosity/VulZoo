   Running 'strings' on atac reveals that it does an ssh brute force login
   attack on remote systems.  Interesting enough, our security logs last
   night showed such an attempt against some of our clients systems, with
   EXACTLY the same sequence of trial user names!  So you have a copy of
   the tool that was being used against them.
