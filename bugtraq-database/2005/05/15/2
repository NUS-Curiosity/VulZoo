Synopsis
========

PostgreSQL is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks and possibly
allows unprivileged users to gain administrator rights.

Background
==========

PostgreSQL is a SQL compliant, open source object-relational database
management system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/postgresql     < 8.0.2-r1                     *>= 7.4.7-r2
                                                          *>= 8.0.1-r3
                                                           >= 8.0.2-r1

Description
===========

PostgreSQL gives public EXECUTE access to a number of character
conversion routines, but doesn't validate the given arguments
(CAN-2005-1409). It has also been reported that the contrib/tsearch2
module of PostgreSQL misdeclares the return value of some functions as
"internal" (CAN-2005-1410).

Impact
======

An attacker could call the character conversion routines with specially
setup arguments to crash the backend process of PostgreSQL or to
potentially gain administrator rights. A malicious user could also call
the misdeclared functions of the contrib/tsearch2 module, resulting in
a Denial of Service or other, yet uninvestigated, impacts.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PostgreSQL users should update to the latest available version and
follow the guide at http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.315

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-db/postgresql
