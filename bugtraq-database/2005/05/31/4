Trustix Secure Linux Bugfix Advisory #2005-0026

Package name:      anaconda bittorrent iptables lilo mod_perl openldap
                   php php4 pptpd samba squid
Summary:           Package fixes
Date:              2005-05-31
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  anaconda:
  The anaconda package contains portions of the Trustix Secure Linux
  installation program which can then be run by the user for
  reconfiguration and advanced installation options.
  Based on Red Hat anaconda 7.2 and 7.3
  
  bittorrent:
  BitTorrent gives you the same freedom to publish previously enjoyed by
  only a select few with special equipment and lots of money.
  You have something terrific to publish -- a large music or video file,
  software, a game or anything else that many people would like to have.
  But the more popular your file becomes, the more you are punished by
  soaring bandwidth costs. If your file becomes phenomenally successful
  and a flash crowd of hundreds or thousands try to get it at once, your
  server simply crashes and no one gets it.  There is a solution to this
  vicious cycle. BitTorrent, the result of over two years of intensive
  development, is a simple and free software product that addresses all
  of these problems.
  
  iptables:
  The iptables utility controls the network packet filtering code in the
  Linux kernel. If you need to set up firewalls and/or IP masquerading,
  you must install this package.
  
  lilo:
  LILO (LInux LOader) is a basic system program which boots your Linux
  system.  LILO loads the Linux kernel from a floppy or a hard drive,
  boots the kernel and passes control of the system to the kernel.  LILO
  can also boot other operating systems.
  
  mod_perl:
  Mod_perl incorporates a Perl interpreter into the Apache web server,
  so that the Apache web server can directly execute Perl code.
  Mod_perl links the Perl runtime library into the Apache web server and
  provides an object-oriented Perl interface for Apache's C language
  API.  The end result is a quicker CGI script turnaround process, since
  no external Perl interpreter has to be started.
  
  openldap:
  LDAP servers and clients, as well as interfaces to other protocols.
  Note that this does not include the slapd interface to X.500 and
  therefore does not require the ISODE package.
  
  php:
  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language.  PHP attempts to make it
  easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages.  PHP
  also offers built-in database integration for several commercial
  and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
  database-enabled web page with PHP is fairly simple.  The most
  common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI
  scripts.  The mod_php module enables the Apache web server to
  understand and process the embedded PHP language in web pages.
  
  php4:
  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language.  PHP attempts to make it
  easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages.  PHP
  also offers built-in database integration for several commercial
  and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
  database-enabled web page with PHP is fairly simple.  The most
  common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI
  scripts.  The mod_php module enables the Apache web server to
  understand and process the embedded PHP language in web pages.
  
  pptpd:
  PPTPd, Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol Daemon, offers out
  connections to pptp clients to become virtual members of the IP pool
  owned by the pptp server.  In effect, these clients become virtual
  members of the local subnet, regardless of what their real IP address
  is.  A tunnel is built between the pptp server and client, and packets
  from the subnet are wrapped and passed between server and client
  similar to other C/S protocols.
  
  samba:
  Samba provides an SMB server which can be used to provide network
  services to SMB (sometimes called "Lan Manager") clients, including
  various versions of MS Windows, OS/2, and other Linux machines. Samba
  uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocols and does NOT need NetBEUI
  (Microsoft Raw NetBIOS frame) protocol.
  
  squid:
  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
  supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
  caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
  non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
  hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
  DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.
