Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in HT Editor, potentially
leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

HT is a hex editor, designed to help analyse and modify executable
files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-editors/hteditor     < 0.8.0-r2                   >= 0.8.0-r2

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Team discovered an integer
overflow in the ELF parser, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
The vendor has reported that an unrelated buffer overflow has been
discovered in the PE parser.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require the victim to open a specially
crafted file using HT, potentially permitting an attacker to execute
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All hteditor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/hteditor-0.8.0-r2"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
