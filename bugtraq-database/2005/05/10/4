ColdFusion MX 7 cross-site scripting in default error page 

Originally posted: May 10, 2005 

~~~~~~~ 

SUMMARY 

The default error page in the optional-use JRun Web Server 
bundled with ColdFusion MX 7 is vulnerable to a cross-site 
scripting attack. 

~~~~~~~ 

SOLUTION 

Define a custom error page or download and install the 
patch referenced below or use an alternative Web Server 
with ColdFusion. 

~~~~~~~ 

Affected Software Versions 

ColdFusion MX 7.0 

~~~~~~~ 

Severity Rating 

Macromedia categorizes this issue as a moderate update and 
recommends users patch their installations immediately. 

~~~~~~~ 

Details 

A specially encoded URL can be used to create a cross-site 
scripting attack through the default 404 error page. 
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a user to follow 
a hyperlink to a page that doesnï¿½t exist on the server. 

Most customers using ColdFusion MX 7 will not be affected 
by this vulnerability because the majority of customers run 
ColdFusion MX 7 with other web servers. This vulnerability 
does not affect ColdFusion servers using connectors to any 
other web server such as IIS or Apache. Although the JRun 
Web Server is included with ColdFusion MX 7, it is not 
recommended for use in production environments and is 
intended for configuration, evaluation and testing purposes 
only. 

~~~~~~~ 

Making the Changes 
 
NOTE: Back up your existing files before making changes. 
As always, test the changes in a non-production environment 
before applying the changes to production servers. 

Install the security patch from the ColdFusion MX 7 
Administrator. The installation process is the same for 
all platforms and installation choices. 

1. Download chf70-60112.jar (2K). 

2. Open the ColdFusion MX 7 Administrator and select the 
System Information page. 

3. Next to the Update File field, select the Browse Button 
and browse to the downloaded file. 

4. Select the file and click Submit. 

5. Restart ColdFusion. 

The ColdFusion MX 7 hot fix JAR file does not need to be 
retained after installing it with the ColdFusion 
Administrator. The file has been copied into the correct 
location. 

The ColdFusion MX 7 hot fix JAR file will appear in the 
System Information list.
