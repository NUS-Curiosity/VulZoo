Synopsis
========

The libTIFF library is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tag Image
File Format) images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/tiff       < 3.7.2                            >= 3.7.2

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered a
stack based buffer overflow in the libTIFF library when reading a TIFF
image with a malformed BitsPerSample tag.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require the victim to open a specially
crafted TIFF image, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.7.2"
