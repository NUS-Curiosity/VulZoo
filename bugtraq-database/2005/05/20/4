Errata
======

This advisory incorrectly described FreeRADIUS versions as being
vulnerable to a remote compromise. After further verifications, it
appears to only result in potential Denial of Service. The SQL injection
issue is not affected by this. Many thanks to Nicolas Baradakis for
bringing this to our attention.

The corrected sections appear below.

Synopsis
========

The FreeRADIUS server is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack and a
buffer overflow, possibly resulting in disclosure and modification of
data and Denial of Service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dialup/freeradius     < 1.0.2-r4                  >= 1.0.2-r4

Description
===========

Primoz Bratanic discovered that the sql_escape_func function of
FreeRADIUS may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow (BID 13541). He also
discovered that FreeRADIUS fails to sanitize user-input before using it
in a SQL query, possibly allowing SQL command injection (BID 13540).

Impact
======

By supplying carefully crafted input, a malicious user could cause an
SQL injection or a buffer overflow, possibly leading to the disclosure
and the modification of sensitive data or Denial of Service by crashing
the server.

Resolution
==========

All FreeRADIUS users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dialup/freeradius-1.0.2-r4"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
