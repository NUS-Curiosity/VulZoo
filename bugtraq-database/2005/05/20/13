Wow. MS really fucked up on this one. 

FYI, though, I've confirmed this vulnerability on Outlook 2003, IE6,
and, shockingly, Mozilla Thunderbird, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. In
fact, it almost seems as if *every* browser or other application that
renders HTML has this "feature" of displaying the text inside a <a> tag!

I, for one, am shocked and apalled that anyone could be so irresponsible
as to write such a vulnerability into production code. By allowing
links in their HTML pages, application writers make it trivially easy to
trick viewers into visiting web sites they didn't intend to! This can
lead to phishing attacks, viruses, widespread panic, and mass hysteria! 

Severity ranking: High!

PS: If you weren't talking about just changing the link text, I
apologize for the above sarcasm.
