Subject: phpbb 2.0.15 released - patches high critical vuln


I don't normally send an email about updated packages, but this one fixes 
a potentially serious issue.

re: http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=288194

A high risk bbcode.php vulnerability is patched with this version, at the
very least please patch it via the link above.  It was discovered by
Papados and patched by myself.  In agreement with phpbb.com, we'll
(CastleCops) release the full details in five days.  A CVE has been
obtained.
