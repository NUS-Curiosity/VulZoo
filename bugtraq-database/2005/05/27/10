vulnerability

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory BEA05-V0100
http://www.appsecinc.com/resources/alerts/general/BEA-001.html
May 27, 2005

Affected versions: BEA WebLogic Server 7.0 and 8.1

Risk level: High

Credits: This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Agustín
Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.

Background:
The Administration Console is a web browser-based, graphical user
interface used to manage a WebLogic Server domain. The Administration
Console supports a full range of product administrative tasks. A
cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the login page of the
Console.

Details:
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when an attacker tricks a
legitimate web application into sending malicious code, generally in
the form of a script, to an unsuspecting end user. The attack usually
involves crafting a hyperlink with malicious script code embedded
within it. A valid user is likely to click on this link since it
points to a resource on a trusted domain. The link can be posted on a
web page, or sent in an instant message, or email. Clicking the link
executes the attacker-injected code in the context of the trusted web
application. Typically, the code steals session cookies, which can
then be used to impersonate a valid user.

Parameters provided to the error page of the Administration Console
are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. User-supplied input to
these parameters is returned without proper sanitization, allowing a
malicious attacker to inject arbitrary scripting code.

To get the session cookie a remote attacker could send this link to
the administrator:
http://vulnerablesite:7001/console/a?=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

Impact:
Attackers can steal administrator's session cookies and password,
thereby allowing the attacker to impersonate the valid user.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this issue.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
For BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 8.1 upgrade to Service
Pack 4. Apply the patch on top of it located at
ftp://ftpna.bea.com/pub/releases/security/CR202495_810sp4.jar on top

For BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 7.0 upgrade to Service
Pack 6. Apply the patch located at
ftp://ftpna.bea.com/pub/releases/security/CR214457_700sp6.jar on top
