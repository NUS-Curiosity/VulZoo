Synopsis
========

The imap4d server and the mail utility from GNU Mailutils contain
multiple vulnerabilities, potentially allowing a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

Background
==========

GNU Mailutils is a collection of mail-related utilities, including an
IMAP4 server (imap4d) and a Mail User Agent (mail).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/mailutils      < 0.6-r1                        >= 0.6-r1

Description
===========

infamous41d discovered several vulnerabilities in GNU Mailutils. imap4d
does not correctly implement formatted printing of command tags
(CAN-2005-1523), fails to validate the range sequence of the "FETCH"
command (CAN-2005-1522), and contains an integer overflow in the
"fetch_io" routine (CAN-2005-1521). mail contains a buffer overflow in
"header_get_field_name()" (CAN-2005-1520).

Impact
======

A remote attacker can exploit the format string and integer overflow in
imap4d to execute arbitrary code as the imap4d user, which is usually
root. By sending a specially crafted email message, a remote attacker
could exploit the buffer overflow in the "mail" utility to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running mail. Finally, a
remote attacker can also trigger a Denial of Service by sending a
malicious FETCH command to an affected imap4d, causing excessive
resource consumption.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU Mailutils users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/mailutils-0.6-r1"
