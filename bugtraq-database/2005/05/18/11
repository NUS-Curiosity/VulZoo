Does this occur because the XSS-style attacks are being injected into
SQL queries, which then generate errors because the queries are
malformed, and then PHP blindly reflects the malformed query back to
the user without quoting XSS-relevant characters?  That would seem to
be more of a problem with the application's runtime environment
(i.e. PHP) than JGS-Portal itself.

Part of why I ask this is because these days, a lot of people are
reporting both XSS and SQL injection problems for the same
applications and the same parameters, which could well be traced back
to the same underlying SQL injection problem in the application.
Whether "error reflection XSS" is PHP's fault or the application's
fault is another question.
