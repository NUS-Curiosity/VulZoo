Synopsis
========

A command validation error in umount can lead to an escalation of
privileges.

Background
==========

util-linux is a suite of useful Linux programs including umount, a
program used to unmount filesystems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/util-linux     < 2.12q-r3                    >= 2.12q-r3

Description
===========

When a regular user mounts a filesystem, they are subject to
restrictions in the /etc/fstab configuration file. David Watson
discovered that when unmounting a filesystem with the '-r' option, the
read-only bit is set, while other bits, such as nosuid or nodev, are
not set, even if they were previously.

Impact
======

An unprivileged user facing nosuid or nodev restrictions can umount -r
a filesystem clearing those bits, allowing applications to be executed
suid, or have device nodes interpreted. In the case where the user can
freely modify the contents of the filesystem, privilege escalation may
occur as a custom program may execute with suid permissions.

Workaround
==========

Two workarounds exist, first, the suid bit can be removed from the
umount utility, or users can be restricted from mounting and unmounting
filesystems in /etc/fstab.

Resolution
==========

All util-linux users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/util-linux-2.12q-r3"
