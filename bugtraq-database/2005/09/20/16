I think some people just try to hard to find problems with PHPBB.  Yes, this
is a "bug", but it's FAR from a security issue.

LOL.

Comment added by team member:

This isn't a security problem. You can do the same thing with a standard
webpage. As for checking remote avatar size, there are several inherit
problems with that, which I won't detail here. As this isn't a security
problem, closing.

» My personnal opinion:

I think this is a minor security problem. A malicious user can use larger
images
(for example: 1280px - 1024px) to almost damage the entire view of a
topic. This, to
be done, has to have Remote Avatar selected.

So, if the admins don't consider this a minor security problem, what
is it? A "special"
feature?

I don't want to criticize the phpBB coders, but why is it dificult to
check out the size
of a image and telling the user that that size of image it's not
possible, or even block the
size on the viewtopic table, something like that.


» Possible solution:

Disable remote avatar or just dig in the code to set the image size you
want.
