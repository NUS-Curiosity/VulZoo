Microsoft has a research team that seeks out new spyware threats for the 
MSAS database.  They write up their own analysis so the threats listed in 
our database most likely have a different name and method for identifying 
malware BHOs.  The experts here at CCSP do share information on new 
threats we find with all Antivirus, Antispyware, AntiTrojan vendors 
(including MSAS) so that everyone has protection as soon as possible.

Microsoft has enormous resources to find new threats and they additionally 
rely on their Spynet community and their new technology codenamed Strider 
using HoneyMonkeys to automatically crawl the web to find new malware 
threats.
