Subject: Re: FireFox Host: Buffer Overflow is not just

This problem also effects Thunderbird (tested) and im guessing
Netscape's Mail client (untested) which it really can't do much except
cause Thunderbird/Netscape to crash without javascript.

Include the linked source in an email for your testing.
