               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated grip package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152919
Issue date:        2005-09-15
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-2005-0706
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

A new grip package is available that fixes a remote buffer overflow.

Grip is a GTK+ based front-end for CD rippers (such as cdparanoia and
cdda2wav) and Ogg Vorbis encoders.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Dean Brettle discovered a buffer overflow bug in the way grip handles
data returned by CDDB servers. It is possible that if a user connects to
a malicious CDDB server, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the
victim's machine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0706 to this issue.

Users of grip should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
