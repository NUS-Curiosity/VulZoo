Subject: Mozilla Firefox "Host:" Buffer Overflow Exploit

(Just a little heads up, no details or PoC attached)
 The security vulnerability in Mozilla FireFox reported by Tom Ferris is 
exploitable on Windows.
I developed a working exploit that seems to be 100% stable, though I've only 
tested it on one system.
The exploit will not be released publicly untill patches are out.
 On a side note: it took only about 3 hours and 30 minutes to develop the 
exploit, so I might not be the only one able to write it.
 Cheers,
SkyLined
