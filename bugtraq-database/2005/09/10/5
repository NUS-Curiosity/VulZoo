It's still making a difference and not only on Cisco products. When
You have MTU sized down to 576 it's quite harder to push full BGP
table fast. When MTU is 1500, or something around that, you're just
synchronizing faster, because You may pack more information in one
packet.

There's a bunch of presentations freely available that show performance
of BGP sessions with various network-level tweaks.
