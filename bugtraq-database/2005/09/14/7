Hi Juha!

I did the same on the 10th of September - still no reply nor official
statement from Netscape which makes me a little worried.

Correct. I reported that workaround on the 10th of September.

I did so using both the security address at netscape.com and the "submission
form" on Netscape's official webpage. I never got any reply/respons from
netscape. 

Netscape uses the same rendering engine as Firefox (unless explicitly told
to use IE) and as such, will also be vulnerable. The workaround, covered by
the Mozilla Team, will correct the problem simply by disabling IDN.
