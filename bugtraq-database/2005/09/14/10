Aren't you just capitalizing on it yourself?

Blackhat has just become another term for 'hasn't done anything'

Non-critical to who? You? Believe it or not, some people, gasp, actually do
use ASCII logging.

Maybe, I grabbed my snapshot from snort.org, and as of my last email you
could find it there to.

Oops, mistake on your part, its okay though I understand that we can't all
be so bright as to get our sources from snort.org, and I'm used to dealing
with ignorant and rude people, I do after all live in Vegas.

The rest really isn't worth replying to, PHC spawned a million idiots like
you running around pretending to be blackhats with cool netmasks like
'whiteh8.net', never actually doing anything and hiding behind the guise
that you don't believe in disclosure to cover the fact that you haven't
written nor found any exploits, and in the end you end up being just as bad
as (most of) the whitehats, useless and ignorant.

So basically your point is you don't have a clue, are a superfluous
twit, incompetent fame whore, and chump?

Perhaps you just sit in your chair masturbating to captured porn all
day and that is why you didn't have time to verify your specious shit.
Give me your address and I will send you the lapjuicer so you can at
least make a profit when you and your buddies get together.

Just my personal grumpy thoughts of the moment.
