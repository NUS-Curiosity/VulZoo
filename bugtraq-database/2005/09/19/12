Dear contact@...scanner.com,

Wow!  Local  information leak for Pocket PC ;)

The  problem is exploitation is not trivial - it requires local attacker
to  be  able to install software, because (as far as I know) there is no
default  application  for Windows for Mobile to browse registry. Because
Windows  for Mobile is not real multi-user system, this issue can not be
classified as security one.
