Subject: Whitepaper - Writing small shellcode


I have written a short whitepaper describing techniques for writing small
shellcode. This can be downloaded from:

http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/WritingSmallShellcode.pdf

Abstract
This paper describes an attempt to write Win32 shellcode that is as small as
possible, to perform a common task subject to reasonable constraints. The
solution presented implements a bindshell in 191 bytes of null-free code,
and outlines some general ideas for writing small shellcode.
