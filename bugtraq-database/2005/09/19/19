If you read the code and original advisory, there is filtering already in
place within the PHP-Nuke framework that monitors HTTP GETs.  As such,
this 'exploit' makes use of variables which should only be passed via HTTP
GETs and not POSTs nor cookies.

Proper data sanitization for this is simply to retrieve what is expected:

$name = $_GET['name'];

The function you specify like http://php.net/addslashes is neither here
nor there.  Why use that function for a variable in POST or cookies when
it is clearly expected to be returned via GET alone?

Ergo:

register_globals off !

If you desire to filter $_POST['name'] and/or $_COOKIE['name'] go for it.  
I can tell you that those values are never to be expected in PHP-Nuke so 
you are just adding extra overhead.
