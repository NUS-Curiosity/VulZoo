Subject: Character Manipulation in Online Systems.


Applicable to Almost all the discussion forums or places which require you an Email System...

Risk : Medium 
(being just 18 years old, i can not write a very attractive article, but i will try my best)

I discovered this Trick after playing with Orkut, then tried it on some other Portals For INstance it has been checked with

Dotnetnuke 
Rainbow Portal
VBBulletin
Invision Power Board 
Orkut
Invision Power Board v2.0.4

Reaction :
--------

THere is a "Reverse Character" which works on windows XP/200/2003 and NT Operating systems (not verfied on other OS's)
this "reverse Character is UNI-Code used to change the character line from left to the right 
but if used in the forums and other places which require a "Username" it simply Vanishes as a Blank Character and the FORUM/PORTAL never generates an error of Illegal Character rather it simply accepts it ... but the actual Problem comes after this ...
few cases :
---------
� Blank UserNames (neglecting the check of minnimum 3 visible characters)
� This is the most effected scenario ... any where your "reverse character" will come it will simply reverse the order of text on its front or back ... so if there is Module showing online users from last 60 Hours and your name comes on the first line then it will simply Reverse the Text of the First Line, Not only for YOu but also for everyuser visiting the forum.
� It messes up with Forum/Portal Newsletters and Notifications via Email's as you username gets used in many places ...
� SIte Admin dont like such effects but rather then deleting the account its wise to substitute the name with there email ID (before the "@" part )
Example text below.

The 2nd line used the Reverse Character and the reverse Character is placed in the next line copy from there.

This Sums up my Finding's 
the solution is not known to me, as its a job for the experts and the respect software owner
for Pictorial Examples any one can ask in the forums on
