Airscanner Mobile Security Advisory #05081101:
vxWeb v.1.1.4 Denial of Service Vulnerability

Risk Level:
Low

Summary:
vxWeb is a complete multi-threaded web server for Windows CE-based devices. However, it is vulnerable to a stack based buffer overflow that results in an instant crash of the web server. 

Details:
GET /Ax1000
.text:0001C310 BL __2_YAPAXI_Z ; operator new(uint)

The YAPAXI or set(UINT) command (located in coredll.dll) ends up reading data off the stack which can be overwritten by a long request. As a result, code in coredll.dll will be fed invalid datatypes, an exception will be thrown, and the web server will crash. We were not able to get code into the program counter (PC). We were able to manually insert values that permitted the yapaxi function to continue on, but this did not result in any other interesting results. 

Workaround:
None

Vendor Response:
Waiting response.
