Subject: Re: AWstats Path Disclosure Vulnerability


Hi !

If you use this url :
http://www.server.com/awstats/awstats.pl?config=xxx

You will get the full path on the hard drive of the script "awstats.pl" 
with all sub folders.
To prevent an attack, this is the kind of information you should hide.

If you search "full path disclosure" on google or on bugtraq you will 
find many security issue.
It is not a critical vulnerability but we should be aware.

Best regards.
