Subject: Revised paper on "ICMP attacks against TCP"


Folks,

I have submitted to the IETF a revised version of my internet-draft on 
"ICMP attacks against TCP".

This version addresses the feedback I have received during the last eight 
months, and includes, among other things, pointers to existing 
implementations of the proposed fixes.

It will soon be available from the internet-drafts public repository. In 
the mean time, you can access it through my web site: 
http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/draft-gont-tcpm-icmp-attacks-04.txt 
(http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/icmp-attacks-against-tcp.html)

As always, feedback is welcome. Noise should be sent to /dev/null.

Kindest regards,

--
