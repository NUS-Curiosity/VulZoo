Synopsis
========

OpenTTD is vulnerable to format string vulnerabilities which may result
in remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenTTD is an open source clone of the simulation game "Transport
Tycoon Deluxe" by Microprose.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /   Vulnerable   /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-simulation/openttd     < 0.4.0.1-r1           >= 0.4.0.1-r1

Description
===========

Alexey Dobriyan discovered several format string vulnerabilities in
OpenTTD.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to crash the
OpenTTD server or client and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running OpenTTD.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenTTD users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=games-simulation/openttd-0.4.0.1-r1"
