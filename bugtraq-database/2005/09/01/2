Synopsis
========

A heap overflow in MPlayer might lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player capable of handling multiple multimedia file
formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /    Vulnerable    /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mplayer      < 1.0_pre7-r1             >= 1.0_pre7-r1

Description
===========

Sven Tantau discovered a heap overflow in the code handling the strf
chunk of PCM audio streams.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious video or audio file which, when
opened using MPlayer, would end up executing arbitrary code on the
victim's computer with the permissions of the user running MPlayer.

Workaround
==========

You can mitigate the issue by adding "ac=-pcm," to your MPlayer
configuration file (note that this will prevent you from playing
uncompressed audio).

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre7-r1"
