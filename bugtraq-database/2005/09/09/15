  Well, at least what I've seen is a level 3 polymorphism, due to the fact that
  you don't perform instrucction mixing, but block mixing which is quite
  different.

  Don't get me wrong, I love to see this kind of source and I'm a great fan of
  polymorphic engines :) Just making a note that your approach needs a little
  bit more of tweaking :)
