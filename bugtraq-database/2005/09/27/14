Synopsis
========

PHP makes use of an affected PCRE library and ships with an affected
XML-RPC library and is therefore potentially vulnerable to remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language widely used to develop
web-based applications. It can run inside a web server using the
mod_php module or the CGI version of PHP, or can run stand-alone in a
CLI.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/php         < 4.4.0-r1                      *>= 4.3.11-r1
                                                           >= 4.4.0-r1
  2  dev-php/mod_php     < 4.4.0-r2                      *>= 4.3.11-r1
                                                           >= 4.4.0-r2
  3  dev-php/php-cgi     < 4.4.0-r2                      *>= 4.3.11-r2
                                                           >= 4.4.0-r2
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     3 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

PHP makes use of a private copy of libpcre which is subject to an
integer overflow leading to a heap overflow (see GLSA 200508-17). It
also ships with an XML-RPC library affected by a script injection
vulnerability (see GLSA 200508-13).

Impact
======

An attacker could target a PHP-based web application that would use
untrusted data as regular expressions, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code. If web applications make use of the
XML-RPC library shipped with PHP, they are also vulnerable to remote
execution of arbitrary PHP code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php

All mod_php users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/mod_php

All php-cgi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-php/php-cgi
