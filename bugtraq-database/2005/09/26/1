The reason that this works in this case is that this is *not* a GIF
header; GIF headers do not begin with "<". It is well known that IE will
interpret files as HTML that contain certain HTML tags if a another type
detection doesn't override it.

For Microsoft's vague documentation on this process, see:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/networking/moniker/overview/appendix_a.asp

If you remove the "<" at the beginning, then IE will detect the GIF
signature, overriding its HTML detection, and show a 'broken image' icon
with no interpretation of JavaScript.

(Tested MSIE 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2)

However the advice is good; as a general rule sites accepting uploads
should validate them as carefully as possible, as IE may not recognize
all file types properly. Invalid image file headers and HTML-like tags
near the start of a file should be considered suspicious.
