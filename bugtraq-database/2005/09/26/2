Synopsis
========

Qt is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit used by KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/qt     < 3.3.4-r8                            >= 3.3.4-r8

Description
===========

Qt links to a bundled vulnerable version of zlib when emerged with the
zlib USE-flag disabled. This may lead to a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers can
overwrite data structures for applications that use Qt, resulting in a
Denial of Service or potentially arbitrary code execution.

Workaround
==========

Emerge Qt with the zlib USE-flag enabled.

Resolution
==========

All Qt users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/qt-3.3.4-r8"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
