The opinions expressed below are my personal and professional opinions,
and not the official position of my employer....

Apologies in advance for the long posting.....

>What is this thing you believe in, an 'electronic crime against a

Well, if you had actually taken the time to quote me accurately, you
would find I mentioned "electronic crimes against children", and not the
phrase you chose to substitute in its place.  A minor point, but
nevertheless, you might want to make sure you are accurate before you go
off the deep end.

>Your intentions may be fine, but your reasoning is actually quite
>insane. An 'electronic crime against a child' ? Absolutely outrageous
>and patently absurd. There is no such thing.

Actually, if you hit any conventional internet search engine and type in
the words "electronic" "crimes" "against" "children" you'll get several
million hits.  Review the top ones, you'll see they predominantly refer
to "electronic" aspects of "crimes against children".

You don't like that?  Then take the same search engine, and search for
the phrase "electronic crimes against children".  I found only two hits,
both pieces of legislation, and both coming from Hawaii. (Don't you have
an office there?)

OK, let's go through this once more.

I asked you in response to an email sent by you on August 30, 2005:

"So if I've read this correctly, you are advocating the willful
destruction of evidence that would otherwise be used in the
investigation of crimes against children??"

You replied to my question on August 31, 2005:

"Yes. Wipe the drive and get on with business."

You have admitted that you advocate the WILLFUL DESTRUCTION of EVIDENCE.
My question was not concerning the wiping of a hard drive you had
suspicions about, it was about the WILLFUL (deliberate, voluntary, done
on purpose) destruction of EVIDENCE.  This means that a: you have
determined that there is something there that might get someone in
trouble, and b: rather than getting that person or corporation into
trouble, you choose to try and make it all go away.

I know you are aware of the following, since you taught 2 courses for
CCE in 2005, but for the record, there is a code of ethics that I as a
Certified Computer Examiner must adhere to.

This code of ethics, the standard of integrity that I hold myself to
professionally and personally, and the value I place upon the ability to
render an unbiased impartial opinion are an integral part of my work
ethic, and I do not appreciate being maligned.

I hate to break the news, but when your hard drive becomes contaminated
with child pornography (so you're at the point that you've identified it
as child pornography), you (according to the law of the United States)
have only ONE course of action, report it to law enforcement.

It's in the law, Jason.  Title 18, USC 2252.

Of course you can tighten down firewall rules, etc to prevent it
happening again, but once you've identified it as child pornography, you
must turn it over.

So in addition to falsifying log records, you are now advocating
concealing the fact that the data was not in fact destroyed, but
archived?  Now instead of an individual being an offender, you have
placed the corporation in jeopardy, since it now knowingly possesses the
same images you identified as child pornography.  In addition, you have
(whether you choose to accept the reality of it or not) assisted the
offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension.

It's in the law Jason.  Title 18, USC 3.

>unbiased and well-informed approach to your work.

Actually, I'm a trained chemist.  My whole background is in fundamental
principles, and I have tried whenever possible to apply that background
to computer forensics.  Furthermore, if you knew anything about my work
as forensic chemist, you would know that the lab I worked at established
more innocence that guilt.  I learned very early on in my career the
importance of identification, coupled with taking any evidentiary
findings in context with surrounding factors.  Don't even presume to
lecture me on bias.

>Ask yourself why >not? Is there something wrong with 'computer

In other words, by your standard, I'm biased to investigate child
pornography, but impartial to investigate terrorist crime.  Remarkable.

In closing: this discussion was for the most part a sensible,
professional opportunity to exchange ideas and assist someone in the
community with a valid question.

Throughout this discussion I have sought to keep our communication on a
civil and a professional level, and I would have appreciated the same
courtesy in return.  It appears I may have expected too much.

Without knowing me, my background, or my experiences you have
nevertheless leveled some groundless accusations at my character,
integrity, and technical competence.  I won't even dignify those
accusations with a response, though I will reiterate: The International
Society of Forensic Computer Examiners code of ethics, the standard of
integrity that I hold myself to professionally and personally, and the
value I place upon the ability to render an unbiased impartial opinion
are an integral part of my work ethic, and I do not appreciate being
maligned.

Apologies for the long post,

Just my opinion,

Tobin
