That's because it's not an exploit.  If you have a program that can run a shell, and it is running under a privileged account, guess what?  The shell will run under the same privileged account.

This "exploit" is a "by design".

The writers suggest that if you are logged in to a privileged account, then do a "run as" to run another app under a non-privliged account, you can script explorer to run a shell as your original privileged account (which you could just do anyway by dropping to a command prompt).

They must be dragging the bottom of the barrel for "exploits".
