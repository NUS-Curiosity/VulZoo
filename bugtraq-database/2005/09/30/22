Subject: Announce: Bluetooth mailing list - Bluetraq


Hi,

By popular demand, we (the trifinite group) have set up a public 
(moderated) mailing list for discussion of all things Bluetooth. This is 
not intended as a replacement for any existing disclosure lists, but 
more for discussions about research into Bluetooth issues etc.

The list can be found here:

   http://trifinite.org/trifinite_lists.html

enjoy,
Adam
