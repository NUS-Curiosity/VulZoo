Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0053

Package names:	   unzip   
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2005-09-30

Package description:
  unzip
  The unzip utility is used to list, test, or extract files from a zip
  archive.  Zip archives are commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The zip
  utility, included in the zip package, creates zip archives.  Zip and
  unzip are both compatible with archives created by PKWARE(R)'s PKZIP
  for MS-DOS, but the programs' options and default behaviors do differ
  in some respects.

Problem description:
  unzip < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Fix Race condition that allows local users to modify
    permissions of arbitrary files via a hard link attack on a file while
    it is being decompressed, whose permissions are changed by Unzip after
    the decompression is complete.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CAN-2005-2475 to this issue.
