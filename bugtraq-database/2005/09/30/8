Although it is a Good Idea (tm) to uncover design deficiencies in 
current AV products, we never should forget that "antivirus" is *by 
definition* a reactive thing and thus cannot protect from unknown 
threats. If we wanted to have a *really* proactive approach, we would 
have to either ask for OS capabilities to efficiently compart 
(malicious) code or for the software manufacturers to take damn care 
when using low-level languages and introduce efficient patching 
mechanisms at last.
