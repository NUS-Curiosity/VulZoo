Subject: RE: Computer forensics to uncover illegal internet use


Jason,

You are definitely off here.


"""Companies and their lawyers who fail to keep up with child pornography
law do so at their peril. The bipartisan resolve of state and federal
legislators to combat child pornography has led to laws that put the fate of
those who innocently possess child porn � such as counsel and their forensic
experts � largely at the mercy of prosecutorial discretion.
Dealing administratively with employees who use company computers to view or
download child pornography no longer suffices. In fact, company lawyers or
managers risk serious criminal penalties if they merely terminate an
offending employee and delete only visibly illicit images from his desktop
computer.
The law generally treats child porn like heroin: mere knowing possession of
it is a crime. Possession on behalf of a client to assist in an
investigation or  defense is no exception. As one court put it: �Child
pornography is illegal contraband."""

"""Criminal liability may also be triggered by knowing possession of a
single child porn image. A limited statutory affirmative defense is
available when a defendant possesses fewer than three such images, but only
if the defendant: (1) does not retain any offending visual depiction; (2)
does not allow any person other than a law enforcement agent to access the
offending visual depiction; and (3) promptly takes reasonable steps to
destroy each such visual depiction or reports the matter to a law
enforcement agency and gives the agency access to each such visual
depiction. """

"""Notably, this statutory affirmative defense is not available if three or
more images are found � and usually where there is one such image, there are
dozens or hundreds more. Thus, if a company finds multiple child porn images
on an employee�s computer, the affirmative defense evaporates, and handling
or even destroying the images may expose the company to criminal
liability."""

I think you need to read the following:
