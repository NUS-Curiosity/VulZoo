Linksys WRT54G Management Interface DoS Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 09.13.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=308&type=vulnerabilities
September 13, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The Linksys WRT54G is a combination wireless access point, switch and
router. More information is available at the following URL:

  http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=508

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation error within the web 
management httpd component of Cisco Systems Inc.'s Linksys WRT54G 
wireless router may allow unauthenticated users to cause a denial of
service (DoS).

The vulnerability exists in several of the "POST" method handlers of the
httpd running on the router's internal interfaces, including by default
the wireless interface. In addition to not checking if authentication 
has failed until after data supplied by an external user has been 
processed, there are several places where the Content-Length is assumed 
to be valid. In some of those cases, data is read in without error 
checking while decrementing the length value. If the Content Length is 
set to a negative number, these checks will take an extremely long time,

during which the httpd will become unresponsive.

III. ANALYSIS

An unauthenticated remote attacker may cause a DoS on the affected 
router. Exploitation of this vulnerability would require that an 
attacker can connect to the web management port of the router. The httpd

is running by default, but is only accessible via the LAN ports or the 
WLAN (wireless LAN).

Although this DoS is against the httpd itself, it may cause a higher
than normal load on the router, which may be sufficient to cause packet
loss. The httpd will also be unavailable. This may be sufficient to
cause to owner to restart the device, which could in turn trigger
changes made by a previous vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version 
3.01.3 of the firmware of the Linksys WRT54G wireless router, and has 
identified the same code is present in versions 3.03.6 and 4.00.7. 
All versions prior to 4.20.7 may be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

To mitigate exposure of the internal network to outside attackers,
ensure encryption is enabled on the wireless interface. The exact
settings to use depend on your wireless deployment policies.
