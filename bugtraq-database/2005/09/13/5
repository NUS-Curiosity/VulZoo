Subject: btscanner 2.0 released


Pentest Limited are pleased to announce the release of btscanner v2.0.

btscanner 2.0 contains many new features over the original, including
inquiry and brute force based scans and a completely redesigned interface.
Furthermore, btscanner is threaded to allow the use of multiple Bluetooth
dongles for scanning.

Description
-----------
btscanner is a tool designed specifically to extract as much
information as possible from a Bluetooth device without the requirement
to pair.

A detailed information screen extracts HCI and SDP information, and
maintains an open connection to monitor the RSSI and link quality.

btscanner is based on the BlueZ Bluetooth stack, which is included with
recent Linux kernels, and the BlueZ toolset. btscanner also contains
a complete listing of the IEEE OUI numbers and class lookup tables.
Using the information gathered from these sources it is possible to make
educated guesses as to the host device type.

Features
--------
- Bluetooth Device Discovery
- HCI and SDP interrogation
- IEEE OUI database lookup
