speaking of MS zealots, i am doing clinical research (sponsored by a TWO
letter agency) on the psychology of MS zealots.

so the clinical behavior of MS zealots is driven by one driving force
(according to my study [patent pending]) - money.

the most common examples of MS who^H^H^H zealots are:
1. "MS is giving me money, so billg is good"
2. "i can't do anything except winblows, so i have winblows dependency.
no MS, no money, no love...."

hope this helps.
