Synopsis
========

The imap4d server contains a vulnerability allowing an authenticated
user to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the imap4d
process.

Background
==========

The GNU Mailutils are a collection of mail-related utilities, including
an IMAP4 server (imap4d).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected

  1  net-mail/mailutils      < 0.6-r2                        >= 0.6-r2

Description
===========

The imap4d server contains a format string bug in the handling of IMAP
SEARCH requests.

Impact
======

An authenticated IMAP user could exploit the format string error in
imap4d to execute arbitrary code as the imap4d user, which is usually
root.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU Mailutils users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/mailutils-0.6-r2"
