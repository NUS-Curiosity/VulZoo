Synopsis
========

A design error in Py2Play allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Py2Play is a peer-to-peer network game engine written in Python.
Pickling is a Python feature allowing to serialize Python objects into
string representations (called pickles) that can be sent over the
network.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-python/py2play      <= 0.1.7                      Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Arc Riley discovered that Py2Play uses Python pickles to send objects
over a peer-to-peer game network, and that clients accept without
restriction the objects and code sent by peers.

Impact
======

A remote attacker participating in a Py2Play-powered game can send
malicious Python pickles, resulting in the execution of arbitrary
Python code on the targeted game client.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

The Py2Play package has been hard-masked prior to complete removal from
Portage, and current users are advised to unmerge the package:

    # emerge --unmerge  dev-python/py2play
