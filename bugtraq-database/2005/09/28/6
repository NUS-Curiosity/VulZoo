Subject:		OpenServer 5.0.7 OpenServer 6.0.0 : UnZip File Permissions Change Vulnerability
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.39
Issue date: 		2005 September 28
Cross reference:	sr894724 fz532853 erg712904
			sr894723 fz532852 erg712905
			CAN-2005-2475

1. Problem Description

	A vulnerability in unzip can be exploited by malicious,
	local users to perform certain actions on a vulnerable
	system with escalated privileges. The vulnerability is
	caused due a race condition that exists when the uncompressed
	file is closed and before its permissions are changed. This
	can be exploited via hardlink attacks to change the permissions
	of other files belonging to the user running unzip. Successful
	exploitation requires that the malicious user is able to
	delete the uncompressed file and replace it with a hardlink
	to another file owned by the unzip user, before permissions
	are set on the file.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
	has assigned the name CAN-2005-2475 to this issue.
