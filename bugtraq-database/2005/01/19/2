It took me less than 10 seconds to find this url

http://support.novell.com/security-alerts/

using the keywords "novell security email address" in Google.

Had you taken the same time to do this, you would have found that 
secure@...ell.com is the place to send this kind of notification.

No doubt you've spent a lot of time doing some good research. Had you spent a 
little longer there would probably be a patch by now.  Making up 'possible' 
email addresses for this kind of mail and then 'forcing' Novell to go public 
on an issue that's probably sitting in a spam bucket is a bit of waste of 
everyone's time and effort, your own included.

Regards

Peter
