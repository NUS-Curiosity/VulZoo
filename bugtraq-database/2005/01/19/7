I have to correct myself slightly here.

After closer inspection it turns out that more recent versions of
Kazaa Lite include a utility called K-Sig [2] instead of sig2dat.
K-Sig does not share any code with sig2dat. It is not clear which of
the two was used by the original poster but it seems neither of them
do any explicit filtering to prevent directory traversal attacks.
