Package:             a2ps
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= a2ps-4.13b-20040818      >= a2ps-4.13b-20050117
OpenPKG 2.2          <= a2ps-4.13b-2.2.0         >= a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1
OpenPKG 2.1          <= a2ps-4.13b-2.1.0         >= a2ps-4.13b-2.1.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Rudolf Polzer discovered [0] a vulnerability in GNU a2ps [1], a
  converter and pretty-printer for many formats to PostScript. The
  program does not escape shell meta characters properly which could
  lead to the execution of arbitrary commands as a privileged user if
  a2ps is installed as a printer filter. a2ps allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the filename.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  identifier CAN-2004-1170 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q a2ps". If you have the "a2ps" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.2/UPD
  ftp> get a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/a2ps-4.13b-2.2.1.*.rpm
