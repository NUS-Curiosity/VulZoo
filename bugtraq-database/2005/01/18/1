Subject: Multiple high risk vulnerabilities in Oracle RDBMS 10g/9i


Researchers at NGSSoftware have discovered multiple high risk
vulnerabilities in the Oracle Database Server. Versions affected include

Oracle Database 10g - All Releases
Oracle9i Database Server - All Releases

The vulnerabilities include PL/SQL Injection vulnerabilities that allow low
privileged users to gain DBA privileges and a buffer overflow vulnerability.
The former can be exploited via the web through Oracle Application Server.
Oracle has released a patch set (18/01/2005) to address these issues. Oracle
database administrators are urged to download, test and install the patch
set as soon as possible. See http://metalink.oracle.com/ for more details.

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about these flaws for three
months. Full details will be published on the 18th of April 2005. This three
month window will allow Oracle database administrators the time needed to
test and apply the patch set before the details are released to the general
public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible disclosure.

NGSSQuirreL for Oracle, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment
scanner and security manager for Oracle, has been updated to check for and
positively identify these flaws in Oracle database servers on the network.
