To answer this in particular, the website says:

"5. Via your domain's control panel, you should password-protect the admin
folder, so that only you can add and edit posts. As in Step 1, if you are a
hostee, you will need to ask your host to do that for you."

Granted, it is poor way to do it, but it does appear that the script was
written for those who (probably) host their stuff on their own (possibly
poorly) admin'ed boxes, or one of a friends', or a free PHP host, etc.  This
is not industrial-grade stuff here.
