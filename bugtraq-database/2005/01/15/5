Various Vulnerabilities in SparkleBlog

SparkleBlog is an open-source PHP script which allows you to input and edit
your weblog entries, without having to go through the hassle of coding in
HTML and uploading via FTP every time you want to make an update.  A weblog
(aka blog) is simply an online version of a diary, and blogging has become
very popular in recent years.  The time and date is automatically added to
the end of each of your blog entries, so people know exactly when you posted
them.  The script even allows your website's visitors to make comments on
each of your blog entries, if they wish.

No password requied for admin pages. So a remote attacker can request the
file and admin the blog site. 

[blogsite]/admin/blogadmin.php
[blogsite]/admin/cpconfig.php
[blogsite]/admin/editentries.php
[blogsite]/admin/update.php
