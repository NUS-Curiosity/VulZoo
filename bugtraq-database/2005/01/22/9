Subject: Re: Various Buffer Overflows in Oracle 10g Tools


Hi Jose,
I'm away from my linux box at the moment; are any of these tools 
setuid/setgid? I'm trying to ascertain the risk posed. If none of these 
overflows present a privilege escalation opportunity then there is no risk 
posed. If these tools are setuid/setgid then, needless to say there is a 
risk.
Cheers,
David Litchfield
