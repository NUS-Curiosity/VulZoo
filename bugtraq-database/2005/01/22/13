1. Systems affected:

        All Konversation versions up to and including 0.15

2. Overview:

        Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Konversation,
        an IRC client  for KDE.

        A flaw in the expansion of %-escaped variables makes that %-escaped
        variables in certain input strings will be inadvertently expanded
        too. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2005-0129 to this issue.

        Several perl scripts included with Konversation fail to properly
        handle command line arguments causing a command line injection
        vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
        (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0130 to this issue.
      
        Nick and password are confused in the quick connection dialog, 
        so connecting with that dialog and filling in a password, would
        use that password as nick, and may inadvertently expose the
        password to others. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
        (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0131 to this issue.
      
3. Impact:

        A user might be tricked to join a channel with a specially crafted
        channel name containing shell commands. If user runs a script in
        that channel it will result in an arbitrary command execution.

        If quick connect is used with a password, the password is used as
        nickname instead. As a result the password may be exposed to others.

4. Solution:

        Upgrade to Konversation 0.15.1 available from
        http://download.berlios.de/konversation/konversation-0.15.1.tar.bz2

5. Patch:

        A patch for Konversation 0.15 is available from
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches
