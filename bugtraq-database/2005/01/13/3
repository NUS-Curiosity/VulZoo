Hi all,

I know I released a working exploit earlier but it had two small
imperfections, version 0.2 should be more robust and fully OS/SP/language
independant. I personally believe it should work on all platforms, but I
don't have enough machines nor time to prove my claim, I'll leave that to
you.
Since my ISP disconnects me every time I attach a PoC that gets flagged as
a threat, it is available @ http://www.edup.tudelft.nl/~bjwever

Let me know if you experienced troubles with v0.1 that v0.2 doesn't fix
for you.

Cheers,
SkyLined

PS. Thanks to spoonm for handing me details on the ANI file format, that
should increase the exploits stability a lot ;)
