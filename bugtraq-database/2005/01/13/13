Subject: Trend Micro Control Manager - Enterprise Edition 3.0 Web application Replay attack


The web application are vulnerable to a replay attack, meaning that the
username and password are encrypted but there are not used any form of
timestamp to make this mechanism more advanced and secure.

If it is possible to sniff the traffic when a user login to the
administrative interface, it is possible to replay this sequence and get a
valid login session, with the rights of the user.

Vendors response to this was, it is a feature not a vulnerability and all
the others also have this problem.
