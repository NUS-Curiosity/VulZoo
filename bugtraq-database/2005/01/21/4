Description:
 
Oracle Corporation released the first Critical Patch Update (CPU) on January
18, 2005.  The CPU is a collection of security related patches for the
Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Collaboration Suite, and
Oracle E-Business Suite.  There are 23 vulnerabilities addressed in the CPU
ranging from buffer overflows to SQL injection to denial of service (DoS)
issues.  Most of the vulnerabilities are high risk and should be addressed
quickly by organizations.

Oracle Database Vulnerabilities:

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Oracle Spatial package MDSYS.MD2 that
can be exploited by an attacker to gain escalated privileges on the server.

Oracle Application Server Vulnerabilities:

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the Oracle Forms Server.  

The Oracle Reports Server administrative functions can be exploited to
obtain the database password used by the server.  Integrigy released a
security alert in November 2002
(www.integrigy.com/alerts/ReportsServer_APPS_Disclosure.htm) to notify
Oracle Applications clients of the issue and to provide a work-around.  The
Oracle patch removes the password from being displayed.  However, Integrigy
still recommends clients install the work-around in order to block access to
all the administrative functions.

Oracle E-Business Suite Vulnerabilities:

Two SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the Oracle E-Business Suite.  
 
Solution:
 
All Oracle customers should consider these vulnerabilities high risk and
apply the Oracle patches at the earliest possible opportunity.  Customers
with Internet facing application servers should consider applying these
patches as soon as possible.  See Oracle Metalink Note 293953.1 for patch
information and instructions.
 
In order to assist our clients, Integrigy has developed a detailed analysis
of the security release and its impact on Oracle Applications.  The analysis
provides additional information on the vulnerabilities and patches released
in the Critical Patch Update as it relates to the Oracle E-Business Suite
(Oracle Applications 11i).  The objective of the analysis is to assist IT
managers and Applications DBAs in assessing the impact on their Oracle
Applications 11i implementations and the risks associated with the
vulnerabilities, especially since the CPU addresses a large number of
vulnerabilities and impacts all layers of the Oracle Applications technology
stack.  The analysis can be downloaded from Integrigy's website at
www.integrigy.com/info/SecurityAnalysis-CPU0105.pdf.
