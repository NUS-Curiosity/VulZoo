There was a demonstration of this very problem on a lecture the Chaos
Computer Club Ulm held on December 13th at the University of Ulm. We had
two sample applications to circumvent Kerio and Nortion Personal
Firewalls. During this lecture we also demonstrated how a malicious
application could establish a remote shell without any Personal Firewall
taking notice.
