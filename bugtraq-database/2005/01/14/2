Subject: Internet Explorer valid JavaScript-file
	successfull load detection local file enumeration


Hi all,

Internet Explorer allows webpages on a remote server to load scripts from the local harddisk. These scripts get run in the remote server's security zone. This is not so much cross-site scripting but what I will call "cross-site loading" for now. Cross-site loading is not a new problem, a number of these bugs have been found already, most of which have not been fixed yet, even though the problem is over two years old now. 

Anyway, using this variant I constructed a webpage that will try to load a JavaScript that is present by default on win2k from various locations on your harddisk(s). If it succeeds, one can assume this is the windows installation directory.

Demo and example:

(I also added demos and examples for two other old, known and unfixed cross-site loading problems).

FireFox does not allow any cross-site loading as far as I could tell, all three demo's do not work on it for that matter.

Cheers,

Berend-Jan Wever
