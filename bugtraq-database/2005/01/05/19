Subject: IBM DB2 XML functions overflows (#NISR05012005H)


NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: IBM DB2 XML functions overflows
Systems Affected: DB2 8.1
Severity: High risk from remote
Vendor URL: http://www.ibm.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ david at ngssoftware.com ]
Relates to: http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/db2-02.txt
Date of Public Advisory: 5th January 2005
Advisory number: #NISR05012005H
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/db205012005H.txt

Description
***********
IBM's DB2 database server contain four XML functions that suffer from stack
based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Details
*******
The xmlvarcharfromfile suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability. When
and only when, 94 bytes are supplied for the second argument a pointer to
the user supplied string is written over the saved return address so when
ucnv_open_2_0 (in db2xmlfn.dll) returns - it does so into the string. This
allows an attacker to run arbitrary code and elevate privileges.

The xmlclobfromfile, xmlfilefromvarchar and xmlfilefromclob functions are
also vulnerable.


Fix Information
***************
IBM has written a patch and can be obtained with the latest fixpak.

http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/downloadv8.html - DB2
v8.1
http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/downloadv7.html - DB2
v7.x

NGSSQuirreL for DB2 (http://www.nextgenss.com/db2.htm) can be used to assess
whether your DB2 server is vulnerable to this.
