Except that I've seen webbie-type people who will execute a stored proc 
by doing:

strSQL = "exec userLogin " + userName + " " + userPassword

which would be still be subject to a SQL Injection attack if I simply 
had a semicolon in the userPassword and then was able to pass any other 
query to it.
