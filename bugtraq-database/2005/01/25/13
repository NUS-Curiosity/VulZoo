The bug fix was posted on the Snitz message boards on 20 September 2004:

http://forum.snitz.com/forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&TOPIC_ID=54791

"to fix this issue, simply remove the following line from down.asp (approx line 76)

if request.form("location") <> "" then response.redirect(request.form("location"))

it is not required."

Snitz Forums 2000 Version 3.4.05 was released on 29 September 2004 and incorporated the bug fix:
