Vulnerability Title:  
 
Internal Path Disclosure in HTTP Variables
 
Vulnerability discovery and development: 
 
Portcullis Security Testing Services
 
Affected systems: 
 
Bottomline Webseries Payment Application 
 
Details:
 
Several HTTP variables in use by the application were found to directly
reference directories and files on the web server.  An example of this
behaviour is listed below:
 
        ConfigFile=blah.cfg
        ReportName=User%20Activity%20Report.rpt
        ReportPath=E:\server\apps\WSWEB\Web+Application+Files\reports\
Impact:
 
An attacker can use the information obtained by this issue to gain a better
understanding of the structure of the underlying file system of the web
server.  This type of information is often essential in launching exploits
against the web server itself.
 
Exploit:
 
Exploit code not required.
