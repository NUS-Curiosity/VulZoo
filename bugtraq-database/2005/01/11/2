Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in UnRTF allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
by way of a specially crafted RTF file.

Background
==========

UnRTF is a utility to convert files in the Rich Text Format into other
formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/unrtf      < 0.19.3-r1                      >= 0.19.3-r1

Description
===========

An unchecked strcat() in unrtf may overflow the bounds of a static
buffer.

Impact
======

Using a specially crafted file, possibly delivered by e-mail or over
the web, an attacker may execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running UnRTF.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All unrtf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/unrtf-0.19.3-r1"
