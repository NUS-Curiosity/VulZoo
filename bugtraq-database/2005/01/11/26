Portcullis Security Advisory
 
Vulnerable System: 
      
MediaPartner 5.0
 
Vulnerability Title:  
 
In Place Password Update Process Flawed
 
Vulnerability discovery and development: 
 
Portcullis Security Testing Service
 
Affected systems: 
 
Emotion MediaPartner Web Server Version 5.0  (5.1 not confirmed)
 
Details:
 
The logic behind the "In Place Password Update" process (which
appears to be used to force a user to change their password when it
has expired) can be exploited to change the password of any user,
without having to authenticate to the system or have knowledge of the 
current password. This is caused by the fact that no checking is done 
to ensure that a session has been authenticated before the change 
password code is executed.
 
Impact:
 
This vulnerability allows the authentication mechanism to be
bypassed, by entering a valid username and resetting their password
to a known value.  Once access was gained to the application
Portcullis were able to identify users with full admin privileges,
after resting their password, full control of the application was
gained.
 
Exploit:
 
No exploit required. Example: http://target_ip/login.bhtml?userNameForPasswordChange=admin
