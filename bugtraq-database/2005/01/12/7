			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.4 UnixWare 7.1.3 UnixWare 7.1.1 : mountd remote denial of service
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.1
Issue date: 		2005 January 11
Cross reference:	sr892156 fz530479 erg712731 CAN-2004-1039
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	mountd is not enabled by default. But when the NFS mountd service
	is run by inetd, if a NFS mount related request is received
	from the remote (or local) host, inetd will repeatedly
	create the mountd process and as a result increasingly
	consume memory. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-1039 to this issue.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Binaries
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	UnixWare 7.1.4 			/usr/lib/nfs/tmp/mountd

	UnixWare 7.1.1 			/usr/lib/nfs/mountd

3. Solution

	The proper solution is to install the latest packages.
