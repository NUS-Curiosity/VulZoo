Subject: RE: MORE CRITICAL FLAWS IN MS WINDOWS EXPLORER


>Why not also delete KDE, Gnome and all the other desktops out there.
Sure but then what would u use ? 

Don't tell me that you would be using X only with a term and with a window
manager - I do use that sometimes - but it not too useful .... 

>Workaround
>On a command prompt: del C:\WINDOWS\explorer.exe

Ok this is what I did exactly see what happened --- 

Z:\Documents and Settings\Aditya>del Z:\WINDOWS\explorer.exe
The system cannot find the file specified.

What can I do with this error message ? How do I make this go away ?
