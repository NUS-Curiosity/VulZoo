Subject: applicable exploit for winxp-sp2-uptodate
	Internet Explorer


patch will come in hours(at least i believe so).

many people(paul of greyhats and mike, sandblad of secunia and 
shreddersub7) already provided proof-of-concept remote-code-execution 
exploit for winxp-sp2-uptodate Internet Explorer.

the problem is: their code is simply not applicable in real attack. so i 
made this:
