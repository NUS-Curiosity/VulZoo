Hello Bugtraq readers,

I would like to make some brief announcements about past as well as upcoming Black Hat events.

First, new content is on-line from our Tokyo, Japan conference. Please check out our free media archives of past presentations:
http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-media-archives/bh-archives-2004.html#Asia-2004 

The media for the audio speeches (most in both English and Japanese) as well as the presentations are on-line. We would like to thank the speakers and participants that made it to last years Black Hat Tokyo, and look forward to seeing you in Tokyo again next year.

Second, registration is now open for both the Europe and Asia Trainings and Briefings! Register now to take advantage of our early bird specials and save.
This year we have an expanded training program that includes new topics and trainers.  For example, Joe Grand will present a hands-on hardware hacking course "Under the Hood: Hands-On Hardware Hacking and Defense Techniques".  Laurent Oudot will be transferring his extensive honeypot expertise to his students in a new two day Black Hat course entitled "Hackers on Honeypots".  Among our returning trainers is Black Hat's reverse engineer Halvar Flake teaching security-specific code-analysis in "Analyzing Software for Security Vulnerabilities".  Class size for all courses is limited, so register early to ensure a spot.

Black Hat Trainings and Briefings Europe, Amsterdam: March 29th to April 1st
Black Hat Trainings and Briefings Asia, Singapore: April 5th to the 8th

And last, but not least, the CFP for the large Las Vegas conference will go on-line February 1st. It is shaping up to be a fantastic conference with more technical training topics and speakers.  We are looking forward to some excellent submissions!
