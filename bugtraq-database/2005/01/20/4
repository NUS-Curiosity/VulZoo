Subject: ASH Hashing Algorithm


With the current class of cryptographic algorithms growing weaker we face
an increasingly large problem.  I went ahead took two SHA-2 algorithms and
created ASH-1 and ASH-2.  The modifications are algorithm neutral and
fairly simple, but add security and flexibility to the SHA family.

The hashing algorithm is detailed in this paper:

Comments, criticism, and help all appreciated.

Thanks,
