3Com OfficeConnect Wireless 11g AP Information Disclosure Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 01.20.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=188&type=vulnerabilities
January 20, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The 3Com OfficeConnect Wireless 11g Access Point provides users with
access to network resources, the Internet, and e-mail at speeds up to
54 Mbps and at distances up to 100 meters (328 feet). More information
about the product is available at 

    http://www.3com.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?tab=features
        &pathtype=purchase&sku=3CRWE454G72

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in 3Com Corp.'s
OfficeConnect Wireless 11g Access Point allows attackers to glean
sensitive router information.

The 3Com OfficeConnect Wireless 11g Access Point (AP) provides an
administrative interface via a web server accessible on port 80. This
interface is exposed by default on the internal ethernet interface and
the wireless interface, and it is also possible to expose it on the
external ethernet interface. The problem specifically exists due to
insufficient privilege checks when accessing various URLs without going
through the formal logon process. An unauthenticated attacker can glean
sensitive information from the device via the following URLs:

    /main/config.bin
    /main/profile.wlp?PN=ggg
    /main/event.logs

These URLs will expose the administrative username and password in clear
text, the WEP key and SSID, and the router log file respectively.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to glean sensitive
router information, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the
device. Compromise of the Access Point (AP) allows an attacker to
potentially redirect traffic, access nodes behind the AP that are
otherwise unaddressable and potentially monitor traffic from a remote
location. This can lead to further compromise of other computers.

IV. DETECTION

It has been reported that firmware version 1.00.08 shipped on the 3Com
OfficeConnect Wireless 11g Access Point is vulnerable. It is suspected
that earlier versions are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDEFENSE is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Firmware version 1.03.07A for 3CRWE454G72 has been released to addresses
