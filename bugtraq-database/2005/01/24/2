Subject: [USN-68-1] enscript vulnerabilities

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-68-1		   January 24, 2005
enscript vulnerabilities
CAN-2004-1184 CAN-2004-1185 CAN-2004-1186
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)

The following packages are affected:

enscript

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 1.6.4-4ubuntu0.1. In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

Erik Sj√∂lund discovered several vulnerabilities in enscript which
could cause arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
calling enscript.

Quotes and other shell escape characters in titles and file names were
not handled in previous versions. (CAN-2004-1184)

Previous versions supported reading EPS data not only from a file, but
also from an arbitrary command pipe. Since checking for unwanted side
effects is infeasible, this feature has been disabled after
consultation with the authors of enscript. (CAN-2004-1185)

Finally, this update fixes two buffer overflows which were triggered by
certain input files. (CAN-2004-1186)

These issues can lead to privilege escalation if enscript is called
automatically from web server applications like viewcvs.
