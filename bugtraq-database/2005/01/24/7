-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

______________________________________________________________________________

                        SUSE Security Announcement

        Package:                realplayer 8
        Announcement-ID:        SUSE-SA:2005:004
        Date:                   Monday, Jan 24th 2005 16:00 MET
        Affected products:      8.1, 8.2, 9.0, 9.1
                                SUSE Linux Desktop 1.0
        Vulnerability Type:     remote code execution
        Severity (1-10):        8
        SUSE default package:   yes
        Cross References:       none

    Content of this advisory:
        1) security vulnerability discussed:
               - integer overflow
           problem description
        2) solution/workaround
        3) standard appendix (further information)

______________________________________________________________________________

1) problem description, brief discussion


   RealPlayer is a combined audio and video player for RealMedia formatted
   streaming data. These formats are very common throughout the Internet.

   eEye Security in October 2004 discovered a flaw in the .rm RealMovie
   stream handling routines which allows a remote attacker to exploit an
   integer overflow vulnerability using a special .rm file. This might
   allow a remote attacker to execute code as the user running RealPlayer.

   Reference URLs for this problems are the Real security advisory:
           http://service.real.com/help/faq/security/040928_player/EN/

   and the eEye security advisory:
           http://www.eeye.com/html/research/advisories/AD20041001.html


   SUSE Linux includes RealPlayer as both standalone player and as a
   plugin for web browsers like Mozilla and Konqueror.
   This might allow the attacker to just provide a web page or E-Mail
   linking to the special exploit .rm file.

   We cannot fully evaluate the impact of this problem due to lack of
   information and lack of source code to review.


   SUSE Linux versions up to 9.1 and the SUSE Linux Desktop 1.0
   include RealPlayer version 8 and are affected by this problem.

   SUSE Linux 9.2 and the Novell Linux Desktop 9 include RealPlayer
   version 10 and are NOT affected by this problem.


   Real does not offer a fixed version 8 RealPlayer, but suggests
   upgrading RealPlayer to version 10.

   However, upgrading Realplayer is not possible for older SUSE Linux
   products since Realplayer 10 requires newer dynamic library
   versions than the ones to be found in those products.  Also some old
   Real content is not compatible with the RealPlayer version 10.

   For these reasons we cannot offer fixed packages for older SUSE Linux
   based products.

2) solution/workaround

   We suggest one of the following workarounds:

   a) De-install RealPlayer

      Either use YaST to deinstall RealPlayer, or as root do:

      # rpm -e RealPlayer

      You will lose the ability to view Real content.



   b) Remove the RealPlayer plug in

      As root, execute the following commands:

      # rm /usr/lib/browser-plugins/raclass.zip
      # rm /usr/lib/browser-plugins/rpnp.so


      Content can still be viewed by starting "realplay" and opening
      URLs, but automatic exploits via web pages or E-Mails are no longer
      possible.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SUSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SUSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@...e.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We recommend against subscribing to security lists that cause the
       e-mail message containing the announcement to be modified
       so that the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       file name of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an uninstalled rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SUSE in rpm packages for SUSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SUSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@...e.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .
