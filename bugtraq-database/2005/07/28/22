Not so obviously.  IDefense has been doing this for a couple of years.  By 
paying for the vuln research they get to be first to announce the vulns to 
the community.  Looks like TP is going to do the same thing.

I doubt they'd get any 0day sigs, since they'd be buying others' research. 
The horse is already out of the barn by then.
