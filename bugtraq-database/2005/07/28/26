If this got around authenticating, it would be the fault of the server,
not the browser.  The browser is only sending a 'request' for a
document.  If firefox fails to ask for credentials in any authentication
scheme, it is the fault of firefox, and should be reported to their bug
tracking system.  Check their support forums first to see if it's known:

I tried it with firefox 1.0.6 and it didn't ask for credentials, but it
didn't give me the FILE, either :)  If it has cached your authentication
response from a previous request, then yes, it will let you have the
file.  But that won't work for someone who genuinely doesn't know the
username/password.
