The livesuite offers services to users scanning and treating virus, worm, hack tools and so on from Internet

See following detail describe:

[The first half]

Neo discovered vulnerability at http://update.nprotect.net/newlivecall/livecall.html

HAURI never check parameters When updates from Internet update server

also HAURI never check file's checksum or hash value.

He modified liveup.haz file, it's live update configuration file

that file just compressed by ZIP compressor.

if HAURI user access phishing page such as can use BBS that has vulnerability such as cross site script 

then evil software downloaded without any restrict

evil software like cmd.exe if exist then HAURI overwrites.

[The latter half]

As you seen above. Saintlinu improved Neo's exploit. 

Saintlinu found HAURI LIVE UPDATE program at XXX Commercial companies in Korea

HAURI checked files in liveup.haz but that's all.

File's checksum is date and time when it made

therefore we can exploit that vulnerability.
