Did you restart Firefox after clicking the link the first time?  Firefox
will remember the HTTP Basic Authentication credentials after you've entered
them once.

Did you make sure the "Use Password Manager to remember this password" check
box was cleared?  Firefox *should* still prompt you for auth, but with the
values pre-filled.

Did you clear your cache?  If you've already visited the page, it's possible
that when you click "Save Link As..." Firefox just reads the cached copy.

Are you accessing the protected page through a proxy server?  Again, it's
possible the proxy server is serving up a cached response, or re-issuing
your original request to the origin server.

For what it's worth, I tried to reproduce this and couldn't.
