Synopsis
========

MIT Kerberos 5 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack and remote
execution of arbitrary code, possibly leading to the compromise of the
entire Kerberos realm.

Background
==========

MIT Kerberos 5 is the free implementation of the Kerberos network
authentication protocol by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/mit-krb5     < 1.4.1-r1                     >= 1.4.1-r1

Description
===========

Daniel Wachdorf discovered that MIT Kerberos 5 could corrupt the heap
by freeing unallocated memory when receiving a special TCP request
(CAN-2005-1174). He also discovered that the same request could lead to
a single-byte heap overflow (CAN-2005-1175). Magnus Hagander discovered
that krb5_recvauth() function of MIT Kerberos 5 might try to
double-free memory (CAN-2005-1689).

Impact
======

Although exploitation is considered difficult, a remote attacker could
exploit the single-byte heap overflow and the double-free vulnerability
to execute arbitrary code, which could lead to the compromise of the
whole Kerberos realm. A remote attacker could also use the heap
corruption to cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest available
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.4.1-r1"
