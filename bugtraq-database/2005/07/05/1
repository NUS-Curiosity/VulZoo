Subject: a new sql injection for aspjar guestbook


hello , my name is: (arash setayeshi) & my yahoo id is : arash_pc0
 
I found a new vulnerability in aspjar guestbook that we can control website & go to admin control panel by (sql injection).
 
sql injection : in login page(guestbook/admin/login.asp) , username should be blank & password is : ' or 'x'='x . by this work we will be in admin control panel so :
 
username:(nothing)
password: ' or 'x'='x
 
this is new sql injection attack. i tested this bug and it is in all versions of aspjar guestbook
 
with special thanks
arash setayeshi
bye
