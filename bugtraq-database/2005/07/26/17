Subject: 3Com launches vulnerability-buying program


folks,

as it was announced few minutes ago that "3Com launches
vulnerability-buying program" (through TippingPoint, a company 3Com
acquired earlier this year) 

http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11253
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/

so what do you think about this step? Obviously, they are trying to
fight public disclosure of security vunl's (that why bugtraq exists)
and buy the information so they can have 0day signatures to
TippingPoint IPS solution.
