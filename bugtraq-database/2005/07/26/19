Synopsis
========

Clam AntiVirus is vulnerable to integer overflows when handling several
file formats, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration
with mail servers to perform attachment scanning. Clam AntiVirus also
provides a command line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the
virus database.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.86.2                      >= 0.86.2

Description
===========

Neel Mehta and Alex Wheeler discovered that Clam AntiVirus is
vulnerable to integer overflows when handling the TNEF, CHM and FSG
file formats.

Impact
======

By sending a specially-crafted file an attacker could execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running Clam AntiVirus.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Clam AntiVirus users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.86.2"
