Synopsis
========

Several vulnerabilities in the Mozilla Suite allow attacks ranging from
the execution of javascript code with elevated privileges to
information leakage.

Background
==========

The Mozilla Suite is an all-in-one Internet application suite including
a web browser, an advanced e-mail and newsgroup client, IRC client and
HTML editor.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla          < 1.7.10                    >= 1.7.10
  2  www-client/mozilla-bin      < 1.7.10                    >= 1.7.10
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla
Suite:

* "moz_bug_r_a4" and "shutdown" discovered that the Mozilla Suite was
  improperly cloning base objects (MFSA 2005-56).

* "moz_bug_r_a4" reported that the suite failed to validate XHTML DOM
  nodes properly (MFSA 2005-55).

* Secunia reported that alerts and prompts scripts are presented with
  the generic title [JavaScript Application] which could lead to
  tricking a user (MFSA 2005-54).

* Andreas Sandblad of Secunia reported that top.focus() can be called
  in the context of a child frame even if the framing page comes from a
  different origin and has overridden the focus() routine (MFSA
  2005-52).

* Secunia reported that a frame-injection spoofing bug which was
  fixed in earlier versions, was accidently bypassed in Mozilla Suite
  1.7.7 (MFSA 2005-51).

* "shutdown" reported that InstallVersion.compareTo() might be
  exploitable. When it gets an object rather than a string, the browser
  would generally crash with an access violation (MFSA 2005-50).

* Matthew Mastracci reported that by forcing a page navigation
  immediately after calling the install method can end up running in
  the context of the new page selected by the attacker (MFSA 2005-48).

* "moz_bug_r_a4" reported that XBL scripts run even when Javascript
  is disabled (MFSA 2005-46).

* Omar Khan, Jochen, "shutdown" and Matthew Mastracci reported that
  the Mozilla Suite incorrectly distinguished between true events like
  mouse clicks or keystrokes and synthetic events generated by a web
  content (MFSA 2005-45).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages that would leverage
these issues to inject and execute arbitrary javascript code with
elevated privileges, steal cookies or other information from web pages,
or spoof content.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.10"

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.10"
