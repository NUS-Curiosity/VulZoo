And for all of those embedded devices which use compact flash (eliminate
block-device access as being "random"), the list is only half complete.

Just how good is the pool of random data going to be after powering on
your Linux based embedded VPN access device?

You're missing the point.  If pi or e had good entropy, would they be a
good data source ?  No, they're predictable.

If you start of with the same X bits each time you reboot, even if you
stir them up, the result is going to be predictable.

No.  See above.  This doesn't change the predictability.

Entropy might be a measure of "randomness" but it is not a measure
of predictability.
