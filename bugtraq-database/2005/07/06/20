If you get it right the first time and disclose your engineering design 
decisions and your source code then you can't sell binary upgrades and 
lucrative support contracts.

How do you propose to create employment opportunities for ten billion 
people around the world if you don't lay the groundwork today through 
planned inefficiency and the systematic elimination of profitless 
thoughts and non-commercial creativity?
