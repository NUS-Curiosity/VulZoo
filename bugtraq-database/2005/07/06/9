Synopsis
========

RealPlayer is vulnerable to a heap overflow that could lead to remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

RealPlayer is a multimedia player capable of handling multiple
multimedia file formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/realplayer      < 10.0.5                    >= 10.0.5

Description
===========

RealPlayer is vulnerable to a heap overflow when opening RealMedia
files which make use of RealText.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to play a specially crafted RealMedia file an
attacker could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/realplayer-10.0.5"
