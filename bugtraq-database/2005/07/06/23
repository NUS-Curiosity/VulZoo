Who said anything about "modern commodity hardware"? :)

Not all machines running most of the OSes mentioned so far are lucky
enough to have hardware RNGs.  Certainly at most two of my machines do,
and likely only one.  (One is an Athlon 2600, the other a K6-2/500.
Everything else is much older.  Oh, wait, I have a P2 somewhere.  But
that's it.  All the rest are things like Sun SS20, Sun IPX, Mac IIci,
DEC AXPpci33.

Or do I just not deserve to have _any_ RNG for having the temerity to
run such old hardware? :)
