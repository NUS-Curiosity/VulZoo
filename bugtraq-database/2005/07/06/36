Subject: Cross site scripting in Lotus Notes web mail


When an HTML file attachment is opened in a lotus notes account via the web mail interface, 
the user sees that there is an attachment.
Clicking the attachment does not prompt for saving or opening (like in Yahoo), but opens the malicious HTML immediately, allowing for stealing of the LTPA session cookies.
