Subject: A comment on using CPU resources, addendum.


Some other thoughts concerning the matter.

Do keep in mind people don't usually spend a lot of time on a particular 
page, so if it's run in the background without people's consent, it's 
unlikely to be very useful.
This may however not stop someone from trying to write some client 
gathering info about the user, their habits, their PC, and sending the 
info back before the page is closed or another link clicked.
