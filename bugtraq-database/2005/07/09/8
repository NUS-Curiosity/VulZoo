Kind of like the commercialization of the SETI project combined with
same approach of how these spyware company's drop code on your machine.
I'm sure it's feasible and if it wasn't thought of before, you just now
gave the idea :)

Subject: A comment on using CPU resources

Greetings and Salutations:

I had an issue with my Firefox browser.  The browser was static, yet it
was using 70% or 80% of the CPU of the system.

It got me to thinking.  Java is a programming language.  What would
prevent companies from running a java script on your computer while you
are viewing their page that uses your CPU to do some computing for them?
Instead of selling (or in addition to selling) advertising the company
could also sell CPU to other companies.

Is this feasible?

Ken
