Subject: A comment on using CPU resources


Greetings and Salutations:

I had an issue with my Firefox browser.  The browser was static, yet it was
using 70% or 80% of the CPU of the system.

It got me to thinking.  Java is a programming language.  What would prevent
companies from running a java script on your computer while you are viewing
their page that uses your CPU to do some computing for them?  Instead of
selling (or in addition to selling) advertising the company could also sell
CPU to other companies.

Is this feasible?

Ken
