Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in XMLRPC.iPIMethods allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming. XML-RPC is a remote procedure call
protocol encoded in XML.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/ruby     < 1.8.2-r2                          >= 1.8.2-r2

Description
===========

Nobuhiro IMAI reported that an invalid default value in "utils.rb"
causes the security protections of the XML-RPC server to fail.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
commands.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.2-r2"
