SPI Dynamics Security Bulletin SPI-0001-07282005

Issue:
Potential WebInspect Cross Application Scripting (XAS) Vulnerability

Severity:
Low

Potential Impact:
Remote Code Execution

Recommendation:
All customers should run SmartUpdate to ensure they are running the
latest version of WebInspect (5.5.386 or later).

Affected Software:
WebInspect 5.0.196

Non-Affected Software:
WebInspect 5.5
QAInspect (all versions)
DevInspect (all versions)
SecureObjects (all versions)
AMP (all versions)

Description:
SPI Dynamics has investigated a public report of a Cross Application
Scripting (XAS) vulnerability in WebInspect. We have verified that
WebInspect 5.5 (released May 16th, 2005) is not vulnerable however
WebInspect version 5.0.196 was susceptible. We recommend all customers
upgrade to WebInspect 5.5 which can be performed automatically at any
time by running SmartUpdate.

Background:
Cross application scripting (XAS) is possible when an application
executes data in a security context different from the original content
(presumably one with less security restrictions). For example the data
may be obtained from an un-trusted source (a remote web server) that is
sent unfiltered into a trusted application such as when web content is
downloaded from a remote server, and then re-displayed on the local
host. Any application that downloads and then later displays and
executes web content (such as JavaScript) may be vulnerable to XAS.
