Description: 

The nProtect:Netizen and nProtectPersonal Web Service are an antivirus solutions.
 
It defends user from Internet about well-known hack tools and viruses something

When it need update and patch itself then download from web site such as update.nprotect.net

that time nProtect update program, npdownv.exe, DO NOT CHECK THAT update site URL!!!

We can change URL, update configuration file and so on

But npdownv.exe DO CHECK files that downloaded from update site compressed WITH PASSWORD!!!

this means npdownv.exe already known password for decompress 

I found password in npdownv.exe by REVERSE ENGINEEGERING 

and Neo modified liveup.haz, configuration file

When user accees the phishing page then downloaded trojan from hacker URL

See following detail describe:
