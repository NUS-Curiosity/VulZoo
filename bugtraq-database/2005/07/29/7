Website Baker Project Multiple Vulnerabilities
----------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerabilities
---------------

1) admin/media/browse.php

The "dir" parameter is vulnerable to xss. Also the script blocks ../ but if a non-existant 

directory is chosen the script tries to read it and the error gives path disclosure.

2) 25 accounts of path disclosure when a file is directly accessed. There is too many too list so 

I will just leave them out.

3) In admin/media users are allowed to upload media for their site. This area is supposed to be 

for picture and maybe songs, but the final extension is not checked and php files are able to be 

uploaded and executed on the server. Even though its in the admin directory regular users can use 

this feauture if the admin allows it, so site admins should be aware of this.

Solutions
---------

1) Check to see if the directory exists before trying to read from it. Strip tags from the 

variable to stop the xss.

2) Check to see if a file is directly accessed and if it is have the script die.

3) Edit the source code to disallow file extensions that could lead to malicious scripts being 

run on the server.
