I don't think that it is FUD any more than it was to post lists of packages
which contained copies of zlib.  Many of those packages did not act on
untrusted compressed data, but it was perfectly reasonable to point them out
for further investigation.

In my opinion, it would have been less responsible to have delayed the
announcement while waiting for other projects to assess their vulnerability.
The advisory contained the best information available to us at the time, and
qualified it appropriately where it might have otherwise been misleading.
