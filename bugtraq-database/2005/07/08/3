Subject: Re: [USN-147-1] PHP XMLRPC vulnerability

To avoid confusion, I want to make clear that Horde applications are 
NOT affected by this vulnerability because we don't use the vulnerable 
software. I would appreciate if such statements would be cross checked 
with the projects before releasing them to the public.
