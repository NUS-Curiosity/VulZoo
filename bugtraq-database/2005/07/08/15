Debian Security Advisory DSA 736-2                   security@...ian.org

Package        : spamassassin
Vulnerability  : mail header parsing error
Problem type   : remote DOS
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CAN-2005-1266
Debian Bug     : 314447

A vulnerability was recently found in the way that SpamAssassin parses
certain email headers. This vulnerability could cause SpamAssassin to
consume a large number of CPU cycles when processing messages containing
these headers, leading to a potential denial of service (DOS) attack. 

The version of SpamAssassin in the old stable distribution (woody) is
not vulnerable.

For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.3-2. Note that packages are not yet ready for certain
architectures; these will be released as they become available.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.4-1.

The only change since DSA 736-1 is the addition of packages for certain
architectures that were not available at the time of the original
advisory.

We recommend that you upgrade your sarge or sid spamassassin package.
