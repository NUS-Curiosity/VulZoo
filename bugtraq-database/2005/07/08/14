Debian Security Advisory DSA 735-2                   security@...ian.org

Package        : sudo
Vulnerability  : pathname validation race
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CAN-2005-1993
Debian Bug     : 315115

A local user who has been granted permission to run commands via sudo
could run arbitrary commands as a privileged user due to a flaw in
sudo's pathname validation. This bug only affects configurations which
have restricted user configurations prior to an ALL directive in the
configuration file. A workaround is to move any ALL directives to the
beginning of the sudoers file; see the advisory at
http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/path_race.html for more information.

For the old stable Debian distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.6.6-1.3woody1.

For the current stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.6.8p7-1.1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution, this problem has been fixed in version
1.6.8p9-1.

The only change since DSA 735-1 is the addition of certain architectures
which were not available in the original advisory.

We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.
