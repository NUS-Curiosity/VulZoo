Like anything in security, "it depends".  In particular, it depends on what
the assumed adversary motivations and capabilities are.  If the adversary is
a nation-state with electron microscopes and other expensive devices, and
the disk is believed to have held highly classified information, it's
clearly true that the only way to destroy the data is to burn the disk (and
in the right way).  If, on the other hand, the adversary is someone who's
randomly buying used computers in hopes of finding carelessly deleted files,
then a full reformat is quite enough to cause them to move on to the next
machine - they're not going to have the motivation or equipment to delve
into a randomly selected disk.

Where in between these two extremes it's necessary to burn the disk is an
exercise left to the reader ;-)  You really have to do a risk analysis... If
it's cheaper / easier / less dangerous for the adversary to dumpster dive to
get hardcopies or bribe someone or hack into the system, then destroying the
hardware is putting the effort in the wrong place.  For a lot of classified
systems, the assumption is that obtaining used disks is a low cost attack,
so it's cost effective to use destruction.
