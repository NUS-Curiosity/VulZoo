KDE Security Advisory: libgadu vulnerabilities
Original Release Date: 2005-07-21
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050721-1.txt

0. References
        CVE CAN-2005-1852


1. Systems affected:

        All versions of Kopete as included in
        KDE 3.3.x up to including 3.4.1. KDE 3.2.x and older
        are not affected.


2. Overview:

	Kopete contains a copy of libgadu that is used if
        no compatible version is installed in the system. Several
        input validation errors have been reported in libgadu
        that can lead to integer overflows and remote DoS or
        arbitrary code execution.


3. Impact:

	If the Gadu-Gadu protocol handler in Kopete is used,
        remote users can DoS the Kopete client or possibly even
        execute arbitrary code.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available that update
        the included copy of libgadu to 1.6rc3 which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
