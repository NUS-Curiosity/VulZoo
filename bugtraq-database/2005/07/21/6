this is probably a hoax or an error, the system command is not executed, it's invisibile and inside the html... :) you can put a javascript instead and steal cookies. This is my proof of concept exploit:

(if you have troubles with this script set allow_call_time_pass_reference = on
and register_globals = On)

otherwise you can make with telnet but in the user agent field you can make something like:

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

and when admin open ip log file the javascript will run in the security contest of his system...

however, you can craft some special urls, (look at this link: http://www.rgod.altervista.org/upbgold196xssurlspoc.txt ) to have same results...

sorry for my bad English
