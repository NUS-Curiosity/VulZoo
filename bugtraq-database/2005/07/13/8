well, for the current 2.4 kernel series block device must be different 
from i2o type controllers. I have some servers (no keyboard, no mouse)
with only i2o storage that weren't gathering any "entropy" according to
/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail.
I submitted a patch several times with no luck.
Without the patch the entropy_avail counter was always at 0.
