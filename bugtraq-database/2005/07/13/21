Summary
=======

Cisco Security Agent (CSA) is a network security software agent that provides
threat protection for server and desktop computing systems.

A malicious attacker may be able to send a crafted IP packet to a Windows
workstation or server running CSA 4.5 which may cause the device to halt and/or
reload.

Repeated exploitation will create a sustained DoS (denial of service).

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID CSCsa85175

This advisory is available at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050713-csa.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco CSA version 4.5 when running on any Microsoft Windows platforms except
Windows XP.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following products are confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Cisco CSA 4.0 and earlier
  * Cisco CSA while running on Solaris
  * Cisco CSA while running on Linux
  * Cisco CSA while running on Windows XP

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by vulnerability.

Details
=======

If a crafted IP packet with certain characteristics are sent to a Windows
platform running CSA 4.5, Windows will halt with a blue screen and system
crash.

When exploited, the affected machine will require a reboot to become
operational again.

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID CSCsa85175 


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will cause a reload of the
affected machine.

Software Versions and Fixes

This issue is also fixed with CSA hotfix version 4.5.0.573 or later which is
available for download at 
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/csahf-crypto

A maintenance release is a scheduled revision of Cisco CSA that introduces new
features or bug fixes, or both.

A hotfix is Cisco CSA update that delivers fixes on an accelerated schedule
that introduce new bug fixes.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their regular
update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades should be
obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide website at 
http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third-party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior or
existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as Cisco
Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
support organization for assistance with the upgrade, which should be free of
charge.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco service
contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should get
their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC
contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades for
non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com"
for software upgrades.

See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for additional
TAC contact information, including special localized telephone numbers and
instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various languages.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they have
purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise using such
software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by the terms of Cisco's software
license terms found at http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html,
