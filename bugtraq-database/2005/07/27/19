Subject: Re: Getting round website authentication with Firefox


Actually, this is a "feature" of most if not all browsers, that have no way
to logout of URLs protected
by HTTP basic authentication.

Try to completely close all browser instances between the two attempts and
you will discover that
firefox asks for a login in all cases.
