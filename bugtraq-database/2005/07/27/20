Hello Volker,

I cannot believe the concept of "low-level" format as a last resort 
measure is still considered to be anything else, but "zeroing" out a 
drive. Modern IDE drives are only, truly LLF'ed at factory-level. A long 
time ago, in the world of RLL/MFM disks it was possible to define 
interleave levels, etc., and actually re-create the physical tracks on 
the platter. Not any more.

Personally, in the modern world, I've been hearing more and more of the 
application HDD degaussers to the end of data wiping. I'd be more 
interested in actual research on the extent of data recovery after a 
thorough demagnetization via specialized hardware... Has anyone done 
this kind of research?

Thanks,
Alexander
