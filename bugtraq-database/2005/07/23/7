I agree with most of what you say, and the general idea is valid.  However, the specifics of

is a dangerously naÃ¯ve approach.  With point-and-click easy to use freeware tools under windows, I can do almost 100% retrieval of files after a full reformat, and even after reloading the OS and using it for a while, the simple point-and-click freeware tools can retieve an awful lot of stuff.  And if I have the skills to use more powerful, complex tools, I can do even better, without needing a lot of money, time, or even strong motivation.

Even for a home user, I'd recommend using a program that securely deletes stuff by actively over-writing with multiple passes of random data (sdelete and DBAN are a couple of my favorites).  A format is *not* enough. Your general idea (that it depends on the motivation and resources available to the attacker) is good, just that your level of paranoia should maybe be turned up a notch :)

I'm not positive which Gutmann piece the OP was referring to, but if it's the one I'm thinking of, it's a bit dated -- his methods were briefly really popular as a shortcut to secure deletion, but if they're the ones I think he's referring to, then they don't work with more modern file systems, so simple random passes are better, though more costly to implement.
