In the case of Linux, this still causes the estimate of how much 'good' 
entropy is in the pool to be inflated. Some applications may rely on the 
fact that /dev/random is backed by 'real' entropy, whereas /dev/urandom 
can be pure PRNG output.

IMO, all this discussion is well and good, but it would be much more 
productive for someone to settle the question empirically.
