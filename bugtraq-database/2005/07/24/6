               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated lvm package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152842
Issue date:        2005-07-24
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0972
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated lvm package that fixes a security flaw is now available.

LVM is the Linux Logical Volume Manager utilities.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

A vulnerability has been reported in LVM, which can be exploited by
malicious, local users to perform certain actions on a vulnerable system
with escalated privileges. The vulnerability is caused due to the
"lvmcreate_initrd" script creating temporary files insecurely. This can
be exploited via symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on the
system with the privileges of the user invoking the vulnerable script.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0972 to this issue.

Users of lvm are advised to upgrade to this errata package, which
contains a backported patch correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
