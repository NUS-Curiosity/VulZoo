---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated dhcp package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152835
Issue date:        2005-07-10
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-1006
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated dhcp packages that fix a security issue are now available.

dhcp is a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server and relay
agent.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

"infamous41md" noticed that the log functions in dhcp 2.x pass
parameters to a function that uses format strings. One use seems to be
exploitable in connection with a malicious DNS server. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-1006 to this issue.

Users of dhcp are advised to upgrade to this errata package, which
contains backported patches correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

5. Bug IDs fixed:

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
