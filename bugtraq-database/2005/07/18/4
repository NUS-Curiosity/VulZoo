KDE Security Advisory: Kate backup file permission leak
Original Release Date: 2005-07-18
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050718-1.txt

0. References
        CVE CAN-2005-1920
        https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103331


1. Systems affected:

        All maintained versions of Kate and Kwrite as shipped with
        KDE 3.2.x up to including 3.4.0. KDE 3.1.x and older and
        KDE 3.4.1 and newer are not affected.


2. Overview:

	Kate / Kwrite create a file backup before saving a modified
        file. These backup files are created with default permissions,
        even if the original file had more strict permissions set.


3. Impact:

	Depending on the system security settings, backup files
        might be readable by other users.  Kate / Kwrite are
        network transparent applications and therefore this
        vulnerability might not be restricted to local users.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.


5. Patch:

        A patch for KDE 3.4.0 is available from
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :
