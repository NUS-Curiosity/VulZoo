Synopsis
========

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Thunderbird allow attacks ranging
from execution of script code with elevated privileges to information
leak.

Background
==========

Mozilla Thunderbird is the next-generation mail client from the Mozilla
project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mozilla-thunderbird           < 1.0.5                    >= 1.0.5
  2  mozilla-thunderbird-bin       < 1.0.5                    >= 1.0.5
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Thunderbird:

* "moz_bug_r_a4" and "shutdown" discovered that Thunderbird was
  improperly cloning base objects (MFSA 2005-56).

* "moz_bug_r_a4" also reported that Thunderbird was overly trusting
  contents, allowing privilege escalation via property overrides (MFSA
  2005-41, 2005-44), that it failed to validate XHTML DOM nodes
  properly (MFSA 2005-55), and that XBL scripts ran even when
  Javascript is disabled (MFSA 2005-46).

* "shutdown" discovered a possibly exploitable crash in
  InstallVersion.compareTo (MFSA 2005-50).

* Andreas Sandblad from Secunia reported that a child frame can call
  top.focus() even if the framing page comes from a different origin
  and has overridden the focus() routine (MFSA 2005-52).

* Georgi Guninski reported missing Install object instance checks in
  the native implementations of XPInstall-related JavaScript objects
  (MFSA 2005-40).

* Finally, Vladimir V. Perepelitsa discovered a memory disclosure bug
  in JavaScript's regular expression string replacement when using an
  anonymous function as the replacement argument (CAN-2005-0989 and
  MFSA 2005-33).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could craft malicious email messages that would
leverage these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with
elevated privileges or help in stealing information.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.0.5"

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.0.5"
