===============
1) Introduction
===============


Race Driver is a funny but poorly supported racing game developed and
published by Codemasters (http://www.codemasters.com).
It has been released in March 2003.


#######################################################################

======
2) Bug
======


Race Driver incorrectly uses sprintf() for building different types of
text strings usually used for the visualization of the data.
The places where this bad sprintf() can be exploited are at least 2:
the public chat hosted on the encrypted IRC server peerchat.gamespy.com
and the in-game server browser.

The public chat is a place used by Race Driver while the users wait for
a free server to join. The users automatically join it when they choose
to play on Internet from the Network menu... it is an useless but
forced stage.
Other than the messages in the channel the game supports also the
private messages (whispers) so an attacker can decide to attack a
specific user or just all the users in the room.

The in-game server browser instead is where are showed and ordered the
online servers through the informations received in their replies.

The sprintf() function is affected by two bugs: a format string and a
buffer-overflow caused by text strings of 264 chars.

===========
3) The Code
===========


For testing the bugs through the chat is enough to use the same game or
an IRC client with a Peerchat proxy.
The example chat messages (or also nicknames) for exploiting the bugs
are the following:
   %n%n%n
 and
  
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaRETA

The raw names of the channels used by Race Driver are: #GPG!511 (the
main), #GPG!510, #GPG!508, #GPG!507, #GPG!506, #GPG!509, #GPG!513,
#GPG!512, #GPG!485, #GPG!486 and (for some milliseconds)
#GSP!racedriver

For testing the bugs through a malicious server you need only to host a
game with the name %n%n%n.
