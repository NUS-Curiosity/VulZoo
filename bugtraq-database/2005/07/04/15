Subject: Re: Access right escalation / severe permission problems on
 Raritan Console Servers


Hi,

the second fix FCR7787 was released @ http://www.raritan.com/support/sup_upgrades.aspx.
FCR7551 was withdrawn.

As opposed to FCR7551 FCR7787 locks the remaining account sshd (with busybox' passwd -l). In fact it does a few exec calls (2xadduser,2xdeluser,2xpasswd). It doesn't resolve the permission problems on /etc/shadow and /bin/busybox though. 

Though asking politely the vendor again didn't notify me of the fix. 

Cheers,
       Dirk
