Synopsis
========

WordPress contains PHP script injection, cross-site scripting and path
disclosure vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based content management and publishing
system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress      < 1.5.1.3                      >= 1.5.1.3

Description
===========

James Bercegay of the GulfTech Security Research Team discovered that
WordPress insufficiently checks data passed to the XML-RPC server. He
also discovered that WordPress has several cross-site scripting and
full path disclosure vulnerabilities.

Impact
======

An attacker could use the PHP script injection vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary PHP script commands. Furthermore the cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities could be exploited to execute arbitrary
script code in a user's browser session in context of a vulnerable
site.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-1.5.1.3"
