Subject: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Sybase EAServer 4.2.5 to 5.2


Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Sybase EAServer 4.2.5 to 5.2
-----------------------------------------------------------

Release Date: July 15 2005
Severity: Medium

A vulnerability has been discovered in Sybase EAServer. If exploited,
this can result in
user-specified code being executed under the security context of the
jagsrv.exe process.  To complete this attack, you must be authenticated
to /WebConsole/.
By default, the jagadmin user password is set to blank so getting access
might be trivial.

After authenticating to /WebConsole/ if an attacker sets the value of
the JavaScript
parameter in TreeAction.do to a large value a return address can be 
overwritten due to a stack-based buffer overflow.
