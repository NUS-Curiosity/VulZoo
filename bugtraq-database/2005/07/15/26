Subject: Any info on potential 0day RDP vuln?


Any one have any info on the '0day' RDP DOS vuln as being reported by SANS:

http://isc.sans.org/diary.php
"Windows 0 day exploit?
News of a 0 day exploit against Windows Remote Desktop this morning has been light on details. A remote DOS is possible and has been discussed on the daily dave mailing list. Remote Desktop is not enabled by default on Windows XP SP2 systems however the terminal services service is running in support of Remote Assistance and Fast user switching. The server does not start a listener on port 3389 until a remote assistance request is sent. However if you enable Remote Desktop your system may be vulnerable.
I doubt that this is the least we are going to here of this. "
