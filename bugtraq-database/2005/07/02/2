Dear Erick,

Those are two very valid points.

I agree with you on the first, in general at least (if there's evidence
that the vulnerability is exploited in the wild, and the vendor has made
it clear through action or inaction that no patch is forthcoming, a
publicly posted exploit can serve as a much-needed cattle prod - but
that's a relatively uncommon situation). However, I wasn't talking about
this, and I assume the OP wasn't, either; this is not an argument not to
release exploit code at all.

The second is true; however, it's also true that when there's a
skiddie-friendly exploit out there, you can expect to see a lot more
attacks. Pretty soon. And as pointed out further in the same thread,
exploits function as a much-needed cattle prod for lazy admins too.
And yes, I've needed the prodding a few times, myself.
