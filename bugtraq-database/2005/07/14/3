 Date                13 July 2005 (V 1.00)

 Oracle Vuln#        AS06
 Time to fix         148 days


Details
#######
Oracle Formsbuilder 9.0.4 creates temp files (e.g. s5hs.1htm) in the local 
temp (%TEMP%) directory. These temp-files contain the username and password 
of the current database connection entered in the Formsbuilder. After closing Formsbuilder these files are not deleted.

This security issued was introduced in Formsbuilder 9.0.4 to avoid another 
security issue in older versions of Formsbuilder (cleartext passwords in the 
Apache log file).


Example
#######
<html> <head> ORACLE FORMS.</head>
<body onload="document.pform.submit();" >
<form name="pform" action="http://localhost:8889/forms90/f90servlet" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="form" value="C:\oracle_security\sql_injection_forms\demo1.fmx">
<input type="hidden" name="userid" value="SCOTT/TIGER@...10103">
<input type="hidden" name="obr" value="yes">
<input type="hidden" name="array" value="YES">
</form> </body></html>



Workaround
##########
Set the environment variable TMP, TEMP and TMPDIR to a secure location and 
delete the temp directory on a regular basis.
