Subject: Re: blogtorrent remote/local user password disclosure


The proposed fix does not work.
How about placing a .htaccess with deny from all in the data and torrents directories ?

I'm not sure that there is a vulnerability. My version of blogtorrent (<0.92) has automatically created the .htaccess...
