HPSBUX01164     REVISION: 4

SSRT4884 rev.4 - HP-UX TCP/IP Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

NOTICE:
There are no restrictions for distribution of this Security
Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon
 as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
10 July 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX
running TCP/IP. This vulnerability could be remotely exploited by
an unauthorized user to cause a Denial of Service(DoS).

REFERENCES:
NISCC VU#532967, CAN-2004-0790, CAN-2004-0791, CAN-2004-1060

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.04, B.11.11, B.11.22, B.11.23 running TCP/IP.
HP-UX B.11.11 and B.11.23 running TOUR (Transport Optional Upgrade
Release).

BACKGROUND:

     AFFECTED VERSIONS

     HP-UX B.11.22
     HP-UX B.11.00
     =============
     Networking.NET2-KRN
     action: set ip_pmtu_strategy= 0 and either install binary
             files or filter ICMP

     HP-UX B.11.11
     =============
     Networking.NET2-KRN
     action: set ip_pmtu_strategy= 0 and install PHNE_33159

     HP-UX B.11.23
     =============
     Networking.NET2-KRN
 ->action: set ip_pmtu_strategy= 0 and install PHNE_32606

     HP-UX B.11.11
     HP-UX B.11.23
     =============
     TOUR_PRODUCT.T-NET2-KRN
     action: set ip_pmtu_strategy= 0 and filter ICMP


     HP-UX B.11.04
     =============
     Networking.NET2-KRN
     action: set ip_pmtu_strategy= 0 and filter ICMP

     END AFFECTED VERSIONS


 Note: The latest TOUR (Transport Optional Upgrade Release),
       version 2.4, is available on B.11.11 only.  The latest
       Transport Functionality is available to B.11.23 customers
       in the HP-UX 11i v2 September 2004 release.   Customers
       using TOUR on B.11.23 can apply the workaround (set
       ip_pmtu_strategy= 0 and filter ICMP) or upgrade to the
       HP-UX 11i v2 September 2004 release.  After upgrading the
       action for B.11.23 Networking.NET2-KRN listed above should
       be implemented.

RESOLUTION:

As reported in NISCC VU#532967 ICMP messages may be used to attack
TCP/IP connections.

<http://www.uniras.gov.uk/niscc/docs/al-20050412-00308.html?
lang=en>

There are three issues reported in NISCC VU#532967:

  CVE number: CAN-2004-0790
 <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0790>
  CVE number: CAN-2004-0791
 <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0791>
  CVE number: CAN-2004-1060
 <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1060>

Workarounds are available for all three of these issues.

Until binary files are available for B.11.04 the workarounds
should be used.


 ->Binary files are available for CAN-2004-0790 and CAN-2004-0791
for HP-UX  B.11.00 and B.11.22.

Since PHNE_33159 is now available for B.11.11 the preliminary
binary  files for B.11.11 have been removed from the ftp site.

 ->Since PHNE_32606 is now available for B.11.23 the preliminary
binary  files for B.11.23 have been removed from the ftp site.


Note: If the TOUR (Transport Optional Upgrade Release) product is
      installed the binary files cannot be used.

Until the TOUR product is revised there are several options:

 B.11.11
    1. Use the workarounds.
       or
   2. Remove TOUR and install the binary files.

 B.11.23
    1. Use the workarounds.
        or
   2. Upgrade to the HP-UX 11i v2 September 2004 release
       and install the binary files.

TOUR(Transport Optional Upgrade Release) is available from
<http://www.hp.com/go/softwaredepot>.


Workaround for CAN-2004-1060 may not be necessary.
===================================
Although changes in the binary files and patches for CAN-2004-0790
and CAN-2004-0791 do not prevent the exploit of CAN-2004-1060,
they do make it less likely to succeed.  The sequence number check
suggested in section 5.1 of <http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/
draft-gont-tcpm-icmp-attacks-03.txt> has been implemented.
Customers should consider whether this check reduces the risk of
the exploit to the point that setting ip_pmtu_strategy=0 is not
required.

If the workaround for CAN-2004-1060 is to be used, please note
the following:
=================================================
HPSBUX01137 recommends setting ip_pmtu_strategy = 0 or 3 as a
workaround for the problem of CAN-2005-1192.   CAN-2004-1060 has a
different root cause and cannot be worked around with
p_pmtu_strategy=3.   To work around both CAN-2005-1192 and
CAN-2004-1060 ip_pmtu_strategy=0 must be used.

Please refer to the Manual Actions section below for a summary of
the required actions.

Workarounds:

  CAN-2004-0790 and CAN-2004-0791

     Filter out the following ICMP messages:

    Type 3, Code 2 (Destination Unreachable, Protocol Unreachable)
    Type 3, Code 3 (Destination Unreachable, Port Unreachable)
    Type 4, Code 0 (Source Quench)

  CAN-2004-1060

     Set ip_pmtu_strategy=0.

Note: Filtering "Protocol Unreachable" and "Port Unreachable"
      should not be done without careful testing.  Filtering these
      out may interfere with the correct functioning of network
      components.
      Filtering "Source Quench" should present little risk.


Setting ip_pmtu_strategy=0
==================
Edit /etc/rc.config.d/nddconf to add the following:

TRANSPORT_NAME[n]=ip
NDD_NAME[n]=ip_pmtu_strategy
NDD_VALUE[n]=0

where 'n' is the next available index value as described in the
nddconf comments.

This value will take effect when the system is rebooted.
Until the system can be rebooted use the following command
to read the /etc/rc.config.d/nddconf file and set the tunable
parameters:

  /usr/bin/ndd -c

The ip_pmtu_strategy parameter can be displayed by the
following command:

  /usr/bin/ndd -get /dev/ip ip_pmtu_strategy

Note: Since open connections will remain potentially vulnerable
      until they are closed and certain internal data structures
      are released it is recommended that the system be rebooted.

Note: There is a defect that will cause "ndd -c" to fail if there
      are more than 10 directives in /etc/rc.config.d/nddconf.
      That defect is fixed in the following patches:

              B.11.11 - PHNE_25644 or subsequent
              B.11.04 - PHNE_26076 or subsequent
              B.11.00 - PHNE_26125 or subsequent


Preliminary binary files
==============

 ->Preliminary binary files are available for B.11.00 and B.11.22.
Patches are available for B.11.11 and B.11.23.  The patches and
the preliminary binary files address CAN-2004-0790 and
CAN-2004-0791 only.  Although changes in the patches and binary
files for CAN-2004-0790 and CAN-2004-0791 do not prevent the
exploit of CAN-2004-1060, they do make it less likely to succeed.

Instructions for downloading and installing the binary files are
contained in readme files available here:

     System:    hprc.external.hp.com  (192.170.19.51)
     Login:     icmp
     Password:  icmp

    FTP Access:
                 ftp://icmp:icmp@...c.external.hp.com/
            or: ftp://icmp:icmp@....170.19.51/
    Note: The links above may not work for all browsers.  If the
          link fails the url should be entered directly into the
          browser's address field.

Since a patch is available for B.11.11 the readme.11.11.txt and
corresponding binary files have been removed from the ftp site.

 ->Since a patch is available for B.11.23 the readme.11.23.txt and
corresponding binary files have been removed from the ftp site.

instructions:
