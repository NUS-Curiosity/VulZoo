Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal, which may allow an attacker
to run arbitrary code or crash the program.

Background
==========

Ethereal is a feature rich network protocol analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/ethereal      < 0.10.10                   >= 0.10.10

Description
===========

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier than
0.10.10, including:

* The Etheric and 3GPP2 A11 dissectors are vulnerable to buffer
  overflows (CAN-2005-0704 and CAN-2005-0699).

* The GPRS-LLC could crash when the "ignore cipher bit" option is
  enabled (CAN-2005-0705).

* Various vulnerabilities in the IAPP, JXTA, and sFlow dissectors.

Impact
======

An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash
Ethereal and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running Ethereal, which could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

For a temporary workaround you can disable all affected protocol
dissectors. However, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the
latest stable version.

Resolution
==========

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.10"
