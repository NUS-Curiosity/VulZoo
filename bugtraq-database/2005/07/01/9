  Seattle.  HTH.

  Wonderful though it would be if it was all someone else's fault, it's
wishful thinking.  We've *been* the software business for the past 30 years
and it's wishful thinking to hope that all the problems are the fault of the
most recent newcomers.  "The crisis in software engineering" has been a
recognized and ongoing problem since the late 60s.  (And before that, it was
still "ongoing", just not "recognized").


    cheers,
