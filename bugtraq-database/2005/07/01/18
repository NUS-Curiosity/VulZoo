Package name:      clamav, cpplus, dev, imagemagick, kerberos5, kernel,
                   openldap, pam_ldap, perl-net-server, php, php4,
                   sqlgrey, swup
Summary:           Multiple bug- and security fixes
Date:              2005-07-01
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on end of life for Trustix Secure Linux 1.5 and 2.1:
  Trustix Secure Linux versions 1.5 and 2.1 reached their planned end of
  life on June 30th 2005.  This is the last batch of updates for those
  versions of the distribution.  Users of TSL 1.5 and 2.1 are encouraged
  to upgrade to the current stable version 2.2 as soon as possible.

Package description:
  clamav: 
  Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of
  this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning).
  The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon,
  a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet.
  The programs are based on a shared library distributed with package,
  which you can use with your own software.
  Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date .
  
  cpplus: 
  CP+ is a web-based tool for remote administration of dedicated servers.
  It can be used to perform basic administrative tasks and create/manage
  domains through a graphical interface, which makes system administration
  easy and comfortable. Users don't need to remember a long list of console
  commands with complex syntax and valid parameter values.
  All major system management tasks are now presented as icons providing
  a single entry point from which to perform a task.
  
  dev: 
  The Trustix operating system uses file system entries to represent
  devices (CD-ROMs, floppy drives, etc.) attached to the machine. All of
  these entries are in the /dev tree (although they don't have to be).
  This package contains the most commonly used /dev entries.
  
  imagemagick: 
  ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read, write, and
  manipulate an image in any of the more popular image  formats including GIF,
  JPEG, PNG, PDF, and Photo CD.
  
  kerberos5: 
  (MIT) Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
  provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using
  secret-key cryptography.  A free implementation of this protocol is
  available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is
  available in many commercial products as well.
  
  kernel: 
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.
  
  openldap: 
  LDAP servers and clients, as well as interfaces to other protocols.
  Note that this does not include the slapd interface to X.500 and
  therefore does not require the ISODE package.
  
  pam_ldap: 
  This package includes a LDAP access clients: pam_ldap.
  
  Pam_ldap is a module for Linux-PAM that supports password changes, V2/V3
  clients, Netscapes SSL/OpenSSL, ypldapd, Netscape Directory Server password
  policies, access authorization, crypted hashes, etc.

  perl-net-server:
  perl-net-server module from CPAN for perl.
  
  php,php4: 
  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language.  PHP attempts to make it
  easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages.  PHP
  also offers built-in database integration for several commercial
  and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
  database-enabled web page with PHP is fairly simple.  The most
  common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI
  scripts.  The mod_php module enables the Apache web server to
  understand and process the embedded PHP language in web pages.
  
  sqlgrey: 
  SQLgrey is a Postfix grey-listing policy service with auto-white-listing
  written in Perl with SQL database as storage backend.
  Greylisting stops 50 to 90 % junk mails (spam and virus) before they
  reach your Postfix server (saves BW, user time and CPU time).
  
  swup: 
  SWUP - SoftWare UPdater is an extension for existing software packaging
  systems to facilitate automatic and secure update and install. SWUP
  handles dependencies between software packages, and is able to fetch
  additional required software when installing or upgrading.
  

Problem description:
  clamav: 
  - Edited freshclam.sh so that freshclam can be started  when
    $LOGFILE is empty. Bug #976.

  cpplus: 
  - New upstream 2.5.2.

  dev: 
  - Added drbd* entries to /dev. Fix Bug #815.
  
  imagemagick: 
  - Fixed an obscure heap-overflow vulnerability in the PNM reader reported by 
    Damian Put.
  - Fixed memory overflow computation.
  
  kerberos5: 
  - Security Fix: Fix for CAN-2004-0175 to krb5 rcp based on Markus Friedl's
    fix for OpenSSH scp.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CAN-2004-0175 to this issue.
  
  kernel: 
  - Add IPX Protocol support, Bug #983
  
  openldap: 
  - Fix, openldap when connecting to a slave using TLS, does not use TLS for
    the subsequent connection if the client is referred to a master, which
    causes a password to be sent in cleartext and allows remote attackers to
    sniff the password.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CAN-2005-2069 to this issue.
  
  pam_ldap: 
  - Fix, pam_ldap when connecting to a slave using TLS, does not use TLS for 
    the subsequent connection if the client is referred to a master, which 
    causes a password to be sent in cleartext and allows remote attackers to 
    sniff the password.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CAN-2005-2069 to this issue.

  perl-net-server:
  - New upstream.
  
  php: 
  - Security Fix: PHP XML RPC's remote code execution vulnerability.
  - GulfTech Security recently discovered a vulnerability in the PHP XML RPC
    that leads to remote code execution.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CAN-2005-1921 to this issue.
  
  sqlgrey: 
  - Multiple Bug Fixes
  - rebuilt on perl-net-server 0.88 to fix lockups.
  
  swup: 
  - New Upstream
  

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
