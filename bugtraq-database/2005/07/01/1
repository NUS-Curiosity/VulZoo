I wrote a more detailed reply to Melvin off-list.  This response misses 
the point of the issue... which is not the fact that uninitialized data 
exists on disk (a known fact exploited by everything from "Delete undo" 
tools to forensic software), but that the NTFS accounting code treats 
said data as a valid portion of the file's content, thus making it 
readable to users without privileged access to the system.

VulnWatch Mod Note: Moved to VulnDiscuss, as I feel this to be the more 
sensible forum of discussion.  You may want to move the original 
response there as well, to avoid confusion.
