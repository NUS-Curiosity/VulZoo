These assumptions are completely wrong. Please read 
http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/icmp-attacks-against-tcp.html

The IPv4 minimum MTU is 68, and not 576. If you blindly send packets larger 
than 68 with the DF bit set, in the case there's an intermmediate with an 
MTU lower that 576, the connection will stall.

576 is the minimum reassembly buffer size. That is the minimum packet size 
every *end-system* should be able to reassemble, and NOT the minimum packet 
size that can get to destination without fragmentation.

Kindest regards,
