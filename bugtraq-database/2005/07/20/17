PATCHADVISOR VULNERABILITY ALERT                

Cisco CallManager CTI Manager Remote Denial Of Service Vulnerability 


VULNERABILITY NAME
==================
Cisco CallManager CTI Manager Remote Denial Of Service Vulnerability

PUBLISHED DATE
==============
12-JUL-05

UPDATED DATE
============
19-JUL-05


BACKGROUND
==========
Cisco Call Manager (CCM) is the software-based call-processing component of the 
Cisco IP telephony solution which extends enterprise telephony features and 
functions to packet telephony network devices such as IP phones, media processing 
devices, voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateways, and multimedia applications.

More information about the product is available here: 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps556/index.html

DESCRIPTION
===========
Cisco Call Manager may restart when more than 1GB of memory is used. Sending 
specially crafted packets to the CCM will cause the CCM to use more than 1 gigabyte 
of virtual memory. 

An example of how to send a specially crafted packet is:

wget http://victim:2000

Cisco has allocated CSCee00116 for this vulnerability. Their bulletin is available here:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050712-ccm.shtml

IMPACT
======
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in resource starvation resulting 
in high CPU utilization, unresponsive terminal services, the inability to run CCM 
Admin or to map drives. This may subsequently lead to phones not responding, phones 
unregistering from the Cisco CallManager, or Cisco CallManager restarting.  In 
extreme examples, all VoIP phones may restart after only 1 packet being sent to the 
CCM.

Cisco CallManager 3.2 and earlier 
Cisco CallManager 3.3, versions earlier than 3.3(5)
Cisco CallManager 4.0, versions earlier than 4.0(2a)SR2b
