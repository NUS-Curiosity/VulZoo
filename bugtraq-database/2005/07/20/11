Note that vulnerabilities can be reported to CA by a) sending email 
to vuln@...com, or b) submitting via a web form at 
http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/vulninfo/submit.aspx .  The 
form can be found by clicking on the "Submit a Vulnerability" link
at http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/ .  This information is 
documented in the "Vendor Dictionary" at OSVDB.
