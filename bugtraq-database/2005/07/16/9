               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated kdelibs/kdebase packages fix security issues

Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix

1. Topic:

Updated kdelibs and kdebase packages that resolve several security
issues are now available.

The kdelibs packages include libraries for the K Desktop Environment.
The kdebase packages include core applications for the K Desktop
Environment.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of
Web browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of
URLs. However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and
character encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a
cookie to a path outside of the originally-specified subset. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0592 to this issue.

iDEFENSE identified a vulnerability in the Opera web browser that could
allow remote attackers to create or truncate arbitrary files. The KDE
team has found two similar vulnerabilities that also exist in KDE. A
flaw in the telnet URI handler may allow options to be passed to the
telnet program, resulting in creation or replacement of files. An
attacker could create a carefully crafted link such that when opened by
a victim it creates or overwrites a file with the victim's permissions.
A flaw in the mailto URI handler may allow options to be passed to the
kmail program. These options could cause kmail to write to the file
system or to run on a remote X display. An attacker could create a
carefully crafted link in such a way that access may be obtained to run
arbitrary code as the victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0411 to these
issues.

Andrew Tuitt reported that versions of KDE up to and including 3.2.3
create temporary directories with predictable names. A local attacker
could prevent KDE applications from functioning correctly, or overwrite
files owned by other users by creating malicious symlinks. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0689 to this issue.

WESTPOINT internet reconnaissance services has discovered that the KDE
web browser Konqueror allows websites to set cookies for certain country
specific secondary top level domains. An attacker within one of the
affected domains could construct a cookie which would be sent to all
other websites within the domain leading to a session fixation attack.
This issue does not affect popular domains such as .co.uk, .co.in, or
.com. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0721 to this issue.

A frame injection spoofing vulnerability has been discovered in the
Konqueror web browser. This issue could allow a malicious website to
show arbitrary content in a named frame of a different browser window.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0746 to this issue.

Secunia Research discovered a window injection spoofing vulnerability
affecting the Konqueror web browser. This issue could allow a malicious
website to show arbitrary content in a different browser window. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CAN-2004-1158 to this issue.

A bug was discovered in the way kioslave handles URL-encoded newline
(%0a) characters before the FTP command. It is possible that a specially
crafted URL could be used to execute any ftp command on a remote server,
or potentially send unsolicited email. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-1165 to this issue.

All users of KDE are advised to upgrade to this updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
