1. Topic:

An updated SquirrelMail package that fixes a cross-site scripting
vulnerability is now available.

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

A cross-site scripting bug has been found in SquirrelMail. This issue
could allow an attacker to send a mail with a carefully crafted header,
which could result in causing the victim's machine to execute a
malicious script. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has
assigned the name CAN-2004-1036 to this issue.

Jimmy Conner discovered a missing variable initialization in
Squirrelmail. This flaw could allow potential insecure file inclusions
on servers where the PHP setting "register_globals" is set to "On". This
is not a default or recommended setting. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0075 to
this issue.

A URL sanitisation bug was found in Squirrelmail. This flaw could allow
a cross site scripting attack when loading the URL for the sidebar. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2005-0103 to this issue.

A missing variable initialization bug was found in Squirrelmail. This
flaw could allow a cross site scripting attack. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2005-0104 to this issue.

Users of Squirrelmail are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains backported patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
