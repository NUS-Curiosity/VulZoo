Subject: Tool release: Xprobe2 v0.3


The xprobe2 development team is pleased to announce the immediate  
availability of Xprobe2 v0.3. Xprobe2 is a remote active operating  
system fingerprinting tool which uses advanced techniques, some which  
where first to be introduced with Xprobe2, such as the usage of  
statistical analysis ('fuzzy logic') to match between probe response 
(s) to its signature database and others, in order to provide with  
accurate results regarding the underlying operating system of a  
probed element(s).

Version 0.3 introduces several enhancements:
- New application-based OS fingerprinting modules (SMB, SNMP)
- Several bug fixes (i.e. pcap sniffing)

Changes made to the signature DB:
- Mac OS X 10.2.x, 10.3.x, 10.4.x
- Linux Kernels 2.4.29, 2.4.30, 2.6.11, 2.6.12
- FreeBSD 4.11, 5.4
- OpenBSD 3.7

The new version of xprobe2 can be downloaded from:
