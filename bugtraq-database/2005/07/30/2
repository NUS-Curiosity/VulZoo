Subject: RE: [VOIPSEC] VoIP-Phones: Weakness in proccessing SIP-Notify-Messages


All-

Avaya is unable to duplicate any application unhandled exceptions,
crashes, or reboots due to unsolicited SIP NOTIFY message processing in
the Avaya 4620 and IP Softphone endpoints.  Furthermore, Avaya tested a
number of variations of the unsolicited SIP NOTIFY messages including
utilizing network captures from Tobias Glemser.  After a discussion with
Mark Teicher about his testing, Avaya is still unable to identify any
issues with the processing of unsolicited SIP NOTIFY messages in these
products.  

Avaya has also tested SIP endpoints currently under development and we
have confirmed that they are not vulnerable - a "481 Subscription does
not exist" response is sent for unsolicited SIP NOTIFY messages as per
RFC 3265.
  
Since the Avaya H.323 endpoints (e.g. 4620 and IP Softphone) don't open
or utilize any of the SIP ports (i.e. 5060 and 5061), messages to these
ports had no affect on the Avaya H.323 endpoints in our testing.  For
thoroughness, Avaya tested ports on the Avaya H.323 endpoints, which are
open for processing H.323 messages.  

On Avaya IP Softphone, the following log entries can be seen when a SIP
message is received, on open H.323 ports, from an unexpected address:

[07/08/2005 12:47:16:930] ERROR: RAS : processingPendingRead:
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is not in the server list. Discarding the message...

When a SIP message is received from a valid call server IP address, on
the open H.323 ports, the following log entries can be seen:

[07/08/2005 14:42:09:944] ERROR: RAS : RASIncomingMsg:
EmH225RASParseMessage failed. result=-939523830.
[07/08/2005 14:42:09:944] ERROR: RAS : processIncomingMsg: Validation
failed   

These log entries are made to note that an invalid H.323 message was
received and discarded; however, Avaya did not witness any unhandled
exceptions or crashes in our testing.   

Note: To view these messages, low level logging must be enabled.  This
can be done by selecting "Tools" from the IP Softphone dropdown menu
followed by clicking "Program Options."  Under "Program Options" select
"Event Logging" and check the box for IP Softphone "Enable ALL logging
for technical support".  This change will require an application restart
and the above messages can be found in the "iClarity.txt" log file
located in the Avaya IP Softphone logging directory (i.e. "C:\Program
Files\Avaya\Avaya IP Softphone\Log Files").

If in the future, more information becomes available, Avaya is willing
to reevaluate our assessment and pursue the issue further.  Information
regarding possible security issues in Avaya products or services should
be sent to securityalerts[at]avaya.com.

All-

The Avaya Product Security Support Team (PSST) has been alerted to the
"Weakness in processing SIP-Notify-Messages" advisory.  We are in the
process of investigating whether any Avaya SIP-enabled or H.323-enabled
devices are affected by these issues.  In addition, we are attempting to
work with Mark to duplicate and validate his testing of the Avaya H.323
IPSoftphone and Avaya 4620 hard phone.  Once our investigation is
complete we will update the list with our findings and, if necessary,
release an Avaya Security Advisory to address any outlined concerns. 

The Avaya Product Security Support Team (PSST) takes the security of
Avaya products seriously. We would like to develop a relationship with
our customers and the public to encourage them to forward
vulnerabilities to us. Please send information regarding any discovered
security problems with Avaya products to securityalerts[at]avaya.com. I,
or someone on the PSST, will work directly to validate the problem and
coordinate a response; including an acknowledgement for working with us
to help protect customers.

Interesting results when executed against the Avaya Softphone and
Avaya 4620.  The Avaya Softphone throws an exception msg handler
window and the application process handler becomes unresponsive  :)
