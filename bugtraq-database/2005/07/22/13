 Exploit and    Patch


Well it seems that there has been some confusions regarding the exploit. One of the users at my site www.h4cky0u.org reported me the exploit and claimed that it was coded by him and his friend. Then i reported the matter to Zinho of HSC who released the advisory regarding the same. I later realised that it was the original work of the gulftech team and i give them full cerdits for this. This is a mistake on my part and i apologise to the original coders of the exploit regarding the same.
