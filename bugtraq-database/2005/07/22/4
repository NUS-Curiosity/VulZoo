 	The sophistication of data recovery in LEAs and TLAs is such that 
drives that once held classified data are routinely shredded and slagged.

 	But for those of us who handle sensitive and personal data (and, 
unfortunately, don't have access to a smelter), having a kiln, a drill 
press, and a belt sander is almost as good.  :)

 	As for retiring CD-ROMs, I just do what I learned from the DoD:
