This is something I must agree with you Bipin. Microsoft has always been
polite and responsible atleast to whatever I have posted them in the past.
To all my posting they have replied back withing 24 to 30 hrs and I believe
it would have been much faster unless there would have been a time zone
difference of 10 to 12 hrs between my location and Redmond. :)
