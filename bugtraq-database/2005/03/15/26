Subject: Re: SAV9 Functionality Hole - misses virus files


Forgive me if this is misposted, but related to this issue:

 I've been looking for some time for a good white paper or any technical 
documentation regarding the communcation of SAV clients and servers, and 
SAV in general.  One particularly annoying issue is the inability to 
change the default Auto-Protect options.  This means that when a new 
client is installed (as we use encrypted SMTP) they are unable to send 
email until we have turned off "Email Auto-Protect" on that specific 
machine in the SSC on the Parent server.  In any case, if anyone has a 
good source of information regarding the internals of SAV 9, it would be 
greatly appreciated.
