I would rather suggest that the string comparison function used in IDN
takes "homograph caracters"[1] into account: just like the current DNS
considers 'a' == 'A', the IDN DNS should consider "LATIN SMALL LETTER
a" == "CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER a" == "CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER A" ==
"GREEK CAPITAL LETTER A"[2], and similarly for the other homograph chars.

A true fix in this way cannot be implemented browser-side, but rather
in the IDN implementation; still, one can make the browser put the IDN
names in a *canonical form* using this equivalence relation: that is,
"CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER a" in a hostname is always sent on the wire as
a "LATIN SMALL LETTER a".

[1] or whatever the correct term for these is...

[2] so, the transitive closure of the (uppercase == lowercase) and the
homograph equivalence relation implies for instance "LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER A" == "GREEK SMAL LETTER \alpha", which are not homograph, but
I see less harm in this than in the current IDN.
