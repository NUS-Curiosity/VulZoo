Synopsis
========

The Ringtone Tools utilities contain a buffer overflow vulnerability,
potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Ringtone Tools is a program for creating ringtones and logos for mobile
phones.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-misc/ringtonetools       < 2.23                       >= 2.23

Description
===========

Qiao Zhang has discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
'parse_emelody' function in 'parse_emelody.c'.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a Ringtone Tools user to open a
specially crafted eMelody file, which would potentially lead to the
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ringtone Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-misc/ringtonetools-2.23"
