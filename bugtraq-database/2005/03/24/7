Yes, but are they actually used? 

The X-hashcash header has to be sent "blind". There is no way for the
recipient to tell the sender that it uses hashcash and how many bits it
requires. At best, this information could be included in the reject
message, but 1) that requires the sender to read the bounce message
(which the average user doesn't) and 2) especially Spamassassin is often
used not to reject messages but only to mark them so they can be sorted
into a Junk folder. 

This makes it very likely that the sender must be told to use hashcash
in some other way (probably by telephone: "did you get my mail?" - "no,
you have to use hashcash" - "what's that?"), which makes it IMHO highly
unlikely that it is used anywhere without prior agreement - but if you
agree in advance to use hashcash, you can agree on simpler measures, too
(e.g. whitelisting each others outgoing mail servers).
