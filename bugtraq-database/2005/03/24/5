Hello BugTraq readers,

I would like to make some brief announcements regarding upcoming Black Hat events.

Our European show is coming to Amsterdam, March 31-April 1. Our on-line registration will be closing this Thursday, March 24. If you wish to register after March 24, you must register on-site.

Second, we are excited to announce our first stand-alone training in Seattle WA, May 23-24. Among the many classes we are offering are Joe Grands Hands On Hardware Hacking And Defense Techniques and the ever popular Infrastructure Attacktecs & Defentecs ­ Hacking Cisco Networks by Stephen Dugan.

Registration for USA Black Hat Briefings in Las Vegas has opened. An early bird registration rate is currently available until May 15 ­ register early and save.

This year marks a dramatic increase in our training offerings ­ there are over twenty separate training sessions to choose from. Seven of our training offerings are new for 2005. Our new instructors include NGS Consulting, Special Ops, Joe Grand, the Grugq, Dominique Brezinski, Thorsten Holz with Maximillian Dornseif and Adam Laurie. Our class sizes are limited and many classes consistently sell out, so register early to ensure a place.

Finally I would like to remind you that our Black Hat USA CFP closes May 1. This year we are having an early round of selections ­ the earlier you submit, the better your chances to be selected.

Thank you.

Jeff Moss
