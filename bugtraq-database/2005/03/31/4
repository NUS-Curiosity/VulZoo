Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in LimeWire can be exploited to disclose sensitive
information.

Background
==========

LimeWire is a Java peer-to-peer client compatible with the Gnutella
file-sharing protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-p2p/limewire       < 4.8.1                           >= 4.8.1

Description
===========

Two input validation errors were found in the handling of Gnutella GET
requests (CAN-2005-0788) and magnet requests (CAN-2005-0789).

Impact
======

A remote attacker can craft a specific Gnutella GET request or use
directory traversal on magnet requests to read arbitrary files on the
system with the rights of the user running LimeWire.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LimeWire users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/limewire-4.8.1"
