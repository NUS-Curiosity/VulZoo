Subject: SecurityForest Exploitation Framework Beta has been released!

Hey Guys,
The Security Forest Exploitation Framework Beta has been released and
is available for download:
http://www.securityforest.com/wiki/index.php/Exploitation_Framework

SecurityForest's Exploitation Framework is similar in concept to the
open-source Metasploit Framework (http://www.metasploit.com) and the
commercial offerings such as Immunity's CANVAS
(http://www.immunity.com) and Core Security Technology's Impact
(http://www.corest.com).

The major difference between the above mentioned frameworks and the
SecurityForest Exploitation Framework is that it leverages the massive
amount of exploits available in the ExploitTree
(http://www.securityforest.com/wiki/index.php/Category:ExploitTree).
These exploits are publically available and do not have to be
re-written to be used in the framework (no matter what language and
sometimes no matter what OS).
It basically acts as a Graphical User Interface to the ExploitTree
which is dynamically updated at the same time as the ExploitTree.

The above mentioned frameworks are great and the Exploitataion
Framework doesn't even compare to them on a technical level, it just
fills the gap.

The Exploitation Framework is provided for legal penetration testing
and research purposes only.

Cheers,
Loni
