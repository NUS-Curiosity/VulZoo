Subject: Possible windows+python bug




This bug is produced on WindowsXP SP1 (OSVer : 5_1_2600) with Python2.3 installed.

Start Python and type (of course x.x.x.x should be replaced with IP address):

import socket
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_RAW,4)
s.sendto("",("x.x.x.x",0))

Press ENTER and your win box should crash immediately.
On my test after restart windows returned BCCode : d1.

By the way, IP protocol 0x04 is "IP over IP", and I could send such datagrams month ago with Python (although Microsoft has crippled some protocols).
Now, this is maybe specific to this configuration, or it could be due to some driver (BCCode: d1 is specific for drivers related problems). It needs further testing on different configurations.
