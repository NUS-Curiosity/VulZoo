Another question, how can one prove that it was found by disassembling the code?
What if it were found by brute force testing?  I can't imagine that a company
would prohibit the user from testing the functionality of a product they sell? A
friend of mine told me this sort of legal piracy was commonplace - have there
ever been any actual legal proceedings in a similar situation?  I'm not finding
anything good on google.
