Nonsense. Absurd, ridiculous nonsense.

There is only one party who has any say over what code gets executed by a CPU: the owner of that physical property.

Everyone else can go fly a kite.

Take your intellectual property fantasies and your heady legal concerns to law school, they have no place in security technology.

Give me a computer that is defensible, so that *my* intellectual property and *my* personal legal liability exposure (both civil and criminal) can be defended, and stop trying to give me the ability to control other people's computers and impose my intellectual property “rights” on them by force.

The more you try to stuff Intellectual Property down people's throats as though it is “Property” that grants its “owner” rights equivalent to rights of real property ownership, the closer you push us to a complete abandonment of all IP protections.

Intellectual property only has value as long as I cooperate with your belief in its value.

Tangible property has value because I can smash your head in with it, whether you believe in its value or not. Get a clue, please. You're a danger to our collective future as a civilization.
