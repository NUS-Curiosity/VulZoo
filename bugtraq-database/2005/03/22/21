Depends on what you want out of it.  Go to www.hotjobs.com or dice.com and type in CISSP.   You'll see lot's of good jobs that list CISSP as either a requirement or a desired background.

That said, I heard a joke recently that goes something like this:
"Getting your CISSP and trying to work in the Information Security field is a bit like reading the Hardy Boys series and applying for a job at the FBI... except that's not really fair to the Hardy Boys, as that series actually does cover some investigation and espionage techniques."

I'm not sure how we got to the point where the CISSP became so popular.  The test has very little to do with security.  In fact, you will get throgh the CISSP test less confused and with a higher test score the less you actually know about security.  Just get the Boson test prep and you should pass the first time you try.

And if you do pass, please, please, don't affix it to the end of your name. One of the easiest ways to find out if the email is even worth reading is if the poster has CISSP as part of their name.  If they do, it's usually safe to hit delete before you get more confused :).
