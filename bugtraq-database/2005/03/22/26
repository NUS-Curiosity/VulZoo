So much haterade it could drown a NFL football team.

The CISSP is good for a few reasons.  

It exposes all of us packet heads to weird things that we may or may
not normally do in our day to day grind.   While a mm deep and a mile
wide is apt at describing it from a knowledge point of view, it is
that very notion that makes the CISSP worth something.   For me it
comes back to the whole "why do i need a degree? i am smartar then
those edumacted foolz upstairs any hoo!".  For me the value add was
that i got to learn a bit about stuff that was "out of the box" that i
have worked myself into via specialization.  Meaning it exposed me to
all sorts of fun stuff like management issues of IA policies, legal
aspects of Infosec, and all that warm gooey goodness.

Does it make me a more well rounded individual?  You bet, ever since i
added those fine words to my name I have been pimping bitches to no
end.  I mean the womenz just melt when you tell them you are a
Certified Informant ion Systems Security Professional. It just has
that ring to it.

Is it the ultimate in geek mental masturbatory bling? NOPE (i think
the SANS GSE is at this point)

Does it make those ever so sezzy HR chicks melt?  Yup
Oh and it makes your boss all tingly with pride when he goes on
sales/business lunches.


So to recap, CISSP is good for its prestige and ability to show the
hardest core of geeks that there is more then reverse engineering
binaries when it comes to Infosec.   If you all ready know all the
domains inside and out to a point where studying INDEPTH the Knowledge
base, then what in the hell are you doing on this list?  You should be
out r00ting Iranian nuke plants while living in that bunker that the
DIA keeps you in.

In fact, you will get throgh the CISSP test less confused and with a higher test score the less you actually know about security.  Just get the Boson test prep and you should pass the first time you try.
