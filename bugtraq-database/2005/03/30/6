Subject: RE: Multiple Sql injection, and multiple XSS vulnerabilities in    Photopost PHP Pro Photo Gallery Software.


The SQL Injection issue in showmembers.php (showmembers.php?si=[SQL]) was
reported to one of the lead developers Michael Pierce on March 11th 2005 by
James Bercegay of GulfTech Research And Development and has since been fixed
after being confirmed a legitimate security risk. Users with the older
vulnerable versions are urged to upgrade asap. More information can be found
on the official PhotoPost forums.
