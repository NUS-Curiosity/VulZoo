Synopsis
========

Smarty's "Template security" feature can be bypassed, potentially
allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code.

Background
==========

Smarty is a template engine for PHP. The "template security" feature of
Smarty is designed to help reduce the risk of a system compromise when
you have untrusted parties editing templates.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/smarty       < 2.6.8                             >= 2.6.8

Description
===========

A vulnerability has been discovered within the regex_replace modifier
of the Smarty templates when allowing access to untrusted users.

Impact
======

This issue may allow a remote attacker to bypass the "template
security" feature of Smarty, and execute arbitrary PHP code.

Workaround
==========

Do not grant template access to untrusted users.

Resolution
==========

All Smarty users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/smarty-2.6.8"
