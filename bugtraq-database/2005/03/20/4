Synopsis
========

Multiple buffer overflows have been found in OpenSLP, which could lead
to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenSLP is an open-source implementation of Service Location Protocol
(SLP).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/openslp       < 1.2.1                           >= 1.2.1

Description
===========

Multiple buffer overflows have been found in OpenSLP, when handling
malformed SLP packets.

Impact
======

By sending specially crafted SLP packets, a remote attacker could
potentially execute arbitrary code with the rights of the OpenSLP
daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSLP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/openslp-1.2.1"
