What's truly interesting is that the legal counsel for iDownload/iSearch 
indicates that there is a "lively debate" going on on the internet about 
whether or not their program is spyware or not.

Maybe I'm not looking in the same places, but I have never seen any 
debate regarding the classification of these programs, at least not a 
lively one.
As for my own experience, I've witnessed iSearch/iDownload packages 
being installed on systems during adware/spyware infestations.  Only one 
conclusion can be gained from that:  You guys are on the right side of 
this argument and these people need to be opposed.

Their assertions are laughable.
