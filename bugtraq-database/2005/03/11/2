My Microsoft Tech Support liason (TAM) confirms this to be true, but has
no further information at this time.

All:

I would like to hear from someone who can reproduce this. If you can,
please send
details with OS, patches installed, pcaps, etc. not a report of what
tools you used
to create the packet, sniff and replay the results. I've tested this and
either my
machines are magically protected from this attack, or it is invalid
(despite what
the press might say). I'd like some outside corroboration of this
attack.

even sniff malicious packet. Using tcpreplay to script this attack
results in total collapse of the network.

NO answer received, so I decided to share this info with security
community.
