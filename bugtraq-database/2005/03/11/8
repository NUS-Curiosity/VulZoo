        (Off site lab equipment provided by BCIT IEL)

Description
-----------
Advanced and intermediate security training 
and technology enhancement for information 
security professionals.

To address the need for intermediate and advanced 
educational requirements that go beyond the introductory 
materials typically found in most currently existing 
training (which are often geared towards the 
novice level) for professionals who already have
significant work experience, and want to further 
improve their skills, we have assembled a curriculum 
of hands-on, half day, training programs - delivered 
by industry renowned experts who are pre-eminent 
in their fields.

This is information security university level training
for practitioners who already have substantial
knowledge and wish to broaden their boundaries.
It goes beyond introductory level material to
focus and delve more deeply into technical 
subjects that aren't addressed in other currently
available training.

The initial courses offered will be:

Gerardo Richarte - Core Security Technologies - Assembler
        Language Programming: Assembly for Exploits

Dave Aitel - Immunity Inc. - Your first Exploit: An
        accelerated class in Windows exploitation

Halvar - Reverse Engineering: Rapid Bug 
        Discovery and Input Crafting

Fyodor - Insecure.Org - Network Reconnaissance
        with NMAP

Renaud Deraison - Tenable Network Security - Vulnerability
        Scanning: Advanced NESSUS Usage

Marty Roesch & Brian Caswell - Sourcefire - Advanced 
        IDS deployment and Signature Creation: Learn 
        to get the most from your SNORT deployment

Laurent Oudot & Nico Fischbach - Applied network security
        and advanced anomaly detection using state-of-the-art
        honeyports and netflow/NIDS

These instructors are each considered to be the world's
top experts in their field. Many have been responsible
for the creation of some of the most famous and useful
security tools and methodologies you probably use 
frequently in your normal security tasks. All 
have given many introductory courses and are 
experienced instructors. They are knowledgeable
in what students need to advance their skills. 
Many have created course material that other
instructors still use. Each has taken that wisdom
and knowledge of training and refined it into material 
to take your understanding to the next level. Our
goal is to empower you to be the experts in
your organization so that you can help your
company be an information security powerhouse.
Let our sensei transform your skill to the next 
degree of intensity.

Our half day format is oriented towards maximum 
information transfer and learning retention.
Research into learning retention rates has proven:

Teaching Method - Knowledge Retention

See/Hear - Lecture 5%
Reading - 10%
Audio Visual / Video - 20%
Demonstration - 30%
Discussion Group - 50%
***Practice by Doing*** - 75%
Teaching Others - 90%
****Immediate application of learning in a real situation**** - 90%

Patterned after martial arts combat training, the
Security Masters Dojo will focus on real world
applications of new skills which can help you 
advance in the field of information security. You
will learn difficult to aquire skill sets from the 
world's top practitioners. A series of tests will
challenge and verify your skills in each course
area, with series of ceremonial belt colors which
are awarded after successful attainment of 
each difficulty level in the testing challenges.
The most difficult levels (black belt), are
difficult to attain. But you can rest assured
that if you study and persevere, by attaining
and overcoming the challenges, you too
will indeed become a world class expert in 
information security - with an exclusive skill
and knowledge level few have reached.

As incentives to performance, two additional 
rank awards will be presented to the two 
most exceptional students in each Dojo sitting 
at the belt award ceremony at the opening of
the CanSecWest/core05 conference. 
(highest cumulative test scores per Dojo
after normalization by class average)

Top student:    Authentic weapon grade Japanese 
                Folded Samurai Katana Sword - 
                Soft and hard powdered carbon 
                steel blend, tameshigiri grade cutting
                sword good for iaido practitioners.
                It's not just decorative, this is the 
                real thing. (We can ship it home 
                if you think you might have any 
                issues with airport security :-) 
                (~USD$1200)


Runner-up:       Linux Zaurus SL3000 PDA with
                4Gig hard drive and VGA touchscreen,
                only available in Japan, converted to 
                english menus and pre-loaded 
                with security tools and NICs. This
                too is not just decorative. (~USD$1200)

Each class is offered in two sessions per dojo 
and features one or two expert intructors teaching 
a small group (maximum of ten people are 
allowed to register per session, class max 12).
Courses have a strong hands-on laboratory component
and prepared exercises for you to perform.
Laboratory equipment for the excercises
and a gigabit peering link will be provided
by the BC Institue of Technology Internet
Engineering Laboratory. 
(http://www.bcit.ca/appliedresearch/facility/iel/)

To accomodate this, each class may have 
prerequisites for software loads and a laptop
is mandatory.  The individual class guides
will list material the students are expected
have knowledge about coming in and 
software tools that need to be pre-installed 
before attending so you get the maximum 
benefit from the focused intermediate or 
advanced level course. Please pay particular
attention to the prerequisites, as the
material listed there will not be reviewed
in the courses, and will be necessary 
to get the maximum benefit out of these
educational programs.

The small size (10) means that space is limited,
so you must book early, but you will be assured
that the low student-instructor ratio will mean
that you will each get specific attention to 
assisting your individual learning process.

Our sensei masters have said "Hai!" to the 
challenge of improving your skills. I hope you 
choose to say so too and rise to the challenge 
of increasing your information security 
knowledge.
