Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0009

Package name:      kernel, mysql
Summary:           Multiple security holes fixed
Date:              2005-03-21
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel:
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  mysql:
  MySQL is a true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL (Structured Query
  Language) database server. MySQL is a client/server implementation
  that consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many different client
  programs/libraries.

Problem description:
  kernel:
  Ben Martel and Stephen Blackheath discovered a denial of service bug
  in the ppp server handling where a client could hang the server.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-0384 to this issue.


  mysql:
  Stefano Di Paola discovered three bugs in MySQL:

  MySQL 4.0.23 and earlier, and 4.1.x up to 4.1.10, allows remote
  authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to execute
  arbitrary code by using CREATE FUNCTION to access libc calls,
  as demonstrated by using strcat, on_exit, and exit.  

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-0709 to this issue.


  MySQL 4.0.23 and earlier, and 4.1.x up to 4.1.10, allows remote
  authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to bypass
  library path restrictions and execute arbitrary libraries by using
  INSERT INTO to modify the mysql.func table, which is processed by the
  udf_init function.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-0710 to this issue.


  MySQL 4.0.23 and earlier, and 4.1.x up to 4.1.10, uses predictable file
  names when creating temporary tables, which allows local users with
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE privileges to overwrite arbitrary files via a
  symlink attack.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-0711 to this issue.
