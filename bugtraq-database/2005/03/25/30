Synopsis
========

IPsec-Tools' racoon is affected by a remote Denial of Service
vulnerability.

Background
==========

IPsec-Tools is a port of KAME's implementation of the IPsec utilities.
It contains a collection of network monitoring tools, including racoon,
ping, and ping6.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-firewall/ipsec-tools      < 0.5-r1                 *>= 0.4-r1
                                                             >= 0.5-r1

Description
===========

Sebastian Krahmer has reported a potential remote Denial of Service
vulnerability in the ISAKMP header parsing code of racoon.

Impact
======

An attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service of racoon using a
specially crafted ISAKMP packet.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All IPsec-Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-firewall/ipsec-tools-0.4-r1"
