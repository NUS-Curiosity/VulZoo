Subject: Re: Secure Science issues preview of their upcoming block cipher


Wouldn't a proof that AES-128 were reducible to CS2-128, so that any 
successful attack on CS2-128 would also constitute a successful attack on 
AES-128, provide exactly the situation that he describes?  CS2-128 would be 
"provably as secure as" AES-128.
