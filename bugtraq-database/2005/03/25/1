Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core

CVE Names:         N/A
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated sharutils packages that fix several security issues are now
available.

The sharutils package contains a set of tools for encoding and decoding
packages of files in binary or text format.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Ulf Harnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in shar.c, where the length
of data returned by the wc command is not checked. Florian Schilhabel
discovered another buffer overflow in unshar.c. Shaun Colley discovered
a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the -o command-line
option handler. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary code as the user running one of the sharutils
programs.

All users of sharutils should upgrade to these packages, which resolve
these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

     rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

     sha1sum <filename>
