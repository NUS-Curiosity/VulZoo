Subject: Firefox Software Update

It appears that there is a problem with the Firefox Software Update, at 
least in Firefox 1.0 on Windows and Mac OS X.

In Preferences -> Advanced -> Software Update there are checkboxes to 
Periodically check for updates to Firefox and My Extensions. It doesn't 
appear that this feature works at all. I've not been notified via this 
method that Firefox 1.0.1 has been released, even manually hitting the 
Check Now button (that takes a minute or so to do it's thing over a 
cable internet connection) happily reports back to me that there are no 
available updates.

Now, there are a couple of bugs, listed as critical in bugzilla, that 
confirm that I'm not alone with these problems, however they don't 
appear to be assigned to anyone at this stage. I believe that this 
issue deserves more attention than it's currently getting as security 
is one of the stated design goals of the project and with no working 
auto-update feature we're potentially being put in a worse position 
than with other vendor's alternatives that at least have monthly 
updates.
