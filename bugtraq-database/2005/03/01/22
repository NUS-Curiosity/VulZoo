 Vulnerable: PBLang 4.63 (and earlier?)  
  
  
 ---  
  
 General information:  
  
 PBLang is an international BBS-software based on 
PHP. It does not require any database but bases on a 
flatfile system. Many professional features. More 
info on the project website.  
  
  
 ---  
  
 Description:  
  
 This is bad. sendpm.php contains a flaw that allows 
a registered (and logged in) user to view other users 
password hashes, as well as their PM's and other 
files on the forum (and outside of the forum 
directory even). An attacker can compromise the 
target system without any trouble using this.  
  
  
 ---  
  
 Proof Of Concept:  
  
 http://localhost/pblang/sendpm.php?to=[username]&subj=[doesnt 
matter]&num=1&orig=/home/public_html/pblang/db/members/[username]  
 will load [username]'s entire account information 
including the MD5'ed password hash and maybe hidden 
email information. It will be shown in webpages 
source code, not in the page itself, so right click 
and view page source.  
  
 Including /etc/passwd is possible aswell, as is any 
file on the server.

 Fix and Vendor status:  
  
 Vendor has been notified, expect official patch 
soon.
