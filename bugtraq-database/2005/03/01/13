Subject: Re: Firefox Software Update


I can confirm that this problem also exists in Firefox 1.0.1 on Linux,
where there simply is no preference UI at all for Software Update, and
no apparent way to check for updates. In addition, I found by
right-clicking an extension, an Update option appears in the menu, but
it does nothing.
