Even if he did, it would be just as incorrect as the original
Subject.

Most likely it was some weird way of contacting them in the
first place: posting the message to BTS resulted in an updated
extension version being published within some 5 hours, security
announce on the website ("Severity: high") and a reminder on
contact address (typo3-project-security>lists.netfielders.de).

PS: when choosing "the next CMS", one of our considerations was
virtually empty bugtraq coverage (with the code being public
since 2000 and used on quite a few sites).  Go figure :-)
