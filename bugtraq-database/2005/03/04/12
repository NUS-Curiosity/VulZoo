Hi.

>Two week ago I found a SQL Inejetion vulnerabilitie in Typo3 (in 
the links-section/module/whatever you call it).

This is the first important information - this is NOT a vulnerability 
in TYPO3 itself, but in an extension.

>I didn't really try to develope an exploit because I thought typo3 
would directly react. 
>But unfortunately that didn't happen :/

Who did you contact? When? How? At least the security team was 
rather surprised about this. Could you explain this?

Finally: This has been analyzed by now, work is being done to fix 
this.

Karsten
