Proving it just as secure as another cipher is very different from
proving its security in any kind of absolute sense.

If I wanted to prove two ciphers to be of equivalent security ("just as
secure as"), I would try to find a way to use a break of either to
break the other (with sufficiently trivial transformation cost, of
course).  If I show that any break of CS2-128 can be trivially used to
break AES-128, then I have shown that CS2-128 is at least as secure
than AES-128; if I do the same in the other direction too, I have shown
that it is just as secure.

That is how to probe its security in absolute terms; it cannot prove
anything in the mathematical sense that is apparently being used here.
(Well, okay, it _can_ prove that a cipher is *in*secure.)  "Provably
just as secure as" has little to nothing to do with the kind of
demonstration of security derived from withstanding skilled attacks.
