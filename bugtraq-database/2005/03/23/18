In the EU, reverse engineering is explicitely allowed if it is done to
ensure interoperability. (Is an exploit an interoperable program? :-))

Oracle prohibits their users from publishing performance benchmarks.
(Not from doing benchmarks, mind you, just from publishing the results)

It is generally believed (at least here in Europe) that quite a lot of
the clauses in a typical licence are against the law and couldn't be
upheld before court. Companies probably hope that their customers will
comply anyway, either because they don't know their rights or because
they cannot afford a lengthy law suit (even if they have good chances of
winning).
