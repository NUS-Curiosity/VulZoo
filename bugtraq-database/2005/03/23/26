Working in computer forensics as I do, I can tell you that nobody today has the capability to delegate the authority you refer to, except microchip manufacturers. They are mostly silent on the subject, because they have other non-general-purpose computing products, and anyone can pay them to have custom products built.

It is the intellectual property decision that box owners make today that results in the absence of the owner's ability to delegate control because the owner does not have a proper means of control.

The opportunity to receive a means of control is being missed at the product/intellectual property selection step.

This is changing...
