  	It's not just government workers.  It's any human being who's been 
raised to be social.

  	According to Judeo-Christian theology, humanity gained knowledge 
of Good & Evil in the Garden of Eden.  Unfortunately, the ability to 
differentiate between the two was not part of the package deal.  This, 
coupled with the demands of a "polite society," is why social engineering 
can strike anyone, anywhere...regardless of their vocation in the public 
or private sector.

  	It is considered socially unacceptable to be unhelpful to others, 
even strangers over the phone.  Hell, some people can't even tell 
telemarketers to buzz off so they have to buy an electronic device to do 
it for them.

  	This is why social engineering works so well...and why folks like 
ourselves are considered "paranoid" and "anti-social" when we start 
pulling IDs and taking names.
