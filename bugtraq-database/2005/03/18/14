A friend of mine told me a story of how he'd sell something back to the 
telemarketer first before hearing about their offer.  So I tried it myself 
a couple times, and the response is amazing.  One person had such a 
gargantuan laugh, another just hung up.  Meeting them at their own level?  

The do not call list was coming into effect at that time, and 
telemarketers didn't take "no" for an answer.  But no one ever trains them 
to deal with "ok I'll hear you out, but first, are you interesting in 
buying product X from me?".
