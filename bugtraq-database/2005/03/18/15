Subject: Truth, Justice and the Ordinary Person

It.s been an interesting few weeks, what with cease and desist letters, 
Court Cases, Hijackings of website email, the list goes on.

Somewhere in all this, the truth seems to be something that is forgotten 
about. Now it appears to be who can swing the majority of the voters their 
way, who can convince the general public that they are being hard done by 
or trying to show that, what the person is doing is OK, because this 
person has credibility. 

Where is this basic concept of truth? 
Doesn't it count any more?
