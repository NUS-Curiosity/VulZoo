Except, of course, that the book of Genesis is really a tome of myths 
and the so-called "Garden of Eden" doesn't really have an effect on 
polite society.

What you're referring to are social norms of politeness that affect 
society, and they are passed down via social means.  Though they have an 
impact on people's rejection of those who are out to harm them, they 
don't explain all of the occurances. 

There's a BIG difference, for instance, between being helpful and giving 
someone the keys to your house so that they can rob you.

ID'ing people and giving out your password or sensitive information are 
NOT analogous events.

The helpfulness argument has some traction on information that is not 
obviously compromising to the person providing it.  However, even in 
that case it has a LOT more to do with the confusion factor than 
anything else.

The average person is easily confused about technology and, as such, 
their perspective will always be that if a tech calls them up and says 
there's a problem or some information they need, they're going to 
provide that information because they simply don't know any better.  As 
far as they know, there's a problem that needs to be solved and that's 
what needs to happen to fix it.

It has more to do with trust and a lack of education/understanding than 
it ever will with polite society being based on a mythical story about 
the inability of mankind to differentiate between good and evil.

There's something to what you're saying, but it just is not the whole 
story.  In order to get the compromising information, the social 
engineer has to pass from A -> B -> C.  Politeness gets them to B.  A 
lack of information and understanding on the part of the end user is 
what gets the social engineer to C.
