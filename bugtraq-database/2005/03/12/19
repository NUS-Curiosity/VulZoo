In Local file header if you modify "general purpose bit flag" 7th & 8'th byte of a zip archive with \x2f ie: "\" F-port, Kaspersky, Mcafee, Norman, Sybari, Symantec seem to skip the file marking it as clean!!! This was discovered during the analysis of "Multiple AV Vendor Incorrect CRC32 Bypass Vulnerability."
Quick/rough conclusion were drawn using www.virustotal.com

Well, tested with F-prot, DrWeb, *Symantec 8.0 long ago... lately verified it using virustotal.com If you have a long archive coment... in a zip archive these AV can't detect virus embedded in it. I came to know Symantec 8.1 is immune to the bug?
