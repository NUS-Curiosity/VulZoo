Synopsis
========

libexif fails to validate certain inputs, making it vulnerable to
buffer overflows.

Background
==========

libexif is a library for parsing, editing and saving EXIF data.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libexif      < 0.5.12-r1                  >= 0.5.12-r1

Description
===========

libexif contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the EXIF tag
validation code. When opening an image with a specially crafted EXIF
tag, the lack of validation can cause applications linked to libexif to
crash.

Impact
======

A specially crafted EXIF file could crash applications making use of
libexif, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libexif users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libexif-0.5.12-r1"
