Subject: EEYE: Computer Associates License Manager Remote Vulnerabilities


Computer Associates License Manager Remote Vulnerabilities

Release Date:
03/02/2005

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Vendor:
Computer Associates

Software Affected:
The vulnerability exists if the CA License package version on the system
is between v1.53 and v1.61.8.
This package is included in almost all Computer Associates products.

Affected Platforms:
AIX 
DEC 
HP-UX 
Linux Intel 
Linux s/390 
Solaris 
Windows 
Apple Mac

Overview:
The Computer Associates License Management software is installed by
default with almost all of Computer Associates products. The Licensing
software allows for the remote management and tracking of software
licenses.  eEye Digital Security has discovered multiple stack-based
vulnerabilities within the licensing component that processes incoming
network requests. The licensing protocol is text-based, and all of the
vulnerabilities arise due to incorrect handling of the incoming text
strings. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities will allow a
remote attacker to reliably execute code within the SYSTEM context.

Technical Description:
The vulnerabilities exist within the "LIC98RMT.EXE" component. This
executable listens on TCP ports 10203 and 10204. 
The license manager accepts the following remote commands:

LOG1 *
GETOLF 
GETCONFIG *
PUTOLF *
GCR *
GBR *
OLFCONFIRM *
GETSTATE
GETBACKUP *
GETLOG *
NEWOLF *
GETLOGD
GETSERVER *
exit

Each of the commands marked with an asterisk contain insecure calls,
which can lead to exploitable conditions. These insecure calls include
tokenizing functions where the functions run out of bounds of the static
buffer, sscanf calls with no width specifiers, inline string copies, and
multiple uses of sprintf with no bounds checking performed.  For the
license manager to successfully process the data within a request, all
that is required after a command is the terminating ASCII string "<EOM>"
(minus the quotes).  Each command takes a variety of parameters, and
most commands issue calls to insecure functions that can trigger
exploitable conditions.  The simplest vulnerability to trigger, and the
most prevalent, lies within the routine that logs status and error
messages to the license communications log file. This logging routine
contains numerous insecure function calls, particularly a call to
vsprintf where user-defined data is copied into a fixed stack buffer.
The vulnerable logging function can be triggered in a multitude of ways;
the easiest is to simply issue an invalid request:

x [user buffer] <EOM>

The above request will trigger one of the many by-the-book stack based
buffer overflows that are riddled throughout this software.
