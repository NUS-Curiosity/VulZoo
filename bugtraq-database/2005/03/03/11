Subject: Microsoft Antispyware Beta window docking issue


If you place your taskbar to the righthand side of the screen (I'm
assuming it'll do this for all positions other than the default
bottomhugging one):

- Popup messages about hosts file changes and other such notifications
float up and up and up and are damned hard to read or click. I'm
assuming this is a bug in their window docking code.

How is this a security issue? A user cannot confirm or deny the action
taken by the software and has to hope the default action doesn't
interfere with system operations.

Another bug, not specifically security related, but which I found in
Antispyware nonetheless is that it has a habit of doing scheduled
scans twice. By this I mean that if I cancel the scheduled scan
(because I know the system to be clean and can use the resources
better at the moment), the software will happily popup again 10
seconds later, and start scanning again.

If anyone knows of an official Microsoft channel where these bugs can
be reported... I'm yet to find one in the software itself.

- Jeroen.
