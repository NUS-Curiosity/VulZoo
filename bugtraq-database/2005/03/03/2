NOTICE:

Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

INITIAL RELEASE:
01 March 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
    authorized user may gain access to privileged files

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
    A potential security vulnerability has been identified with
    HP OpenVMS VAX version 7.x and 6.x and OpenVMS Alpha
    Version 7.x or 6.x that may allow a local authorized user
    to gain  unauthorized privileged access to data and system
    resources.

REFERENCES:
None

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
    HP OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-2,   HP OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-1,
    HP OpenVMS Alpha V6.2-x, HP OpenVMS VAX V7.3,
    HP OpenVMS VAX V6.2-x

     NOTE:  For all other OpenVMS Version 7.x or 6.x, Alpha or VAX
            installations, upgrade to a minimum of a supported HP
            OpenVMS VAX or Alpha version and then apply the
            patches included within this bulletin.

BACKGROUND:

    The kits may be downloaded from the ITRC by going to
    http://www2.itrc.hp.com/service/cki/enterService.do
    enter the patch id and then search, download the MUP
    (mandatory update patch) by following the ITRC instructions.

    It should be much faster searching without including the file
    extensions in the search window.


RESOLUTION:
    To protect against this potential security vulnerability, HP
    is providing a MUP for OpenVMS customers.

    NOTE:
           OpenVMS V8.2 and OpenVMS VAX Version 5.* customers are
           not affected by this potential security vulnerability.
