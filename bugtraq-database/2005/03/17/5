Synopsis
========

Grip contains a buffer overflow that can be triggered by a large CDDB
response, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Grip is a GTK+ based audio CD player/ripper.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/grip       < 3.3.0                           >= 3.3.0

Description
===========

Joseph VanAndel has discovered a buffer overflow in Grip when
processing large CDDB results.

Impact
======

A malicious CDDB server could cause Grip to crash by returning more
then 16 matches, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

Disable automatic CDDB queries, but we highly encourage users to
upgrade to 3.3.0.

Resolution
==========

All Grip users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/grip-3.3.0"
