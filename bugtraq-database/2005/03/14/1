A minor correction - if Apple goes after them for the use of 'iFoo',
that would be a trademark issue (governed by Title 35 of the US Code), rather than
a copyright issue (governed by Title 17).  The paperwork for trademarks
is handed by the Patent and Trademark Office, the paperwork for registering
copyrights is done with the Register of Copyrights over at the Library of Congress.
