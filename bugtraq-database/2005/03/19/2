Synopsis
========

KDE is vulnerable to a local Denial of Service attack.

Background
==========

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. DCOP is KDE's simple IPC/RPC mechanism.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdelibs     < 3.3.2-r7                       >= 3.3.2-r7
                                                          *>= 3.2.3-r8

Description
===========

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that it is possible to stall the
dcopserver of other users.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this to cause a local Denial of Service by
stalling the dcopserver in the authentication process. As a result all
desktop functionality relying on DCOP will cease to function.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdelibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose kde-base/kdelibs
