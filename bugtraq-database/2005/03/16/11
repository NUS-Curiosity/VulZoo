Synopsis
========

MySQL contains several vulnerabilities potentially leading to the
overwriting of local files or to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

MySQL is a fast, multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/mysql      < 4.0.24                              >= 4.0.24

Description
===========

MySQL fails to properly validate input for authenticated users with
INSERT and DELETE privileges (CAN-2005-0709 and CAN-2005-0710).
Furthermore MySQL uses predictable filenames when creating temporary
files with CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE (CAN-2005-0711).

Impact
======

At attacker with INSERT and DELETE privileges could exploit this to
manipulate the mysql table or accessing libc calls, potentially leading
to the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running MySQL. An attacker with CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE privileges could
exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-4.0.24"
