Synopsis
========

A format string vulnerability in the Hashcash utility could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Hashcash is a utility for generating Hashcash tokens, a proof-of-work
system to reduce the impact of spam.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/hashcash      < 1.16-r1                       >= 1.16-r1

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team identified a flaw
in the Hashcash utility that an attacker could expose by specifying a
malformed reply address.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would permit an attacker to disrupt Hashcash
users, and potentially execute arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Hashcash users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/hashcash-1.16-r1"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
