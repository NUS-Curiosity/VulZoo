Subject: thoughts and a possible solution on homograph attacks


Hi security community,

this is my first publication I post on Bugtraq, so please be patient with me.

Since the recent problems with IDN, I wanted to clear up my thoughts on 
homograph attacks, so I sorted everything in an article which also contains 
what I believe to be an easy and general solution.

You can find it here:

Unfortunately, my free time is currently limited, so I may not be able to 
participate too much in any discussions on the subject. My appologies for 
that. But I will definitely read any feedback I receive.
