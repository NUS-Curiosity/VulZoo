Subject: Lingo VoIP ATA / UTStarcom iAN-02EX remote access vulnerability


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

after unsuccessfully attempting to find contact information of anyone who 
can address or correct this, here's a public disclosure.

Vulnerability Name
   Lingo VoIP ATA / UTStarcom iAN-02EX remote access vulnerability

Overview
   the UTStarcom iAN-02EX is a VoIP ATA currently being used by Lingo (and 
other VoIP providers?). this advisory is specific to the configuration of 
the iAN-02EX device as currently shipped by Lingo, and may or may not 
apply to other configurations of the device. the default configuration 
leaves the ATA vulnerable to unauthorized remote access.

Description
   using the default password, a remote attacker may access the device via 
the WAN port. this problem is compounded by Lingo's recommendation that 
the device should be placed between a broadband modem and router 
("recommended method"). this configuration makes the ATA's WAN port 
accessible from the public internet.

Impact
   an attacker may cause a denial of service for voice and/or data traffic. 
an attacker may gain access to a customers speed-dial list and modify that 
list (this may be particularly dangerous if the attacker is a scorned 
ex-lover or overzealous admirer). an attacker may gain gain access to 
other areas of the LAN behind the ATA (by specifying it as a DMZ or port 
forwarding). an attacker may change the default password (the ATA doesn't 
appear to have a customer accessible hardware reset, which could compound 
a password problem). an attacker may cause other havoc for the VoIP 
customer.

Solution
   this vulnerability can be mitigated by not allowing login access via 
WAN. at the very least this feature should be disabled by default. ideally 
access via the WAN port should require that the default password is 
changed.
