Synopsis
========

The dcopidlng script is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially
allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. DCOP is KDE's simple IPC/RPC mechanism.
dcopidlng is a DCOP helper script.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdelibs     < 3.3.2-r5                       >= 3.3.2-r5
                                                          *>= 3.2.3-r7

Description
===========

Davide Madrisan has discovered that the dcopidlng script creates
temporary files in a world-writable directory with predictable names.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
dcopidlng is executed, this would result in the file being overwritten
with the rights of the user running the utility, which could be the
root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdelibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose kde-base/kdelibs
