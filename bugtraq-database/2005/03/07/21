Subject: vBulletin Worm - perl.Santy variant




Greetings,

It seems there is a variant of perl.Santy going around that has been altered to exploit all versions of vBulletin below 3.0.6. Jelsoft has released 3.0.7 last week. So it is best to upgrade your forums or use the supplied patch available on www.vbulletin.com/forum/
