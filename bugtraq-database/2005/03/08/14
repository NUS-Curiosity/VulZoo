You are far too fast to dismiss the usability criticism. People _WON'T_ 
participate in a system requiring them to retype the domain name to 
establish an SSL connection. Additionally, it would fail in the case 
where a user's locale was (for example) Greek while the site they were 
connecting to was American. They would type what they perceived to be the 
domain - and it wouldn't work. A "reverse homograph" failure.

It is a technically nice but completely unusable solution.
