=========================

(responding to self)

the ATA can be reset by dialing *#26845# from a connected phone. this 
presents another problem. an attacker can reset the password (and then 
gain unauthorized access to the ATA) by gaining access to any phone 
connected to the ATA. this can be easily accomplished at a party or by 
wireless beige-boxing which could be done from some distance away.

of course this type of reset seems to wipe out most info that would be 
useful to an attacker (LAN config, speed-dial list, etc) but still 
facilitates DoS and other types of attack.

solution: a pinhole button in the back of the ATA would require physical 
access to the device in order to reset the password.
