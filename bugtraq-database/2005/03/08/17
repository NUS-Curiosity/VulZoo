Here is a copy of our first reply with the solution :

- create a new administrator account
- in Administration / Properties, uncheck Options / Allow all access to localhost.

Do not forget to adjust the "local machine" properties to use the new administration account.

-

The installer will be updated to ask for an administrator account in the next version.

Until then, if needed, the administrators can apply the solution above if running in a multi-users environment.
