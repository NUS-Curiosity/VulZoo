	You have come to the same idea as I did :-) (hope my post to
Bugtraq will pass the moderation), just with a different flavor.  That's a
good sign for me, and this kind of solution seems to be not-so-hard to
implement.

	A small addition: not "language", but "languages".  And, may be
even more -- "character set".  For example, russian-speaking users
currently use only latin letters, as all the world do.  And if IDN
somewhen becomes common, they would have to use a mixture of latin and
cyrillic letters.

	(I hope IBM wold be clever enough to grab the "IBM.com" domains,
where "B" is "cyrillic capital VE" and/or "M" is "cyrillic capital M". :-)

	Unfortunately, most users in case of such warnings blindly press
[Ok] not even trying to read what they are warned about.  And if there is
a "[x] Don't show this again..." option, they will immediately swith it
on.  So, such switchable-off protection would in fact become illusory...
