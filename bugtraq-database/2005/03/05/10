The error isn't in usercp_register.php, it is perfectly fine that the user can set these options. The Problem is the HTML filtering in privmsg.php and viewtopic.php.

In privmsg.php you'll find these lines:
if ( !$board_config['allow_html'] )
{
   if ( $user_sig != '' && $privmsg['privmsgs_enable_sig'] && $userdata['user_allowhtml'] )
   { 

If you look closely at the DB you'll see there is no field privmsgs_enable_sig in phpbb_privmsgs, the field is named privmsgs_attach_sig, also the $userdata['user_allowhtml'] really shouldn't be there. So change the code to:

if ( !$board_config['allow_html'] )
{
   if ( $user_sig != '' && $privmsg['privmsgs_attach_sig'] )
   {

and HTML filtering will work for the signature. The same goes for the viewtopic.php, find the code:
if ( !$board_config['allow_html'] )
{
   if ( $user_sig != '' && $userdata['user_allowhtml'] )
   { 

and remove the $userdata['user_allowhtml'] so that it looks like this:
if ( !$board_config['allow_html'] )
{
   if ( $user_sig != '' )
   {

and HTML filtering of the signature in posts will always work when HTML is forbidden on the board.
