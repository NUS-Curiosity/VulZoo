Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in DBMS_METADATA package

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory
http://www.appsecinc.com/resources/alerts/oracle/2005-03.html
April 18, 2005

Affected Versions: Oracle Database Server versions 9i and 10g

Risk Level: High

Credits: This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban
Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.

Details:
The OBJECT_TYPE parameter -- used in various procedures of the
DBMS_METADATA package -- is vulnerable to SQL injection. Although this
package executes with the privileges of the calling user, it internally
uses another package that executes the injected SQL with the privileges
of the SYS user thereby allowing an attacker to gain DBA privileges. By
default PUBLIC has EXECUTE privilege on DBMS_METADATA.

Impact:
Any low privileged database user can execute functions with DBA
privileges. Users with privilges to create or modify a function can
inject a user-defined function in the vulnerable procedure and thus
execute SQL statements with DBA privileges.

Workaround:
Revoke Execute privilege on the vulnerable package.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2005 available at
http://metalink.oracle.com
