Denial of Service in Oracle interMedia

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory
http://www.appsecinc.com/resources/alerts/oracle/2005-01.html
April 18, 2005

Affected versions: Oracle Database Server versions 9i and 10g

Risk level: Medium

Credits: This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban
Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.

Details:
Within the Oracle interMedia system, two types (ORDImage and ORDDoc)
have a vulnerability that can cause a Denial of Service condition. When
trying to load a specially constructed file, or when setting specially
constructed data to object's property, a Denial of service can be
triggered making Oracle server process consume 100% CPU usage. The
service needs to be restarted to resume normal operation.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely by supplying a specially
constructed file to an application that uses the vulnerable objects to
process the file in the database server.

Impact:
By default PUBLIC has execute permission on these objects so any Oracle
database user can exploit this vulnerability. Exploitation of this
vulnerability will allow an attacker to cause a DOS (Denial of service).

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2005 available at
http://metalink.oracle.com
