Subject: Sanboxed browsing and authentication credentials


Hi there,

i just have to take a look on possible solutions to provide a good
"Sandboxed browsing" solution to beeing able to authenticate various
hotel dsl lines and hotspots. After successful authentication the VPN
client will take over from here.

So i got two questions for you all:
1. What Tools are available to realize such sandboxed browsing? (I
know Cisco Secure Agent ak Okena Stormwatch)
2. What type of credentials are beeing authenticated on wireless
hotspots all over the world? (I'm aware of the mac address, nothing
more). I dont mean what authentication method used, i want to analyze
what is this authenticated bound to. (Example, mac address, hash over
file xyz, Hostname, IP ....)

I thank you for your time to write the feedback.

Greetings

max
