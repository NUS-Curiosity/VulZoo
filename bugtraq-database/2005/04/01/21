Subject: Re: [HV-HIGH] Microsoft Jet DB engine vulnerabilities


How is this a high-level vulnerability when a user must launch the file, 
simply resulting in possible code execution within that user's interactive 
credentials?  If you're going to get them to launch a file, why not code up 
a nice juicy .exe for them and not bother with the other stuff?

Or even better, since it's an MDB file, code it up in an Access module- that 
way it won't even throw an exception.

A bug, yes- a security vulnerability, no.
