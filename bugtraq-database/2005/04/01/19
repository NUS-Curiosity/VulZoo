Solution:

At the moment of writing this advisory, no patch is released, we can 
only suggest to :

1- Restrict all incoming connections to 20031/tcp and 20031/udp, a fix 
might come very soon.
2- set STRICTS ACL rules, for example, allow ONLY SYSTEM to write in 
configure.cfg. This will protect against Local attack.
