Synopsis
========

The telnet-bsd telnet client is vulnerable to two buffer overflows,
which could allow a malicious telnet server operator to execute
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

telnet-bsd provides a command line telnet client which is used for
remote login using the telnet protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/telnet-bsd      < 1.0-r1                       >= 1.0-r1

Description
===========

A buffer overflow has been identified in the env_opt_add() function of
telnet-bsd, where a response requiring excessive escaping can cause a
heap-based buffer overflow. Another issue has been identified in the
slc_add_reply() function, where a large number of SLC commands can
overflow a fixed size buffer.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require a vulnerable user to connect to
an attacker-controlled host using telnet, potentially executing
arbitrary code with the permissions of the telnet user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All telnet-bsd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/telnet-bsd-1.0-r1"
