If you read the changelog you would have noticed this was fixed over a month ago.

Laziness is no excuse for not reporting vulnerabilities to a vendor first. If you can sign up to bugtraq to report an old, already fixed hole, then creating a bugzilla login surely can't be too much trouble.
You can simply email security@...nel.net with information as well. 
As a vendor we take legitimate security concerns very seriously and usually have a fix released within a few hours of notification, it's a shame some people don't try to take advantage of this effort.
