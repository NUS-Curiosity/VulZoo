Subject: Multiple medium risk flaws fixed in new version of PHP (late advisory)


David Litchfield of NGSSoftware has discovered multiple medium risk 
vulnerabilities in PHP. Versions affected include

PHP 5.0.3
PHP 4.3.10

PHP has released updated versions of the software available here:

http://www.php.net/downloads.php


Whilst PHP is opensource, NGSSoftware will abide by our policy and not 
release details of these flaws for three months. Full details will be 
published on the Tuesday, 12th of July 2005. This three month window will 
allow PHP users the time needed to test and apply the patch set before the 
details are released to the general public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new 
approach to responsible disclosure.

Typhon III, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment scanner, has 
been updated to check for and positively identify these flaws. More 
information about Typhon can be found here:
