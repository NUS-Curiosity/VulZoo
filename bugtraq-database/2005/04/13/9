Info

Program: DoKuWiki
Version: 2005-02-18
Module:  media.php
Bug type: File Upload bug
Vendor site: http://wiki.splitbrain.org/
Vendor Informed: Yes
===================
Bug Info

Remote user with file-upload privileges can upload anyone file with any
extention/content, like a <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?> in php-script

If uploaded file cases allowed extention, like a cmd.gif.php, system
allows to upload it
I'd tested it on php-4.3.7.
