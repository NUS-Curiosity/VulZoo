Synopsis
========

rsnapshot allow a local user to take ownership of local files,
resulting in privilege escalation.

Background
==========

rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync, allowing
local and remote systems backups.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/rsnapshot       < 1.2.1                         >= 1.2.1

Description
===========

The copy_symlink() subroutine in rsnapshot follows symlinks when
changing file ownership, instead of changing the ownership of the
symlink itself.

Impact
======

Under certain circumstances, local attackers can exploit this
vulnerability to take ownership of arbitrary files, resulting in local
privilege escalation.

Workaround
==========

The copy_symlink() subroutine is not called if the cmd_cp parameter has
been enabled.

Resolution
==========

All rsnapshot users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rsnapshot-1.2.1"
