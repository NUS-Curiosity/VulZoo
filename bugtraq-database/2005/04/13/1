Subject: Centra 7 XSS Exploit




Centra is a program used by businesses and colleges, it allows users to stream microsoft office and other applications over the web in a nice enviroment with voip options.  However on root directory when you go in to enroll for a session if you create or modify your username, first name, or last name to contain any html code it will be ran.  For instance:

&lt;script&gt;alert("hi");&lt;/script&gt; will result in a popup box that says hi

You can put iframes in the portal to keep people from being able to access the application.  

FIX: Use the cleartext function to strip fields that users have input to.
