Synopsis
========

JunkBuster is vulnerable to a heap corruption vulnerability, and under
certain configurations may allow an attacker to modify settings.

Background
==========

JunkBuster is a filtering HTTP proxy, designed to enhance privacy and
remove unwanted content.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-proxy/junkbuster     < 2.0.2-r3                   >= 2.0.2-r3

Description
===========

James Ranson reported a vulnerability when JunkBuster is configured to
run in single-threaded mode, an attacker can modify the referrer
setting by getting a victim to request a specially crafted URL. Tavis
Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team identified a heap
corruption issue in the filtering of URLs.

Impact
======

If JunkBuster has been configured to run in single-threaded mode, an
attacker can disable or modify the filtering of Referrer: HTTP headers,
potentially compromising the privacy of users. The heap corruption
vulnerability could crash or disrupt the operation of the proxy,
potentially executing arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All JunkBuster users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-proxy/junkbuster-2.0.2-r3"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
