vulnerabilities in Oracle's Database Server. Versions affected include

Oracle Database 10g Release 1 Version 10.1.0.2, 10.1.0.3, 10.1.0.3.1 and 
10.1.0.4

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about these flaws for three 
months. Full details will be published on the Tuesday, 12th of July 2005. 
This three month window will allow Oracle database administrators the time 
needed to test and apply the patch set before the details are released to 
the general public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible 
disclosure.

NGSSQuirreL for Oracle, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment 
scanner and security manager for Oracle, has been updated to check for and 
positively identify these flaws in Oracle database servers on the network.
