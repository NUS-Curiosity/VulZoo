How to write remote exploits ( V. 1.1) 

1. Introduction

Hi welcome to my first english tutorial, and my first tutorial about
exploit coding, on the next pages, I want to show you the basics of
remote exploits writing. In order to understand the following, I hope
that you know "socket programming in C", also ANSI C, and I hope you
know how local exploits work. If you haven't got any idea of these
things I want to suggest you to first read other papers or books
likeâ€¦:

o The C Programming language (Kernighan/Ritchie)
o Unix Network Programming (Richard Stevens)
