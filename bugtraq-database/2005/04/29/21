Subject: Re: Safari HTTPS Overflow


Gilbert â€“
	This appears to be an issue where Safari is calling  
CFSocketEnableCallBacks on a null CFSocketRef.  Not an overflow.  An  
overflow would require a buffer, somewhere, to have overflowed.  This  
is not happening at all.  Just because a program crashes when you send  
it a relatively long string does not define it as an overflow.  Look at  
the crash report:

Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)
Codes:      KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE (0x0002) at 0x0000000c

	Also, did you notify Apple  
(https://bugreport.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/RadarWeb.woa) of this  
bug, or did you just figure they'd hear about it through the grapevine?
