Don't bother...

They NEVER EVER responded to me on multiple security issues that I tryed 
to report.

For example note my comment at the bottom of this advisory:
http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/attachments/20030403/c2098729/SRT2003-04-03-1300.txt

I eventually gave up on both issues I found and published them.
