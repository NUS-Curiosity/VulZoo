Mod security alleviates most of this

SecFilterSelective THE_REQUEST "\&cmd" "redirect:http://www.gaytardedhax0rs.net"

As do normal apache settings

<Location /admin/>
#
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from YOUR_ADDRESS_GOES_HERE
    Deny from all
    ErrorDocument 403 http://www.gaytardedhax0rs.net
</Location>

Problem with an htaccess file is creating the users, then making sure no
kiddiot is using some password dumping script or program. IP based would
work better since I can't think of some silly scriptkiddiot injecting info
on the network level to pwn some site using any one of these injection
based tools.
