Subject: Re: Re: Borland Security Contact



Please contact the Firebird developers by submitting the bug at the
URL below. InterBase is a discontinued product and is (AFAIK) no
longer officially maintained by Borland. The source code was released
on 25th July 2000 under a custom "InterBase Public License v.1.0"

The Firebird project on Sourceforge picked up where Borland left.
Standard business method: No money, no business, no bugfix.
