Subject: Zone-H 2004 statistics are ready to be downloaded




 The graphical statistics for the year 2004 are finally ready! They also contains excerpts of the year 2002 amd 2003 when needed.

There are two files

a nice PDF document which can be downloaded here

while the full set of data in txt format, ready to be imported in your spreadsheet can be downloaded here:

The PDF document contains a useful disclaimer about Zone-H activity, read it please. You might be disppointed discovering that this year we made no comments on the graphs. It is simply because the graphs are self-talking.

Beside this, we always get emails like: "hey, why don't you make a graph comparing the different webservers? It might be useful!" and "hey, why did you do that graph comparing the webserver? It's useless!". To avoid this, this year we did all possible graphs, up to you which one to consider and how to interpret it.

I just want to add one comment: the tendence is to break through the application level, we started to tell it a couple of years ago, much earlier than anyone else. This is possible thanks to having the large database as we have.

Starting from the year 2005 we will be able to deliver much detailed stats regarding the intrusion methodolgy as from January 1st we adopted a more detailed set of notification options. Results are really promising, I assure you...

Enjoy the statistics but remember that this material is copyrighted and you can use it under the same license its currently serving our website. At the end of the PDF file you will find the details

NOTE: two days ago we uploaded a PDF document containing a doubled graph, where the massdefacement count by month was duplicated instead of the single defacement count by month.

Enjoy!
