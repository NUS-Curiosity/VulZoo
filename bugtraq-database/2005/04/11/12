Synopsis
========

phpMyAdmin is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL databases from a web-browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin      < 2.6.2_rc1                   >= 2.6.2_rc1

Description
===========

Oriol Torrent Santiago has discovered that phpMyAdmin fails to validate
input to the "convcharset" variable, rendering it vulnerable to
cross-site scripting attacks.

Impact
======

By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker can inject and
execute malicious script code, potentially compromising the victim's
browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.2_rc1"
