Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 04.11.05: Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup UniversalAgent Buffer Overflow


Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup UniversalAgent Buffer 
Overflow

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 04.11.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=232&type=vulnerabilities
April 11, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

BrightStor ARCserve Backup provides backup and restore protection for 
all classes of Windows, NetWare, Linux and UNIX servers, as well as 
Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, UNIX, AS/400 and VMS client environments.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Computer 
Associates International Inc's BrightStor ARCserve Backup UniversalAgent

may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The BrightStor software uses a network agent to perform backups on nodes

across the network. This agent service requires either administrative 
credentials or a node-specific password and is capable of backing up 
system settings as well as files. This agent will listen on TCP and UDP 
ports 6050 by default.

When an agent request is received on the TCP port, with the "option" 
field set to 0, 3 or 1000, and a large string preceding this "option"
field in the packet, an overflow will occur. The agent software
includes its own exception handler, preventing the service from
actually crashing. Each time an exception occurs due to this overflow,
the handler will kick in and restore the service back to an operating
state. This particular overflow will cause three exceptions, two of
which are non-exploitable, and one which can be used to hijack
execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for a remote 
unauthenticated compromise with system level access. Although 
exploitation of this vulnerability is not trivial, it has been shown 
that it can be done reliably.

IV. DETECTION

Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup v11 (Win32) has been 
confirmed vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employ firewalls, access control lists or other TCP/UDP restriction 
mechanism to limit access to systems and services.
