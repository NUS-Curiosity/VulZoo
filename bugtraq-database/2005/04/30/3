Synopsis
========

phpMyAdmin leaves the SQL install script with insecure permissions,
potentially leading to a database compromise.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL databases from a web-browser. phpMyAdmin uses a
pma MySQL user to control the linked-tables infrastructure. The SQL
install script sets the initial password for the pma user.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.6.2-r1                      >= 2.6.2-r1

Description
===========

The phpMyAdmin installation process leaves the SQL install script with
insecure permissions.

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain the initial
phpMyAdmin password and from there obtain information about databases
accessible by phpMyAdmin.

Workaround
==========

Change the password for the phpMyAdmin MySQL user (pma):

    mysql -u root -p
    SET PASSWORD FOR 'pma'@...calhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPassword');

Update your phpMyAdmin config.inc.php:

    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass']   = 'MyNewPassword';

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should change password for the pma user as
described above and upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.2-r1"
