Hi Ravish,

This only happens on older versions, it was fixed in 2.0.5. (see
[NOBYTES.COM: #2] CubeCart 2.0.4 - Multiple Vulnerabilities)
The only other thing an attacker could do is to include a .php file
somewhere else on the server.
For example, if the attacker also had his/her website on that same server
and knew the full path to it, they could use file inclusion to launch an
'evil' .php file from there home folder.

Regards

John

Hello,

http://www.victimsite.com/index.php?&language=f00bar.php

Warning: Failed opening '/var/www/html/admin/lang/f00bar.php' for inclusion
(include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/html/admin/settings.inc.php
on line 147

This is path disclosure but it can also be used for malicious file include.
