Synopsis
========

The mit-krb5 telnet client is vulnerable to two buffer overflows, which
could allow a malicious telnet server operator to execute arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

The MIT Kerberos 5 implementation provides a command line telnet client
which is used for remote login via the telnet protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/mit-krb5     < 1.3.6-r2                     >= 1.3.6-r2

Description
===========

A buffer overflow has been identified in the env_opt_add() function,
where a response requiring excessive escaping can cause a heap-based
buffer overflow. Another issue has been identified in the
slc_add_reply() function, where a large number of SLC commands can
overflow a fixed size buffer.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require a vulnerable user to connect to
an attacker-controlled telnet host, potentially executing arbitrary
code with the permissions of the telnet user on the client.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All mit-krb5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.6-r2"
