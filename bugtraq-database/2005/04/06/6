Subject: drone armies C&C report - March/2005


Below is a periodic public report from the drone armies / botnets
research and mitigation mailing list.
For this report it should be noted that we base our analysis on the data
we have accumulated from various sources.

According to our incomplete analysis of information we have thus far, we
now publish two reports.


The ISP's that are most often plagued with botnet C&C's (command &
control) are, by the order listed:
----------------------------------

Top 13 with open non-resolved suspect C&Cs
ASN     Responsible Party       Unique IPs      Open-unresolved
21840   SAGONET-TPA - Sago Networks     31-40      11-15

* We would gladly like to establish a trusted relationship with
   these and any organizations to help them in the future.

* We would especially like to note the serious and prompt response by
   PNAP, as well as the serious efforts made by The Planet.

* By previous requests here is an explanation of what "ASN" is, by Joe
   St Sauver:
   http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~joe/one-pager-asn.pdf

* Clarification: the definition of "count" is how many C&C servers are
   located at said AS. We replaced it to be called "Unique IPs" and
   "Open-unresolved" accordingly.


The Trojan horses most used in botnets:
---------------------------------------

1. Korgobot.
2. SpyBot.
3. Optix Pro.
4. rBot.
5. Other SpyBot variants and strains (AgoBot, PhatBot, actual SDbots,
    etc.).

* There seems to be an increase in Energymechs used for botnets running
   on *nix machines.
