Synopsis
========

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been found in the telnet client in
Heimdal which could lead to execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5 that includes a telnet
client program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/heimdal       < 0.6.4                          >= 0.6.4

Description
===========

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the slc_add_reply() and
env_opt_add() functions have been discovered by Gael Delalleau in the
telnet client in Heimdal.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require a vulnerable user to connect to
an attacker-controlled host using the telnet client, potentially
executing arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Heimdal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/heimdal-0.6.4"
