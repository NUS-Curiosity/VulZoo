Subject: insecure user account lam-runtime-7.0.6-2mdk rpm




Serverity: HIGH

I found a bug when lam-runtime-7.0.6-2mdk is installed it creates a new user/group with insecure permissions.

BUG:

user "mpi" is created without a password which can be used to compromise a system.
# rpm -qf /var/lib/mpi/test_mpi.lam
lam-runtime-7.0.6-2mdk

FIX:

Either lock the account, delete the directory or remove the rpm package.
