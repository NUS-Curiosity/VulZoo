MySQL MaxDB Webtool Remote Stack Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 04.25.05
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=234&type=vulnerabilit
ies
April 25, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

MaxDB by MySQL is a re-branded and enhanced version of SAP DB, SAP AG's
open source database. MaxDB is a heavy-duty, SAP-certified open source
database that offers high availability, scalability and a comprehensive
feature set. MaxDB complements the MySQL database server, targeted for
large mySAP ERP environments and other applications that require maximum
enterprise-level database functionality.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in 
MySQL MaxDB could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of HTTP 
GET queries containing a percent sign (%). When an attacker issues an 
HTTP GET request specifying a percent sign followed by a long string as 
the file parameter, a stack-based overflow occurs. Although exceptions 
within the process can be raised with smaller strings, it is necessary 
to provide a string of approximately 4,000 bytes in length to overwrite 
the process Structured Exception Handler (SEH). Using this method, is 
possible to gain control of execution flow and execute arbitrary code. 

It is also possible to simply overwrite the program's saved instruction 
pointer. However, it would be necessary to provide several valid 
pointers in the buffer along the way in order to avoid premature 
exceptions.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow remote attackers 
to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. Note that the vulnerability is 
in the web administration service, which should be configured not to 
allow connections from untrusted hosts or listen on public-facing 
network interfaces.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in MySQL 
MaxDB 7.5.00.23.

V. WORKAROUND
