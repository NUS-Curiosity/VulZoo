MySQL MaxDB Webtool Remote Lock-Token Stack Overflow Vulnerability 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 04.25.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=235&type=vulnerabilities
April 25, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

MaxDB by MySQL is a re-branded and enhanced version of SAP DB, SAP AG's 
open source database. MaxDB is a heavy-duty, SAP-certified open source 
database that offers high availability, scalability and a comprehensive 
feature set. MaxDB complements the MySQL database server, targeted for 
large mySAP ERP environments and other applications that require maximum

enterprise-level database functionality.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in 
MySQL MaxDB could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to a lack of bounds checking 
in the WebDAV functionality of the web tool. When an attacker issues an 
HTTP request with the unlock method, along with a long Lock-Token 
string, a stack-based overflow occurs. The offending code follows: 

MaxDB_ORG/sys/src/SAPDB/WebDAV/Handler/WDVHandler_CommonUtils.c:

WDVH_Bool getLockTokenHeader(sapdbwa_HttpRequestP request,
                             WDVH_Char *sLockToken,
                             WDVH_Char *errormsg) 
{
WDVH_Char       *temp1, *temp2, *temp4, *temp5;
WDVH_UInt4      length;
WDVH_Char       temp3[WDVH_MAX_IF_HEADER_LEN];

if (request==NULL || sLockToken==NULL || errormsg==NULL)
    return WDVH_False;

temp4 = (char*)sapdbwa_GetHeader(request,"Lock-Token");
if (temp4 != NULL) {
    strcpy(temp3,temp4);
[...] 

The variable temp3 is a fixed-length stack buffer. The function 
sapdbwa_GetHeader() returns the user supplied value for Lock-Token. This

user-supplied value is then copied into the fixed-size buffer using a 
strcpy() call. Due to no boundary checking, it is possible to overflow 
the stack buffer and overwrite stack memory, ultimately leading to 
control of execution flow and execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow remote attackers 
to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. Note that the vulnerability is 
in the web administration service, which should be configured to not 
allow connections from untrusted hosts or listening on public-facing 
network interfaces.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in MySQL 
MaxDB 7.5.00.23.

V. WORKAROUND

Employ firewalls, access control lists or other TCP/UDP-restriction 
mechanisms to limit access to administrative systems and services.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

This vulnerability is addressed in MySQL MaxDB 7.5.00.26 available for
