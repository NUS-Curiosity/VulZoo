Synopsis
========

Rootkit Hunter is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing a
local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

Rootkit Hunter is a scanning tool to detect rootkits, backdoors and
local exploits on a local machine. Rootkit Hunter uses downloaded data
files to check file integrity. These files are updated via the
check_update.sh script.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-forensics/rkhunter     < 1.2.3-r1                 >= 1.2.3-r1

Description
===========

Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen and Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux
Security Team have reported that the check_update.sh script and the
main rkhunter script insecurely creates several temporary files with
predictable filenames.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
rkhunter or the check_update.sh script runs, this would result in the
file being overwritten with the rights of the user running the utility,
which could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Rootkit Hunter users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-forensics/rkhunter-1.2.3-r1"
