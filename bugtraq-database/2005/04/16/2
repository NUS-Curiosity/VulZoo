Subject: Re: Http Response Splitting Vulnerability In
	PHP-NUKE 7.6 and below


Technically http response splitting occurs when a web application fails to 
reject illegal input such as the CR and LF characters.  PHP-Nuke's 
mainfile.php has had the following function in it:

function removecrlf($str) {
    return strtr($str, "\015\012", ' ');
}

So the power is there to stop it, but it isn't being used.

It should be called more frequently on user input validation.  However, a 
one stop shop would be to install mod_security with the appropriate 
filters.  It won't just protect a webapp like php-nuke or postnuke, it'll 
protect all the pages accessible via Apache.

However, $forwarder should only accept URLs, and nothing more in this 
example.  As such, there ought to be a whitelist of characters that are 
approved for input specific to URLs.

But when it comes to CRLFs, I can't see anything at the moment why they 
ought to be whitelisted.
