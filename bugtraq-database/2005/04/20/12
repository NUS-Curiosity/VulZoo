Hmmm ...

[Section VI. Vendor Response]

    "This issue affects an extremely small subset of the McAfee 
    Internet Security Suite 2005 user base as the vast majority 
    of home users do not use non-Administrator Windows accounts"

    "McAfee's key priority is the security of our customers."

If McAfee believes the correct functioning of its product depends on the
first statement being true, then the second statement doesn't seem to quite
fit.
