Subject: Linux vsyscalls may be used as attack vectors

I send (again !) this e-mail including in attachment an advisory
explaining how vsyscalls may be used as powerful attack vectors on
Linux 2.6.x kernels.

I received many mailer daemon replies for delivery failures in
multiple boxes with my last e-mail. I hope this one will be okay.
Please, confirm.

Regards,

Clad.
