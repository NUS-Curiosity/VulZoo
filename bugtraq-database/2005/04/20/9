I. INTRODUCTION
Desktop Rover is a software application for Microsoft Windows that
provides the features of a hardware KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse).

II. DETAILS
Desktop Rover version 3.0 (and possibly earlier versions) is
vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS). A remote attacker could send
a specially crafted packet to trigger an invalid memory access to
crash the application, resulting in a denial of service.

By default the Desktop Rover listens on port 61427/TCP, it also
conveniently opens up this port in the XP personal firewall.

This packet is an example packet that will cause a denial of service,
there are more variations, but this will suffice for example.

20:23:48.778009 192.168.28.133.32771 > 192.168.28.129.61427: P [tcp sum ok] 
1:13(12) ack 1 win 5840 (DF) (ttl 64, id 24051, len 64)

Validated Platforms:
 Windows 2000 Advancded Server [Build 2195, SP4, All Windows Updates]


III. MITIGATING STRATEGY
 The vendor is releasing a fix in version 3.1 soon which will address the 
 vulnerability, until then restricting access to the Desktop Rover ports will 
 reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited.
