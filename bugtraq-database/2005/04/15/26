This is not how most Unix variants work: provided you have an
open-for-write descriptor on a file, you can write to it as long as the
descriptor survives even if the file's permissions deny you write
access.

In particular, creating a file for write with a mode forbidding writing
is not at all impossible.

Now, if you're not on a Unix variant, or for all I know even some of
the more variant Unix variants, this may not be true.  But it certainly
is common for this to work fine.  Indeed, it's arguably better because
it helps prevent others from writing to the file by mistake even during
a brief time between open()ing and fchmod()ing.
