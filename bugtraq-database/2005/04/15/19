Subject: windux-linux-gui-rainbow-lanman-cracker released



Just wanted to share that we have finally released a GUI version of 
ophcrack, the original rainbow table password cracker.

Features:
- runs with GUI under Windows and linux
- dumps hashes from local and remote hashes, provided you are admin
- dumps hashes from encrypted sam and config, provided you boot on a CD 
to retrieve the files (no admin needed)
- cracks 99.9% of alphanumerical passwords of length 1 to 14
- comes with two rainbow table sets, one for less than 500MB RAM one for 
more.

Ophcrack 2 is hosted on sourceforge: ophcrack.sourceforge.net

regards,

  Philippe
