Update
======

New ways of bypassing Smarty's "Template security" were found and
fixed in Smarty. Users making use of that feature are encouraged
to upgrade to version 2.6.9.

The updated sections appear below.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/smarty       < 2.6.9                             >= 2.6.9

Description
===========

A vulnerability has been discovered within the regex_replace modifier
of the Smarty templates when allowing access to untrusted users.
Furthermore, it was possible to call functions from {if} statements and
{math} functions.

Resolution
==========

All Smarty users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/smarty-2.6.9"

Availability

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
