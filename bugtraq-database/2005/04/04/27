Subject: RE: AW: PayPal "security" measures


Hi guys,

can you let me know what steps you took to get this situation.  Did you just 
sign in and get this message right there? Did you click on any tabs?  I 
tried to recreate the situation you guys were seeing, but have been unable 
to do so.

It almost sounds like phishing, or a man in the middle attack redirecting 
you or attempting to redirect you elsewhere.

Very interesting situation, Can you provide some more info please.

Thanks

J
