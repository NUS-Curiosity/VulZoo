Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in XV, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

XV is an interactive image manipulation program for the X Window
System.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/xv      < 3.10a-r11                        >= 3.10a-r11

Description
===========

Greg Roelofs has reported multiple input validation errors in XV image
decoders. Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has
reported insufficient validation in the PDS (Planetary Data System)
image decoder, format string vulnerabilities in the TIFF and PDS
decoders, and insufficient protection from shell meta-characters in
malformed filenames.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require a victim to view a specially
created image file using XV, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All XV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/xv-3.10a-r11"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
