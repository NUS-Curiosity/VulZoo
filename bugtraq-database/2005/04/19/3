(->Don't read if don't care about Oracle security...)
You think you are secure because you are running the
unbreakable Oracle, you think you are secure because
you are up to date with patches, you think you are
secure because etc., etc......
You are wrong, Oracle software is so buggy that it can
be owned in five seconds bypassing all protection
mechanisms. Think how much money you will loose when
your corporate data is compromised.
There are still dozens of unpatched vulnerabilities.
The best protection is eliminating vulnerabilities.
