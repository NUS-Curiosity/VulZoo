Original Release Date: 2005-04-20

1. Systems affected:

        Quanta 3.1.x, KDE 3.2 and new up to including KDE 3.4.0.


2. Overview:

        Kommander is a visual editor and interpreter to edit and
        interpret visual dialogs and execute scripts attached to
        dialog actions. 

        Kommander executes without user confirmation data files
        from possibly untrusted locations. As they contain 
        scripts, the user might accidentally run arbitrary code.


3. Impact:

        Remotly supplied kommander files from untrusted sources
        are executed without confirmation. 


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.


5. Patch:

        A patch for KDE 3.4.0 is available from 
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :
