That's the whole point of the discussion- the way Postgres's pg_shadow
stuff works the salt is known and *because* of that it might as well not
exist since it means that you can pre-compute the keyspace.  Knowing the
salt means you can pre-compute the keyspace ahead of time.  If you don't
know the salt until you've gained access then you'll have to wait till
then to begin computing the keyspace.

I suppose technically you could start pre-computing the keyspace before
then, but then it's a much larger keyspace which makes it much more
difficult.
