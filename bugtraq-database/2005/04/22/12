Description
===========

Piotr Bania has discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in
RealPlayer and Helix Player when processing malicious RAM files.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to play a specially crafted RAM file an attacker
could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
the application.

Workaround
==========

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/realplayer-10.0.4"
