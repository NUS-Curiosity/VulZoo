Synopsis
========

KDE fails to properly validate input when handling PCX images,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. kimgio is the KDE image handler provided
by kdelibs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdelibs     < 3.3.2-r8                      *>= 3.2.3-r9
                                                           >= 3.3.2-r8

Description
===========

kimgio fails to properly validate input when handling PCX files.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to load a specially-crafted PCX image in a KDE
application, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdelibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose kde-base/kdelibs
