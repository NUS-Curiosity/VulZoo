The comments on md5 and sha1 are both inaccurate if you're comparing 
them. Encrypted passwords are as strong as the design of the password. 
In some cases, SHA-1 is a faster brute force because SHA-1 is a faster 
hash. There are two issues here. Using SHA-1 to hash a password, and the 
strength of a password. If the implementation of SHA-1 is not effective, 
there could be weaknesses that enable reducing the time required to 
perform exhaustive/dictionary attacks against sha-1 protected password.

I'm out of context, but I had to make some corrections.
