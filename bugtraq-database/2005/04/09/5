This has been a bug for over a year now:

This too was pointed out nearly two years ago:

In general a multi-layered defense system is a good idea.  mod_security is 
a great tool for Apache which can be installed to catch certain kinds of 
GET injections.  Certainly not fool proof as the codebase should filter 
inputs.

On the topic of programming it is good practice to validate input, 
however, for path disclosure, it is an even better plan to disable 
displaying errors on a production website.

Actually I know of a couple sites that work effortlessly to promote 
security in php-nuke.  These days chatserv works on writing and collecting 
patches into a bundle for download:

nukecops.com
nukeresources.com
ravenphpscripts.com

I'd suggest posting your finds as news submissions to these sites, with 
always a followup to phpnuke.org's Francisco (AKA nukelite).
