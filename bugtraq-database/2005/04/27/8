Zinho's Security Advisory       


Title: Comersus v6 Shopping Cart Sever Script injection 
Risk: High    
    


Comersus is one of the most used Shopping Cart software written in asp, available for  *nix and windows platforms. 


A critical script injection can lead to admin privileges stealing: 

Proof of concept: By registering on the site with username:  
" Tommy &lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt; " 

the script will be executed in all the pages in which Tommy's account is listed. Among  the other also in the admin pages. 
Being comersus a shopping cart script, this is reported as a high risk level issue
