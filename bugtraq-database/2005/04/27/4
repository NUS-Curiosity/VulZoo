Subject: Re: Discovering and Stopping Phishing/Scam Attacks


I think that this will just force the phishers to host their own images. 
As such, this approach is not very interesting unless there actually is 
a problem for the phishers in hosting their own images. The phishers 
could even host their own images on virtual domains that are typo-alike 
to the legitimate domain name.

For me personally, I would not notice the difference, as I already have 
my mail client configured to not load referenced images, because 
spammers already use hits on their hosted images as web bugs to detect 
working e-mails, and that just brings more spam down on your head. If 
you are loading images referenced in e-mails, you probably want to 
figure out how to turn that off.
