Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0015

Package name:      postgresql
Summary:           Buffer overflows
Date:              2005-04-25
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

Package description:
   PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
   (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including
   transactions, subselects and user-defined types and functions). The
   postgresql package includes the client programs and libraries that
   you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQL
   client programs are programs that directly manipulate the internal
   structure of PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server. These client
   programs can be located on the same machine with the PostgreSQL
   server, or may be on a remote machine which accesses a PostgreSQL
   server over a network connection. This package contains the docs
   in HTML for the whole package, as well as command-line utilities for
   managing PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server.


Problem description:
  From the CVE entry:
  Multiple buffer overflows in gram.y for PostgreSQL 8.0.1 and earlier
  may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via 
  (1) a large number of variables in a SQL statement being handled by the
      read_sql_construct function, 
  (2) a large number of INTO variables in a SELECT statement being handled
      by the make_select_stmt function, 
  (3) a large number of arbitrary variables in a SELECT statement being
      handled by the make_select_stmt function, and 
  (4) a large number of INTO variables in a FETCH statement being handled
      by the make_fetch_stmt function, a different set of vulnerabilities
      than CAN-2005-0245.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-0247 to this issue.
