Subject: Re: index.cgi script  XSS + file show


Could you please provide some more specific information regarding the
bugs you have found? For example, a simple google query for
"inurl:index.cgi" yields over two million results, and I seriously doubt
that those are all vulnerable - which product(s) are we talking about
here, and which version(s)? This information would greatly enhance the
ability of those who are either writing or using the vulnerable
software, to deal with the problem..

Kind regards,
David van Moolenbroek
