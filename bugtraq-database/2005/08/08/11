That may be not true for users using (at least) Internet Explorer, as
"MIME-type sniffing" will be used to determine the file type (and

That's what happen in some Oracle web pages sent with "text/plain" and
vulnerable to a text/code/JS injection. Oracle isn't to blame (really ?)
but the browser (if IE) will execute the JavaScript code.
