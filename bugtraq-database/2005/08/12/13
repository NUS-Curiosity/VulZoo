[sorry for the truncated post... stupid. fat. fingers.]

Man, I hate when people put this crap in as a bug in the software.  From 
the PHP.ini file:
-----------------
; Print out errors (as a part of the output).  For production web sites,
; you're strongly encouraged to turn this feature off, and use error logging
; instead (see below).  Keeping display_errors enabled on a production 
web site
; may reveal security information to end users, such as file paths on 
your Web
; server, your database schema or other information.
display_errors = On
------------------

There are clearly some issues to address in the XOOPS pages pointed out; 
no doubt there are some bugs to correct.

However, a path disclosure error in PHP is not an issue on a system 
which is configured for production (unless it comes directly from the 
software and not the PHP error reporting logic).

I understand the concern with path disclosure errors.  However, it 
sounds a little too much like our excuse making industry is kicking in 
when we start blaming software for not fixing improperly configured systems.
