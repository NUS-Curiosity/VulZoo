	Two-FactorAuthentication Service


I don't see how RapidSSL is the same as TeleAuth.

TeleAuth is a complete API that can be integrated into many different
systems. In addition to web sites, it can be used for telnet / SSH /
FTP access via it's PAM modules, can be used to collect credit card
information in e-commerce sites, or any custom application that needs
two-channel communications.

Also, I'm not sure there exists any free services that offer similar features.

Thanks for the friendly e-mail though.

Mohit.
