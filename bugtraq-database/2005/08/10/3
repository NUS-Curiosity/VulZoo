Subject: RE: Help put a stop to incompetent computer
	forensics


Jason,

After a trivial Google search, the following was found:

"Marcus Lawson, the president of the Spokane private forensic firm
Global Compusearch"
http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/070302_ctv.html

The firm's URL is www.globalcompusearch.com

Also, some might be interested in a two-part article in the Digital
Investigation journal
(http://www.compseconline.com/digitalinvestigation/) on this very
subject, the so-called Trojan Defense.

Cheers,

Chris

Though it raises new and important issues, say industry sources, the 
Trojan Horse problem won't likely mint a new defense strategy: It's just

a riff on the standard "not me" defense.

"There are a lot of child porn defendants who say, well, somebody else 
might have done it," said the EFF's Tien.  "But it doesn't fare very 
well, for obvious reasons."

In the end, experienced computer forensics investigators should be able 
to tell whether the computer's owner, or a Trojan Horse, spawned the 
material in question.

"You wouldn't want to just throw that out there as your defense," said 
Marcus Lawson, a computer forensic analyst who testified in the trial of

convicted child rapist and murderer David Westerfield. "An experienced 
computer forensics person could tell you whether it was because of [a 
Trojan virus] or not." _______________________________________________
