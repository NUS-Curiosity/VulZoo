As you know, typical.

I understand your upset with regard to this sort of stupid comment,
but I think you'd find you get a much more serious response if you
simply dump sentences like that. Insults aren't necessary - people
that know will already be sufficiently aware of it.

Simple - create a program which distributes random programs and data
accross the internet and picks data/applications to execute at random.

Why dig up dirt, just explain professionally why his actions are
incorrect. If you wanted you may be able to approach him under a
lawful banner with regard to submitting false testement or evidence.

Innocence is always subject to bias, as is everything else. Whilst
Lawsons statement above, in the general sense is very much incorrect,
the specific circumstances may allow for such a statement to be made.
There are many malware which simply do not perform complex or
confusing operations and can therefore be very easily analysed to be
(mostly) sure that the malware was not responsible for the data in
question. Logs may indicate a users physical presence which will
increase again the circumstantial evidence. It is and always will be
hard to make an accurate judgement for a court in such a scenario. As
an industry we should be providing statistical figures to back up any
claims which need to be made. If a user has booted a machine and
started printing fake bank notes out of the printer five minutes
later, having edited the images with some large image manipulation
program, it's really unlikely that the multitude of malware on the
machine could have contributed to his crime. Nevertheless if the
malware has touched any of the files on the local system, a computer
scientist may claim that we have no way of proving the user was
responsible - that is until the CCTV camera footage is presented. In
this field more than others, one must take circumstance with a pinch
of salt, and be very clear about what you DONT know.

Bring on physical data analysis, thats all I have to say about that.

Infosec is now such a large industry that as with most of the rest of
the computer industry, no one man can cover even a few percentiles of
the total spread of technologies. This makes qualification very
difficult. The best solution (and one which is becoming more common
worldwide) is to use highly practiced and well trained police officers
as forensics staff.

Yeah, next time lets claim it was the FBI's trojan, and they're
starting a big conspiracy trying to frame us all.
