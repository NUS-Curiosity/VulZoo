Subject: CoolWebSearch found in massive spyware ring


Sunbelt Software recently reported to the FBI evidence that shows 
CoolWebSearch is in a massive spyware ring where private information such 
as user names, passwords, chat sessions, bank information are stored and 
uploaded to servers. The FBI responded and are working on the case.

"Note that there is a LOT of bank information in here, including one 
company bank account with over US$350,000 and another small company in 
California with over $11,000 readily accessible. This list goes on and on 
and on. Of course, there's also eBay accounts and much more." --Sunbelt

This is obviously _big_ news.  Here are some links with far greater 
detail.  For all those out in the trenches:

Lets finally put an end to CWS.

Kudos out to Patrick Jordan, aka Webhelper.
