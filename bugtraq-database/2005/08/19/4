Synopsis
========

Adobe Reader is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially
lead to execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Adobe Reader is a utility used to view PDF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/acroread      < 7.0.1.1                       >= 7.0.1.1

Description
===========

A buffer overflow has been reported within a core application plug-in,
which is part of Adobe Reader.

Impact
======

An attacker may create a specially-crafted PDF file, enticing a user to
open it. This could trigger a buffer overflow as the file is being
loaded, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-7.0.1.1"
