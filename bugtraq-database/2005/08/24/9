Vendor's Description:

"Home ftp server is a very easy to use Windows FTP server application
 with all the nice ftp features included."

2. The bugs:
-------------

i.  Information Discolusure, the program by default stores users
    information ("ftpmembers.lst") and ftp server settings
    ("ftpsettings.lst") into program's directory which is the default
    users home directory.
    Note that ftpmembers.lst and ftpsettings.lst are in clear text.
    So a malicious user once logged in, can see server settings and
    users info in the home directory.


ii. Directory Traversal, the program allows users to see and/or
    download (if Allow download files is enabled) all the files
    available on the remote system.
