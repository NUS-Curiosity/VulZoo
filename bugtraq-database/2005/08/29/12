Subject: Re: unload event in ie/mozilla/opera


"that means you can "keep" the user on a site. when you type a new url
 in the address-bar, javascript overwrites it."
 Annoying, but not very dangerous.
 When I type a new url, I get brought to a "file://localhost/[...]/unload.html". Then I type a new url, and that's ok.
 I wouldn't disable javascript for that.
