Symantec AntiVirus 9 Corporate Edition Local Privilege Escalation
Vulnerability 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 08.29.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=298&type=vulnerabilities
August 29, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Symantec AntiVirus 9 Corporate Edition is an enterprise quality 
Anti-Virus solution for the Windows platform. 

More information can be found at the following location:

http://enterprisesecurity.symantec.com/products/products.cfm?ProductID=1
55

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a design error in the Symantec AntiVirus 9
Corporate Edition may allow a user to gain elevated privileges.
Exploitation can occur when a user chooses the right click "Scan for
viruses" option. The Symantec scan file interface allows the user to
launch a help window through the use of a toolbar icon. If the user
then right clicks the help window title bar they can choose the "Jump
to URL" menu option, which will then allow them to browse the local
file system and execute files as the SYSTEM user.

This vulnerability is a re-appearance of an old bug formerly found in
the Symantec 7.x series virus scan product.
