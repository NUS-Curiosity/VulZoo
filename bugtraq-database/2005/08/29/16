Adobe Version Cue VCNative Arbitrary Library Loading Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 08.29.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=296&type=vulnerabilities
August 29, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Version Cue is a software version tracking system for Adobe 
products distributed with Adobe Creative Suite and select Adobe 
products. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a design error in Adobe Systems, Inc. Version Cue 
allows local attackers to gain root privileges. Version Cue includes a
setuid root application named VCNative which contains a design error
that allows local attackers to gain root privileges. The vulnerability
specifically exists due to an unchecked command line option parameter.
The "-lib" command line option allows users to specify library
"bundles" which allows for the introduction of arbitrary code in the
context of a root owned process. The init function in a shared library
is executed immediately upon loading. By utilizing the "-lib" argument
to load a malicious library, local attackers can execute arbitrary code
with root privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows local attackers to execute arbitrary 
code with root privileges. The attack method is trivial and requires no 
specialized exploit code or skill by the attacker. Simply compiling a 
shared library with malicious code is all that is required to gain 
control of the system.

It should be noted that VCNative must connect to a valid host before 
loading libraries. The vulnerability is not exposed if VCNative has not 
been configured with a proper host value. In addition, the 
vulnerability affects only the Apple OS X platform and is only 
installed with Adobe Creative Suite or other Adobe products.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in 
Adobe Version Cue version 1 on the Apple OS X platform.

V. WORKAROUND

As a workaround solution, remove the setuid bit from the VCNative 
binary and execute the application as a root user when necessary.
