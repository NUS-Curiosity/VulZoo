Subject: Re: Internet Explorer 6 Meta Refresh Parsing
	Weakness

Why should Microsoft be accountable for the mistakes of webmasters? Have you even tested any of ther other browsers? Even if you have, a webmaster should indeed be responsible for blindly redirecting a user to a url supplied in input. This isn't an Internet Explorer mistake - it is a webmaster mistake, and quite a silly one at that.

Btw, if this message appears in your mailboxes twice, it's because I sent it twice (the first time I received a DNS failure message).

> 
> BACKGROUND 
> While the format of 
> META http-equiv="refresh" 
> and 
> META name="refresh" 
> type HTML headers was never exactly defined by they W3C, web 
> browsers have been interpreting this instruction since early 
> releases. Web application developers got used to the clients' 
> behaviour and using this tag to initiate URL redirections 
> became common. 
> 
> As most web browsers, Internet Explorer 6 interprets this tag, 
> too. However, in contrary to other web browsers, IE6's HTML 
> parser uses a pretty loose rule set which facilitates 
> injection of malicious code into it when browsing web 
> applications which insufficiently sanitize user supplied 
> input. 
> 
> For example, a web application may use the following PHP code 
> (redirect.php) to redirect a web browser to a different URL: 
> 
> 
> > $goto = $_GET["goto"]; // Input sanitization omitted 
> $meta1 = ''; 
> echo $meta.$goto; 
> ?> 
> 
> 
> 
> Assuming this script is hosted in the web root on example.org, 
> the following HTML code would be returned on a request to 
> http://example.org/redirect.php?goto=localhost :

> Obviously, a web application developer must make sure that no 
> malicious code can be injected along the 'goto' parameter passed 
> via the HTTP GET method. A common method to sanitize user input 
> would be to hardcode the protocol part of the URL ('http://')

> ISSUE 
> Unlickily, and in contrary to other web browsers, Internet 
> Explorer 6 allows multiple 'URL=' parts in the 'content' 
> attribute and will only interpret the last value given. 
> Resulting from this, it is still possible to inject code into a 
> web application using the input sanitization described above 
> which will be executed when using Internet Explorer 6. 
> 
> For example, Internet Explorer 6 will interpret the following 
> statement: 
> 
> URL parameter: 
> goto=;URL=javascript:alert('XSS'); 
> Resulting META tag: 
> content="0; URL=http://;URL=javascript:alert('XSS');"> 
> Resulting behaviour: 
> Displays Javascript alert with text 'XSS' 
> 
> Making use of Internet Explorers loose parsing, a code such as 
> this value of the 'goto' URL parameter will work, too: 
> 
> %20%20%20%20%20;UrL=jaVAscRIpt:alert('XSS'); 
> 
> will work, too. As any of ';', 'UrL', '=', 'jaVAscRIpt' and ':' 
> may be legal content passed to the traget web site (think of a 
> search term passed to a search engine), sanitizing this is not 
> too easy. 
> 
> As the expected behaviour would be that a web browser would 
> either return an error message for incorrect syntax or would 
> attempt to interpret anything after the first 'URL=' part as the 
> target URL, Internet Explorer behaves in a pretty uncommon way. A

> 
> 
> WORKAROUND 
> Client: Disable META REFRESH in Security Settings for the Internet

> Server: Perform thorough sanitization on your web applications.
