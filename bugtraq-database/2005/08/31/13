Synopsis
========

pam_ldap contains a vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to
gain system access.

Background
==========

pam_ldap is a Pluggable Authentication Module which allows
authentication against LDAP directories.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-auth/pam_ldap        < 180                             >= 180

Description
===========

When a pam_ldap client attempts to authenticate against an LDAP server
that omits the optional error value from the
PasswordPolicyResponseValue, the authentication attempt will always
succeed.

Impact
======

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to bypass the LDAP
authentication mechanism, gaining access to the system possibly with
elevated privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All pam_ldap users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/pam_ldap-180"
