Synopsis
========

phpWebSite is vulnerable to multiple issues which result in the
execution of arbitrary code and SQL injection.

Background
==========

phpWebSite is a web site content management system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpwebsite     < 0.10.2_rc2                >= 0.10.2_rc2

Description
===========

phpWebSite uses an XML-RPC library that improperly handles XML-RPC
requests and responses with malformed nested tags. Furthermore,
"matrix_killer" reported that phpWebSite is vulnerable to an SQL
injection attack.

Impact
======

A malicious remote user could exploit this vulnerability to inject
arbitrary PHP script code into eval() statements by sending a specially
crafted XML document, and also inject SQL commands to access the
underlying database directly.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpWebSite users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phpwebsite-0.10.2_rc2"
