Subject: secure client-side platform




how to have a secure client-side platform for secret communication?
    ... transferring and storing secret messages, online banking, etc

i got some fresh ideas in mind, and would like to share it here:
0. watch network with sniffer, so be sure no byte is sent to weird destinations
1. read-only operating system(knoppix, etc), so every boot is a fresh start
2. get every secret processed in memory and stored as encrypted in remote server

any suggesion or fresh idea on this topic is welcome
