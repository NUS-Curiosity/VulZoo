Description:
A vulnerability has been identified in Hummingbird FTP, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain knowledge of sensitive information.

The vulnerability is caused due to the use of a simple algorithm to "encrypt" passwords in FTP profiles (*.hfs). The problem is that a cipher text is generated by incrementing the plain text ASCII value of each password character by 125 (0x7d). This makes it trivial to gain knowledge of the password.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 10. However, prior versions may also be affected.


Solution:
Set proper ACLs for FTP profiles.
