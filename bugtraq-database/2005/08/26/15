All linksys MACs will have an address with one of these prefixes:
        00045A       The Linksys Group,
        000625       The Linksys Group, In
        000C41       The Linksys Group, In
        000F66       Cisco-Linksys
        001217       Cisco-Linksys, LLC
        001310       Cisco-Linksys, LLC
e.g.
        00:04:5A:xx:xx:xx


Plug a laptop into any worrisome network segments and look for a linksys
MAC address. If the linksys routers talk IPv6:
        ping6 -w ff02:1%fxp0    (or %eth0 or whatever your interface is)
Otherwise do a broadcast ping, a ping sweep, or whatever will tickle a
linksys router.

(friendly reminder: the host's MAC address will not be preserved if the
packet goes through a router)
