Subject: 22nd Chaos Communication Congress 2005: Call for Papers


Call for Papers

22C3 - Private Investigations
22nd Chaos Communication Congress
December 27th to 30th, 2005
Berlin, Germany

http://www.ccc.de/congress/2005/



Overview
========

The 22nd Chaos Communication Congress (22C3) is a four-day conference on
technology, society and utopia. The Congress offers lectures and
workshops  on a multitude of topics including (but not limited to)
information technology, IT-security, internet, cryptography and
generally a critical-creative attitude towards technology and the
discussion about the effects of technological advances on society.

The Chaos Communication Congress is the annual congress of the Chaos
Computer Club e.V. (CCC). The Congress has established itself as the
"European Hacker Conference" assembling people from all over the world.

Even more important, the Congress is a great party bringing together the
brightest heads of a variety of cultures and interests strengthening the
idea of cross-culture inspiration and borderless networking. 22C3 is
fun.



Topics
======

The 22C3 conference program is roughly divided into five separate
categories. These categories should serve as guidelines for your
submissions and as a help to our visitors. However, it is not mandatory
for your talk to exactly match the descriptions below. Anything that is
interesting for our audience will be strongly considered.


Hacking
-------

The 'Hacking' domain addresses topics dealing with technology,
concentrating on current research with high technical merit.
Traditionally, the majority of all talks held tend to be drawn from this
domain.

Topics in this domain include but are in no way limited to: network and
system security, programming, hardware hacking, applied cryptography and
creative use of technology in an unintended way in general.


Science
-------

The 'Science' domain deals with current or future objects of scientific
research that have the potential to radically change our lives, be it
basic research or conducted for the industry.

We are looking for talks and papers on the current state of the art in
this domain, covering subjects such as nano technology, quantum
computing, high frequency physics, bio technology, brain-computer
interfaces, automated analysis of surveillance cctv, etc.


Society
-------

This domain deals with the state of society itself. Anything about
politics and sociology with a relevance for hackers would go in here.

Possible topics could include wire tapping laws, surveillance practices,
net politics, intellectual property and copyright issues, effects of
technology on kids etc.


Culture
-------

Dealing with cultural mind expansion, this domain adresses to the fringe
of the technoverse. Examples would be Diskordianism, geek entertainment,
video game culture, computer music, pixel art, and literature for
hackers.


Community
---------

The Chaos Communication Congress invites developers, projects and
activists to present themselves and their topics at the Congress.

Developer groups are also encouraged to ask for support to hold smaller
on-site developer conferences and meetings in  the course of the
Congress.


Publication
===========

The Chaos Communication Congress Proceedings are published on paper and
online on the Internet. Only talks and presentations that were actually
accepted will be published.

Further Information
===================

we are unfortunately unable to pay any fees. Help on travel expenses and
accomodation is generally possible but is to be agreed upon after
acceptance of the lecture/workshop.

You can find the perliminary agenda at

http://www.ccc.de/congress/2005/

You will find also information on the registration procedure for
participants here.

22c3-content at cccv.de.



Submissions
===========

Language
--------

We are looking for speakers who can give lectures and/or workshops in
either English or German. 22C3 is an international event, so we have a
certain focus on having a large share of talks in English, for the
benefit of our growing number of international guests.


However, the quality of the presentation should come first. If you feel
insecure, received criticism from your audience before, or if you just
fear that the value and understandibility of your talk might suffer,
please choose German.


Lecture Requirements
--------------------

Lectures should  not exceed 45 minutes plus up to 10 minutes for Q&A.
Longer timeslots are possible if we feel the topic demands it (please
remark on submission). Workshops should include a talk on the basic
