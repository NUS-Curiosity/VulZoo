yes. this is why i added the "window.unlock" which is set true on
document.onmousedown
--> see code

> hit reload, you will see the URL of the site you typed in.
yes... strange things happens there. also if you "see source-code"
after the redirect, it shows the source of the url you  typed into the
address-bar.

i did not have time to play some more with it. but maybee there i a
way to spoof an URL

on my opinion this redirect should be blocked (like they do block
popups etc..). this is a security lack... or am i wrong?

cheers
