Synopsis
========

PhpWiki includes PHP XML-RPC code which is vulnerable to arbitrary
command execution.

Background
==========

PhpWiki is an application that creates a web site where anyone can edit
the pages through HTML forms.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpwiki      < 1.3.10-r2                    >= 1.3.10-r2

Description
===========

Earlier versions of PhpWiki contain an XML-RPC library that improperly
handles XML-RPC requests and responses with malformed nested tags.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary
PHP script code into eval() statements by sending a specially crafted
XML document to PhpWiki.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PhpWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phpwiki-1.3.10-r2"
