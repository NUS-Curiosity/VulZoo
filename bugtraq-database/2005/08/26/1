Subject: ssl-login-checkbox faked in Lycos webmail-frontend


Lycos Webmail offers a checkbox named "SSL LOGIN" which let you assume a secure transfer of your credentials - it's only pretended! Repeatedly sniffs shows account and password in cleartext - no https-packet came across...
The interesting part of the relating http-packet:

...
login=dasbinich&hiddenlogin=Nutzername&hiddenpassword=******&password=geheim000&ssl=on
HTTP/1.0 302 Found

Proxy-Connection: keep-alive Server: Apache/1.3.33 (Unix) Resin/2.1.12 mod_gzip/1.3.26.1a mod_ssl/2.8.22 OpenSSL/0.9.6c

...and so on. Funny, isn't it? Or poor!

Lycos informed in july 27.
