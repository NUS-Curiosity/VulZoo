Subject: Re: LeapFTP .lsq Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Seeing as how, given a large enough buffer, it is relatively easy to
write arbitrary shell code using just ASCII characters, the larger
unicode space would make this even easier.  Unless there are some
pretty severe unlisted restrictions on either the length or content of
the overflow string, making an exploit is practically trivial.

If you want a quick'n'dirty overview of shell code using a very
limited subset of ASCII you can refer to the lecture notes from a unix
security class I took in Fall 2004 (starting on page 5 of this
document):  http://cr.yp.to/2004-494/0910.pdf
