Synopsis
========

A flaw in Tor leads to the disclosure of information and the loss of
anonymity, integrity and confidentiality.

Background
==========

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/tor     < 0.1.0.14                           >= 0.1.0.14

Description
===========

The Diffie-Hellman implementation of Tor fails to verify the
cryptographic strength of keys which are used during handshakes.

Impact
======

By setting up a malicious Tor server and enticing users to use this
server as first hop, a remote attacker could read and modify all
traffic of the user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.1.0.14"
