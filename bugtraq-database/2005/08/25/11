Synopsis
========

libpcre is vulnerable to a heap integer overflow, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libpcre is a library providing functions for Perl-compatible regular
expressions.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libpcre        < 6.3                              >= 6.3

Description
===========

libpcre fails to check certain quantifier values in regular expressions
for sane values.

Impact
======

An attacker could possibly exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code by sending specially crafted regular expressions to
applications making use of the libpcre library.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libpcre users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre-6.3"
