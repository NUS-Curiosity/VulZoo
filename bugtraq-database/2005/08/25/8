Subject: Re: unload event in ie/mozilla/opera


In Firefox (the browser I was just testing that in), the only time
that seems to trigger is when a different address is placed in the
address bar.  Other events such as back, forward, and closing the
window don't call it.

What I found most interesting is that if you type an address in and
are redirected, the address bar will show the original URL, but if you
hit reload, you will see the URL of the site you typed in.

Is there a possibility to use this to spoof a URL?
