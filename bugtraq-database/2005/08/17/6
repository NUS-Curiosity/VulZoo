============================== Summary ==============================

 Security Alert: NOVL-2005-10098073
          Title: GroupWise Password Caching
           Date: 16-August-2005
       Revision: Original
   Product Name: GroupWise 5.x, 6.x
 OS/Platform(s): Windows and NetWare

    Vendor Name: Novell, Inc.

        Affects: GroupWise Windows Clients & Proxies
    Identifiers: Bugtraq:13997, CVE:CAN-2005-2620, SECTRACK:1014247

============================ Description ============================

The GroupWise client sometimes caches the user name and password in 
memory while it is running.

============================== Impact ===============================

A hostile user with administrative access to the machine where a user 
is logged in may dump memory and find username/password pairs of 
logged in users.

======================== Recommended Actions ========================
GW 7 was released with these fixes already applied, so no further
action is required for GroupWise 7 users.

Until the official release of GroupWise 6.5 SP5 in mid-September, 
customers wishing to apply Field Test Files (FTF) can download these 
from http://support.novell.com/filefinder/  and locate the latest 
GroupWise Agents and GroupWise Client FTFs.  Currently as of 
August 16, 2005 the filenames are fgw655h.exe for Agents and 
f32655f7e.exe for GW Client.  Both, FTFs will need to be applied 
to get the full fix.
