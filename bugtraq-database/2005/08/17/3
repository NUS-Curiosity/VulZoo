Synopsis
========

Improper validation of Bluetooth device names can lead to arbitrary
command execution.

Background
==========

bluez-utils are the utilities for use with the BlueZ implementation of
the Bluetooth wireless standards for Linux.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-wireless/bluez-utils       < 2.19                     >= 2.19

Description
===========

The name of a Bluetooth device is improperly validated by the hcid
utility when a remote device attempts to pair itself with a computer.

Impact
======

An attacker could create a malicious device name on a Bluetooth device
resulting in arbitrary commands being executed as root upon attempting
to pair the device with the computer.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All bluez-utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/bluez-utils-2.19"
