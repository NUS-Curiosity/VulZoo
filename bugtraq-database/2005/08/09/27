Subject: tool release: n.bug


Hi,

n.runs GmbH announces the availability of n.bug, a runtime library call trace
program for windows. n.bug builds on Phenoelit's dumbug core and provides a
GUI, enhanced call tracing and even documentation. It can be used much like
ltrace(1) on UNIX platforms for finding vulnerabilities by identifying
callers of interesting functions with user provided data in closed source
applications.

regards,
Felix Lindner
