Sorry, I just noticed that that last comment was entirely misleading! In all 
versions, using --no-same-owner without --no-same-permissions *will* cause 
the setuid and setgid bits to be preserved even where the owner or group has 
been changed to root (i.e. where a different UID or GID was specified in the 
archive), as will using -o (in 1.15) without --no-same-permissions. The -o 
option is 'broken' in 1.14 (and possibly in earlier versions) in that it 
simply fails to enable the intended behaviour (in fact it enables the exact 
opposite, being equivalent to --same-owner).
