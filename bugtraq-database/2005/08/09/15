I'm not saying that it shouldn't have the behaviour, rather that it
should warn the user.

Howeber the only reason I posted this "bug" was because a number of
unix/linux vendors have decided that the same issue in unzip (which I
cited earlier : CAN-2005-0602) should be considered a vulnerability
and have issued patches to change the behaviour. Hence they may (or
may not) decide to take similar action with tar,

The number of people who use tar for archival purposes is minimal
compared to those who use it for distribution purposes. Of course you
could argue that misusing an archival tool as a distribution tool is
the source of this potential problem, but the fact is that it is used
for distribution purposes and thus is a potentinal attack vector.
