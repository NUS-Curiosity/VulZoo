This isn't specific to GNU, it's *expected behaviour* for every version of tar.
 In fact, a failure to conform to this behaviour breaks essential functionality
of tar.  If the root user doesn't know what this tool does or what it's for,
then don't run it.

What part of 'Tape ARchive' wasn't clear?  Would you be happy if your backup and
restore procedures failed to actually restore files in their original condition?
 Sheesh.
