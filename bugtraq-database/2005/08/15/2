Synopsis
========

Gaim is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code or to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Gaim is a full featured instant messaging client which handles a
variety of instant messaging protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/gaim       < 1.5.0                                >= 1.5.0

Description
===========

Brandon Perry discovered that Gaim is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
overflow when handling away messages (CAN-2005-2103). Furthermore,
Daniel Atallah discovered a vulnerability in the handling of file
transfers (CAN-2005-2102).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could create a specially crafted away message which,
when viewed by the target user, could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code. Also, an attacker could send a file with a non-UTF8
filename to a user, which would result in a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gaim users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/gaim-1.5.0"
