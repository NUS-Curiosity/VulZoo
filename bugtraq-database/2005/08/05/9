No; compound attacks need more than one attack vector. In your example
of attacking a web server, the attacker needs a compound attack
comprised of a remote->local attack and a local->root attack to take
over the machine. It is "compound" in that it is comprised of more than
one attack, but does not necessarily involve the victim's intervention.
