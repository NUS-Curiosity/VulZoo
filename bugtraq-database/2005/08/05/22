I still don't understand why this is a problem. If it were a problem, it
would be one of humongous dimensions because it affects all programs
that use open(..., 0666) to create non-executable files potentially
containing sensitive contents. For example all editors. And all shells
because any redirection could create such a file.

If you work on confidential information, your umask should be 077. In a
bank I worked for this was prescribed for the superuser account. Made
for a lot of admin problems because root rarely creates files with
confidential information, but frequently files that must be readable
for anyone...
