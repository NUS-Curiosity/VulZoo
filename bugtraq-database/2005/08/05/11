Synopsis
========

The pstopnm utility, part of the Netpbm tools, contains a vulnerability
which can potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Netpbm is a package of 220 graphics programs and a programming
libraries, including pstopnm. pstopnm is a tool which converts
PostScript files to PNM image files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/netpbm       < 10.28                          >= 10.28

Description
===========

Max Vozeler reported that pstopnm calls the GhostScript interpreter on
untrusted PostScript files without specifying the -dSAFER option, to
convert a PostScript file into a PBM, PGM, or PNM file.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious PostScript file and entice a user
to run pstopnm on it, resulting in the execution of arbitrary commands
with the permissions of the user running pstopnm.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Netpbm users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/netpbm-10.28"
