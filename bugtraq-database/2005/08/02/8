Subject: Re: Re : [Firefox Bug 302187] New: Shared section vulnerability when opening microsoft office document resulting in DoS



It's a security issue, i found it and reported this to
MS long time ago when i started to research shared
sections bugs, MS will fix the issue in some future. I
don't know why MS said to you that it's not a security
issue.
