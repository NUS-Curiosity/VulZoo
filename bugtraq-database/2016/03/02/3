Potential Security Impact: Multiple Vulnerabilities

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY

Potential security vulnerabilities identified with Windows running the NVidia
Graphics Driver have been addressed in certain HP EliteBook and Zbook Products.
The vulnerabilities could be locally exploited resulting in execution of code,
Denial of Service (DoS), elevation of privilege, or other impacts.

Note: In addition to the CVE vulnerabilities referenced below, this update also
addresses the "MS_Detours_Security_Update_For_Nvidia_Driver" vulnerability where
the Nvidia driver has an unpatched Microsoft Detours library that limits the
effectiveness of OS Security features such as ASLR, DEP and SafeSEH. Depending
on the security context of the target system, malicious code attacks can result
in loss of information, denial of service, or full system compromise.
