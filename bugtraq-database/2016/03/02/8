Cisco NX-OS Software TCP Netstack Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160302-netstack

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 March 02 16:00  UTC (GMT) 

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the TCP stack of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to improper processing of certain TCP packets in the closing sequence of a TCP session while the affected device is in a TIME_WAIT state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific TCP packet to an affected device on a TCP session that is already in a TIME_WAIT state. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the TCP stack on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.

This vulnerability can be exploited using either IPv4 or IPv6 packets. The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted sequence of TCP packets destined for TCP ports listening on the device. The packets may use the IPv4 or IPv6 unicast address of any interface configured on the device.

This vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
