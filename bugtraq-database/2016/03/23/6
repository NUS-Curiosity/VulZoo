Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software DHCPv6 Relay Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160323-dhcpv6

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 March 23 16:00  GMT

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) relay feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DHCPv6 relay messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 relay message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
