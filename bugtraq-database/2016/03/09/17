Summary
========

A vulnerability in the web-based administration interface of Cisco Model DPQ3925 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 Wireless Residential Gateway with EDVA could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to become unresponsive and restart, creating a denial of service (DoS) condition.
 
The vulnerability is due to improper handling, processing, and termination of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to management-enabled interfaces of an affected system.
