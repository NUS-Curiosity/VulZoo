Package        : bsh
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2510

Alvaro Mu√±oz and Christian Schneider discovered that BeanShell, an
embeddable Java source interpreter, could be leveraged to execute
arbitrary commands: applications including BeanShell in their
classpath are vulnerable to this flaw if they deserialize data from an
untrusted source.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0b4-12+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0b4-15+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch) and unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.0b4-16.

We recommend that you upgrade your bsh packages.
