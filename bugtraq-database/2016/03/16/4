Advisory Details:

A Cross Site Scripting(XSS) vulnerability has been found in Litecart CMS

1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Litecart-1.3.4

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in URI. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an attacker to change appearance of the web site, steal cookies of other users and forge check out pages. It is also possible to gain administrative access to the web site.

Vulnerable URL - http://127.0.0.1/litecart-1.3.4/public_html/en/printable_order_copy
Vulnerable Parameter - order_id

The exploitation example below uses the "prompt()" JavaScript function to display user cookie:

POC -

Here, checksum needs to be some valid checksum.
