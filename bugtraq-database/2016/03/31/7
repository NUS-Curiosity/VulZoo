v1.80 wordpress plugin.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-03-24:    Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple client-side web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the
official WP External Links v1.80 wordpress plugin.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script
codes to the application-side of the vulnerable modules.

The vulnerabilities are located in the
`[ignore]`,`[title]`,`[no_icon_class]` and `[class_name]` values of the
`wp_external_links-main`,
`wp_external_links-seo` or `wp_external_links-style` module POST method
request. Remote attackers are able to inject script codes to the
application-side of the affected modules. The attack vector of the
issues are persistent and the request method to inject is POST.
The injection point are the input fields and the execution occurs in the
main context sub menu after the inject.

The security risk of the application-side vulnerabilities are estimated
as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5.
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerabilities requires a privileged
web application user account and low or medium  user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects,
persistent load
of malicious script codes or persistent web module context manipulation.

Request Method(s):
                [+] POST
