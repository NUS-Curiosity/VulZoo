Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Dorma Web CMS web-application (2016 Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to
compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerabilities are located in the `id_news` and `id_sub_cat` values
of the `more.php` or `news_continue.php` files.
Remote attackers are able to execute sql commands by injection of
malicious statements via GET method request. The vulnerability
is located on the application-side and the request method to
inject/execute is GET. The security vulnerability is a classic order
by sql injection bug.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as
high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.4.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no
user interaction or privileged web-application user accounts.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database
management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
                [+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] more.php
                [+] news_continue.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] id_news
                [+] id_sub_cat


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote
attackers without privileged web-application user account or user
interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

Dork(s):
inurl:more.php?id_news= intext:"Design by DORSA WEB"
inurl:news_continue.php?id_news= intext:"Design by DORSA WEB"

PoC: Exploitation
http://localhost:8080/news_continue.php?id_news=36[SQL INJECTION
VULNERABILITY!]--
http://localhost:8080/more.php?id_news=114[SQL INJECTION VULNERABILITY!]--


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The sql injection vulnerability can be patched by usage of a prepared
statement and entities in the news_id GET method request. Escape the entry.




Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the sql injection web vulnerability in the
web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.0)
