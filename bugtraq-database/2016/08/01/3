Package        : redis
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7458
Debian Bug     : 832460

It was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, did not
properly protect redis-cli history files: they were created by default
with world-readable permissions.

Users and systems administrators may want to proactively change
permissions on existing ~/rediscli_history files, instead of waiting
for the updated redis-cli to do so the next time it is run.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u5.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 2:3.2.1-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.
