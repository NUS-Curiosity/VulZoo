Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The vulnerbaility laboratory core research team discovered multiple client-side cross site vulnerabilities in the QuickerBB v0.7.0 Forum web-application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-08-11:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
QuickerBB
Product: QuickerBB - Forum (Web-Application) 0.7.0 and 0.6.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple client-side cross site scripting vulnerabilities has been discovered in the QuickerBB v0.7.0 Forum web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to client-side browser to web-application requests.

The cross site scripting vulnerabilities are located in the `username` and `email` parameters of the `Register` module.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious payloads to the client-side requested register module of the index.php file.
The injection points are the vulnerable marked parameters and the execution point occurs in the forum registration form web context.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector of the issue is non-persistent.

The security risk of the xss vulnerabilities are estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.2. 
Exploitation of the client-side vulnerabilities requires no privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in non-persistent phishing attacks, session hijacking, non-persistent external 
redirect to malicious sources and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected web module context.

Request Method(s):
			[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Register

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] index.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] username
			[+] email


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reprduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the forum web-application without authentication
2. Open the register module with click to the link
3. Inject to the username or email inputs own script code payload
4. The execute occurs when processing to click the submit button for the POST method request
5. Successful reproduce of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the vulnerable name and email input fields of the registration formular.
Disallow special chars and filter the entries or escape the context to prevent further client-side script code injection attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerabilities in the registration formular of the forum is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.2)
