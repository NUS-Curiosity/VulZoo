Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers Fragmented Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160810-iosxr

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 August 10 16:00  GMT

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the driver processing functions of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on the route processor (RP) of an affected device, which could cause the device to drop all control-plane protocols and lead to a denial of service condition (DoS) on a targeted system. 

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted, fragmented packets that are directed to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted, fragmented packets to an affected device for processing and reassembly. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak on the RP of the device, which could cause the device to drop all control-plane protocols and eventually lead to a DoS condition on the targeted system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigations for this vulnerability.
