Subject: Linksys E1200 and E2500 (Missing authorization on parental control)



Linksys E1200 hardware version 2.2 and firmware version 2.0.07 (build 2) suffer from missing authorization control on parental control page. This allows an attacker to change the parental controls set up by parents  to keep kids safe from visiting adult sites and probably compromise a kidï¿½s device.
