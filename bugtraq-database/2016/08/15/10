Subject: Linksys E2500 and E1200 (Unauth Command Injection)

Linksys E2500 and E1200 suffer from missing command injection issue in parental control parameters. This allows an attacker to change the control the device remotely.

Combining the attack of no authorization control, it allows an attacker to actually execute unauthenticated command injection attack and thus control the entire device.
