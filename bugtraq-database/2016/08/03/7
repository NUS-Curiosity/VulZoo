Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV180 VPN Router and Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access arbitrary files on the system. This vulnerability allows the attacker to perform directory traversal.

The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input verification and sanitization of the user input directory path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the system that should be restricted.

Cisco has not released and will not release a firmware update to address this vulnerability. Mitigations for this vulnerability are available.
