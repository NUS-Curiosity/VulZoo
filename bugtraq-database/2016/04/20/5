Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Management Interface Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160420-wlc

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 April 20 16:00  GMT (UTC)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) devices running Cisco AireOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to the presence of unsupported URLs in the web-based device management interface provided by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access a URL that is not generally accessible from and supported by the management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
