Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
4PSA
Product: VoipNow - Online Service (Web-Application) 4.0.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official VoipNow v4.0.1 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable service.

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `report_block_table_details` and `report_block_table_title` values of the `xajax_handler.php` 
file GET method request. Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script codes to the Notes input field in the invoice template. 
Thus allows an attacker to trigger an execution of the payload on edit or active invoice interaction. The request method to inject is POST 
via input and the attack vector of the issue is located on the application-side of the service.

The security risk of the application-side vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8. 
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low privilege web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to 
malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Invoice - Template
				
Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] xajax_handler.php

Vulnerable Inputs(s):
				[+] Add Note

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] report_block_table_details
				[+] report_block_table_title


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the main website
2. Login to the application
3. Open Invoices Management - Invoice Number as Template
4. Inject to the Note description input field on buttom the malicious payload
5. Save the request via POST method
6. Watch the printed site or the edit invoice formular to trigger the persistent script code execution
7. Successful reproduce of the application-side vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable Notes input field in the invoice POST method request.
Disallow the usage of special chars and restrict the input to prevent further script code injection attacks.
Encode the vulnerable 
`report_block_table_details` and `report_block_table_title` output values to fix the issue.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side validation web vulnerability in the voipnow web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.8)
