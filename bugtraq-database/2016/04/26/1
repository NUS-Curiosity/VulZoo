Product: Account System - (Web-Application) 2016 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistant email spoofing web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Trendmirco online-service web-application.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to send spoofed emails with injected malicious script codes or changed content.

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `Share your protection` email function. It allows users to promote a product to friends or family.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script codes to the `download url` & `message` values of the `sendEmail` POST method request.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector of the vulnerability is located on the application-side of the service. Remote attackers 
are able to manipulate the download url source and the message body context. The execution occurs in the email that arrives to the target inbox,
when preparing to share.

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.6. 
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected software module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] /my_account/product/

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] sendEmail

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] downloadURL
				[+] message

Affected Service(s):
				[+] account.trendmicro.com


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The email spoofing and validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable download url and message values in the sendEmail POST method request.
Restrict the input and disallow special chars to prevent an application-side inject


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the email spoofing web vulnerability in the official trend micro accounts web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.6)
