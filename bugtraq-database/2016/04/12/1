Package        : didiwiki
Debian Bug     : 818708

The update for didiwiki issued as DSA-3485-1 introduced a regression
that caused a large number of valid pages to not be accessible
anymore. This occurred mostly for pages whose names started with
non-ascii characters.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.5-11+deb7u2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-11+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-13.

We recommend that you upgrade your didiwiki packages.
