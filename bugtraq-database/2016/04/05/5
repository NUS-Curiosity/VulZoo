Package        : mercurial
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-3068 CVE-2016-3069 CVE-2016-3630
Debian Bug     : 819504

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mercurial, a distributed
version control system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:

CVE-2016-3068

    Blake Burkhart discovered that Mercurial allows URLs for Git
    subrepositories that could result in arbitrary code execution on
    clone.

CVE-2016-3069

    Blake Burkhart discovered that Mercurial allows arbitrary code
    execution when converting Git repositories with specially
    crafted names.

CVE-2016-3630

    It was discovered that Mercurial does not properly perform bounds-
    checking in its binary delta decoder, which may be exploitable for
    remote code execution via clone, push or pull.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.2-4+deb7u2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.2-2+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.
