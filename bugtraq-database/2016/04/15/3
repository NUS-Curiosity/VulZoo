                   VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2016-0004
Synopsis:    VMware product updates address a critical security issue in
             the VMware Client Integration Plugin
Issue date:  2016-04-14
Updated on:  2016-04-14 (Initial Advisory)
CVE number:  CVE-2016-2076
 
1. Summary

   VMware vCenter Server, vCloud Director (vCD), vRealize Automation
   (vRA) Identity Appliance, and the Client Integration Plugin (CIP)
   updates address a critical security issue.

2. Relevant Releases

   vCenter Server 6.0
   vCenter Server 5.5 U3a, U3b, U3c
 
   vCloud Director 5.5.5
  
   vRealize Automation Identity Appliance 6.2.4

3. Problem Description

   a. Critical VMware Client Integration Plugin incorrect session
      handling

   The VMware Client Integration Plugin does not handle session content
   in a safe way. This may allow for a Man in the Middle attack or Web
   session hijacking in case the user of the vSphere Web Client visits
   a malicious Web site.

   The vulnerability is present in versions of CIP that shipped with:
   - vCenter Server 6.0 (any 6.0 version up to 6.0 U2)
   - vCenter Server 5.5 U3a, U3b, U3c
   - vCloud Director 5.5.5
   - vRealize Automation Identity Appliance 6.2.4

   In order to remediate the issue, both the server side (i.e. vCenter
   Server, vCloud Director, and vRealize Automation Identity Appliance)
   and the client side (i.e. CIP of the vSphere Web Client) will need
   to be updated.

   The steps to remediate the issue are as follows:
   A) Install an updated version of:
      - vCenter Server,
      - vCloud Director,
      - vRealize Automation Identity Appliance,
   B) Subsequently update the Client Integration Plugin on the system
      from which the vSphere Web Client is used.
      Updating the plugin on vSphere and vRA Identity Appliance is
      explained in VMware Knowledge Base article 2145066.
      Updating the plugin on vCloud Director is initiated by a prompt
      when connecting the vSphere Web Client to the updated version of
      vCloud Director.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the identifier CVE-2016-2076 to this issue.

   Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
   remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
   available.

   Plugin                  above          Mac OS
  
   * After installing the updated version, the Client Integration Plugin
     will need to be updated on all systems from which the vSphere Web
     Client is used to connect to vCenter Server, vCloud Director and
     vRealize Automation Identity Manager.

  ** vCloud Director 8.0.0 did not ship with a vulnerable CIP version,
      and vCloud Director 8.0.1 shipped with the updated version of the
      CIP.
