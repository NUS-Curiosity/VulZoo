Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager Privilege Escalation API Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160406-privauth

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 April 6 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the application programming interface (API) web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain elevated privileges.

The vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) when an unexpected HTTP URL request is received that does not match an expected pattern filter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with a modified URL to bypass RBAC settings. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the application to view and edit unauthorized data.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds are not available.
