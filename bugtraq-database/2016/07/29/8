Authors of Advisory: Matthias Deeg and Gerhard Klostermeier (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Logitech Wireless Combo MK520 is a wireless desktop set consisting of a
mouse and a keyboard.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"A keyboard and mouse that puts convenience and control comfortably at
your fingertips"

Due to an insecure implementation of the encrypted data communication,
the wireless keyboard Logitech K520 is prone to replay attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found out that the wireless keyboard Logitech K520 is
prone to replay attacks.

An attacker can sniff the AES-encrypted data packets of the 2.4 GHz
radio communication sent by the keyboard to the receiver (USB dongle)
and replay the recorded communication data at will causing the same
effect as the original data communication.

A replay attack against the keyboard can, for example, be used to gain
unauthorized access to a computer system that is operated with a
vulnerable Logitech K520 keyboard. In this attack scenario, an
attacker records the radio communication during a password-based user
authentication of his or her victim, for instance during a login to the
operating system or during unlocking a screen lock. At an opportune
moment when the victim's computer system is unattended, the attacker
approaches the victim's computer and replays the previously recorded
AES-encrypted data communication for the password-based user
authentication and by this gets unauthorized access to the victim's
system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH could successfully perform a replay attack as described
in the previous section using the USB radio dongle Crazyradio PA (see
[2]) and a simple proof-of-concept software tool.

The following output exemplarily illustrates a replay attack with the
recorded data packets for the word "test".
