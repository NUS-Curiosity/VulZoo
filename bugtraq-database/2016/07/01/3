Subject: [CVE-2016-6130] Double-Fetch Vulnerability in Linux-4.5/drivers/s390/char/sclp_ctl.c

I found this double-fetch vulnerability when I was doing my research on double-fetch issue analysis, and Iï¿½d like to make an anouncement here. 

This was found in Linux kernel file Linux-4.5/drivers/s390/char/sclp_ctl.c, and crafted user space data change under race condition will lead to consequences like over-boundary access on the kernel buffer, and information leakage.
