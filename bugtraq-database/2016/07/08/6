Technical Details & Description:
================================
A session validation approval web vulnerability has been discovered in the official BMW ConnectedDrive online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate specific configured parameters to compromise the affected web-application service.

VIN := vehicle Identification Number
A vehicle identification number, commonly abbreviated to VIN, or chassis number, is a unique code including a serial number, used by the 
automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds as defined in ISO 3833.

The vulnerability is located in the session management of the VIN adding procedure. Remote attackers are able to bypass the secure validation 
approval of the VIN when processing to create it. Basically the validation does not allow to add a non exisiting number to the interface 
configuration to prevent different typ of errors or issues. In case of the adding procedure the request approve via action - add the context.
Remote attackers are able to change with a live session tamper the action information to create or update. Thus allows an attacker to bypass 
the invalid VIN exception to add a new configuration finally. Thus interaction results in the takeover of other vehicle identification numbers 
to view or manipulate the configuration.

The security risk of the session validation vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.0. 
Exploitation of the session validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a compromise of registered or valid vehicle identification numbers via connecteddrive.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST/GET

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] action

Affected Module(s):
				[+] VIN - Konfiguration to Add/remove Vehicle


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The session validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction and with low privileged web-application user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the web-application of bmw connecteddrive (https://www.bmw-connecteddrive.co.uk/cdp/) and login
2. Surf to the My Settings module of the service
3. Start the session tamper and include a new random VIN
4. Save the requesst and manipulate in the session tamper the add value to create
5. Continue to process the GET request after it
6. Now, the module opens and the restriction with the vehicle Identification Number approval is bypassed
7. Now you can add your own VIN to the interface to create another car with the same VIN
8. Successful reproduce of the web-application vulnerability that affects the bmw car connecteddrive!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure approval of the action create/update/add request in the `/cdp/release/internet/servlet/vehicleAdd` module.
Setup a secure session validation that approves the request to deny unauthorized activities with invalid, compromised or manipulated vehicle identification numbers.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the session validation and approval web vulnerability in the bmw connectdrive web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.0)
