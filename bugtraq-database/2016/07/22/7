Bug Description :
DreamMail is an email client application, which allows its users to send, receive, and 

manage emails.

send emails attaching specific JavaScript codes, the victims who receive those emails may 

lose personal credentials, or the browsers of the victims may be hijacked.

JavaScript as well as Html.
