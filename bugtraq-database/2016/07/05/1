Subject: [CVE-2016-6136] Double-Fetch Vulnerability in Linux-4.6/kernel/auditsc.c

I found this double-fetch vulnerability when I was doing my research on double-fetch issue analysis, and Iï¿½d like to make an announcement here. 

This was found in Linux kernel file Linux-4.6/kernel/auditsc.c, and crafted user space data change under race condition will make control strings processed as none-control strings, which could mislead the audit subsystem of Linux kernel.
======================================================
1. Affected Versions: Linux Kernel 4.6 and earlier versions.

3. Patch: This has been confirmed by the maintainers and  patched in the new version:  https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-kernel/issues/18

4. CVE: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2016-6136 to this issue.
