Subject: Multiple DoS vulnerabilities in libosip2-4.1.0

Antisip's libosip2 v4.1.0 is vulnerable to heap buffer overflows in the following functions while parsing SIP messages and leads to a DoS if glibc hardening is enabled.
1. *osip_body_to_str*
2. *_osip_message_to_str*

All files for reproducing the issues have been filed in the bug tracker [1][2] and have since been fixed in upcoming osip version 5.0.0 [3]. I wonder if the report is sufficient to mandate CVEs. Feedback welcome.
