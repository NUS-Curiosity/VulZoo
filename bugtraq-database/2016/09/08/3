Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official PHPHolidays v3.00.50 content management system.
The web vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes on the client-side of the vulnerable module or service.

A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the search engine. The web vulnerability could allow an attacker to 
execute javascript in the web-browser of the user or administrator to compromise session credentials. The attacker can connect to a 
third account to trigger the issue without knowing the password.

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.1. 
Exploitation of the client-side cross site vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in non-persistent phishing, session hijacking, non-persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and client-side manipulation of affected or connected web module context.
