Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Common Industrial Protocol Request Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160928-cip

Revison: 1.0

For Public Release: 2016 September 28 16:00  GMT

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly process an unusual, but valid, set of requests to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a CIP message request designed to trigger the vulnerability to an affected device. An exploit could cause the switch to stop processing traffic, requiring a restart of the device to regain functionality.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
