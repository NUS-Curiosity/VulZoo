1. Product Information
===========================
BMC BladeLogic Server Automation (BSA) is an enterprise management solution, which allows its customers to quickly and securely provision, configure, patch, and maintain physical, virtual, and cloud servers.
It is available for Linux and Windows and runs as a privileged network daemon on the supervised servers.
For more information, please refer to http://www.bmcsoftware.com.au/it-solutions/bladelogic-server-automation.html

2. Vulnerability Summary
===========================
A logic flaw in the authentication process of BSA's network daemon (rscd) could allow a remote attacker to execute several commands without providing a valid client certificate or valid credentials.
Amongst the affected commands, the REMOTE_COPY_DIRECTORY feature performs a recursive dump of an arbitrary directory, with the daemon's privileges (root).
This could allow an attacker to retrieve any file from the remote system, e.g. /etc/shadow.

3. Remediation Steps
===========================
It is recommended to upgrade your BSA &lt;= 8.7 for Linux installation by performing one of the following:
- Apply BSA 8.7 Patch 3
- Upgrade to BSA &gt;= 8.8
These downloads are available on BMC's Electronic Product Distribution website at http://www.bmc.com/available/epd.html
