Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of specific values received as part of a user-supplied HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious dnslookup request to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
