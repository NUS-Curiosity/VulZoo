====================
Stanford
Product: Stanford University - Online Service (Web-Application) 2016 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql-injection web vulnerability has been discovered  in the official Stanford University online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers and privileged user accounts to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-server or dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `id` value of the `getevent.php` file GET method request. Remote attackers are able to execute own 
malicious sql commands via id value to compromise the web-server or connected database management system. The issue is a classic 
remote sql injection vulnerability. The request method to execute is GET and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the
active web-service.

The security risk of the sql-injection vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.8.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction and a low privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] getevent.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+ id



Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The sql-injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account or user interaction.
