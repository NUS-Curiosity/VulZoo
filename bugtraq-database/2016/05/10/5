Discovery Status:
=================
Published

Shanmin Xu
Product: xNotes - Mobile API (Web-Application) 4.5


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Notes v4.5 iOS mobile web-application (wifi).
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests via POST.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` values of the `Upload File` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own 
files with malicious `filename` values in the `upload.action` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. 
The arbitrary file upload execute occcurs in the index file dir listing of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to inject 
the local file upload form request by usage of the `wifi interface` in connection with the vulnerable upload service module.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4. 
Exploitation of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability results in mobile web-application or device compromise.

Request Method(s):
					[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] Upload

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
					[+] File Dir Index Listing


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The file include web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1.  Install the vulnerable ios web-application to your ios device
2.  Start the application
3.  Open the file transfer button on the buttom left
4.  Open the called IP in a web-browser
5.  Surf to the Upload function and choose a random test image/picture
6.  Start a http session tamper to exploit the followup POSt method request
7.  Inject your local file request to the filename value for exploitation
8.  Continue the request
9.  The local file include issue executes in the filename value in the next step
10. Successful reproduce of the local file include vulnerability!
