Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL Affecting Cisco Products: May 2016 

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160504-openssl

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 May 04 19:30  GMT (UTC)

Summary
=======

On May 3, 2016, the OpenSSL Software Foundation released a security advisory that included six vulnerabilities. Out of the six vulnerabilities disclosed, four of them may cause a memory corruption or excessive memory usage, one could allow a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server supports AES-NI, and, lastly, one is specific to a product performing an operation with Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) encoding.

Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the OpenSSL package affected by one or more vulnerabilities.

This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.
