RESOLUTION

HPE has provided the following instructions to mitigate these vulnerabilities
in the OVA version of HPE VAN SDN Controller:

Follow these steps to update the version of OpenSSL in the controller, which
reduces the risk of these vulnerabilities:

If a proxy is configured to access the Internet:

Edit the "apt.conf" file found in the /etc/apt directory.
Add the http proxy setting by adding a line similar to the following:

Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy-ip:proxy-port/";

Create and Edit the sources.list file in the /etc/apt directory:

Add the line: deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib
non-free

Run updates for apt-get indexes:

sudo apt-get update

Run apt-get upgrade command to upgrade openssl version:

sudo apt-get upgrade openssl

Remove the "sources.list" file from /etc/apt directory.

If a proxy is configured in the first step:

Edit the "apt.conf" file found in the /etc/apt directory.
Remove the http proxy setting by removing the line added in step 1:

Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy-ip:proxy-port/";

Reboot the system to use the newer version of OpenSSL.
