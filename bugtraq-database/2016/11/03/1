Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Routers Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20161102-tl1

Revision: 1.0

For Public Release 2016 November 2 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Transaction Language 1 (TL1) code of Cisco ASR
900 Series routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a reload of, or remotely execute code on, the affected system.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs
incomplete bounds checks on input data. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the TL1 port,
which could cause the device to reload. An exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the
system or cause a reload of the affected system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
