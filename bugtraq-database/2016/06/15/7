Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160615-rv

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 June 15 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and the Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on a targeted system.
 
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of HTTP user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with custom user data. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the affected system, which could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.

Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
