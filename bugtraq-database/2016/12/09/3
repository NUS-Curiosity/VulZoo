Vendor:
================
www.symantec.com



Product:
===================
Symantec VIP Access
Desktop versions prior to 2.2.2


Vulnerability Type:
=======================
Arbitrary DLL Execution



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-6593



Vulnerability Details:
=====================

VIP Access Desktop UI Manager invokes DLLs from the current working folder during startup. A malicious local user can create
specifically modified DLLs to replace the normal product DLLs required during startup.

Then, by redirecting the startup path of the VIP Access Desktop UI Manager the user can cause the VIP Access Desktop
UI Manager to invoke the substituted DLL instead of the required product DLL. Any specifically modified code execution
could be performed with logged-on user privileges, which is normally user-level access in currently supported operating systems.
Ultimately, this problem is caused by a failure to properly validate required product DLLs during start-up.

This could result in a local user being able to manipulate VIP Access Desktop to load and execute an arbitrary DLL of the userï¿½s
choice with user-level privileges.
