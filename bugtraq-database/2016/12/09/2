         CVE Name       

    Description  The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for     
                 whitespace when attempting to strip the content between a    
                 SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than           
                 following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal  
                 tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as   
                 if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as       
                                                                              
                 Contact\x01:                                                 
                                                                              
                 will be seen as a valid Contact header.                      
                                                                              
                 This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is        
                 placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such   
                 a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To         
                 headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into    
                 Asterisk without authentication since it believes the        
                 request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the     
                 bug described above, the request will look like an           
                 out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then        
                 process the request as a new call. The result is that        
                 Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without     
                 any authentication.                                          
                                                                              
                 If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this      
                 issue does not affect you.                                   
                                                                              
                 If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps  
                 track of what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue  
                 does not affect you.                                         
                                                                              
                 If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue   
                 does not affect you.                                         

    Resolution  chan_sip has been patched to only treat spaces and            
                horizontal tabs as whitespace following a header name. This   
                allows for Asterisk and authenticating proxies to view        
                requests the same way
