MSIE 9 IEFRAME CView::EnsureSize use-after-free
===============================================
(MS13-021, CVE-2013-0090)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability
in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this
vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact
or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker
  from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Details
-------
This bug was found back when I had very little knowledge and tools to do
analysis on use-after-free bugs, so I have no details to share. ZDI
revealed that this was a use-after-free vulnerability in their advisory
at http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-13-097/.
