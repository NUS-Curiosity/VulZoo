Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered  in the official New Era Company content management system (2016-Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `id` value of the `details.php` file. Remote attackers are able to execute sql commands by 
injection of malicious statements via GET method request. The vulnerability is located on the application-side and the request 
method to inject/execute is GET. The security vulnerability is a classic order by sql injection in the `id` value. 

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.1.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] details.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The sql injection vulnerability can be patched by implementation of a prepared statement in the details.php GEt method request.
Restrict the id parameter value and disallow usage of special chars and script code tags.
Filter the id value with a separate exception-handling to prevent further sql injeciton attacks and escape.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 8.1)
