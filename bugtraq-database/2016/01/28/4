Vulnerability Laboratory ID (VL-ID):
====================================
1661


Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
6.6


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
DirectPass runs as a local console and browser plug-in but can also sync between multiple PC installations through your Trend Micro account. 
Unlike LastPass 1.72 (free, 5 stars), Dashlane (free, 4.5 stars), and RoboForm Everywhere 7 ($19.95 direct, 4.5 stars), it doesn`t let you 
log in to your saved credentials online. However, it will sync with free DirectPass apps for Android and iPhone. You can also test a free 
edition that manages just five passwords.

DirectPass can export its data for import to another DirectPass installation. It can also import login data from LastPass. Hoping to get a 
fast start, I imported my 200+ LastPass logins. The results were disappointing. For starters, DirectPass doesn`t include the ability to 
categorize sites, so my passwords came through as an unordered list, a very long list. There`s no way to sort the list, and no provision to 
search for a particular login. For some reason, clicking in the list`s scroll bar doesn`t scroll down by one  `page` of items. Instead, it 
scrolls to the corresponding location in the list. Finding any particular login required tediously scrolling through the entire list.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Trend Micro
Product: DirectPass 2016 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A filter bypass issue and corss site request forgery web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Trend Micro Direct Pass web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the input filter to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the online-service.

This persistent vulnerability allows an attacker to execute javascript inside the password hint box! This would allow an attacker to trick a victim to logging 
into an account and then when the victim inserts a wrong master-password, a malicious javascript payload executes. The vulnerability is located on the
application-side and the request method to inject is POST. The validation of the input is wrong encoded and suffers from a persistent vulnerability.

The security risk of the filter bypass and persistent validation vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.1. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged direct-pass user account with restricted access and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation 
of affected or connected application modules.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Password Hint - Input Box

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Direct Pass - Web Application


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1.  Go to https://www.directpass.com and sign-in
2.  Go to https://www.directpass.com/showdb#settings/master
3.  Change your master password
4.  Then insert your master password
5.  Then insert the new master password and confirm master password
6.  For the Hint, right-click on the box and click inspect element and remove maxlength="20" from the code
7.  Then put ur XSS payload into the Hint box!
8.  Logout from your account
9.  Login to your account 
10. Insert your master-password wrong and your  XSS payload executes!
Note: This vulnerability also effects the beta/duplicated version of the website: http://pwm-ibeta.trendmicro.com

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable password hint input.
Disallow special chars and restrict the input via filter exception.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the input validation web vulnerability and filter bypass  in the direct-pass web-application of trend micro is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.6)
