Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-7575

Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent at INRIA discovered a flaw in
the TLS 1.2 protocol which could allow the MD5 hash function to be used
for signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a
TLS handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this flaw to
conduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an
authenticated TLS client.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u19.

For the stable distribution (jessie), the testing distribution (stretch)
and the unstable distribution (sid), this issue was already addressed in
version 1.0.1f-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
