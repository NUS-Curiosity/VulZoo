Package        : prosody
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-1231 CVE-2016-1232

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Prosody, a lightweight
Jabber/XMPP server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:

CVE-2016-1231

    Kim Alvefur discovered a flaw in Prosody's HTTP file-serving module
    that allows it to serve requests outside of the configured public
    root directory. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access
    private files including sensitive data. The default configuration
    does not enable the mod_http_files module and thus is not
    vulnerable.

CVE-2016-1232

    Thijs Alkemade discovered that Prosody's generation of the secret
    token for server-to-server dialback authentication relied upon a
    weak random number generator that was not cryptographically secure.
    A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to guess at
    probable values of the secret key and impersonate the affected
    domain to other servers on the network.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.2-4+deb7u3.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.7-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your prosody packages.
