Affected Product(s):
====================
los818
Product: Content Management System 2016 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official los818 Content Management System (2016-Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The sql injection web vulnerability is located in the id value of the paper name php files. The request method to inject is GET 
and the attack vector of the issue is located on the application-side. Remote attackers are able to inject own sql commands to 
compromise the web-application or connected database management system.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.3.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] [PAPER-NAME].php (dinning.php, productdetail.php, category.php, partners.php, newsdetail.php)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account or user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by usage of a prepared statement in the paper-name file GET method request.
Encode the id value and parse the context to prevent against sql injection or script code injection attacks. Disallow usage of special chars.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerability in the id value of the web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.3)
