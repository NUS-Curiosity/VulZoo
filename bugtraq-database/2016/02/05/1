Package        : krb5
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8629 CVE-2015-8630 CVE-2015-8631
Debian Bug     : 813126 813127 813296

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2015-8629

    It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
    to read beyond the end of allocated memory by sending a string
    without a terminating zero byte. Information leakage may be possible
    for an attacker with permission to modify the database.

CVE-2015-8630

    It was discovered that an authenticated attacker with permission to
    modify a principal entry can cause kadmind to dereference a null
    pointer by supplying a null policy value but including KADM5_POLICY
    in the mask.

CVE-2015-8631

    It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
    to leak memory by supplying a null principal name in a request which
    uses one. Repeating these requests will eventually cause kadmind to
    exhaust all available memory.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u7. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is
not affected by CVE-2015-8630.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
