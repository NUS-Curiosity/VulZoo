Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Prezi is a cloud-based presentation software based on a software as a service model. The product employs a zooming user interface (ZUI), which allows 
users to zoom in and out of their presentation media, and allows users to display and navigate through information within a 2.5D or parallax 3D space 
on the Z-axis. Prezi was officially established in 2009 by co-founders Adam Somlai-Fischer, Peter Halacsy and Peter Arvai.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Prezi
Product: Online Service - Web Application 2016 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An open redirect web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Prezi web-application.
The bug allows remote attackers to execute external urls by the internal web-application requests via client-side.

The vulnerability is located in the GET parameter of the vulnerable `track` module. The vulnerability allows an remote 
attacker to prepare client-side malicious urls to external sources. The request method to execute is GET and the vulnerability is 
located on the application-side of the online-service. The vulnerability is a classic open redirect web vulnerability.

The security risk of the open redirect web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires no privileged user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in client-side redirects to malicious sources or client-side phishing.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] /track

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] URI


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Vulnerability:
Open redirect in the following module:	/track?type=click&enid=[UNIQUE-ID]&&&2003&&&http://EVILURLHERE.com

PoC:
click.prezi.com/track?type=click&enid=ZWFzPTEmbXNpZD0xJmF1aWQ9ODMxNDk0MjImbWFpbGluZ2lkPTM2NzMmbWVzc2FnZWlkPTExNyZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTE0NTAxMzM4Njkmc2VyaWFsPTE2Nzc3NTIzJmVtYWl

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Disallow to request not whitelisted webpages and include a tag filter to the enid to prevent as well.
Restrict and filter the parameter and disallow usage of special chars. Encode the GET request to prevent client-ide script code inject.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side open redirect web vulnerability in the Prezi web-application is estimated as low. (CVSS 3.0)
