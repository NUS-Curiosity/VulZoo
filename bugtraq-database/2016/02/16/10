Debian Bug     : 779587 796105 798316 801691 803927 812441 812445 812455

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in the GNU C Library, eglibc.

The CVE-2015-7547 vulnerability listed below is considered to have
critical impact.

CVE-2014-8121

    Robin Hack discovered that the nss_files database did not
    correctly implement enumeration interleaved with name-based or
    ID-based lookups.  This could cause the enumeration enter an
    endless loop, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2015-1781

    Arjun Shankar discovered that the _r variants of host name
    resolution functions (like gethostbyname_r), when performing DNS
    name resolution, suffered from a buffer overflow if a misaligned
    buffer was supplied by the applications, leading to a crash or,
    potentially, arbitrary code execution.  Most applications are not
    affected by this vulnerability because they use aligned buffers.

CVE-2015-7547

    The Google Security Team and Red Hat discovered that the eglibc
    host name resolver function, getaddrinfo, when processing
    AF_UNSPEC queries (for dual A/AAAA lookups), could mismanage its
    internal buffers, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow and
    arbitrary code execution.  This vulnerability affects most
    applications which perform host name resolution using getaddrinfo,
    including system services.

CVE-2015-8776

    Adam Nielsen discovered that if an invalid separated time value
    is passed to strftime, the strftime function could crash or leak
    information.  Applications normally pass only valid time
    information to strftime; no affected applications are known.

CVE-2015-8777

    Hector Marco-Gisbert reported that LD_POINTER_GUARD was not
    ignored for SUID programs, enabling an unintended bypass of a
    security feature.  This update causes eglibc to always ignore the
    LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable.

CVE-2015-8778

    Szabolcs Nagy reported that the rarely-used hcreate and hcreate_r
    functions did not check the size argument properly, leading to a
    crash (denial of service) for certain arguments.  No impacted
    applications are known at this time.

CVE-2015-8779

    The catopen function contains several unbound stack allocations
    (stack overflows), causing it the crash the process (denial of
    service).  No applications where this issue has a security impact
    are currently known.

The following fixed vulnerabilities currently lack CVE assignment:

    Joseph Myers reported discovered that an integer overflow in the
    strxfrm can lead to heap-based buffer overflow, possibly allowing
    arbitrary code execution.  In addition, a fallback path in strxfrm
    uses an unbounded stack allocation (stack overflow), leading to a
    crash or erroneous application behavior.

    Kostya Serebryany reported that the fnmatch function could skip
    over the terminating NUL character of a malformed pattern, causing
    an application calling fnmatch to crash (denial of service).

    Joseph Myers reported that the IO_wstr_overflow function,
    internally used by wide-oriented character streams, suffered from
    an integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.  On
    GNU/Linux systems, wide-oriented character streams are rarely
    used, and no affected applications are known.

    Andreas Schwab reported a memory leak (memory allocation without a
    matching deallocation) while processing certain DNS answers in
    getaddrinfo, related to the _nss_dns_gethostbyname4_r function.
    This vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.

While it is only necessary to ensure that all processes are not using
the old eglibc anymore, it is recommended to reboot the machines after
applying the security upgrade.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.13-38+deb7u10.

We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.
