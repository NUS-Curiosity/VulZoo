Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Ubiquiti Network
Product: Ubnt Community - Web Application (Online Service) 2016 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Ubiquiti Networks airCRM online service web-application.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script code to the application-side of the affected application module.

The vulnerabilites are located in the input Name fields in the Billing Section. Remote attackers with low privilege web-application user accounts are 
able to inject own malicious script code via POST method request. The vulnerability is located to the application-side of the vulnerable service.

The security risk of the application-side cross site vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious source 
and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
						[+] POST

Vulnerable Service(s):
						[+] aircrm.ubnt.com
						
Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] Billings
						
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] Business Name 
						[+] Residental First Name
						[+] Residental Last  Name


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The security vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Go to the subscriber module

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable input fields. Restrict the input and disallow usage of special chars.
Filter and setup a secure exception handling that prevents the persistent execution in the output location.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of application-side input validation web vulnerability in the frontend of the airCRM web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.8)
