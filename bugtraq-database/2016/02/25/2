RatioSec Research Security Advisory RS-2016-001

JSN PowerAdmin Joomla! Extension Remote Command Execution Via CSRF and
XSS vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------------------

Product: JSN PowerAdmin Joomla! Extension
Vendor: JoomlaShine.com
Tested Versions: 2.3.0
Other Vulnerable Versions: Prior versions may also be affected
Vendor Notification: 28th January, 2016
Advisory Publication: 24th February, 2016
CVE Reference: Pending
RatioSec Advisory Reference: RS-2016-001
Risk Level: High
CVSSv3 Base Score: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

---------------------------------------------------------

RatioSec Research has discovered two cross-site request forgery and
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in JSN PowerAdmin
Joomla! Extension which can be exploited, respectively, to upload PHP
files and run arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
session in context of the affected web site.

1) The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP
requests without performing proper checks to verify the requests
validity. An authenticated user's browser can be forced to upload PHP
files via the extension installer and subsequently execute arbitrary
commands with the web server privileges by tricking the user into
visiting a malicious web site.

2) Input passed to `identified_name` GET parameter when `package` is
set, `option` is set to `com_poweradmin`, `view` is set to
`installer`, and `task` is set to `installer.install` in
`/administrator/index.php` is not properly sanitised before being
reflected. This can be exploited to run arbitrary HTML and script code
in a user's browser session in context of the affected web site.
