Package        : xymon
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2054 CVE-2016-2055 CVE-2016-2056 CVE-2016-2057 
                 CVE-2016-2058

Markus Krell discovered that xymon, a network- and
applications-monitoring system, was vulnerable to the following
security issues:

CVE-2016-2054

  The incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the "config"
  command can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in
  denial of service (via application crash) or remote code execution.

CVE-2016-2055

  The incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the "config"
  command can lead to an information leak by serving sensitive
  configuration files to a remote user.

CVE-2016-2056

  The commands handling password management do not properly validate
  user-supplied input, and are thus vulnerable to shell command
  injection by a remote user.

CVE-2016-2057

  Incorrect permissions on an internal queuing system allow a user
  with a local account on the xymon master server to bypass all
  network-based access control lists, and thus inject messages
  directly into xymon.

CVE-2016-2058

  Incorrect escaping of user-supplied input in status webpages can
  be used to trigger reflected cross-site scripting attacks.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.17-6+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xymon packages.
