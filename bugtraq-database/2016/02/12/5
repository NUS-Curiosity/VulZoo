Subject: CVE-2015-0061 and CVE-2015-0063 (MS16-009/MS16-011)

Hello everyone,

I've recently released examples on twitter of how to trigger two
security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer. These issue
were discovered last year and reported to Microsoft through ZDI.
Microsoft release security updates to address these issues last Tuesday.

CVE-2016-0061:

CVE-2016-0063:
https://twitter.com/berendjanwever/status/697818121835581441

Both were found through fuzzing inspired by Michal Zalewski's cross_fuzz

Cheers,
