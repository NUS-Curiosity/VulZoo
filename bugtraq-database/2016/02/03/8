Technical Details & Description:
================================
An open redirect web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SimpleView CRM web-application.
The bug allows remote attackers to execute external urls by the internal web-application requests via client-side.

The vulnerability is located in the `redirect` parameter of the vulnerable `./crm/track/` module. The vulnerability allows an remote 
attacker to prepare client-side malicious urls to external sources. The request method to execute is GET and the vulnerability is 
located on the application-side of the online-service. The vulnerability is a classic open redirect web vulnerability.

The security risk of the open redirect web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires no privileged user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in client-side redirects to malicious sources or client-side phishing.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] ./crm/track/

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] redirect


Proof of Concept (PoC):
