Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Presse Portal (DPA) online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerabilities are located in the `id` and `city` values of the `iframe.htx` `userfeed.htx` `userchoosefeed.htx` `change_profile.htx` files. 
Remote attackers are able to execute own sql commands by manipulation of the GET or POST method request with the vulnerable id and city parameters. 
The request method to inject the sql command is GET or POST and the issue is located on the application-side of the `./services/content/` module. 
The sql vulnerability allows remote attackers to compromise the database management system that is connected to the web-application. 3 oft the issues 
require a low privileged user account. The other two issues are POST request sql injections vulnerabilities.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 9.1.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
						[+] GET & POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] ./services/content/
						[+] ./services/


Vulnerable File(s):
						[+] iframe.htx
						[+] userfeed.htx
						[+] userchoosefeed.htx
						[+] change_profile.htx
						[+] userindex.htx

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] id
						[+] city
						[+] website_desc


1.2
Multiple client-side cross site scripting web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Presse Portal (DPA) online service web-application.
A vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script codes on the client-side to compromise application to browser requests.

The vulnerability is located in the `page` value of the `location_search.php` file. Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script codes to 
the client-side of the affected web-application. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is client-side. The attacker inject the 
payload in the page value to execute the code in the results page of the location search module. 

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.3. 
Exploitation of the non-persistent web vulnerability requires a no privilege web-application user account and only low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in session hijacking, persistent phishings attacks, persistent external redirect and malware loads or 
persistent manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
					[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] ./katalog/

Vulnerable File(s):
					[+] katalog.htx
					[+] -6694

Affected Parameter(s):
					[+] action=showDate&date=
					[+] action=showChar&char=


Proof of Concept (PoC):
