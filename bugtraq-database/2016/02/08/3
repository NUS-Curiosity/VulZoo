Subject: [CVE-2016-0602, CVE-2016-0603] Executable installers are vulnerable^WEVIL (case 24): Oracle Java 6/7/8 SE and VirtualBox

Hi @ll,

the installers or Oracle's Java 6/7/8 for Windows and VirtualBox for
Windows load and execute several DLLs from their "application directory".

* The online installer jxpiinstall.exe:
  UXTheme.dll and RASAdHlp.dll plus
  (on Windows XP) SetupAPI.dll, HNetCfg.dll and XPSP2Res.dll
  (on Windows Vista and above) ProfAPI.dll, Secur32.dll, NTMarta.dll
  and Version.dll

* The offline installer jre-8u66-windows-i586.exe:
  UXTheme.dll, RASAdHlp.dll, NTMarta.dll, Secur32.dll, WinHTTP.dll,
  NetUtils.dll, ProfAPI.dll and WindowsCodecs.dll

* VirtualBox-5.0.12-104815-Win.exe:
  UXTheme.dll, MSIHnd.dll and MSI.dll plus
  (on Windows XP) SFC_OS.dll, ClbCatQ.dll, XPSP2Res.dll, WS2_32.dll
  and WS2Help.dll
  (on Windows 7) PropSys.dll, ProfAPI.dll and DWMAPI.dll


For software downloaded with a web browser the application
directory is typically the user's "Downloads" directory: see

<http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2012/02/downloads-folder-binary-planting.html>
and <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/134> for
"prior art" about this well-known and well-documented vulnerability.


Oracle published an advisory and new installers for Java SE today:

Oracle published updated versions of VirtualBox on 2019-01-19:
