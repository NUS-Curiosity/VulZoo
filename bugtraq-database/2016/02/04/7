         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  If no UDPTL packets are lost there is no problem. However,   
                 a lost packet causes Asterisk to use the available error     
                 correcting redundancy packets. If those redundancy packets   
                 have zero length then Asterisk uses an uninitialized buffer  
                 pointer and length value which can cause invalid memory      
                 accesses later when the packet is copied.                    

    Resolution  Upgrade to a released version with the fix incorporated or    
                apply patch.
