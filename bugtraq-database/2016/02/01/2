Package        : privoxy
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-1982 CVE-2016-1983

It was discovered that privoxy, a web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities, contained invalid reads that could enable a remote
attacker to crash the application, thus causing a Denial of Service.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.19-2+deb7u3.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.21-7+deb8u1.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 3.0.24-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your privoxy packages.
