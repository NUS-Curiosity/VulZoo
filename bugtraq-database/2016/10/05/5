Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco NX-OS Software Malformed DHCPv4 Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20161005-dhcp2

Revision: 1.0

For Public Release: 2016 October 5 16:00  GMT

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======
A vulnerability in the implementation of the DHCPv4 relay agent in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of malformed DHCPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv4 packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DHCP process or device to crash.

This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 packets only. The vulnerability can be triggered by malformed DHCP packets processed by a DHCP relay agent listening on the device, using the IPv4 broadcast address or IPv4 unicast address of any interface configured on a device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
