Template injection in various resources - CVE-2019-11581

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, according
to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The scale allows us to
rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.
This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT
environment.


Description:

There was a server-side template injection vulnerability in Jira Server and Data
Center, in the ContactAdministrators and the SendBulkMail actions. For this
issue to be exploitable at least one of the following conditions must be met:
- - an SMTP server has been configured in Jira and the Contact
Administrators Form
is enabled; or
- - an SMTP server has been configured in Jira and an attacker has `JIRA
Administrators` access.
In the first case, where the Contact Administrators Form is enabled, attackers
are able to exploit this issue without authentication. In the second case,
attackers with `JIRA Administrators` access can exploit this issue. In either
case, successful exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to remotely
execute code on systems that run a vulnerable version of Jira Server or Data
Center.
Versions of Jira Server and Data Center starting with version 7.0.0 before
7.6.14 (the fixed version for 7.6.x), from version 7.7.0 before 7.13.5 (the
fixed version for 7.13.x), from version 8.0.0 before 8.0.3 (the fixed version
for 8.0.x), from version 8.1.0 before 8.1.2 (the fixed version for 8.1.x), and
from version 8.2.0 before 8.2.3 (the fixed version for 8.2.x) are affected by
this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at:
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-69532 .
