Subject: DASAN H665 has vendor backdoor built into BusyBoxâ€™s /bin/login

Hi!

DASAN H665 has vendor backdoor built into BusyBox /bin/login. Account

without any password, at least for administration interface documented
in H665 Quick Guide (subnet 192.168.55.0/24 on LAN interface).

$ telnet 192.168.55.1
Trying 192.168.55.1...
Connected to 192.168.55.1.
