---------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Affected Versions:

All versions prior to 7.9.4.0 and 7.11.0.0.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located within the SOAP API, specifically into the
"portal_get_related_notes()" SOAP function. User input passed through the
"order_by" parameter isnâ€™t properly sanitized before being used to construct
an "ORDER BY" clause of a SQL query from within the "get_notes_in_contacts()"

to e.g. read sensitive data from the database through time-based SQL injection attacks.
