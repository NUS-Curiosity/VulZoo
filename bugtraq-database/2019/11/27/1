Subject: Re: SEC Consult SA-20191125-0 :: FortiGuard XOR Encryption in
 Multiple Fortinet Products

Hi,

we received incorrect version information during the coordination phase thus our initial advisory stated that FortiOS
v6.0.7 fixes the issue. Fortinet has just now confirmed that only v6.2.0 includes the patch. See their advisory:
