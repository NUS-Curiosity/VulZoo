Debian Bug     : 920302 920303

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTP server.

CVE-2018-17189

    Gal Goldshtein of F5 Networks discovered a denial of service
    vulnerability in mod_http2. By sending malformed requests, the
    http/2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server
    thread cleaning up incoming data, resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2018-17199

    Diego Angulo from ImExHS discovered that mod_session_cookie does not
    respect expiry time.

CVE-2019-0196

    Craig Young discovered that the http/2 request handling in mod_http2
    could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when
    determining the method of a request and thus process the request
    incorrectly.

CVE-2019-0211

    Charles Fol discovered a privilege escalation from the
    less-privileged child process to the parent process running as root.

CVE-2019-0217

    A race condition in mod_auth_digest when running in a threaded
    server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate
    using another username, bypassing configured access control
    restrictions. The issue was discovered by Simon Kappel.

CVE-2019-0220

    Bernhard Lorenz of Alpha Strike Labs GmbH reported that URL
    normalizations were inconsistently handled. When the path component
    of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'),
    directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for
    duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers
    processing will implicitly collapse them.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.25-3+deb9u7.

This update also contains bug fixes that were scheduled for inclusion in the
next stable point release. This includes a fix for a regression caused by a
security fix in version 2.4.25-3+deb9u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

tracker page at: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache2
