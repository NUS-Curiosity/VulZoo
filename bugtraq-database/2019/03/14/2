Subject: IPv6 Security for IPv4 Engineers

Folks,

It is often argued that IPv4 practices should be forgotten when
deploying IPv6, as after all IPv6 is a different protocol! But we think
years of IPv4 operational experience should be leveraged as much as
possible.

So we are publishing IPv6 Security for IPv4 Engineers as a roadmap to
IPv6 security that is specifically aimed at IPv4 engineers and operators.

Rather than describing IPv6 in an isolated manner, it aims to re-use as
much of the existing IPv4 knowledge and experience as possible, by
highlighting the security issues that affect both protocols in the same
manner, and those that are new or different for the IPv6 protocol suite.
Additionally, it discusses the security implications arising from the
co-existence of the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols.

The document is available at:

Comments are always welcome. And if you think we've missed something or
the like, please drop me en email -- the document can always be revised.

* Personal plug-ins:

 + If you happen to be in Heidelberg next week
(https://www.troopers.de/troopers19/ngi/), there's an opportunity to
chat about IPv6 security.

 + I'll be doing IPv6 security training in Paris (France) next June:

Thanks!

Cheers,
