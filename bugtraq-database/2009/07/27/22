Subject: RE: computer crime statistics


You probably will have more look searching databases provided by your local
library. If your local University has a data librarian they might be able to
help find sources of data (if they even exist). A reference librarian can
show you how to search various databases of scholarly research to see if
anyone has done any surveys etc. and published their findings.  I'd start
with IEEE Explore and the ACM Digital Library. The National Criminal Justice
Reference Service *might* be able to provide some guidance as well.
