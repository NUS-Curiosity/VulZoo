Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in dhclient as included in the ISC DHCP
implementation allows for the remote execution of arbitrary code with
root privileges.

Background
==========

ISC DHCP is the reference implementation of the Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol as specified in RFC 2131.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/dhcp     < 3.1.1-r1                          >= 3.1.1-r1

Description
===========

The Mandriva Linux Engineering Team has reported a stack-based buffer
overflow in the subnet-mask handling of dhclient.

Impact
======

A remote attacker might set up a rogue DHCP server in a victim's local
network, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with root
privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ISC DHCP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/dhcp-3.1.1-r1"
