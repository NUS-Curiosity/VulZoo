Hi Michal,

Interesting tidbit:
The W3C DOM specifies the select.length attribute to be *read only*.
Yet   (all)  browsers  have  implemented  it  allowing to write to it. I
am not sure what use that has (?) but one thing is sure, they failed
to add a limit, the W3C didn't, but that's because it was never meant
to be written to in the first place.
