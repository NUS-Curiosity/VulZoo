Hi Cru3l.b0y

We've been seeing you keep mistakenly assuming RFI for constant variables.
For next releases of your great bug hunting journey, please note:

1. Constant variables are usually written Capital letter such as
ABSPATH, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST
2. Programmers define them in config file in advance/earlier with
define function like define( ABSPATH, ...) , define(DB_USER,...)

If this finding is automatically invoked by your own written audit
scripts, please fix it.

No offense, actually. We appreciate it.
