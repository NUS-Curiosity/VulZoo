...which happens to be covered here for half a year or so:
http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Redirection_restrictions

I can't see how this could be a vulnerability per se, although
changing the behavior offers an additional, if small, degree of
protection in case of security lapses in web applications, so it's a
reasonable improvement.
