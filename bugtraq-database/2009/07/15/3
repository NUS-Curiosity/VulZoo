For the record (and again I hope I'm not wasting your time by
misunderstanding the problem), I can report that FF 3.5 (en-GB
version) running on Win2K SP4+ (Workstation), with the extensions
Noscript, Oldbar, JRE6, and British dictionary, is unaffected by the
PoC for TZO-26-2009 that you published here in May [1].  No CPU
slugging, no disk activity, browser stays fully responsive, along with
rest of system.

But nor do I see any red circle generated by the HTML  :)

I could guess from some statements on the web ([3]) that FF's SVG
doesn't work on Windows 2000 at all, except that I have no problem
viewing this :

At the end of Mozilla bug 393832 [2] (of which your own bug 465615 was
a duplicate) there is a comment dated 13.July.2009 stating a patch for
the SVGLength code was added, but I downloaded my FF 3.5 on 9.July, so
that can't be relevant.

Curious ... I would have thought this one would be OS-agnostic.
