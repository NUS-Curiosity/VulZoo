 Arbitrary Pointer Dereference Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

iDefense Security Advisory 07.14.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 14, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Office Publisher is a desktop publishing application. For more
information, please visit following website:

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an arbitrary pointer dereference vulnerability in
version 2007 of Microsoft Corp.'s Publisher could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code as the user running Publisher.

This vulnerability exists in PUBCONV.DLL module in Microsoft Publisher
2007. PUBCONV.DLL module is responsible for converting legacy format
Publisher files (.pub) created by older version of Publisher into the
Publisher 2007 format. A programming error causes that module to
dereference the arbitrary attacker-controlled value as the address of a
table of function pointers. This vulnerability allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the affected system within the security context of
the local user running Publisher. Thus, the level of compromise would
depend upon the security context of that user. An attacker would need
to craft a malicious file and either host it on a website or send it as
an attachment in an e-mail. The attacker would then need to persuade the
local user to open it. There is no way an attacker can force
exploitation. Further, this vulnerability exists only in Microsoft
Publisher 2007, further minimizing the risk of exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense comfired PUBCONV.DLL (version 12.0.6311.5000) in Microsoft
Office Publisher 2007 is vulnerable. Microsoft Office Publisher 2000,
2002 and 2003 do not appear to be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Deny access to the publish converter by changing the ACLs on the file.
This can be accomplished as follows:

  cacls \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\pubconv.dll /d everyone

Note: By doing so, Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 may not open previous
versions of Publisher documents.
