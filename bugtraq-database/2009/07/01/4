Subject: radware AppWall Web Application Firewall: Source code disclosure on management interface


Security Advisory
---------------------------------------
Vulnerable Software: 	radware AppWall Web Application Firewall

Vulnerability Description
---------------------------------------
The radware AppWall Web Application Firewall operates as a reverse proxy
between the clients and the web server to be protected. All HTTP
requests are checked before being forwarded to the web server. The
system can be administered via a seperate management interface which is
normally not accessible for external users. The web interface is
realised using the PHP programming language. Some of the functionality
is stored in include files and embedded when needed. The files have a
*.inc extension and are not interpreted by the web server. A
user/attacker with access to the web management interface can therefore
access parts of the product source code by requesting the included files
directly.


Proof of Conept
---------------------------------------
The following example requests reveal product source code enabling an
attacker to search for further implementation vulnerabilities:
https://appwall/Management/funcs.inc
https://appwall/Management/defines.inc
https://appwall/Management/msg.inc


Vulnerable Versions
---------------------------------------
The tested version was Gateway Version 4.6.0.2 / AppWall Version
1.0.2.6. Prior versions are also likely to be vulnerable.


Patch
---------------------------------------
Currently we are not aware of any patch or update available.
