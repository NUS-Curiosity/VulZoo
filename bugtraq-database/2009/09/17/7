Vendor description:
-------------------
I-Load is an ASP.NET component explicitly created to manage image uploading
within ASP.NET applications. Unlike other image manipulation libraries,
I-Load uses a sophisticated graphical interface which allows the uploading,
resizing, cropping and rotating of photos.

source: http://i-load.radactive.com/en/documentation/

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The I-Load component contains multiple vulnerabilities which are described
below.

* Path Disclosure:
******************

The WebCoreModule.ashx script prints the absolute path of the folder 
name, where
images are saved to, in some requests and responses. This can help an 
attacker
with the exploitation of the also existing file disclosure vulnerability.

* Cross Site Scripting:
***********************

Most of the parameters used by WebcodeModule.ashx start with two 
underscores
"__" which disables the build-in ASP.NET "Anti Cross Site Scripting"
functionality. Some parameters are not sufficiently validated and can be
exploited to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the response.


* File Disclosure:
******************

WebCoreModule.ashx can be exploited by the means of path traversal to read
arbitrary files on the server given that the file permissions allow it. An
attacker is able to gain sensitive data such as configuration files
(e.g. Web.config), the whole source code of the application or other 
sensitive
data on the server.


* Arbitrary File Upload:
************************

It is potentially possible to upload an arbitrary file using the I-Load
Webcontrol with a user-defined file extension. The filename itself is
dynamically generated, but it is possible to reproduce that parameter in
advance. The file remains on the server for a very short period of time.
Nevertheless, during this time frame it could be possible to execute 
that file
and thus compromise the affected server.

Proof of Concept:
-----------------
SEC Consult will not release proof of concept exploits to the public.

Vulnerable versions:
--------------------
RADactive I-Load 2008.2.4.0

Prior versions are most likely also vulnerable.

Solution:
---------
Immediately upgrade to version 2008.2.5.0 which is available at
http://i-load.radactive.com/en/download/.
