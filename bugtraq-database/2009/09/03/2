Subject: FRHACK ITSec Conf DVDs and Live Streams

Hi list,

That's the final countdown for FRHACK 01, IT Security Conference, by
hackers - for hackers, France, September 7th-8th 2009.
http://www.frhack.org

Due to demand, the FRHACK staff decided to provide DVDs and a limited
amount of accounts to assist FRHACK via live streams.
So, if you can't travel to FRHACK, please register asap on:
http://www.mediatux.com/purchasefrhack.php

Notes:
- tracks #1 will be available for sure, tracks #2 should be but we can't
confirm it today
- some talks will be freely available for download after FRHACK, like
mine and Richard Stallman's one.

Happy Hacking!
/JA
