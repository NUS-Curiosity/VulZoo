Subject: 3rd party patch for XP for MS09-048?

Hello All:

Given that M$ has officially shot-down all current Windows XP users by not
issuing a patch for a DoS level issue, I'm now curious to find out whether
or not any brave souls out there are already working or willing to work on
an open-source patch to remediate the issue within XP.

I realize some of you might be tempted to relay the M$ BS about "not being
feasible because it's a lot of work" rhetoric... I would just like to hear
the thoughts of the true experts subscribed to these lists :)

No harm in that is there?
