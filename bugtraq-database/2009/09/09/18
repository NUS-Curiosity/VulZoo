Synopsis
========

Multiple insecure temporary file usage issues have been reported in
LMBench, allowing for symlink attacks.

Background
==========

LMBench is a suite of simple, portable benchmarks for UNIX platforms.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-benchmarks/lmbench        <= 3                    Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Dmitry E. Oboukhov reported that the rccs and STUFF scripts do not
handle "/tmp/sdiff.#####" temporary files securely. NOTE: There might
be further occurances of insecure temporary file usage.

Impact
======

A local attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary
files with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

LMBench has been removed from Portage. We recommend that users unmerge
LMBench:

    # emerge --unmerge app-benchmarks/lmbench

References
==========
