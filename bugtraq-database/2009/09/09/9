Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows in the Apache Portable Runtime and its
Utility Library might allow for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Apache Portable Runtime (aka APR) provides a set of APIs for
creating platform-independent applications. The Apache Portable Runtime
Utility Library (aka APR-Util) provides an interface to functionality
such as XML parsing, string matching and databases connections.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/apr            < 1.3.8                          >= 1.3.8
  2  dev-libs/apr-util       < 1.3.9                          >= 1.3.9
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Matt Lewis reported multiple Integer overflows in the apr_rmm_malloc(),
apr_rmm_calloc(), and apr_rmm_realloc() functions in misc/apr_rmm.c of
APR-Util and in memory/unix/apr_pools.c of APR, both occurring when
aligning memory blocks.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious server
with software that uses the APR or act as a malicious client to a
server that uses the APR (such as Subversion or Apache servers),
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache Portable Runtime users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =dev-libs/apr-1.3.8

All APR Utility Library users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =dev-libs/apr-util-1.3.9
