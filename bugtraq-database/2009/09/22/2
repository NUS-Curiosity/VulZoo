TOORCON 11 PRELIMINARY LINEUP ANNOUNCED!

We're proud to announce our preliminary lineup for ToorCon this year and especially our keynote, Vernor Vinge. Vernor is a prolific science fiction novel writer and is best known for his Hugo Award-winning novels and novellas A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), A Deepness in the Sky (1999), Rainbows End (2006), Fast Times at Fairmont High (2002) and The Cookie Monster (2004), as well as for his 1993 essay "The Coming Technological Singularity", in which he argues that exponential growth in technology will reach a point beyond which we cannot even speculate about the consequences.

WORKSHOPS

Over the past few years, ToorCon has been known for providing hands-on workshops which focus on teaching a wide range of skills in a small classroom environment. The main goal is to teach the basics and provide the audience with the tools to expand on their knowledge on their own after the 2-day workshop is over. We have an exciting list of workshops to choose from this year:

Software Defined Radio Workshop
Instructor: Michael Ossman
Includes: Use of a USRP (If you would like a USRP kit included in your training cost, please contact us) 
Software Defined Radio (SDR) techniques are rapidly becoming essential to all areas of wireless security research. Recent attacks on Bluetooth, GSM, wired and wireless keyboards, implantable medical devices, RFID, and more have been made possible by software radio. A combination of lectures, software exercises, and over-the-air projects, this workshop will provide the hands-on background in digital signal processing and radio engineering required to apply software radio techniques to practical hacking of diverse wireless systems. If you have experience developing software but lack experience with radio technology and digital signal processing, this workshop is for you.

Application Security Workshop
Instructor: Jared DeMott
Includes: CD with VMWare images and printed training materials
There are four technical skills required by security researchers, software quality assurance engineers, or developers concerned about security: Source code auditing, fuzzing, reverse engineering, and exploitation.  All these skills and more are covered.  C/C++ code has been plagued by security errors resulting from memory corruption for a long time.  Problematic code is discussed and searched for in lectures and labs, with WebGoat introduced as well.  Fuzzing is a topic book author DeMott knows about well.  Mutation file fuzzing and framework definition construction (Sulley and Peach) are just some of the lecture and lab topics.  When it comes to reversing C/C++ (Java and others are briefly discussed) IDA pro is the tool of choice.  Deep usage of this tool is covered in lecture and lab.  Exploitation discussions and labs are the exciting final component.  Youï¿½ll enjoy exploiting BSD local programs to Vista browsers using the latest techniques.

Web and Cloud Application Security Workshop
Instructor: Andre Gironda
Includes: Printed workbook, Build/setup/use of a virtual infrastructure
This cloud-web application security workshop covers web applications in various virtual infrastructures, primarily focused on defense, compliance, and incident response. First, we'll identify applications as if they had already been attacked. Then, we'll come up with a risk management plan based on incident data, compliance/regulations, as well as data classifications. We'll look at full-knowledge verification using web server configuration and content files, in addition to runtime and source code verification. We'll go over the various implications of pen-testing cloud-web applications. This will include a thorough look at the strengths and weaknesses of web application firewalls and application hardening practices. Finally, we'll perform mock verifications and discuss partnering with application developers.

Applied Physical Security - Lockpicking and Safecracking
Instructor: datagram
Includes: 1 lockpicking kit, 1 handcuff key, 1 practice deadbolt, 1 practice padlock
This course focuses on learning and applying techniques of lockpicking, key bumping, impressioning, decoding, bypass, and safe cracking against a variety of real world locks and safes. Common lock designs are examined for various weaknesses that allow different methods of attack, some of which are extremely fast and easy to perform. High security locks will also be examined so attendees can learn to spot good locks from bad locks when shopping for access control devices.


DEEP KNOWLEDGE SEMINARS

Once again we are providing an additional day of deep knowledge seminars focused on addressing the growing corporate security issues in a small classroom environment that encourages discussion and interaction with the instructors. Here are a couple topics that have been preliminarily accepted for the Seminars:

Wes Brown
Building and Using an Automated Malware Analysis Pipeline

Robert Zigweid
Threat Modeling: Learn to Optimize Your Security Budget
