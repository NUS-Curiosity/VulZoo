Subject: International Hacking & Security Conference "POC2009" and Call
 for Paper

The 4th international hacking and security conference "POC2009" 
by hackers will be held in Seoul, Korea on November 5 ~ 6. 
'POC' means �Power of Community�. We believe that the power of 
community can make the world safer. POC doesn�t pursue money. 
So we are free to show real hacking and security. 
POC2009 hates just theoretical discussion. 
POC2009 concentrates on technical and creative discussion and 
will show real hacking. POC2009 believes that showing talks much more 
than just speaking.


In POC2009, some speakers will open 0-days. 
And new attack techniques will be introduced.
New speakers are being added.  
Now, the decided speakers are from Korea, China, Spain,etc. 

This year, the Reverse Engineering Contest will be held 
from October 5 to October 9. 
The winner can be a speaker of POC2009. 
He can also enjoy the privilege of POC2009 speaker.
