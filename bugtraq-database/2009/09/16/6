 11a/b/g Poe Access Point

Hi Yossi,

Are you doing something funky with your IP address, e.g., NAT'ed/short DHCP
lease?  The reason I ask is because in 2008, Adrian Pastor stated
authentication in the 3Com Wireless 8760 was linked to the source IP
address [1].  It may well be the case (as you have discovered) that it
allows arbitrary IP addresses to access the config once an administrator
has authentication... However, I just wanted to hit this badboy up incase
there was some confusion.

Cheers,

Tom
