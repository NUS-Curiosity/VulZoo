Subject: RE: [Full-disclosure] 3rd party patch for XP for MS09-048?

P.S.

Anyone check to see if the default "XP Mode" VM you get for free with Win7 hyperv is vulnerable and what the implications are for a host running an XP vm that get's DoS'd are?  

I get the whole "XP code to too old to care" bit, but it seems odd to take that "old code" and re-market it around compatibility and re-distribute it with free downloads for Win7 while saying "we won't patch old code."
