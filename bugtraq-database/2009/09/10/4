Subject: SecurityTubeCon CFP, Venue: Cyberspace!

Dear All,

SecurityTube.net is pleased to announce the CFP for SecurityTubeCon, the 
first hacker conference, to be held completely online!

SecurityTubeCon is aimed at democratizing hacker conferences by allowing 
any researcher, regardless of his physical location, to share his work 
with the community. Unlike other Cons we will not *accept / reject* 
speakers. If you have something interesting to share, you WILL be heard. 
The idea behind SecurityTubeCon is not to pass judgments on your work, 
instead, it aims at providing a platform for knowledge exchange.

Once speakers send in their talk abstracts, we will put it online for 
the community members to decide which talks they want to attend. On the 
day of the conference, speakers will broadcast their talks using 
screencasting software and the interested participants will tune in. The 
participants will use IRC / chat rooms to ask questions to the speakers 
during the talks.

What else is unique about SecurityTubeCon?

a. This conference will be held completely online!
b. Location No Barrier - speak / attend SecurityTubeCon from your bedroom :)
c. Language No Barrier - though we would recommend English as the 
preferred language so you can address a global audience, feel free to 
speak in the language you are most comfortable with
d. $0 is the conference registration fees - absolutely free
