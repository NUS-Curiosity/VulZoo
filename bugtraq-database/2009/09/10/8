-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of malformed FlashPix (.fpx)
files. While parsing the SectorShift and cSectFat fields from the
header, the application will multiply 2 user-controlled 32-bit values
and utilize this for an allocation. If the result of the multiplication
is greater than 32bits, the application will allocate an undersized heap
chunk. Later, the application will copy file data directly into this
buffer leading to a buffer overflow which can allow for code execution
under the context of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
