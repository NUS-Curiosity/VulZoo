Alex, nice work. Thank you for sharing it with us.

I'd recommend taking a look at Ilja van Sprundel's work with regular 
expression bugs in his Unusual bugs presentation.
... Where he played a bit with Google Code Search back in 2007, I think. 
He helped Google out by giving them his research, of course.

I found two versions online:
http://www.ruxcon.org.au/files/2006/unusual_bugs.pdf
http://www.slideshare.net/amiable_indian/unusual-bugs

Ilja and I later discussed creating a real regex fuzzer to discover 
vulnerabilities, but I at least never had the time to play with it. He 
might have, I am CC:ing him.

My best to Adar,
