Subject: [scip_Advisory 4021] IBM Lotus Notes 8.5 RSS Widget Privilege Escalation

IBM Lotus Notes 8.5 RSS Widget Privilege Escalation

scip AG Vulnerability ID 4021 (09/08/2009)
http://www.scip.ch/?vuldb.4021

I. INTRODUCTION

Lotus Notes is a client-server, collaborative application developed and
sold by IBM Software Group.

More information is available on the official product web site at the
following URL:

http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/notes/

II. DESCRIPTION

Marc Ruef at scip AG found a design vulnerability in the current Release
8.5.

The product provides some widgets which can be added and enabled by the
user. One of those widgets provide a simple RSS reader.

This reader downloads the RSS file, extracts the items and saves them
locally as HTML files.

The interpretation and display of the RSS items is handled by the
Internet Explorer regarding the applied security zone.

III. EXPLOITATION

No exploitation is required. A malicious RSS feed may contain script
data or embedded objects.

IV. IMPACT

The RSS items are handled like web documents which introduces the
possibility of running script code or to embed multimedia objects (e.g.
Flash or movies).

Because locally saved files run in the Local Zone of the Internet
Explorer some privilege escalation is possible.

V. DETECTION

It may be possible to identify malicious RSS feeds if they contain
script code or embedded objects.

VI. SOLUTION

IBM has been informed immediately. They are able to address this
vulnerability with a hotfix.

VII. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor verified the existence of the issue and addressed it as soon
as possible with a hotfix. Unfortunately most of the communication
bypassed us and were forced to ask for the current status several times.
Our last request of the current status at 08/24/2009 were unanswered.
