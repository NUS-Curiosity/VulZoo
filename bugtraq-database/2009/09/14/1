The referenced web page is titled, "ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial
of Service) Revisited". The authors cite work as early as 2003 in
their paper.

In my humble opinion, the novelty is that Checkermax, a firm which
specializes in source code analysis, may be staging a tool to help
solve or alleviate the problem. At minimum, the firm has added to the
body of knowledge.

If you've ever had the pleasure of working behind someone who thinks
K&R terseness is cool, you will welcome any and all tools to perform
static and dynamic analysis. These folks live in a fantasy world where
function calls do not fail and bad guys do not exist.
