Synopsis
========

A remotely exploitable off-by-one error leading to a heap overflow was
found in irssi which might result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

irssi is a modular textUI IRC client with IPv6 support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/irssi      < 0.8.13-r1                       >= 0.8.13-r1

Description
===========

Nemo discovered an off-by-one error leading to a heap overflow in
irssi's event_wallops() parsing function.

Impact
======

A remote attacker might entice a user to connect to a malicious IRC
server, use a man-in-the-middle attack to redirect a user to such a
server or use ircop rights to send a specially crafted WALLOPS message,
which might result in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running irssi.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All irssi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =net-irc/irssi-0.8.13-r1
