Subject: WASC Announcement: Announcing the Web Application Security Scanner Evaluation Criteria v1


The Web Application Security Consortium is pleased to announce the release
of version 1 of the Web Application Security Scanner Evaluation Criteria
(WASSEC).  The goal of the WASSEC project is to create a vendor-neutral
document to help guide information security professionals during web
application scanner evaluations.  The document provides a comprehensive list
of features that should be considered when conducting an evaluation.  The
WASSEC project does not promote any specific products or tools, but instead
provides valuable information to help you make your own decision about which
of these tools best meets your needs.
 
The WASSEC document be found here in both wiki and PDF formats:
http://projects.webappsec.org/Web-Application-Security-Scanner-Evaluation-Cr
iteria
 
A large group of volunteers have contributed their expertise to the WASSEC
project.  If you have questions or would like to contribute to future
enhancements of the WASSEC, you can the project leader, Brian Shura, at
bshura73@...il.com.
