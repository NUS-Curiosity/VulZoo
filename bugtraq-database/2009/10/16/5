IBM DB2 JDBC Applet Server Remote DoS Vulnerability

Release Date: 2009-10-16

CVE ID: CVE-2009-2971

http://www.nsfocus.com/en/advisories/0902.html

Affected system:
==============

IBM DB2 Universal Database v8.1 Fixpak 15 (v8.2 Fixpak 8) and lower versions
IBM DB2 Universal Database v8.1 Fixpak 17a (v8.2 Fixpak 10a)

Unaffected system:

Impact: 
======

NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a remote DoS vulnerability in IBM DB2, which
will cause IBM DB2 JDBC Applet Server to exit due to out-of-bound access by
sending carefully crafted data to the Server.

Description:
==========

IBM DB2 is a large-scale business relational database system oriented to E-commerce,
business information, content management, customer relation management and
other applications. IBM DB2 operates on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris and Windows.

There exists a vulnerability in function jdbcReadString() of IBM DB2 JDBC
Applet Server. When converting UNICODE to ANSI string, the function uses the
length field from the packet directly without validating the actual string
size. Remote unauthenticated attackers can cause the JDBC Applet Server to
exit by sending carefully crafted JDBC data.

Workaround:
===========

* Apply rules at the host or boundary firewall, allows access to the JDBC
service port (6789/TCP) from trusted IPs only. 

Vendor Status:
============

The vulnerability has been fixed by the vendor in IBM DB2 v8.1 Fixpak 18.
