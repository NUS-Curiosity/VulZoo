Dear Dan,

They appear to /bin/ls as symlinks, but observation suggests that they
"act" as hardlinks. Could that be fixed somehow? (I did look at the
kernel fs/proc/base.c but did not make much sense to me...)

BTW: did you notice how bugtraq failed to follow this conversation?
They seem to have a strong pro-Windows, contra-Linux stance.

Cheers, Paul
