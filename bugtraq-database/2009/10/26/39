Paul, in authentic kernels /proc/<PID>/fd/<FD> are symlinks, not anything other. 
There're no such publicly accessible file objects, as file descriptors, there're 
only files (including special ones), directories and symlinks. But the above 
words don't necessary relate to patched kernels like distributed by third parties.
