Well, at first I would say this might definitely somewhat unexpected.
It's correct otoh, that you shouldn't be too lax with files when you
think you "secured" them somewhere in the path... 
But if you think of /proc/x/fd as *hard* links to the files, then the
behavior would not be surprising, which might help...

(You might have this as a "real world scenario" if you have some brain
dead application which you try to secure in this way...)
