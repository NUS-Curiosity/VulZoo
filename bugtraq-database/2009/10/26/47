guest abuses ptrace permissions on his own processes to write to ANY file open 
by his processes, whose permissions explicitly allow writing to it. Doesn't it 
trouble you, that guest's processes still retain open file descriptors and hence 
access to files, that you believe should no longer be accessible to those 
processes due to permissions you set?
