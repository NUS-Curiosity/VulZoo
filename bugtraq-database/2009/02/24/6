iDefense Security Advisory 02.24.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 24, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Flash Player is a very popular web browser plugin. It is available
for multiple web browsers and platforms, including Windows, Linux and
MacOS. Flash Player enables web browsers to display rich multimedia
content, such as online videos, and is often a requirement for popular
websites.

For more information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a invalid object reference vulnerability in Adobe
Systems Inc.'s Flash Player could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

During the processing of a Shockwave Flash file, a particular object can
be created, along with multiple references that point to the object. The
object can be destroyed and its associated references removed. However a
reference can incorrectly remain pointing to the object. The invalid
object resides in uninitialized memory, which the attacker may control
to gain arbitrary execution control.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Shockwave
Flash file created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes
this via social engineering or injecting content into a compromised,
trusted site.

Utilizing various techniques, an attacker is able to re-allocate and
control the memory used by the destroyed object. This allows the
attacker to subvert execution when a virtual function is called via the
invalid reference.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in latest
version of Flash Player, version 9.0.124.0. Previous versions may also
be affected.

Exploitation of this vulnerability was tested on Windows XP SP3 and
Windows Vista SP1. iDefense believe that all platforms supported by
Flash Player are affected by this vulnerability, including Linux and
MacOS.

V. WORKAROUND

A Internet Explorer plugin is available to temporarily block and unblock
Flash content using a single click. Only trusted sites should be
unblocked when using this plugin. More information is available at
http://flash.melameth.com.

A Firefox plugin is available to temporarily block and unblock Flash
content using a single click. Only trusted sites should be unblocked
when using this plugin. More information is available at:
