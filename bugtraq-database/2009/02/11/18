Subject: Re: pam-krb5 security advisory (3.12 and earlier)

        As a reminder, to see what we're running on what systems:

        remctl memory-new ood query installed libpam-krb5 --verbose

        ...or, to see what's pending (this will be useful tomorrow):

        remctl memory-new ood query pending libpam-krb5 --verbose
