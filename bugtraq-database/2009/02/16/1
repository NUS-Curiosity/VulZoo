Subject: Re: Enomaly ECP/Enomalism: Silent update remote command execution
 vulnerability

We've just released an update to Enomaly ECP (v 2.2.2) that addresses this issue. This update removes a fallback feature implemented some time ago which was found to have escaped our usual rigorous QA process. Although no users experienced any security issues, a potential security vulnerability existed in this functionality. This feature will be reintroduced once the security concerns have been addressed.

The Enterprise version of Enomaly ECP is not affected by this issue.
