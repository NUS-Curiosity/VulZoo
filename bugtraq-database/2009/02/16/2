Subject: Re: SEP(Symantec) Bug

Symantec has reviewed the issue that was reported with smc.exe crashing from the command line. We have confirmed that an improperly formatted command line can cause the user mode process to crash.  However, the privileged service process is unaffected. The client machine maintained full protection.  Symantec will supply an update to prevent the command line tool from crashing in a future release.
