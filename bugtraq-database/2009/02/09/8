Subject: [BMSA-2009-02] XML injection in PyBlosxom

BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2009-02
===================================


:Title: XML Injection in PyBlosxom
:Severity: Low
:Reporter: Blue Moon Consulting
:Products: PyBlosxom v1.4.3
:Fixed in: --


Description
-----------

PyBlosxom is a lightweight file-based weblog system. The project started as a Python clone of Blosxom but has since evolved into a beast of its own. PyBlosxom focuses on three things: simplicity, extensibility, and community.

In v1.4.3, PyBlosxom suffers an XML injection issue. This allows a malicious user to insert abitrary code into the XML output from PyBlosxom.

The problem is with Atom flavor. Its ``head.atom`` uses ``$(url)`` and ``$url`` variables, in many places, that were not properly escaped. Injection can be made by forcing PyBloxsom to use Atom flavor such as ``http://host/path/%3Ccool%3E?flav=atom``. A tag ``<cool>`` is injected in such URL.

Blue Moon Consulting has verified the bug in version 1.4.3. It is highly likely that it also exists in older versions starting from 1.3.

Workaround
----------

Disable Atom flavor by deleting ``atom.flav`` directory.

Fix
---

Users of PyBlosxom are advised to contact the vendor directly for a proper fix.

Disclosure
----------

Blue Moon Consulting adapts `RFPolicy v2.0 <http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html>`_ in notifying vendors.

:Initial vendor contact:

  February 07, 2009: Initial contact sent to Will Guaraldi.

:Vendor response:

  February 07, 2009: Will replied PyBlosxom did not use XML, so there could be no XML injection bug.

:Further communication:

  February 07, 2009: Replied to Will that we did find such bug.

  February 08, 2009: Will was skeptical about the bug but asked us to file it in the bug tracker anyway.

  February 08, 2009: We replied that filing security bug in a public bug tracker was not our disclosure practice. We again stated our disclosure policy and asked Will to accept it before we could send him further details.

  February 08, 2009: Will said he would not make any agreement. We therefore decided to alert the public. 

:Public disclosure: February 09, 2009

:Exploit code: No exploit code is needed.
