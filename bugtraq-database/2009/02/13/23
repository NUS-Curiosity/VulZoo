...and how did you confirm that? By seeing Silverlight in the accepted
mime-types header? Silverlight is a plugin which is a lot like the Flex
framework for Flash, only for .Net. So, I guess you have a Silverlight
application installed to play .WAV files, but this does not change the
fact that anything outside of IE (which has the Silverlight extension
installed) will use whatever the default media player is on your PC.

But I think you are probably correct Rolphin, as I've had a lot of Windows Media Player crashes recently. Either way, Windows Media Player should probably not be incorporated into Firefox if it's going to crash. A more stable platform should be used (such as Silverlight)

You can choose a different player within the preferences of Firefox.
What is the problem again?
