Package        : moodle
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2009-0500 CVE-2009-0502 CVE-2008-5153
Debian Bug     : 514284

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Moodle, an online
course management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0500

    It was discovered that the information stored in the log tables
    was not properly sanitized, which could allow attackers to inject
    arbitrary web code.

CVE-2009-0502

    It was discovered that certain input via the "Login as" function
    was not properly sanitised leading to the injection of arbitrary
    web script.

CVE-2008-5153

    Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the SpellCheker plugin creates
    temporary files insecurely, allowing a denial of service attack.
    Since the plugin was unused, it is removed in this update.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2+etch2.

For the testing (lenny) distribution these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-3+lenny1.

For the unstable (sid) distribution these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your moodle package.
