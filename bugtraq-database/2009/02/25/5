You say you can execute arbitrary code on your computer (under your own 
account)? What an amazing exploit! (pun intended)

Any client-server application depending on the client side not being
messed with by its user is *broken by design*. It does not matter
whether the messing in question is easy (like putting a VB script in the
right directory) or difficult (like attaching a debugger to a running
process and flipping bits in its memory space).

the REAL problem?
