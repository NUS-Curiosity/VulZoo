Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
The HP-ChaiSOE/1.0 embedded web server on certain HP JetDirect printers allows a potential attacker to gain read only access to directories and files outside of the web root.  An attacker can leverage this flaw to read arbitrary system configuration files, cached documents, etc. Information obtained from an affected host may facilitate further attacks against the host.  Exploitation of this flaw is trivial using common web server directory traversal techniques.

Solution Description
--------------------
The vendor has released an update.  See http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c01623905 for more details.
