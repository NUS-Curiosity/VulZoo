Subject: Re: Apache directory traversal on shared hosting environment.

Sounds like you can fix this also with the Apache configuration directives you list in the report. So, it seems that you simply need to update your httpd.conf to proper settings for shared hosting and that there is no vulnerability, except that your configuration is vulnerable.
