So a University of Technology maintains a CERT team, that discloses the 
most basic of XSS flaws, and you cannot even figure out which script is 
affected?

You thank three people, presumably for help in this discovery or advisory. 
On top of that, you disclose this without a solution other than "sanitize 
input" in so many words.

I believe you have done worse than any of the random <script> pasting 
kiddies flooding the list for the last ten years.
