Synopsis
========

Multiple boundary checking vulnerabilities in libTIFF may allow for the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged
Image File Format) images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/tiff     < 3.8.2-r8                        >= 3.8.2-r8

Description
===========

Two vulnerabilities have been reported in libTIFF:

* wololo reported a buffer underflow in the LZWDecodeCompat()
  function (CVE-2009-2285).

* Tielei Wang of ICST-ERCIS, Peking University reported two integer
  overflows leading to heap-based buffer overflows in the tiff2rgba and
  rgb2ycbcr tools (CVE-2009-2347).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF or the tiff2rgba and
rgb2ycbcr tools, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.2-r8"
