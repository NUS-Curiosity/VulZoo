Subject: OpenCms (7.5.0) - Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting, Phishing
 Through Frames, Application Error

Application: OpenCms

Version: 7.5.0

Hardware: Tomcat/Oracle

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting, Phishing Through Frames,
Application Error


Overview:

Various URL's within the deployed OpenCms application version 7.5.0 are
open to attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting, Phishing Through Frames
and Application Error.  Some of these attacks allow injection of scripts
into a parameter in the request.  The application should filter out such
hazardous characters from user input.

Example follows:
Vulnerable URL (from the OpenCms VFS):
/opencms/opencms/system/modules/org.opencms.workplace.help/jsptemplates/
help_head.jsp?&homelink=>"'><script>alert("This%20site%20has%20been%20co
mpromised")</script>

Results:
Insertion of the script into the homelink parameter successfully embeds
the script in the response and is executed once the page is loaded into
the user's browser (i.e. vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting)



Below find the complete list of vulnerable URL's (all paths are relative
to the OpenCms VFS).  All issues are of High risk.
