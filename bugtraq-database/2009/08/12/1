Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in several ATEN IP KVM Switches

This is Technical Support Team from ATEN.

Firstly, we appreciate all suggestions from Germany TUB LAB. Undoubtedly, guaranteeing our KVM products with robust security mechanism is our responsibility.

After discussing with Germany TUB LAB, we believe all security issues could be fixed by new Firmware version as below. 

- KH1508i/KH1516i v1.0.068 
- KN9108/KN9116 v1.1.109 
- PN9108 v1.8.179 

Scheduled Release Date is around Aug. 17, 2009 

Please visit our ATEN official site later.

As for SSL Certificate, SSL Certificate import function has built into our KVM above with new firmware. We strongly suggest our KVM users to import their individual Certificate for advanced security concern. We will tell our KVM users how to generate their own Certificate by openssl tool in our product manual later.

Thanks,
ATEN SUPPORT
