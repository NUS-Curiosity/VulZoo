Subject: Static analysis tool exposition (SATE) 2009 - call for participation

We are preparing an exposition for static analysis tools that find 
security relevant defects. Briefly, participating tool makers run their 
tools on real programs.  Researchers led by NIST analyze the tool 
reports.  Everyone reports results and experiences at a workshop.  The 
tool reports and analysis are made publicly available later.

The plan is at http://samate.nist.gov/SATE.html

We plan to provide the test sets by 19 August, and to hold the workshop 
on 6 November.

We invite tool makers to sign up. If you would like to participate in 
the exposition, or if you have questions, please email Vadim Okun 
(vadim.okun 'at' nist.gov).

Sincerely,
Vadim
