Mechanical computers are computers. The loss and the algorithmic crack  
of the Enigma machine circa 1939 should count - the story and break
of the more difficult 4 rotor Naval Machine at Bletchley park  
recovered from the U-boat and cracked in 1941 is the most famous.

But I would nominate the break of the 3 Rotor Enigma circa 1939, by  
the Polish, as the first documented computer security vulnerability.
