Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk allowing for
Denial of Service and username disclosure.

Background
==========

Asterisk is an open source telephony engine and toolkit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/asterisk      < 1.2.32                         >= 1.2.32

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the IAX2 channel
driver when performing the 3-way handshake (CVE-2008-1897), when
handling a large number of POKE requests (CVE-2008-3263), when handling
authentication attempts (CVE-2008-5558) and when handling firmware
download (FWDOWNL) requests (CVE-2008-3264). Asterisk does also not
correctly handle SIP INVITE messages that lack a "From" header
(CVE-2008-2119), and responds differently to a failed login attempt
depending on whether the user account exists (CVE-2008-3903,
CVE-2009-0041).

Impact
======

Remote unauthenticated attackers could send specially crafted data to
Asterisk, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service via a daemon crash,
call-number exhaustion, CPU or traffic consumption. Remote
unauthenticated attackers could furthermore enumerate valid usernames
to facilitate brute force login attempts.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.32"
