Hey Andres,
That seems to be really cool stuff! We need more of these test suites
for both SCAs/WebApps Scanners (every body uses WebGoat, even vendors,
so it's not fun and doesn't mean anything anymore).

Hope many will contribute to this project!

I haven't had a change to look at what apps compose this test suites,
but is Wivet part of it? Such crawler targeting test suite is also
important for web apps scanners...
