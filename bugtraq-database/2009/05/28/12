-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists when the application parses a malformed .PICT
image. While decoding a tag 0x77 in the image, the application misuses a
16-bit length when allocating tag data. When copying tag data into this
buffer, a heap overflow occurs. This can lead to code execution under
the context of the current user.


-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
