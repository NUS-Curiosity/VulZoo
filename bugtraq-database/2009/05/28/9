Subject: Re[2]: [TZO-27-2009] Firefox Denial of Service (Keygen)

Hi Tavis,

The  bug title says Denial of service, not information leak, or crypto
leak or whatever.

That's it, one might want to write a paper how,  by  indirect
means  memory  leaks  can  wreak  havoc, that's an exercise
I happily leave  to  the  reader. The point was that you
better  analyse  them  instead  of having them sit there a few months.
period, nothing more nothing less.
