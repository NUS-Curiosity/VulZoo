Subject: Re: Insufficient Authentication vulnerability in Acer notebooks

Hello Susan!

If Microsoft did it, than it's good. But better for my opinion to do such as
in Windows XP Professional - not to disable admin account by default, but to
make password of default admin account similar to password of first admin
(during installation process). Because if default admin account will be
enabled later (with empty password) and will forget to set new password,
than it'll be much worse.

I'm not using Vista, so I can't check this issue on any of my computers. And
I want to check it by myself - is there such issue on Vista or not. For this
I'm planning to check one notebook of my friend (with Vista). But for more
than two weeks I couldn't meet with him and take his notebook. I quickly
checked two Asus notebook of my friends (as I wrote already to bugtraq), but
there is some delay with this Acer notebook with Vista. If in near time I'll
not be able to meet with my friend to take his notebook (because he is
busy), then I'll try to check this situation on one Samsung notebook of
another friend of mine (and better to check both these notebooks).

There are many versions of Vista, so there can be such situation with
different versions of Vista as with XP, where XP Home and XP Professional
have different situations with default admin accounts. Which leads to
vulnerability in XP Home. So I'm planning to investigate different versions
of Windows Vista to be sure.
