References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1252

Description:
    Previous versions of the ntp package contain an ntpd daemon which,
    in a non-default configuration (using public key cryptography for
    ntp packet authentication), a remote attacker could cause the ntpd
    daemon to crash (or, in rPath Linux 1, possibly execute remote code).
