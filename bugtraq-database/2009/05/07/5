Subject: Update: [TZO-15-2009] Aladdin eSafe generic bypass - Forced release



Update:
Aladdin responded and posted a blog post, please read the timeline and
then the blog post.
http://www.aladdin.com/AircBlog/post/2009/05/Archive-Bypass-Issue-and-eSafe.aspx

It is said that :
-----------------
"This means that in case a customer receives such a specially crafted
archive file, he will not be able to extract it."

This is wrong. Winrar for example extracts the PoC files fine.

"We have acted on the issue after two days since its first coming
into view."
Please see the timeline below and draw your conclusions

"The  eSafe  products affected by this vulnerability are 7.1, 7.0, and
6."
I  was  not communicated this information and had to find a referer in
my log files in order to know.


Full update to be published after more discussions...
