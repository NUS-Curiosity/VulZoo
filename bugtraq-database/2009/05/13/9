Subject: Re: The security tools list, new version with more than 200 new 
 tools!

Hi Ignace,
	Your question is very normal. Well, I'm doing in order to have a large
referral center for security tools. When you eventually need some tool
somewhere, not know any, want to try other tools you use regularly, or
have a proprietary tool and want to share with everyone. For all that I
think is a good idea to a site that combines the largest and ranked them
as best as possible so that it can help in all these cases.
	The reason for not having added the tools available in backtrack, FIRE,
Phlax, Helix, etc, is that, despite the contributions of all you are
doing (and I appreciate greatly), almost all the tools I introduced
myself by hand. That takes time and that's why I'm going to slowly,
because what I do in my spare time. But of course that will introduce
all of these tools.
	
Regards
