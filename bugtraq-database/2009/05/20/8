Subject: RE: Insufficient Authentication vulnerability in Asus notebook

The difference here is that renaming the admin also offers a some mitigation against local (e.g., non-networked) attacks for when the same person that can't be bothered to lock their session is rewarded with the latest d1psh1t virus when they download their porn-mule update. Installing the OS on something other than C: and renaming the admin account (regardless of the password) thwarts (sound of water dripping) most common local-attack methods. Simple and effective.

IOW:
1. no, this is not a "vulnerability in software", but build process failure by the OEM. As others have pointed out, this is frequently done to allow "ease of recovery" for the user.
2. there is no expectation (sadly) that OEM will perform any sort of security configuration on their products; typically, this is what "Bob's Security Suite" is intended to accomplish (I know...)
3. anyone leaving their session unlocked when they're removed from it for any length of time is a fuul (IMHO). It takes barely more than 0 seconds to hit <WIN>-L as you move away from the keyboard. ..of course, this habit may be offset by a 4-character password policy...

A better option is to set a strong password and set a local policy that the local admin account cannot be accessed over the network.  I'm a big advocate of that in all environments and prevents the need for renaming the account to prevent automated attacks.

Thanks,

We're talking XP Home here, right?  A admin account without a password
cannot be access remotely over the internet, so if you have physical
access at all times of that Asus netbook it's arguably more secure in
some circumstances.
