Subject: Re[2]: Addendum : [TZO-26-2009] Firefox (all?) Denial of Service through unclamped loop (SVG)

Dear Jim Parkhurst,

It  may  depend  on  video  card  and  video  drivers  and/or  amount of
memory/video  memory.  9  years  ago there was vulnerability in Internet
explorer          with          displaying         scaled         image:
http://securityvulns.com/advisories/ie5freeze.asp   results   were  also
different  on  different  hardware.  In some cases even mouse cursor was
frozen and reboot was only option.
