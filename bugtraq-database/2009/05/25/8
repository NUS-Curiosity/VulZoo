Synopsis
========

An error in acpid might allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of
Service.

Background
==========

acpid is a daemon for the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
(ACPI).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-power/acpid      < 1.0.10                           >= 1.0.10

Description
===========

The acpid daemon allows opening a large number of UNIX sockets without
closing them, triggering an infinite loop.

Impact
======

Remote attackers can cause a Denial of Service (CPU consumption and
connectivity loss).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All acpid users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-power/acpid-1.0.10"
