Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Cscope might allow for the remote execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/cscope       < 15.7a                            >= 15.7a

Description
===========

James Peach of Apple discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in
cscope's handling of long file system paths (CVE-2009-0148). Multiple
stack-based buffer overflows were reported in the putstring function
when processing an overly long function name or symbol in a source code
file (CVE-2009-1577).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
source file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cscope users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/cscope-15.7a"
