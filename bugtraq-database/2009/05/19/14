Description:
    In previous versions of the postgresql package, authenticated
    users of a postgresql database could cause the postgresql server
    to crash by triggering a failure in converting an error message to
    an encoding selected by the user, by making mismatched encoding
    conversion requests.  In addition, a GiST index corruption bug
    is also addressed by this update; users of GiST indices should
    regenerate GiST indices after updating.
