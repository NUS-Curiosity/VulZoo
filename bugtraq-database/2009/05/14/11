You should only do the above recommendation, if you like to have your
boxes owned.

You should not have any administrative accounts named "Administrator"
and _all_ administrative accounts should have a _STRONG_ password
associated with them.

No exceptions.

Password safes are available at no charge.  If you somehow forget your
password, you can always reset it via AD or resetting the SAM.
