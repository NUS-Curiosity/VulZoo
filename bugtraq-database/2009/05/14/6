Subject: Re: Insufficient Authentication vulnerability in Asus notebook

Once someone has physical access all bets are off, there's a lot the  
can do.

1) steal it
2) boot off cd and reset/enable admin acct
3) boot off cd and grab all hashes
4) pour a perfectly good frappucino on the keyboard
5) cover it with smiley face stickers


You get the idea.  This is non issue.
