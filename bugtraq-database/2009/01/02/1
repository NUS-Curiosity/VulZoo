Subject: A tool to identify the MD5 certs on FF

Exec. Summary : 

<snip from= http://www.codefromthe70s.org/sslblacklist.aspx>

Update 12/31/2008

SSL Blacklist now detects and warns about certificate chains that use the MD5 algorithm for RSA signatures.

Great little FF-addon that helps you identify whether the SSL-site you are on is using a bad cert from the Debian/OpenSSL goof a while back, or now whether it is MD5 based.

Enjoy,
