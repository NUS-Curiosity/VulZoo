Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Global Site Selector Appliances DNS
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20090107-gss

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090107-gss.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 January 07 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco Application Control Engine Global Site Selector (GSS)
contains a vulnerability when processing specific Domain Name System
(DNS) requests that may lead to a crash of the DNS service on the
GSS.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090107-gss.shtml

Affected Products
=================

All versions of GSS system software prior to 3.0(1) are affected by
this vulnerability. If the GSS is configured with the optional Cisco
Network Registrar (CNR) software, the device is not vulnerable.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following GSS products are affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco GSS 4480 Global Site Selector
  * Cisco GSS 4490 Global Site Selector
  * Cisco GSS 4491 Global Site Selector
  * Cisco GSS 4492R Global Site Selector

In order to determine the software that runs on a GSS device, users
should log in to the device and issue the show version command to
display the system software banner. The version is indicated on the
line starting with Version. The following example shows a GSS that
runs system software 2.0(1):

    gss.cisco.com#show version

    Global Site Selector (GSS)
    Model Number: GSS-4491-k9
    Copyright (c) 1999-2007 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

    Version 2.0(1)

    Uptime: 19 Hours 18 Minutes and 14 seconds

    gss.cisco.com#

In order to determine if CNR is enabled on the GSS device, users
should log in to the device and issue the show running-config | grep
cnr command to display the system CNR configuration. If CNR is
enabled, cnr enable will be displayed in the output. If CNR is
disabled, no cnr enable will be displayed. The following example
shows a GSS that does not have CNR enabled:

    GSS.cisco.com#show running-config | grep cnr
    no cnr enable
    GSS.cisco.com#

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Cisco Global Site Selector using interaction with Cisco Network
    Registrar
  * Cisco Application Control Engine Module
  * Cisco Network Registrar
  * Cisco Content Services Switch (CSS)

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco GSS platform allows customers to leverage global content
deployment across multiple distributed and mirrored data locations,
optimizing site selection, improving Domain Name System (DNS)
responsiveness, and ensuring data center availability.

The GSS is inserted into the traditional DNS hierarchy and is closely
integrated with the Cisco CSS, Cisco Content Switching Module (CSM),
or third-party server load balancers (SLBs) to monitor the health and
load of the SLBs in customers data centers. The GSS uses this
information and user-specified routing algorithms to select the
best-suited and least-loaded data center in real time.

A vulnerability exists in the GSS when processing a specific sequence
of DNS requests. An exploit of the vulnerability may result in a
crash of the DNS service on the GSS.

When the DNS server crashes, an error message will appear in the logs
similar to the following example:

    Dec 18 04:47:21 gss NMR-6-LAUNCHSVR_EXIT[27261] dnsserver' has exited [ExitUnknown(139)]"

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID: CSCsj70093 

This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2008-3819.

http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/gss-3des?psrtdcat20e2

Workarounds
===========

A workaround for this vulnerability includes setting the property
"ServerConfig.dnsserver.returnError" to disabled (or zero). The
following example shows how to set the property to disabled. It is
enabled by default:

    GSS#config terminal
    GSS(config)#$sserver.returnError 0
    GSS(config)#property set ServerConfig.dnsserver.returnError 0
    GSS(config)#exit
    GSS#write memory


Note: Negative responses (NXDOMAIN and NODATA) will not be sent out
by the GSS with this setting disabled. Also, by using the DNS server
statistics (show statistics dns global), it will not be possible to
differentiate between the NXDOMAIN or NODATA mismatches because both
of these will increment the DNSQueriesUnmatched counter.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.
