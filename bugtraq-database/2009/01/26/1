Subject: Problems with syscall filtering technologies on Linux

Hi,

There's a trick which may permit the bypassing of policies in
technologies which do syscall filtering on the Linux x86_64 kernel.

The trick is made possible by the fact that the 32-bit and 64-bit
kernel tables are different, combined with the fact that a 64-bit
process can make a 32-bit syscall and visa versa. The syscall "number"
check can get confused and permit a syscall it did not intend to.
