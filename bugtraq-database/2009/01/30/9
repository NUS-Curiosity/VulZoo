Successfully tested on: Novell GroupWise WebAcess 7.0.3

Novell has confirmed the following versions to be affected by this
vulnerability:

GroupWise 6.5x
GroupWise 7.0, 7.01, 7.02x, 7.03
GroupWise 8.0 (shipping 8.0 release only)

CVE reference: CVE-2009-0272

Description:

Novell WebAccess is vulnerable to CSRF.

Any HTTP request can be successfully forged which means that any
configuration settings can be changed on behalf of the victim user by
tricking him to either:

- visit a page
- click on a link
- view the content of an email (HTML body or attachment)

Perhaps, the most interesting CSRF attack that can be carried out is
installing a persistent backdoor which forwards received emails to the
attacker. By forging the requests that adds a new forwarding rule, a
copy of any email sent to the victim user will be sent to the attacker's
inbox.

All the attacker needs to do is email the victim with a malicious link
and trick him to click on it. Alternatively, the CSRF attack can be
triggered by simply viewing an email sent by the attacker.

Consequences:

Attackers can steal emails, deface email signatures, etc ...


Proof of concept (PoC):

_As kindly requested by Novell, ProCheckUp will delay publication of the
PoC details to allow GroupWise customers time to apply the recommended
security patches._
