Subject: PerlSoft Guestbook v1.7b Bruteforcer + RCE!


Typ: Bruter & RCE
Name: PerlSoft GB Pwner
Affected Software: PerlSoft Gästebuch
Version: 1.7b
Coder/Bugfounder: Perforin 
 
 
------> the RCE is only once possible, do not waste your command!
 
STEP1: Use my script to bruteforce the admin login from the guestbook.
STEP2: If we gain access, you can decide to get in the ACP with the login OR to use the RCE!
STEP3: Deface or root the server ;)
 
------> Infos about the Exploit
 
Unfortunaly, the RCE is only once possible and only after gaining acces to the admincenter... so choose your command usefull. (I tried to make a RFI out of it but the results were shitty because most of the webserver are secured against including php file from other webservers.)
The RCE is possible due a security hole when you change the Username. The script doesn´t check the input so we can manipulate the script.=)
