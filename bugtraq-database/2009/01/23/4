4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in AXIS Camera 
Control, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the 
CamImage.CamImage.1 ActiveX control (AxisCamControl.ocx) and can be
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by assigning an overly
long string to the "image_pan_tilt" property.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but 
requires that the user is tricked into visiting and clicking a 
malicious web page.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

The vendor recommends removing the ActiveX control and using 
AXIS Media Control as a replacement.
