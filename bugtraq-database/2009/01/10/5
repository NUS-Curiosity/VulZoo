Subject: Re: Team SHATTER Security Advisory: Oracle Database Buffer
	Overflow in SYS.KUPF$FILE_INT.GET_FULL_FILENAME (DB11)

Hi,

This is very typical and, in my opinion, you should only consider
trustworthy the Team Shatter's advisory, not the Oracle's one.

Take for example the bug APPS01[1] in Oracle Critical Patch Update of
April 2007 [2], it was a preauthenticated remote bug (with remote I mean
"from internet", not from "adjacent network"). CVSS2 Score would be 9/10
(calcule it yourself [3]), however, the Oracle advisory says that a
"Valid session" was needed and that the CVSS2 score was 4.2. It's funny.

Yes, don't trust the Oracle's advisories, the aren't real.
