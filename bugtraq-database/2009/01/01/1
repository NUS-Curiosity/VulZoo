Subject: Re: apache 1.x <=> 2.x suphp (suPHP_ConfigPath) bypass safe mode
 exploit&#8206;

Hi brother For your exploit i dont know why you call it bypass  because suPHP his job is allow users to change some options on PHP by uploading php.ini and for apache with .htacess 


So when SuPHP loaded on Apache modules any user can turn safe_mode off ;=

So we can Called "suPHP Script"
and for your exploit it require fopen be eable on php fonction and we always learn from our errors 

and new Happy year for all worlds (alsow muslims)
>From suphp.org
suPHP is a tool for executing PHP scripts with the permissions of their owners. It consists of an Apache module (mod_suphp) and a setuid root binary (suphp) that is called by the Apache module to change the uid of the process executing the PHP interpreter.
