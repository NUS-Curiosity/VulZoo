Affects: TFTPUtil GUI versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0
Fixed in: 1.4.0
Risk: Medium

Vulnerability Description: TFTPUtil GUI versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 are prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sanitize TFTP GET requests. By using a specially crafted TFTP GET request an attacker is capable of retrieving files outside of the TFTP root directory.

Impact: The ability to obtain files outside of the TFTP root directory may allow an attacker to obtain more information about the underlying operating system and applications running on the host.

[--Background--]

Type of vulnerability: Input validation flaw
Who can exploit it: Local and remote users

TFTPUtil GUI is an application that provides services for transferring configuration files, firmware files and other types of data using the TFTP protocol. The application should restrict GET requests to the contents of the TFTP root directory to prevent obtaining data from other parts of the host operating system.

Vulnerability Scope: The default installation of TFTPUtil 1.20. or 1.3.0 will allow exploitation of this vulnerability.

[--More Details--]

Exploitation of this flaw is trivial and can be executed using any RFC 1350 compliant TFTP client software. No exploit code is required.

[--Fix or Workaround Information--]

Patch availability: 1.4.0
Vendor provided fix: 1.4.0
