4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in DevIL, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application
using the library.

The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within the
"iGetHdrHeader()" function in src-IL/src/il_hdr.c. These can be 
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when processing
specially crafted Radiance RGBE files.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

Fixed in the SVN repository.
