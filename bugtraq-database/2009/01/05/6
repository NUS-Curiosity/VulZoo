Subject: Call for papers and trainers - SeacureIT 2009

Dear colleagues,

it is my pleasure to officially announce the launch of SEaCURE.IT, the
first international technical conference ever held in Italy on security
releated topics (http://www.seacure.it).

The 2009 edition will be held from May 19th to 22nd in the wonderful
seaside resort Tanka Village, located in Villasimius, Sardinia, a large
and beautiful island in the Mediterranean sea.

Besides the main conference, featuring two tracks of top-notch
presentations over two intense days, the programme will include two days
of advanced trainings, and a set of unique social events (Italian
style), in order to foster networking.

A number of key speakers already confirmed their presence, and we warmly
thank them for the trust placed in us. With this call for papers, we
invite submission of papers from researchers worldwide for presentation
at our conference.

== About SEaCURE.it ==

SEaCURE.IT is the first international technical conference ever held in
Italy on security releated topics, aimed at bringing together the
leading experts from all over the world, to create a unique setting for
networking and discussion among the speakers and the attendees.

The 2009 edition will be held from May 19th to 22nd in the wonderful
seaside resort Tanka Village, located in Villasimius. In a relaxed
setting, our attendees and speakers will be able to meet and discuss in
an informal, highly profitable way.

Besides the main conference, featuring two tracks of top-notch
presentations over two intense days, the programme includes two days of
advanced trainings, and a set of unique social events (Italian style),

is possible to put together the brightest minds from the university,
goverment, industry and hacking community to provide the audience with
cutting-edge research in the field.

Vendors, IT Decision Makers, Policy Makers, Security-, Network-, and
Firewall-Admins, and Software Developers.
