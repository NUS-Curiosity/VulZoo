Subject: MSFXDC Metasploit eXploits Development Contest

Hi there,

MSFXDC (MetaSploit Framework eXploits Development Contest) is a
challenge where the main goal is to code the largest number of new
Metasploit Framework exploits modules.
https://www.securinfos.info/metasploit/msfxdc.php

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to code new exploits
modules for the Metasploit Framework (latest 3.x version).
Exploits modules must be new regarding the current Metasploit Framework
SVN repository content.
(http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/ Updated to revision 6062)
(Backup:
https://www.securinfos.info/metasploit/framework-trunk-snapshot-6062.tar.gz)

Exploits modules can be new fresh sploits or old exploits ported to the
MSF v3.x.
(ie: stolen from www.milw0rm.com or MSF v2 modules still not ported to
v3
http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/documentation/metasploit2/exploits.txt
)

NOTE: Contesters can take advantage of the MSF-eXploit Builder to
achieve this goal ( https://www.securinfos.info/metasploit/MSF_XB.php )

and you can submit your stuff to:
msfxdc@...psi.com
until February 1st 2009 00H00 GMT
