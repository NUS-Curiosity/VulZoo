4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in the Oracle BEA
WebLogic Server plug-ins for web servers, which can be exploited by
malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The Oracle BEA WebLogic Server can be configured to receive requests
via an Apache, Sun, or IIS web server. In this case, a plug-in is
installed in the Internet-facing web server that passes the request to
a WebLogic server. An integer overflow when parsing HTTP requests can 
be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply patches released by the vendor.
