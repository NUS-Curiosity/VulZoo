4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a security issue in SAP GUI, which can
be exploited by malicious people to gain knowledge of sensitive 
information, corrupt files, or compromise a user's system.

The problem is that the bundled KWEdit ActiveX control (KWEDIT.DLL) 
provides the insecure method "SaveDocumentAs()", which saves an HTML 
document to a specified location. This can be exploited in combination
with e.g. the "OpenDocument()" method to disclose the contents of 
files or to execute arbitrary code on a user's system.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to the latest versions, which reportedly set the kill-bit for 
the ActiveX control.
