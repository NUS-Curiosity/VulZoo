Synopsis
========

An error in Avahi might lead to a Denial of Service via network and CPU
consumption.

Background
==========

Avahi is a system that facilitates service discovery on a local
network.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/avahi      < 0.6.24-r2                       >= 0.6.24-r2

Description
===========

Rob Leslie reported that the
originates_from_local_legacy_unicast_socket() function in
avahi-core/server.c does not account for the network byte order of a
port number when processing incoming multicast packets, leading to a
multicast packet storm.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted legacy unicast mDNS
query packets to the Avahi daemon, resulting in a Denial of Service due
to network bandwidth and CPU consumption.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Avahi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/avahi-0.6.24-r2"
