Subject: WOOT'09 call for papers

The CFP for the 3rd USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies is now
available at http://www.usenix.org/woot09/cfpa

WOOT'09 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in system
security to present research advancing the understanding of attacks on
operating systems, networks, and applications. WOOT seeks submissions
that reflect the state of the art in offensive computer security
technology--either surveying previously poorly known areas or presenting
entirely new attacks. We welcome papers on offensive technologies,
including but not limited to:

 - Vulnerability research (software auditing, reverse engineering)
 - Exploitation techniques and automation
 - Network-based attacks (routing, DNS, IDS/IPS/firewall evasion)
 - Reconnaissance (scanning, software, and hardware fingerprinting)
 - Malware design and implementation (rootkits, viruses, bots, worms)
 - Denial-of-service attacks
 - Web and database security
 - Penetration testing
 - Weaknesses in deployed systems (VoIP, telephony, wireless, games)
 - Practical cryptanalysis (hardware, DRM, etc.)

WOOT'09 will be a one-day event on Monday, August 10. It will be co-located
with the 18th USENIX Security Symposium in Montreal, Canada.

The submission deadline for papers is 11:59 p.m. PDT on
Tuesday, May 26, 2009.

We look forward to your submissions.

Alexander Sotirov, independent security researcher
