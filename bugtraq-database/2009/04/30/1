 overflow exploit

Symantec discontinued sales and support for Winfax Pro in early 2006.  As such, there will be no further updates to the product.

Anyone running a legacy version of this product and concerned about this issue may want to follow the procedures outlined in MSKB 240797 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797 to set the killbit for this control to prevent it from being called.

Symantec Product Security Team
