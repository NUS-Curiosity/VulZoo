Subject: Re: Addonics NAS Adapter (bts.cgi) Remote DoS Exploit (post-auth)

Have any of these buffer overflows been debugged and/or proven
exploitable? Is debugging practical on this device? More details may
suffice the mind.

Each of these buffer overflows will crash the entire TCP/IP stack and the device will have to be power cycled to restore any functionality. Addonics currently has implemented GUI level (client side) controls for preventing long inputs, but by simply doing a direct HTTP GET request (the device doesn't use POST) this can be bypassed.
