Subject: skpd: A tool to dump processes to executable ELF files

Hello,

I just developed a tool for dump a running process, to an executable ELF
file. This tool works on GNU/Linux, and has been tested on systems like
Ununtu 8.10, Gentoo, Debian lenny, Debian etch, etc.

Fell free to send me bugs, comments, and patches.

It can be downloaded from here:

Regards.
