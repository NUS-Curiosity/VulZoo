Hi.

IBM DB2 Version 9.5 Fix Pack 3a came out, fixing also two DoS
vulnerabilities I found.
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21372517IBM DB2

1. "IZ37697: SECURITY: MALICIOUS CONNECT DATA STREAM CAN CAUSE DENIAL OF
SERVICE."
First is pre-auth DoS vulnerability. Here is exploit: it require
"DB2TEST" database present on target database, because its name is
hardcoded into packet.

2. IZ39653: SECURITY: MALICOUS DATA STREAM CAN CAUSE THE DB2 SERVER TO TRAP.
The second DoS vulnerability, it is require also "DB2TEST" database
present on target database and require "GUEST" account present with "QQ"
password. All this stuff is hardcoded too.
