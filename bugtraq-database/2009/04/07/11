Subject: OSSTMM 3 Sample Released

Hi,

To show the progress of the OSSTMM 3 we have released a 20 page sample 
  with the ToC included. You'll see the graphics have not been put in 
nor the new cover attached and there's still some chapters missing and 
2 needing editing but this sample should give you a good idea of the 
extensive content we're working with and how far we've come since the 
Lite version was released. It's a completely new re-write from 2.0 
with a big focus on clarity for the end user. Let's just say we don't 
want it to read like stereo instructions again ;)

You can get the sample at http://www.osstmm.org.

Sincerely,
-pete.
