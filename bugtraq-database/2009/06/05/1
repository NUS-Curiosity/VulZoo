A simple solution is to follow the installation instructions, which
strongly recommend removing the install script after a successful
install. There are also further checks and reminders about this built
into Geeklog.

You cant expect your users to do so, then the best way would be to force the webmaster to remove the install scripts before he can use the CMS.
