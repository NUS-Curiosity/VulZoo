ZDI-09-035: Microsoft Word Document Stack Based Buffer Overflow
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-035
June 10, 2009

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-0563

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Office Word

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Word. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page, open a malicious e-mail, or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of vulnerable tags inside a
Microsoft Word document. Microsoft Word trusts a length field read from
the file which is used to read file contents into a buffer allocated on
the stack. When an invalid length is present, a stack based buffer
overflow occurs, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary code.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
