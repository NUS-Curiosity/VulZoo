vulnerability that could result in a reboot on systems that receive a
crafted packet.

Cisco Video Surveillance 2500 Series IP Cameras contain an
information disclosure vulnerability that could allow an
authenticated user to view any file on a vulnerable camera.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that mitigate these
vulnerabilities.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are vulnerable:

  * Cisco Video Surveillance Stream Manager firmware for the Cisco
    Video Surveillance Services Platform versions prior to 5.3
  * Cisco Video Surveillance Stream Manager firmware for the Cisco
    Video Surveillance Integrated Services Platform versions prior to
    5.3
  * Cisco Video Surveillance 2500 Series IP Camera firmware versions
    prior to 2.1

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Video Surveillance Services Platforms and Cisco Video
Surveillance Integrated Services Platforms are vulnerable to a DoS
condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted packet to UDP port 37000, which could cause the crash of a
critical process and result in a system reboot. This vulnerability is
documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsj47924 and has been assigned Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2009-2045.

Cisco Video Surveillance 2500 Series IP Cameras contain an
information disclosure vulnerability. An authenticated user may be
able to access a vulnerable camera and view any file through the
embedded web server on TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and/or 443 (HTTPS),
depending on the camera configuration. This vulnerability is
documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCsu05515 and CSCsr96497 (Wireless
Cameras) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) identifier CVE-2009-2046.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the Cisco Video Surveillance Stream
Manager firmware vulnerability could cause a system reboot. Repeated
exploitation may result in an extended DoS condition, which could
prevent administrators from viewing video surveillance feeds.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco Video Surveillance 2500 Series
IP Cameras vulnerability could allow an authenticated user to view
any file on a vulnerable camera. This vulnerability could allow a
non-privileged user to obtain privileged access.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

Although there are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities, it is
possible to mitigate the vulnerabilities through the use of network
filters. Administrators are advised to restrict access to UDP port
37000 on vulnerable Cisco Video Surveillance Services Platform and
Integrated Services Platform systems to trusted hosts. On Cisco Video
Surveillance 2500 Series IP Cameras, administrators are advised to
restrict access to TCP ports 80 and 443 to trusted hosts.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin
companion document for this advisory, which is available at the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20090624-video.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing, or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
