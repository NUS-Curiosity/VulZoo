Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Physical Access Gateway Denial of
Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20090624-gateway

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 June 24 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the Cisco Physical
Access Gateway. There are no workarounds available to mitigate the
vulnerability. This vulnerability has been corrected in Cisco
Physical Access Gateway software version 1.1. Cisco has released free
software updates that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at:

 http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090624-gateway.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco Physical Access Gateway running software versions prior to 1.1
are vulnerable.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco Physical Access Gateway running software versions 1.1 or later
are not vulnerable. No other Cisco products are currently known to be
affected by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco Physical Access Gateway is the primary means for the Cisco
Physical Access Control solution to connect door hardware, such as
locks and readers, to an IP network. Certain crafted TCP port 443
packets may cause a memory leak that could lead to a denial of
service (DoS) condition in the Cisco Physical Access Gateway. A TCP
three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsu95864 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-1163.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

CSCsu95864 - Memory leak with certain IP packets

CVSS Base Score - 7.8

Access Vector           - Network
Access Complexity       - Low
Authentication          - None
Confidentiality Impact  - None
Integrity Impact        - None
Availability Impact     - Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.4

Exploitability          - Functional
Remediation Level       - Official-Fix
Report Confidence       - Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability described in this
document may result in a memory leak. The issue could be repeatedly
exploited to cause an extended DoS condition. Connected door
hardware, such as card readers, locks, and other input/output devices
will function intermittently during extended DoS exploitation. Doors
will remain open or locked depending on the gateway's configuration.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

This vulnerability has been corrected in Cisco Physical Access
Gateway software version 1.1 and can be downloaded from the following
link:

http://tools.cisco.com/support/downloads/go/Redirect.x?mdfid=280588231

Workarounds
===========

No workarounds are available; however, mitigations that can be
deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the
Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this
advisory, which is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20090624-gateway.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing, or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http:/ www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
