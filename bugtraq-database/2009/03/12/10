Subject: Trellis Desk v1.0 XSS Vulnerability

This problem has been reported to the author but no action taken to resolve the issue.

The search box does not sanitise data and is open to simple XSS SQL injection.

file sources/article.php find around line 519
$searchstring = $this->ifthd->input['keywords'];

Needs to have the following line added after...
$searchstring = mysql_real_escape_string( $searchstring );
