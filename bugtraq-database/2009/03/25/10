I noticed that as well, but suspected they were notified via more then 
one mechanism or had already found the bug internally. I find it funny 
that they had the final code ready on the 28th, but still didn't get it 
out to the public for another 2 weeks.  I suppose they ran it through 
one last QA procedure, or they just don't like to deliver things early.
