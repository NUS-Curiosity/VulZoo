References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0062

Description:
    Previous versions of the ISC DHCP server were vulnerable to denial
    of service or arbitrary code execution attacks via malformed DHCP
    packets with a large dhcp-max-message-size that trigger a
    stack-based buffer overflow.
    
    Note that rPath Linux 2 is susceptible only to a Denial of Service
    in this case, due to the stack protector feature enabled as part of
    rPath Linux 2.
