Synopsis
========

A missing boundary check in Samba might lead to the disclosure of
memory contents.

Background
==========

Samba is a suite of SMB and CIFS client/server programs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/samba      < 3.0.33                              >= 3.0.33

Description
===========

Samba does not properly check memory boundaries when handling trans,
rans2, and nttrans requests.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests to a Samba
daemon, leading to the disclosure of arbitrary memory or to a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.33"
