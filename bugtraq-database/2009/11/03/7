I was speaking about single file bind-mounts, not directories.

# touch /tmp/a
# mount --bind /etc/passwd /tmp/a
# ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1990 2009-08-24 16:22 /etc/passwd
# cat /tmp/a
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
[...]

Two references to the same inode, yet the link count is 1 and /proc is
nowhere in the picture.
