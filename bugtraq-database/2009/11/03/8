Nobody will ever need that, since sockets are bidirectional and their file 
descriptors are in fact both readable and writable. But changing access mode of 
regular and special files, directories and even pipes file descriptors is in 
fact possible and could be accomplished rather easily by checking the 
corresponding inode (this is true at least for Linux).
