-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to deny services on vulnerable
installations of Novell eDirectory. Authentication is not required in
order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within Novell's eDirectory Server's LDAP
implementation. Novell eDirectory's NDSD process binds to port 389/TCP
for handling LDAP requests. When the service processes a search request
with an undefined BaseDN, it will become unresponsive resulting in an
inability to query or authenticate to that server.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
