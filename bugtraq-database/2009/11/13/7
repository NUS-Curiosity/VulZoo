    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1891

Description:
    Previous versions of httpd do not properly handle Options=IncludesNOEXEC
    in the AllowOverride directive, which allows local users to gain
    privileges via a specially crafted .htaccess file combined with an exec
    element in a .shtml file.
    
    Additionally, two similar vulnerabilities exist -- one in mod_proxy, 
    and one in mod_deflate -- which could allow a remote attacker 
    to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted requests.
    
    These three issues have been addressed in this release.
