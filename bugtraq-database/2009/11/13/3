    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1890

Description:
    Previous versions of httpd do not properly handle Options=IncludesNOEXEC
    in the AllowOverride directive, which allows local users to gain
    privileges via a specially crafted .htaccess file combined with an exec
    element in a .shtml file.
    
    Additionally, when a reverse proxy is configured, a vulnerability in 
    mod_proxy could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
    (CPU consumption) via crafted requests.
    
    Both of these issues have been addressed in this release.
