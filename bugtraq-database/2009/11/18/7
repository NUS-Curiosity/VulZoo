4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Serv-U, which can 
be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a 
vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in a function when 
processing a hexadecimal representation of a string using a TEA 
decoding algorithm. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based 
buffer overflow by passing an overly long string.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
