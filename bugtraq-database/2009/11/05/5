-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun Java Runtime Environment. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the processing of arguments to the
setBytePixels AWT library function. Due to the lack of bounds checking
on the parameters to the function a user controllable memcpy can result
in a heap overflow. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can
lead to remote system compromise under the credentials of the currently
logged in user.

Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
