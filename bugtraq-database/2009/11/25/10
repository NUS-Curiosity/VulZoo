Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark, allowing
for the remote execution of arbitrary code, or Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Wireshark is a versatile network protocol analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/wireshark       < 1.2.3                     >= 1.2.3

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark:

* Ryan Giobbi reported an integer overflow in wiretap/erf.c
  (CVE-2009-3829).

* The vendor reported multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the
  Bluetooth L2CAP, RADIUS, and MIOP dissectors (CVE-2009-2560), in the
  OpcUa dissector (CVE-2009-3241), in packet.c in the GSM A RR
  dissector (CVE-2009-3242), in the TLS dissector (CVE-2009-3243), in
  the Paltalk dissector (CVE-2009-3549), in the DCERPC/NT dissector
  (CVE-2009-3550), and in the dissect_negprot_response() function in
  packet-smb.c in the SMB dissector (CVE-2009-3551).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted "erf"
file using Wireshark, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application. A remote
attacker could furthermore send specially crafted packets on a network
being monitored by Wireshark or entice a user to open a malformed
packet trace file using Wireshark, possibly resulting in a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-1.2.3"
