Advisory ID: SWRX-2009-001
Advisory URL: http://www.secureworks.com/ctu/advisories/SWRX-2009-001
Date published: Wednesday, November 11, 2009
CVE: CVE-2009-3565
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (Medium) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
Date of last update: Wednesday, November 11, 2009
Vendors contacted: McAfee, Inc.
Release mode: Coordinated release
Discovered by: Daniel King, SecureWorks


Summary
McAfee Network Security Manager is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using vulnerable parameters in a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim�s web browser within the security context of the Network Security Manager site.


Affected Products
McAfee Network Security Manager (NSM), version 5.1.7.7 (default configuration).
It is unknown which other versions, if any, are affected as of November 11, 2009.


Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

McAfee has provided a new release to address this security flaw. Upgrade NSM software to NSM 5.1.11.6 or above, available for McAfee NSM clients at:
https://secure.nai.com/apps/downloads/my_products/login.asp

More information is available from McAfee at:

Follow best practices of placing the security management console on a segregated management network. Apply restrictive, default-deny firewall policies to protect these assets from access by unauthorized users.

Do not perform administrative access of security management consoles from computers exposed to the Internet through web browsing, email, and other applications. Lock down and heavily monitor systems used to perform administrative tasks such as accessing security management consoles.


Details
User-controllable input supplied by the �iaction� and �node� parameters to the �Login.jsp� page is not properly sanitized for invalid or malicious content prior to being returned to the user in dynamically generated web content. This condition may aid an attacker in retrieving session cookies, stealing recently submitted data, or launching further attacks. 


SecureWorks Risk Scoring
Likelihood: 2 � Best practice is to deploy the management console web application on a segmented management network.
Impact: 5 � Control over security appliances managed by the management console.


CVSS Severity (version 2.0)
Access Vector: Network exploitable; Victim must voluntarily interact with attack mechanism
Access Complexity: Medium
Authentication: Not required to exploit
Impact Type: Allows unauthorized modification
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: Partial
Availability Impact: None
Impact Subscore: 2.9
Exploitability Subscore: 8.6
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (Medium) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
