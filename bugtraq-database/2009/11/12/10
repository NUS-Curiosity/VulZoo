I. BACKGROUND --------------------- 

"Microsoft Office Excel is a powerful tool you can use to create and
format spreadsheets, and analyze and share information to make more
informed decisions. With the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface,
rich data visualization, and PivotTable views, professional-looking
charts are easier to create and use." from microsoft.com


II. DESCRIPTION --------------------- 

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered four critical vulnerabilities
affecting Microsoft Office Excel.

These vulnerabilities are caused by memory corruptions, invalid index,
and invalid pointer errors when processing malformed Excel documents,
which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a specially
crafted XLS file.
