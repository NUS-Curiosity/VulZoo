Subject: Re: New vulnerability in Xerox Fiery Webtools

There is no SQL Injection Vulnerability in WebTools as we are not using Database. MyDocs url ("/wt3/
summary.php?select=") is safe as "select" is just name of a variable and the name is nothing to do with select command in SQL.

Please provide details about the Fiery model and version so that we can close this report.
