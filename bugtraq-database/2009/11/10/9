-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. Authentication is not
required on certain configurations to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of RPC calls to the License
Logging Service (llssrv.exe). When processing arguments to the
LlsrLicenseRequestW method a character array is expected to contain a
terminating null byte. By supplying data that does not end in a null it
is possible to overlap a call to lstrcatW, resulting in a heap overflow.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote system
compromise under the credentials of the SYSTEM account.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
