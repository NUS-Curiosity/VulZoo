 Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 11.10.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 10, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Word is a word processing application that is part of the
Microsoft Office suite of products. For more information about
Microsoft Word, see following web site.

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in
Microsoft Corp.'s Word could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the targeted user.

This vulnerability occurs when Word parses the File Information Block
(FIB) structure inside a Word document. When a malformed FIB structure
is processed, a stack buffer overflow will occur which can lead to an
exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the
affected host under the context of the user opening the file.

Exploitation might require that the user open a specially crafted word
document with a vulnerable application. The most likely exploitation
vector involves convincing a user to open a word document sent to them
via e-mail or linked on a website.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed fully patched Microsoft Word 2003 SP3, Microsoft
Word XP SP3, Microsoft Word 2000 SP3 are vulnerable.

Microsoft Word 2007 SP1 is not affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue. Since the vulnerability occurs in the core parsing code, it is
not possible to disable the affected module.

User awareness is the best defense against this type of attack. Users
should not follow links or open attachments from untrusted sources or
that are received unexpectedly from trusted sources.
