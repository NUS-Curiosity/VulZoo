ZDI-09-089: Microsoft Windows Intel Indeo Codec Parsing Heap Overflow Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-089
December 8, 2009

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4
Microsoft Windows XP SP3
Microsoft Windows 2003 SP2

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows Media Player. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the Intel Indeo41 codec which is
accessed by various applications through the Video Compression Manager.
This codec is registered to handle IV41 streams within a container such
as the AVI format. Due to the lack of bounds checking on a specified
size within the 'movi' record a heap overflow can occur. If successfully
exploited this vulnerability can allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the user accessing the file.


-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
