 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:276-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python-django
 Date    : December 8, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in python-django:
 
 The Admin media handler in core/servers/basehttp.py in Django 1.0
 and 0.96 does not properly map URL requests to expected static media
 files, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal
 attacks and read arbitrary files via a crafted URL (CVE-2009-2659).
 
 Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in the forms library in Django
 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.1 allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted (1) EmailField
 (email address) or (2) URLField (URL) that triggers a large amount
 of backtracking in a regular expression (CVE-2009-3695).
 
 The versions of Django shipping with Mandriva Linux have been updated
 to the latest patched version that include the fix for this issue.
 In addition, they provide other bug fixes.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
