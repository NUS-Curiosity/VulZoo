Subject: RE: Tests about semicolon zero-day (BID 37460)

Okay, here is a good question after read the updated version of HD Moore Blog
post [1]:
(btw, that is the same question we are talking in twitter)
- Based on the blog post "Results of Investigation into Holyday ISS Claim"
(MSRC) [2], there is no vulnerability related to this case, right? BUT... If a
user has a weak password, a guessable password, you can GUESS the user's
password and get the user's access... Getting all the privileges he/she has.

Okay, I know that there are a lot of best practices floating around, describing
many, many ways to enforce the users to create a strong password instead... But
according to my experience in pen-tests, the easiest way to get a system access
is guessing users' passwords. RIGHT?

In a dynamic WWW, things change and "'write' and 'execute' privileges on the
same directory" (QUOTED) [2] is not a "IMPOSSIBLE AND UNBELIEVABLE" thing.

"If the weather is good, the waves are good... Let's surfing!"

So I think they should change the term "not a vulnerability" to "vulnerabilistic
feature"... I know that this word does not exist, anyway. =)

PS: Don't send me any flame if you didn't check the "vulnerability" [3]
definition.
