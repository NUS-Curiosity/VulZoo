3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Lateral Arts 
Photobox uploader ActiveX Control, which can be exploited by 
malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error when parsing URLs. 
This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an 
overly long string assigned to a number of properties (e.g. "LogURL",
"ConnectURL", "SkinURL", "AlbumCreateURL", "ErrorURL", and 
"httpsinglehost").

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a 
user e.g. visits a malicious website.

The vulnerability is confirmed in version 2.2.0.6. Other versions may 
also be affected.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

According to the vendor (Lateral Arts), the vulnerability is fixed
in version 1.3 of the upstream version.
