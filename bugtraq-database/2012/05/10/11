Package        : file
Vulnerability  : regression fix
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1571

A regression was discovered in the security update for file, which
lead to false positives on the CDF format. This update fixes that
regression. For reference the original advisory text follows.

The file type identification tool, file, and its associated library,
libmagic, do not properly process malformed files in the Composite
Document File (CDF) format, leading to crashes.

Note that after this update, file may return different detection
results for CDF files (well-formed or not). The new detections are
believed to be more accurate.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.04-5+squeeze2.

We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.
