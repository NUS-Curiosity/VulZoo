Subject: things you can do with downloads

Another moderately interesting tidbit, I guess...

It is an important and little-known property of web browsers that one
document can always navigate other, non-same-origin windows to
arbitrary URLs. Perhaps more interestingly, you can also navigate
third-party documents to resources served with Content-Disposition:
attachment, in which case, you get the original contents of the
address bar, plus a rogue download prompt attached to an unsuspecting
page that never wanted you to download that file.

It's closely related to many other fundamental, open issues with
browser UI design - but I guess it's an interesting highlight.
