3rd Workshop on Security and Privacy in Social Networks

Call for Papers

Third International Workshop on Security and Privacy in Social Networks 2012 (SPSN-2012) in conjunction with IEEE SocialCom 2012, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, September 3-6, 2012
http://spsn12.media.mit.edu/index.html

Scope of Workshop:

The workshop aims to bring to the forefront innovative approaches for analyzing and enhancing the security and privacy dimensions in online social networks. In order to facilitate the transition of such methods from theory to mechanisms designed and deployed in existing online social networking services, we need to create a common language between the researchers and practitioners of this new area, spanning from the theory of computational social sciences to conventional security and network engineering.

Objectives:

The guiding goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners who deal with the design and analysis of online social networking side by side with those who design security and privacy protocols, in order to:

1.	Survey and discuss the current state of research that deals with security and privacy in social networks.
2.	Create a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in enabling current social networks to incorporate dedicated security methods.
3.	Create new opportunities and set the ground for future collaboration between participants, generating insights that can be carried forward into future work.
4.	Foster creativity and imagine the underlying technological changes in the way we network and communicate that will take place over the next 5-10 years.

Submission:

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered in another forum. We welcome work in progress in addition to more mature work. Submission could be made in the form of either
•	A short position paper of up to 4 proceedings pages in length.
•	A full-length technical paper of up to 8 proceedings pages in length.

Submission must be in PDF format, in accordance with the IEEE conference paper style (http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 

Submissions should be done via the submissions website at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spsn2012). 

All submitted papers will be reviewed and judged on originality, technical correctness, relevance, and quality of presentation by the Technical Program Committee. 

Should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present the work in order for the paper to be published by IEEE and included in the IEEE Digital Library.

Accepted papers will be included in the IEEE Social Computing proceedings. 
Topics:

The proposed topics for the workshop include but are not limited to the following:

•	Malware propagation in social networks
•	Information leakage via social networks
•	Social currency mechanisms – potential and risks
•	Privacy management in social networks - access controls, permissions
•	Stealing Reality (malicious application of Reality Mining)
•	Identity theft in social networks
•	Collaborative detection of distributed network attacks
•	Peer-to-peer based security mechanisms
•	Trust and reputation in social networks
•	Socially inspired network security architectures
•	Socially aware network security protocols
•	Security configuration based on social contexts groups (social-firewall, authentication protocols, etc.)
•	Configuring security protocol parameters based on social information
•	Privacy-preserving methods for data access and data mining.
