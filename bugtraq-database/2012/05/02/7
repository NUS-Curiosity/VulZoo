Package        : samba
Vulnerability  : missing permission checks
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2111

Ivano Cristofolini discovered that insufficient security checks in
Samba's handling of LSA RPC calls could lead to privilege escalation
by gaining the "take ownership" privilege.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
