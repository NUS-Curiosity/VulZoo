Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : Multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4557 CVE-2012-4929
Debian Bug     : 689936

A vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2012-4557

	A flaw was found when mod_proxy_ajp connects to a backend
	server that takes too long to respond. Given a specific
	configuration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,
	putting a backend server into an error state until the retry
	timeout expired. This could lead to a temporary denial of
	service.

In addition, this update also adds a server side mitigation for the
following issue:

CVE-2012-4929

	If using SSL/TLS data compression with HTTPS in an connection
	to a web browser, man-in-the-middle attackers may obtain
	plaintext HTTP headers. This issue is known as the "CRIME"
	attack. This update of apache2 disables SSL compression by
	default. A new SSLCompression directive has been backported
	that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in
	environments where the "CRIME" attack is not an issue.
	For more information, please refer to:
	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze10.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
