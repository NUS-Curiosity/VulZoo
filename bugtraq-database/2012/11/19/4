Introduction:
=============
Microsoft Exchange Server is, by a distance, the most popular communication, collaboration and email messaging application today! 
MS Exchange serves as the hub of all email communications in most corporate environments that use the Microsoft Active Directory 
technology. It becomes a necessity to have an Exchange reporting tool that will equip and Exchange Administrator with precise, 
granular, comprehensive and actionable data on all aspects of the MS Exchange Server. Exchange Reporter Plus

ManageEngine Exchange Reporter Plus is a web-based analysis and reporting solution for Microsoft Exchange Servers.
Exchange Reporter Plus is a comprehensive and complete MS Exchange reporting software that provides over 70 different reports on 
every aspect of the Microsoft Exchange Server environment. The range includes reports of crucial importance.
A few of the many vital Exchange tasks that can be performed using Exchange Reporter Plus are listed below.
Track incoming and outgoing emails, monitor mailbox size and keep spam away from Active Directory mailboxes with Mailbox Traffic, 
Mailbox Content, and Mailbox Size Reports.
Keep a tab on the number of messages sent and received by each Exchange server using Server Traffic Reports.
Monitor the vital statistics of Exchange Server Public Folders with comprehensive Public Folder Reports.
Generate reports on Distribution Lists and also show the traffic for each distribution by running Distribution Lists Traffic Report!

Exchange Reporter Plus presents these reports in an easily comprehensible format, that even technically naive users will have no hassles 
in creating and interpreting them. In addition to generating these reports in the wink of an eye, also facilitates exporting these reports. 
The reports can be downloaded as xls, csv, pdf or html files for further activities. Curious to know more?? Try Exchange Reporter 
Plus hands-on in our Live Demo!

Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in Exchange Reporter Plus v4.1, a web-based analysis and reporting solution. 
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent vulnerability 
is located in Schedule New Report module with the bound vulnerable Schedule Name Schedule Description parameters. Successful exploitation of 
the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user 
inter action & privileged user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Schedule New Report 

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] Schedule Name 
			[+] Schedule Description 

1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in Exchange Reporter Plus v4.1, a web-based analysis and reporting solution.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required user inter action 
or local low privileged user account. The first vulnerability is located in ReportsIndex.do with the bound vulnerable reportCategoryID parameter. 
The second vulnerability is located in search box for reports. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, client site phishing & client-side 
content request manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Reports


Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] ReportsIndex.do


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+]  reportCategoryID
			[+]  search report


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action & low 
privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

The attacker schedules a new report and inserts in schedule name and schedule description his own malicious javascript or html code.
Then inject the malicious script code i.e., <iframe src=www.vuln-lab.com onload=alert("VL")/>
When the user browses the alarms page in the control panel the persistent injected script code will be 
executed out of the web application context.

1.2
PoC:
http://exchangereporterplus.127.0.0.1:8080/exchange/ReportsIndex.do
?selectedTab=reports&reportCategoryID=3+>"<iframe src=http://www.vuln-lab.com onload=alert("VL")></iframe>

The attacker can go to reports and insert own malicious script code inside of the search report box to exploit the service application.


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the client side cross site vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+).
