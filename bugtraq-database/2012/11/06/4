Subject: Wisecracker 1.0 - A high performance distributed cryptanalysis framework

Wisecracker is an open source high performance distributed
cryptanalysis framework that leverages GPUs and multiple CPUs. It
allows security researchers to write their own cryptanalysis tools
that can distribute brute-force cryptanalysis work across multiple
systems with multiple multi-core processors and GPUs. Security
researchers can also use the sample tools provided out-of-the-box. The
differentiating aspect of Wisecracker is that it uses OpenCL and MPI
together to distribute the work across multiple systems, each having
multiple CPUs and/or GPUs.

As an example an MD5 reversing for 6-8 character strings is provided.
