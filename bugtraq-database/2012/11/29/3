Subject: Oracle Exadata leaf switch logins

Hello,

While evaluating our exadata 1/4 rack I noticed the following issues.


Oracle Exadata leaf switch logins

>From Oracle.com "Oracle Exadata is the only database machine that provides extreme performance for both data warehousing and OLTP applications, making it the ideal platform for consolidating on private clouds. It is a complete package of servers, storage, networking, and software that is massively scalable, secure, and redundant.

The oracle engineered solution contains two leaf switches and in larger installations a spine switch. The installation I worked with didn't have a spine switch, but the two leaf switches were configured with three logins with easily guessable passwords and a shadow file that was world readable.

There are three accounts with easily guessable default passwords on the exadata inifiniband switches:

ilom-admin,ilom-operator and nm2user.
passwords are same as logins
rux0r:~ meep0$ ssh ilom-admin@....168.0.113 "cat /conf/shadow"

The shadow file is world readable:

[root@...d-1swib2 ~]# ls -l /conf/shadow -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 749 Dec 23 2011 /conf/shadow

Vendor: notified 3/12/2012

Oracle pointed me at a doc stating you should rotate these passwords after installation (as far as I recall these engineer solutions are configured/installed by them onsite.). They also weren't concerned about the lax permissions of /etc/shadow.
