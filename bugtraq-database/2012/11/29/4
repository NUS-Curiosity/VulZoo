Video Lead Form plugin description

Video Lead Form is a sales and marketing dream tool. Many people use video as a means of engaging their visitors but then have to find awkward ways to ask their visitors to submit a contact or lead form. Video Lead Form solves this problem by embedding the form directly into the video. Users of Video Lead Form can choose where in the video the form should appear, either at the beginning, the end, or five seconds after the video starts.

When a viewer submits the form, their information is emailed to you, simple as that. Video Lead Form can also be integrated with Salesforce for an even easier way to generate and manage sales leads.
