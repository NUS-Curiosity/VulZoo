Introduction:

Abstract:
=========
The Security Effect Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the russian Bce NetCat v5.0.1 content management system.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-10-31:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple client side cross site scripting and http parameter pollution vulnerabilities are detected in the russian Bce NetCat v5.0.1 content management system.
The non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to form malicious client side web requests to steal cms customer session 
information. The client side crlf vulnerability allows remote attackers to change the GET and POST request with own values to manipulate the http protocol request.

The first client side cross site scripting vulnerability is located in the search module with the bound vulnerable search_query application parameter.
The secound http parameter pollution vulnerability is located in the post.php file when processing to request via the bound vulnerable redirect_url 
parameter request.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities can result in client side http parameter manipulation via post/get, client side phishing, client side 
cookie stealing via cross site scripting and client side cms web context manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] search
				[+] post

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] search_query
				[+] redirect_url


Proof of Concept:
=================
1. Client Side - Cross Site Scripting
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user 
account and with medium or high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1 - In URL address.

PoC:
http://site.127.0.0.1:3666/?’ onmouseover=’prompt(document.cookie)’bad=’>


1.2 - In “search_query” parameter.

PoC:
http://site.127.0.0.1:3666/search/?search_query=’ onmouseover=prompt(document.cookie) bad=’



2. Client Side via POST - CRLF injection/HTTP Parameter Pollution
The client side crlf vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user 
account and with medium or high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

In /netcat/modules/netshop/post.php URL encoded POST input redirect_url was set to NetCatStatus:hacked_by_seceffect

PoC: POST
http://site.127.0.0.1:3666/netcat/modules/netshop/post.php
cart%5b353%5d%5b10%5d=1&cart_mode=add&redirect_url=%0d%0a%20NetCatStatus:hacked_by_seceffect


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+)|(-)medium.

1.2
The security risk of the http parameter pollution vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).
