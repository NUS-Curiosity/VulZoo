Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in Acc PHP eMail v1.1.



Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-13:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in Acc PHP eMail v1.1. The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or 
local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected 
application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] index.php?action=email_modify&conf=0&id=57[SQLi]


1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Acc PHP eMail v1.1 The bugs allow remote attackers to 
implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead 
to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.
                                       
Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] index.php?action=email_modify&conf=0&id=57 - inject  code in the mail box



Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required user inter action.
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with medium required user inter action. 
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
http://www.xxx.com/mailinglist/demo/index.php?action=email_modify&conf=0&id=-57+union+select+version()--%20-&limit=0&order=id_user

1.2
The issue can be exploited by an insert on the Created Object function with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context.

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the pre auth sql injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the persisten input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium.
