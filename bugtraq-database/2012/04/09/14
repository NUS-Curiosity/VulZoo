4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in RealNetworks
Helix Server, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a
Denial of Service.

1) An error in the SNMP Master Agent process (master.exe) can be
exploited to terminate the service by establishing and immediately
closing a TCP connection on port 705.

2) An input validation error when processing the "DisplayString" of
SNMP object idenfiers can be exploited to cause an unhandled exception
and terminate the SNMP Master Agent service (master.exe) via a
specially crafted "Open-PDU" request sent to TCP port 705.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 14.3.x.
