My ideas for a fix, so far:

It is tempting to add O_NOFOLLOW to the relevant open() calls, maybe by
changing the string "open" to something else:
  perl -i.bak -pe 's/open/PSzO/g' SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux*/libML*.so
and LD_PRELOAD a library built from something like
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/stat.h>
  #include <fcntl.h>
  int PSzO(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode)
  {
    return open(pathname, flags|O_NOFOLLOW, mode);
  }
but that would not work: I believe those files in /tmp/MathLink allow
other processes to send commands to the running Mathematica session,
possibly including shell escapes.

The fix might be to make the directory in /tmp private to the user,
naming it /tmp/MathLink-$USER and checking it has right owner and
"chmod 0700" permissions. That fix will need to be implemented by
Wolfram.

Cheers, Paul
