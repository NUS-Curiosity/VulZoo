[Bug Summary]

- Persistent/Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (A common user can
launch Xss attack using the any fields (First Name,Last Name and
others). This Xss is executed in any other logged user context,
included admin)


- Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Must a valid session.

[Impact]

- Medium


[Affected Version]

- 6.1 build 20596

[Not Affected Version]

6.1 HF10, build 22595



[Bug Description and Proof of Concept]


- Exploiting the HTML-injection issue allows an attacker to execute
HTML and Java Script code in the remote user context to steal
cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is
rendered to the user; other attacks may also be possible.

- Moreover, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are caused due
to lack of input validation. This allows malicious people to inject
arbitrary HTML and script code. More info at:
