Credits:

Fayo of Application Security Inc.

Details:
SQL Injection works by attempting to modify the parameters passed to an
application to change the SQL statements that are passed to a database.
SQL injection can be used to insert additional SQL statements to be
executed.
The 'SCPLBL_INSTALLED_DATE0DI' parameter used in web page
/em/console/ecm/search/searchPage is vulnerable to SQL Injection
attacks. This web page is part of Oracle Enterprise Manager web
application. It may be possible for a malicious user to execute SQL
statements with the elevated privileges of the SYSMAN database user in
the repository database. This user has the DBA role granted.

Impact:
This vulnerability allows an Oracle Enterprise Manager user to execute
SQL statements with the elevated privileges of the SYSMAN database user.
This may also be exploited by an attacker that convinces a valid user to
click or open a malicious link.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

There is no workaround for this vulnerability.
