Details:
HTTP Response Splitting is a web application vulnerability where input
parameters are unsafely used in response headers allowing an attacker to
make the server print one (or more) new line sequences in the header
section which allows to set arbitrary headers, take control of the body,
or break the response into two or more separate responses.  This can be
used to perform cross-site scripting, cross-user defacement and web
cache poisoning, among other attacks.
The 'pageName' parameter of web page
/em/console/database/schema/grantObjPrivs is vulnerable to this kind of
attacks.

Impact:
An attacker that convinces a valid Oracle Enterprise Manager user to
click or open a malicious link can take over the user's session.
