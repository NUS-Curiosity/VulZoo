         CVE Name       CVE-2012-4737                                         

    Description  When an IAX2 call is made using the credentials of a peer    
                 defined in a dynamic Asterisk Realtime Architecture (ARA)    
                 backend, the ACL rules for that peer are not applied to the  
                 call attempt. This allows for a remote attacker who is       
                 aware of a peer's credentials to bypass the ACL rules set    
                 for that peer.                                               

    Resolution  The ACL rules for peers defined in an ARA backend are now     
                honored. Users of chan_iax2 should upgrade to the corrected   
                versions; apply a provided patch; or define their IAX2 peers  
                outside of an ARA backend in a static configuration file.
