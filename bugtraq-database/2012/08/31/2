                 CVE-2012-3531

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in TYPO3, a content management
system.

CVE-2012-3527
	An insecure call to unserialize in the help system enables
	arbitrary code execution by authenticated users.

CVE-2012-3528
	The TYPO3 backend contains several cross-site scripting
	vulnerabilities.

CVE-2012-3529
	Authenticated users who can access the configuration module
	can obtain the encryption key, allowing them to escalate their
	privileges.

CVE-2012-3530
	The RemoveXSS HTML sanitizer did not remove several HTML5
	JavaScript, thus failing to mitigate the impact of cross-site
	scripting vulnerabilities.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.5.19+dfsg1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.
