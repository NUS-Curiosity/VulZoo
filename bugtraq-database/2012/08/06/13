Introduction:
=============
Joomla is a free and open source content management system (CMS) for publishing content on the World
Wide Web and intranets and a model–view–controller (MVC) Web application framework that can also be
used independently.
Joomla is written in PHP, uses object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and software design
patterns, stores data in a MySQL database, and includes features such as page caching,
RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, polls, search, and support for language
internationalization.
Joomla had been downloaded 23 million times. Between March 2007 and February 2011 there had been
more than 21 million downloads. As of November 2011, there are over 8,600 free and commercial
extensions available from the official Joomla! Extension Directory and more available from other sources.

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability-Lab researcher discovered a SQL injection vulnerability in the com_package module of the joomla CMS.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-07-08:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure



Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the com_package module of the joomla Content Management System.
Remote attackers & low privileged user accounts can execute/inject own sql commands to compromise the application dbms.
The vulnerability is located in the com_package module with the bound vulnerable id parameter. Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability result in dbms (Server) or application (Web) compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] index.php?option=com_package

Vulnerable Parameter(s):		
				[+] id


Proof of Concept:
=================
The SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account or 
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:

Path:		/
File:		index.php
Module:		?option=com_package
Parameter:	details&id=-1'[SQL Injection]--
URL:		http://www.xxx.com/index.php?option=com_package&task=details&id=174-1'[SQL Injection]--
