- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore() in
content/base/src/nsGenericElement.cpp. A use-after-free condition can be
triggered by adding an already parented option element to an option
collection and then removing its associated select element during an event
handler execution. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will lead
to code execution in the context of the browser.
