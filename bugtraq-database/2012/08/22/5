originally developed by David Barrett, that uses plain text files to
store data. The 'engine' is used to edit the data as well as to format
it and present it as a web page. Significant modifications were done
to the codes of this wiki for bugs and enhancements (XHTML compliance,
UTF-8 encoding, backup maintainance, page deletion, etc.) by Santosh
Patnaik (SP) who also largely seeded the wiki with new and old
(non-wiki) documents.
