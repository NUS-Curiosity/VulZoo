ZDI-12-137 : Apple Mac OS X libsecurity_cdsa_plugin Malloc Integer
Truncation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-137
August 17, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0651

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Apple

- -- Affected Products:
Apple OS X

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Mac OSX. Authentication is not required
to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the libsecurity_cdsa_plugin which implements
routines defined in libsecurity_cssm. The library defines an allocation
routine as having an argument type uint32. The implemented methods in the
cdsa_plugin accept parameter having type size_t, this value is truncated
from 64 bits to 32 bits when being passed to the library routine. This can
lead to an underallocated memory region and ultimately a write out of
bounds. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the process.

- -- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
