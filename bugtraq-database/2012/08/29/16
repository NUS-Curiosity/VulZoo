10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP SiteScope. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists because HP SiteScope allows unauthenticated SOAP
calls to be made to the SiteScope service. One of those calls is
loadFileContent() which will return the content of any local file on the
server including the configuration files containing password information.
This can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current
process.

- -- Vendor Response:


- -- Mitigation:
Given the stated purpose of SiteScope, and the nature of the vulnerability,
the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the
service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a
legitimate procedural relationship with the HP SiteScope service should be
permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of
ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are
available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
