ZDI-12-150 : Oracle Outside In XPM Processing Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-150
August 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

- -- Affected Products:
Oracle Outside In

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable products utilizing the Oracle Outside In Technology. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of XPM files. When parsing the
chars_per_pixel element the code within vsgdsf.dll does not validate that
the data can fit within a stack buffer prior to copying it. This can be
leveraged by a remote attacker to execute code under the context of the
user running the application. 

- -- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
