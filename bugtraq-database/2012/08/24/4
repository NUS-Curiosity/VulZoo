This looks a lot like what muuratsalo has discovered some time ago: http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/76934 (there is more similar issues in OSVDB if you use advanced search). If I remember correctly from muuratsalo's emails he did get contact to vendor, but vendor did not fix all issues and wasn't co-operative in discussion.

Do you think NS-12-007 and NS-12-008 are new issues? If so we should request CVE-identifiers if these differ a lot of other XSS-issues. At the point where vendor does not fix issues like these nor reply I would say that people shouldn't be using the software at all.
