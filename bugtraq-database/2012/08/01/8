4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Citrix Access
Gateway Plug-in for Windows, which can be exploited by malicious
people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow error in the 
nsepacom ActiveX control (nsepa.exe) when processing HTTP responses
based on the request via the "StartEpa()" method. This can be 
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially
crafted "Content-Length" HTTP response header.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
