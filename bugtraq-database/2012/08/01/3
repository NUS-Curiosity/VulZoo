Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the Barracuda  SSL VPN 680 appliance application.

Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Barracuda Networks
Product: SSL VPN Appliance v680 - 2.2.2.115


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in Barracuda SSL VPN 680 v2.2.2.115 appliance application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required 
user inter action. The bugs are located in the fileSystem.do, showUserResourceCategories.do,launchAgent.do files with the bound 
vulnerable  policyLaunching, resourcePrefix, path & return-To parameters. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, 
phishing & client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] showUserResourceCategories.do&messageResourcesKey=resourceCategory
				[+] fileSystem.do?launchId=l52ca6d&actionTarget=list&path=
				[+] launchAgent.do

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] policyLaunching & resourcePrefix
				[+] list&path
				[+] return-To


Proof of Concept:
=================
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium or high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

Solution:
=========
2012-07-14:	Vendor Fix/Patch by Barracuda Networks


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(-).
