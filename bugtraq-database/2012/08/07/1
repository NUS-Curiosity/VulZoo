Package        : globus-gridftp-server
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3292

It was discovered that the GridFTP component from the Globus Toolkit, a 
toolkit used for building Grid systems and applications performed
insufficient validation of a name lookup, which could lead to privilege 
escalation.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.23-1+squeeze1 of the globus-gridftp-server source package
and in version 0.43-1+squeeze1 of the globus-gridftp-server-control
source package

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your globus-gridftp-server packages.
