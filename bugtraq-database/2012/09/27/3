+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
implementation in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software that
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected
device to reload. Affected devices must be configured to process SIP
messages and for pass-through of Session Description Protocol (SDP)
for this vulnerability to be exploitable.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. There are no workarounds for devices that must run SIP;
however, mitigations are available to limit exposure to the
vulnerability.
