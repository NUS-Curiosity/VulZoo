  NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2010-2595
  An array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input." in the
  TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function causes an unexpected crash.

CVE-2010-2597
  Also related to "downsampled OJPEG input", the TIFFVStripSize function crash

  codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file.

CVE-2010-4665
  The tiffdump utility has an integer overflow in the ReadDirectory function.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
