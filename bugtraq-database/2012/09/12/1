Package        : freeradius
Vulnerability  : stack-based buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 687175
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3547

Timo Warns discovered that the EAP-TLS handling of freeradius, a
high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server, is not properly
performing length checks on user-supplied input before copying to a local
stack buffer.  As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this
flaw to crash the daemon or execute arbitrary code via crafted
certificates.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.10+dfsg-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.12+dfsg-1.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your freeradius packages.
