Affected Products
======== ========

Confirmed in latest Configfree version 8.0.38 on Windows 7 on a Toshiba 
Satellite R850. Other versions may also be affected.


Details
=======

The ‘profileName’ field of the cf7 file is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.

ConfigFree is the registered file handler for the cf7 filetype (CFProfile.exe 
at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\cf7_auto_file\shell\open\command) so if a user could 
be convinced to download a malicious cf7 file and execute it, the stack 
buffer overflow vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the 
victim's machine. 


Impact
======

If a user could be convinced to download a malicious cf7 file and execute it, 
the stack buffer overflow vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary 
code on the victim's machine. 


Solution
========

As no fix is available, concerned users can remove this utility from their machine.
