Subject: IPv6 Toolkit v1.2.3 released! (and upcoming IPv6 security trainings)

Folks,

I realize we never announced the toolkit on these lists, so here you go.

** SI6 Networks' IPv6 toolkit **

We've released SI6 Networks' IPv6 toolkit v1.2.3. It is available at:
<http://www.si6networks.com/ipv6toolkit>.

The toolkit contains a number of IPv6 security/troubleshooting tools,
such as:

* An IPv6 local network scanner (scan6)
* An IPv6 fragmentation attack/assessment tool (frag6)
* A tool to craft arbitrary TCP/IPv6 segments (tcp6)
* A tool to craft arbitrary Router Advertisements (ra6)
.... and many, many others

This version of the toolkit has been fully-ported to Mac OS (the list of
supported systems now including, at the very least, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, Linux, and Mac OS), and also incorporates a number of patches
sent by the community.

Any feedback on the tools will be welcome (either unicast to me, or to
the ipv6hackers mailing-list
<http://lists.si6networks.com/listinfo/ipv6hackers/>).


** IPv6 security trainings **

Development of the IPv6 toolkit is partially supported through our IPv6
security trainings <http://www.hackingipv6networks.com>. Please consider
attending one of our trainings. The list of already-scheduled trainings
can be found at: <http://www.hackingipv6networks.com/upcoming-t>, and
currently includes trainings in Ghent (Belgium), Lisbon (Portugal), and
Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).
