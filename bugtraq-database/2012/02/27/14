Basically, you're saying that if I have the rights of a user on a
machine, I can access the private conversations of that user? Ooooh
no. Well, I can also copy his keyfiles, no? And I can alter his
settings. And spawn fake "Update didn't work, please enter root
password to proceed" windows. I could alter his ~/.bashrc so that
whenever he launches "sudo" or "su", a script is launched instead that
grabs his password. So, please, what's the point?
