Introduction:
=============
OSQA is the Open Source Q&A System. It is free software licensed under the GPL, and you can download the source code 
for OSQA from our Subversion server. OSQA is originally based on CNProg, an excellent Chinese Q&A web application written 
by Mike Chen and Sailing Cai. OSQA is written in Python and powered by the Django application framework. 


Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Lab Research Team discovered multiple persistent Input Validation Vulnerabilities on OSQAs CMS v3b.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-02-27:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected on OSQAs CMS v3b. The vulnerability allows remote attackers 
to hijack customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required user inter action or local low privileged user account & medium 
required user inter action. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing & application-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                                              [+] Url Bar
                                                              [+] Picture Bar
                                                              [+] Blockquote


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by local low privileged user accounts or remote attackers with high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

XSS #1 
http://localhost/questions/ask/ press url bar & put xss code <img src="<img src=search"/onerror=alert("xss")//">

XSS #2  
http://localhost/questions/ask/ press picture bar & put xss code <img src="<img src=search"/onerror=alert("xss")//">


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(-).
