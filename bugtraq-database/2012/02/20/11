Subject: Dolphin 7.0.7 <= Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

1. OVERVIEW

Dolphin 7.0.7 and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.


2. BACKGROUND

Dolphin is the only "all-in-one" free community software platform for
creating your own social networking, community or online dating site
without any limits and under your full control. Dolphin comes with
hundreds of features, module plugins and tools. Everything is included
and extension posibilities are literally endless. You can use it for
free with a BoonEx link in the footer or buy a $99 permanent license
to remove that requirement.
