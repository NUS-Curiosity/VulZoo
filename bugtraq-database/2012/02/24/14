Subject: Security advisory for Bugzilla 4.2 and 4.0.5

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A CSRF vulnerability in the implementation of the XML-RPC API
  when running under mod_perl could be used to make changes to
  bugs or execute some admin tasks without the victim's knowledge.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Versions:    4.0.2 to 4.0.4, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc2
Fixed In:    4.0.5, 4.2
Description: Due to a lack of validation of the enctype form
             attribute when making POST requests to xmlrpc.cgi,
             a possible CSRF vulnerability was discovered. If a user
             visits an HTML page with some malicious HTML code in it,
             an attacker could make changes to a remote Bugzilla
             installation on behalf of the victim's account by using
             the XML-RPC API on a site running mod_perl. Sites running
             under mod_cgi are not affected. Also the user would have
             had to be already logged in to the target site for
             the vulnerability to work.
