February  8, 2012

7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Total Defense



- -- Affected Products:

Total Defense CA Total Defense

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to remotely obtain domain
credentials on vulnerable installations of CA Total Defense Suite UNC
Management Web Service. Authentication is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the App_Code.dll service listening by
default on TCP ports 34444 and 34443 (SSL). The service allows a remote
client to request encrypted domain credentials without authentication.
The encryption lacks a salt allowing an attacker with a local
installation of CA Total Defense Suite UNC Management Web Service to
easily decrypt the credentials.

- -- Vendor Response:


Total Defense states:
We are pleased to confirm that all three vulns that were reported by
Tipping Point were proactively closed as part of the Total Defense R12
SE3 (Build 831) release cycle.  This SE3 release is publicly shipping
from our download links since December 5th, 2011.  Physical media (DVD)
is currently in production for those clients seeking that option as
opposed to a download and we will be shipping those DVDs in early
January 2012 based on the production schedule.
