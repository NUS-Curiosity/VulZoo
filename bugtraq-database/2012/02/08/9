- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of CA Total Defense Suite. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the uncsp_ViewReportsHomepage stored
procedure, accessed via the management.asmx console. The Management Web
Service listens for SOAP 1.2 requests on port 34444 for HTTP and 34443
for HTTPS. Due to a flaw in the implementation of the
uncsp_ViewReportsHomepage stored procedure, it is possible for a remote,
unauthenticated user to inject arbitrary SQL commands in the SOAP
request--which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under
the context of the SYSTEM user by invoking an exec function.

- -- Vendor Response:


Total Defense states:
We are pleased to confirm that all three vulns that were reported by
Tipping Point were proactively closed as part of the Total Defense R12
SE3 (Build 831) release cycle.  This SE3 release is publicly shipping
from our download links since December 5th, 2011.  Physical media (DVD)
