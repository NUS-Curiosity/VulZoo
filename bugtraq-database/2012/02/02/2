APPLE-SA-2012-02-01-1 OS X Lion v10.7.3 and Security Update 2012-001

OS X Lion v10.7.3 and Security Update 2012-001 is now available and
addresses the following:

Address Book
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.2,
OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.2
Impact:  An attacker in a privileged network position may intercept
CardDAV data
Description:  Address Book supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for
accessing CardDAV. A downgrade issue caused Address Book to attempt
an unencrypted connection if an encrypted connection failed. An
attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this behavior
to intercept CardDAV data. This issue is addressed by not downgrading
to an unencrypted connection without user approval.
