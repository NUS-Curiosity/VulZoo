- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of XML elements within a TeXML
file. Specifically, when handling the transform attribute the code within
QuickTime3GPP.qtx does not properly validate the length of the data within
a translate or matrix object before copying it into a fixed-length buffer
on the stack. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running
Quicktime.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
