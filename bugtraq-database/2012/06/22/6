- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of DataDirect SequeLink. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a packet that is
received. When parsing a field in this packet, the application will use a
signed length to copy data into a statically sized buffer located on the
heap. This can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow  and allows for code
execution under the context of the service.

- -- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
