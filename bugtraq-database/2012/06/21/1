Debian Bug     : 676510

It was discovered that Quagga, a routing daemon, contains a
vulnerability in processing the ORF capability in BGP OPEN messages.
A malformed OPEN message from a previously configured BGP peer could
cause bgpd to crash, causing a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.99.21-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
