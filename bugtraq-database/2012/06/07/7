- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of MP4 files. A size value is
read from MP4 files and used for size calculation without proper
validation. The arithmetic performed on the size value can cause integer
overflows, resulting in undersized allocations. This undersized memory
allocation can be subsequently overpopulated with data supplied by the
input file which can be used to gain remote code execution under the
context of the current process. 

- -- Vendor Response:

Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
