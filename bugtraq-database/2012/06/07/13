- -- CVE ID:

CVE-2011-4260

- -- CVSS:

7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks

- -- Affected Products:

- -- Vulnerability Details:

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the raac.dll module. By editing the stsz
atom in the mp4 file data, an attacker could change a sample size to force
a loop in raac.dll to loop too many times, causing heap corruption. This
vulnerability can be leveraged to execute code under the context of the
user running the application.
