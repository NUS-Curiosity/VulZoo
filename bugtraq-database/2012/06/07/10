June  6, 2012

- -- CVE ID:

CVE-2012-0926

- -- CVSS:

9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks

- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required in that a target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious
file. 

The flaw exists within the RV10 encoded data in the rv10.dll component.
When encountering an invalid encoded height or width field the process
miscalculates an offset while preparing to decode the data packets which
constitute the stream. The process attempts to store data at this location.
A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the process.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
