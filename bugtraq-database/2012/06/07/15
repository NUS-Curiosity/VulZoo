- -- Vulnerability Details:

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable applications using DataDirect's SequeLink. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within how the application processes GIOP packets.
When processing a specific GIOP packet, the application will trust a size
field in the packet. The application will use this size in a copy operation
into a statically sized buffer which can cause a buffer overflow. This can
lead to code execution under the context of the service.

- -- Vendor Response:

Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
