ZDI-12-076 : Apple QuickTime MPEG Stream Padding Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-076
June  6, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0659

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Apple

- -- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's QuickTime Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application calculates the padding
for an MPEG sample. When calculating the padding, the MPEG library will
subtract this from another length without checking for underflow. This
resulting length will then be used in a memcpy operation into a statically
sized buffer allocated on the heap. This can lead to code execution under
the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
