ZDI-12-077 : Apple QuickTime QTVR QTVRStringAtom Parsing Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-077

June  6, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0667

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Apple

- -- Affected Products:

Apple QuickTime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the QuickTimeVR.qtx component. A signedness
error exists when processing a QTVRStringAtom having an overly large
"stringLength" parameter. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
