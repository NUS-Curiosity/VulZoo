ZDI-12-075 : Apple Quicktime RLE Sample Decoding Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-075

June  6, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0668

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Apple

- -- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file. 

The specific flaw exists within how the application decodes video samples
encoded with the RLE codec. When decompressing the sample, the application
will fail to accommodate for the canvas the sample is rendered into. This
can cause a buffer overflow and thus can be taken advantage of in order to
gain code execution under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
