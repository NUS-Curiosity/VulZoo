10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of SAP Netweaver ABAP. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the msg_server.exe listening on 3900 by
default. When the msg_server parses a message with opcode 0x43 and
sub-opcode 0x04 it uses a user suplied size field to copy a string into a
static sized stack buffer. The resulting buffer overflow can lead to remote
code execution under the context of the process.

- -- Vendor Response:
SAP has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
found at:
