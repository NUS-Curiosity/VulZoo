Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple persistent Web vulnerabilities in Interspire Shopping Cart v6 CMS.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-03:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Interspire Shopping Cart v6 Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account of the application. 
The persistent vulnerabilities are located in the coupon name, product name & the bound export function but also in the 
password input profile listing. 

Vulnerable Module(s):
                               [+] Marketing > Coupon > Create a Coupon Code > Name
                               [+] Products > Name > STRING > View All > Mark Export these Products > x
                               [+] Customer > Add or Register Customer > Password & Name


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account and low required 
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...


Products > Name > STRING > View All > Mark Export these Products > x

<tr class="GridRow" onmouseover="this.className='GridRowOver'" onmouseout="this.className='GridRow'">
<td style="height: 21px;">29</td>
<td style="height: 21px;">"><iframe src="a" onload='alert("VL")' <<="" td="">
<td style="height: 21px;">"><iframe src=a onload=alert("VL") <</td>
<td style="height: 21px;">$32,432.00</td>
<td style="height: 21px;"><img src="images/tick.gif" alt="tick"/></td>
<td style="height: 21px;"><img src="images/cross.gif" alt="cross"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

Note: 
1. To reproduce the issue you need to add a product with script code in the name value.
2. The you need to mark the product in the products view all listing and try to export it.
3. The persistent code is getting execute when the export website will be open and processing to load the context.
