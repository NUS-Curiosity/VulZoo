This is in regards to:

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53694

This is an uncoordinated release, the author did not make any attempt
to notify us either by email or the public forum. The non-working
exploit seems to have been copied and pasted with RIPS source code
analyzer and the author didn't even bother tho test our understand the
code. A real hacker can read source code, not run a RIPS source code
analyzer and publish the finding without due diligence.

This is the result:
Try : alert('..config.inc.php could not be loaded');

1) The "/" or %2F won't be accepted. $filename =
preg_replace("/[^a-z._\d]/i", "", $_GET['js']); // sanitize, prevent
path traversal
2) It will only read js.gz file (I see attempts to load /etc/passwd
but that doesn't make sense - I don't think he knows/understand how to
read source code) - readfile(SITE_PATH.'/js/'.$
filename.'.js.gz'); The bad chars will be stripped anyway ...
3) Test:
http://gekkocms.babygekko.com/js/js_gzip.php?js=..%2Fconfig.inc.php
http://gekkocms.babygekko.com/js/js_gzip.php?js=../config.inc.php

The js_gzip.php was included as of v1.1.5a

Also older versions on my website:

http://www.babygekko.com/downloads/archives/gekko_web_builder_v1.1.5a.zip
http://www.babygekko.com/downloads/archives/gekko_web_builder_v1.1.5a.zip
http://www.babygekko.com/downloads/archives/gekko_web_builder_v1.1.5c.zip

I am fine with people publishing vulnerabilities to make code more
secure. What I'm unhappy is how some wannabe script kiddiot can just
download source code analyzers/scanners and publish things WITHOUT any
prior test and WITHOUT contacting vendors. I have had people publish
their findings in my forum and I'm fine. But not when they don't at
least test or contact me and then later turns out to be a false alarm.

Here's a copy & paste from v1.1.5a (old version - the same)
