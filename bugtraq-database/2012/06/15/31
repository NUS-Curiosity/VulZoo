          CVE Name        CVE-2012-3553                                       

    Description  AST-2012-008 previously dealt with a denial of service       
                 attack exploitable in the Skinny channel driver that         
                 occurred when certain messages are sent after a previously   
                 registered station sends an Off Hook message. Unresolved in  
                 that patch is an issue in the Asterisk 10 releases,          
                 wherein, if a Station Key Pad Button Message is processed    
                 after an Off Hook message, the channel driver will           
                 inappropriately dereference a Null pointer.                  
                                                                              
                 Similar to AST-2012-008, a remote attacker with a valid      
                 SCCP ID can can use this vulnerability by closing a          
                 connection to the Asterisk server when a station is in the   
                 "Off Hook" call state and crash the server.                  

    Resolution  The presence of a device for a line is now checked in the     
                appropriate channel callbacks, preventing the crash.
