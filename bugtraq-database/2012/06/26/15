Subject: OpenLimit Reader for Windows contains completely outdated, superfluous and VULNERABLE system components

Hi @ll,

the OpenLimit reader (<https://www.openlimit.com/en/products/reader.html>
and <https://www.openlimit.com/en/products/reader/download-reader.html>),
an application aimed to provide security by validating X.509 signatures
and signing PDFs inside Adobe Reader, contains completely outdated,
superfluous and vulnerable components, which comprise 40% (SIC!) of the
whole installation package!


JFTR: the downloadable self-extracting setup program "OLReader2502_DE.exe"
      as well as the contained files (SETUP.EXE, SCSetup\WS*.DLL) are all
      signed with an X.509 certificate valid until 2012-05-26T23:59:59Z.

      Fortunately some wise guy but missed to time-stamp the signed files,
      Windows treats the signature as invalid since 2012-05-27T00:00:00Z.-P


According to it's manufacturer, this application supports Windows 2000
and later versions.

The self-extracting setup program "OLReader2502_DE.exe" extracts the
following 3rd party files (ALL are updates/installers from Microsoft)
into "%TEMP%\SignCubesInstall":


INSTMSI.EXE     12.0.2600.2 from 2002-02-19

    the installation package of "Microsoft Installer 2.0".

    A newer version of Microsoft installer is part of ALL supported

Fortunately the "Windows File Protection" fixes most of the damage done
by the installation of this piece of crap^W^W^Wwell engineered software
and restores the overwritten system files.


On Windows 5.x the following overwritten registry entries are but NOT
fixed:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{0BE35200-8F91-11CE-9DE3-00AA004BB851}\InProcServer32]
@="C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\MFC42.DLL"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{0BE35201-8F91-11CE-9DE3-00AA004BB851}\InProcServer32]
@="C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\MFC42.DLL"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{0BE35202-8F91-11CE-9DE3-00AA004BB851}\InProcServer32]
@="C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\MFC42.DLL"

MFC42.DLL is the ANSI version of this system DLL, suitable for Windows
9x/ME. Windows NT* but needs the UNICODE version of this DLL, named
MFC42U.DLL. As result, UNICODE programs which use MFC42.DLL will fail!


To complete the sad story: before the installation ALL system DLLs were
registered with their fully qualified pathnames and were not vulnerable
to "binary planting" attacks (<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2269637>
and <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107>).


After the installation, the Windows installation was vulnerable again
(modulo the "Known DLLs"):

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{0000002F-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\InProcServer32]
