Subject: File Upload Concern in Front Account 2.3.13 and OpenDocMan 1.2.6.2

I have put this in a separate report since they are not strictly
vulnerabilities.

By default, both software apps allow the end user to upload any HTML
file they wish. This means that files with malicious javascript may be
uploaded to the server.

The issue is that when a user clicks view for these files, it will open
in the browser under the domain of the application.

Since the application does not provide any technical guard against this,
one must rely on the OS anti-virus signatures to pick up the malicious
code. 

While uploading HTML files not a strict vulnerability, per se. The
ability to abuse this functionality with malicious code may be a more
common issue than realized.
