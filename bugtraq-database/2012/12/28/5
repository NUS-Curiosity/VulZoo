Subject: CubeCart 5.0.7 and lower versions | Insecure Backup File Handling

1. OVERVIEW

CubeCart 5.0.7 and lower versions are vulnerable to Insecure Backup
File Handling which leads to the disclosure of the application
configuration file.


2. BACKGROUND

CubeCart is an "out of the box" ecommerce shopping cart software
solution which has been written to run on servers that have PHP &
MySQL support. With CubeCart you can quickly setup a powerful online
store which can be used to sell digital or tangible products to new
and existing customers all over the world.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

CubeCart 5.0.7 and lower versions contain a flaw that insecurely backs
up the configuration file, "global.inc.php", upon new installation or
upgrade process. The name of backup configuration file is set to the
year, month, day, hour, minute that the process is performed.  The
non-randomized nature of this backup scheme allows an attacker to
retrieve the file through brute-force method.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

5.0.7 and lower versions


5. Affected Files

/setup/setup.install.php
/setup/setup.upgrade.php

///////////CODE //////////////
##Backup existing config file, if it exists
if (file_exists($global_file)) {
	rename($global_file, $global_file.'-'.date('Ymdgi'));
}
/////////////////////////

e.g.
http://127.0.0.1/cube507/includes/global.inc.php-2012021245719		\
