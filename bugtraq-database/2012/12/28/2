Introduction:
=============
While most businesses now have some type of anti-spam protection, many must deal with cumbersome 
management, frustrated users, inflexible solutions, and a higher-than-expected total cost of ownership. 
SonicWALL® Email Security can help. Elegantly simple to deploy, manage and use, award-winning SonicWALL 
Email Security solutions employ a variety of proven and patented technology designed to block spam and 
other threats effectively, easily and economically. With innovative protection techniques for both 
inbound and outbound email plus unique management tools, the Email Security platform delivers superior 
email protection today—while standing ready to stop the new attacks of tomorrow.

SonicWALL Email Security can be flexibly deployed as a SonicWALL Email Security Appliance, as a software 
application on a third party Windows® server, or as a SonicWALL Email Security Virtual Appliance in a 
VMW® environment. The SonicWALL Email Security Virtual Appliance provides the same powerful protection as a 
traditional SonicWALL Email Security appliance, only in a virtual form, to optimize utilization, 
ease migration and reduce capital costs.

Medium


Details:
========
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the official Dell SonicWall Email Security (7.4.1.7429) Application.
The vulnerability typus allows an attacker to inject own malicious script code in the vulnerable module on application side (persistent).

The vulnerability is located in the Host Konfiguration >  Einstellungen für CIFS-Bereitstellung > section when processing to request via
the `Bereistellunge testen` module the bound vulnerable [Name des freigegebenen Laufwerks] [Benutzer-ID für Remoteanmeldung] [Kennwort für 
Remoteanmeldung] application parameters. The persistent injected script code will be executed directly out of the `system command failed` 
web application exception-handling.

The vulnerability can be exploited with a low (restricted) privileged application user account and low or medium required user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in persistent session hijacking, persistent phishing, external redirect, external 
malware loads and persistent vulnerable module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Section(s):
				[+] System > Host Konfiguration >  Einstellungen für CIFS-Bereitstellung

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] [Bereitstellung testen] - Exception Handling

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] [Name des freigegebenen Laufwerks] [Benutzer-ID für Remoteanmeldung] [Kennwort für Remoteanmeldung]


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account & low required user inter action.

</div>


Solution:
=========
To patch/fix the persistent web vulnerabilities parse the exception-handling output parameter listing.
Restrict the input fields (parameters) and disallow special chars and obviously forbidden strings.

2012-12-17:	Vendor Fix/Patch (v7.4.2)

Note: The vulnerability has been addressed by sonicwall in december 2012. 
Sonicwall provids all the customers an upgrade/update to version 7.4.2. 




Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
