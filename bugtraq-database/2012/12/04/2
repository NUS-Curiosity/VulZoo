Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - Christmas 2012 meet! Tuesday 11th December
 2012

Hard to believe, but 2012 is almost over!!!!

Once again we've managed to secure the venue for a December meet, so we 
can start the festivities well before your livers are too crippled by 
office parties... Not only that, but we've even got a speaker lined up!

Chris from Facebook London's Site Integrity Engineering Team will be 
giving us:

"Why root the kernel when you can just install a toolbar?"

Chris will give a brief overview of the major attacks against Facebook 
and then deep dive on a trend towards browser malware that they really 
saw gain traction last year.

... and then we'll do some serious Christmas drinking!

DOWNSTAIRS @ The Phoenix, Cavendish Square

Talk starts at 19:30, but the venue is ours from much earlier... food is 
good and beer is cold!

See you next week!

cheers,
MM
