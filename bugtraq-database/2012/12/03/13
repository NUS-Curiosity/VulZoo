Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] MySQL (Linux) Stack based buffer overrun PoC Zeroday

Hi Kingcope,

   MySQL Server exploitable stack based overrun
   Ver 5.5.19-log for Linux and below (tested with Ver 5.1.53-log
   for suse-linux-gnu too) unprivileged user (any account
   (anonymous account?), post auth) as illustrated below the
   instruction pointer is overwritten with 0x41414141 bug found by
   Kingcope this will yield a shell as the user 'mysql' when properly
   exploited

Out of curiosity, is this exploitable when using hardened toolchain
settings? Specifically, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCES=2 and
-fstack-protector-all?

Jeff
