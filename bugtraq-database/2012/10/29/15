About DIMVA
-----------
The annual DIMVA conference serves as a premier forum for advancing the
state of the art in intrusion detection, malware detection, and
vulnerability assessment.  Each year, DIMVA brings together
international experts from academia, industry, and government to present
and discuss novel research in these areas.  DIMVA is organized by the
special interest group "Security - Intrusion Detection and Response"
(SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI). The conference
proceedings will appear as a volume in the Springer Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) series (approval pending).
