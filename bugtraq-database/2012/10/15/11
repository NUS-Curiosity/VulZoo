Subject: Critical issues affecting Steam users


We have just released a paper [1], in which we prove that the current
implementation of the Steam Browser Protocol handling mechanism is an
excellent attack vector to exploit local issues in a remote fashion.

Steam [2] is the biggest gaming related digital delivery platform with
an audience of more than 50 million people and supporting several
different platforms including Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

A demonstrating video [3] is available.
