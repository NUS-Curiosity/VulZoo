Introduction:
=============
The GTA family of Internet security firewall UTM systems has been expanded to include three new gigabit appliances. 
The GB-2500 Firewall UTM Appliance is one of GTA s most capable firewalls, designed for businesses with extensive 
network demands. Featuring a powerful Intel Dual-Core processor, two gigabits of RAM and four gigabits of static
 memory, the GB-2500 easily handles intensive, resource-demanding network configurations. The GB-2100 Firewall UTM 
Appliance provides robust protection and network reliability for SME organizations. Featuring flexible configuration 
options, straightforward implementation and uncomplicated maintenance and monitoring, the GB-2100 presents 
comprehensive protection that is adaptable to any network environment. The GB-820 Firewall UTM Appliance is designed 
for smaller offices, providing gigabit performance with all the features and tools available in larger appliances, 
but in a space-saving desktop unit. Built-in VPN acceleration provides the GB-820 with increased throughput, allowing 
organizations to easily handle periods of increased VPN activity.

All GTA Firewall UTM Appliances include our advanced firewall features - policy based NAT, virtual hosting via IP 
Aliasing, advanced routing such as BGP and Single-Sign on authentication - at no extra charge. Threat management 
features include DoS and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), basic content filtering and advanced email gateway features.

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================

Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the GTA UTM Firewall Appliance Application Firmware GB 6.0.3.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 

The first vulnerability is located in the user remote password and pre-shared secret input fields & user account output listing. 
The secound vulnerability is located in the VPN Certificate emailAddress & subject with affect on the VPN Details Listing section. 

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin), persistent phishing & stable (persistent) 
web context manipulation in vulnerable modules or bound application sections. Exploitation requires low or medium user inter action & 
a low or medium privileged web application user/manager account.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Users - [Configure -> Accounts -> Users] -  > Remote Access > L2TP / PPTP > Remote Password
				[+] Users - [Configure -> Accounts -> Users] -  > Mobile IPSEC > Modify & ASCII  > Pre-shared Secret
				[+] VPN Certificate - Input & Listing

Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account & low 
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Note:
To bypass the invalid argument filter exception use an onload iframe to request your external content with cookies. Standard frames 
and script tags with double quotes will be blocked by the invalid argument exception & validation. To verify the bypass use also the 
wrong standard strings for the invalid argument validation.


Locations: 			remotePW_hidden, identity, form input desc, fullName, Pre-shared Secret, & emailAddress
Good Example Bypass String:	"><x src=http://www.vuln-lab.com onload=alert("GTA") < or "><x src=http://www.vuln-lab.com onload=alert(document.cookie) <
Wrong Example Bypass String:	>"<iframe src=http://google.com> or <script>alert("TEST")</script>

Note: The vulnerable content certificate can also be exported via download function to review the problem.

Solution:
=========
Parse the input field values secret_hidden, remotePW_hidden, identity, form input desc, fullName & emailAddress. 
Restrict the name input fields  with a special filter when processing to load strings with tags like (< > , double quotes & co.  ...). 
Parse also the vulnerable output listing were the script code is getting unsanitized executed out of the waf application context.


Risk:
=====
The vulnerabilities can be exploited with low required user inter action & privileged user account.
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.
