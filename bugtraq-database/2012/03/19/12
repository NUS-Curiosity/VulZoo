Ticket #5417 (new defect)

RelativeLink.sh in Tor browser bundle has small typo causing debug mode to be always turned on

Reported by: cypherpunks
Priority: critical
Component: Tor bundles/installation

Description

TBB starts in debug mode disregardless of --debug switch used or not. This is caused by small bug on line 208 on RelativeLink.sh, where it says

if [ "${debug}" ];

where it should say

if [ "${debug}" == 1];

or

if [ ${debug} -eq 1 ];
