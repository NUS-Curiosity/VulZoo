Subject: Free Web App Security Challenges - Hackademics Project

Dear List,

OWASP is sponsoring/providing the FREE OWASP Hackademic Challenges! The
OWASP Hackademic Challenges Project is an open source project that helps
you test your knowledge on web application security. You can use it to
actually attack web applications in a realistic but also controllable
and safe environment. These challenges are now all integrated into HL
(Hacking-Lab) and ready for you to play with.
