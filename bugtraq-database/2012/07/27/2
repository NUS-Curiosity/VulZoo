Subject: Security advisory for Bugzilla 4.3.2, 4.2.2, 4.0.7 and 3.6.10

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* In HTML bugmails, an improper validation of the permissions of the
  addressee can lead to confidential information about bugs and
  attachments to be visible to the addressee.

* The description of a private attachment can be visible to a user
  who hasn't permissions to access this attachment if the attachment
  ID is mentioned in a comment in a bug.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    4.1.1 to 4.2.1, 4.3.1
Fixed In:    4.2.2, 4.3.2
Description: In HTML bugmails, all bug IDs and attachment IDs are
             linkified, and hovering these links displays a tooltip
             with the bug summary or the attachment description if
             the user is allowed to see the bug or attachment.
             But when validating user permissions when generating the
             email, the permissions of the user who edited the bug were
             taken into account instead of the permissions of the
             addressee. This means that confidential information could
             be disclosed to the addressee if the other user has more
             privileges than the addressee.
             Plain text bugmails are not affected as bug and attachment
             IDs are not linkified.
