The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple different
web vulnerabilites in Classified Ads Script PHP v1.1 CMS.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-13:    Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected in the Classified
Ads Script PHP 1.1  Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged
user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. The
vulnerability is located in the admin.php file with the
bound vulnerable orderType & orderBy parameters. Successful exploitation
of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable File(s):
                                        [+] admin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                                        [+] orderType
                                        [+] orderby


Proof of Concept:
=================
The SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers
with privileged user account & without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

http://127.0.0.1/test/classifiedscript/admin.php?act=ads&orderType=[ ASC
/ DESC ]&search=&orderBy=[SQL-INJECTION]
http://127.0.0.1/test/classifiedscript/admin.php?act=ads&orderType=[SQL-INJECTION]
http://127.0.0.1/test/classifiedscript/admin.php?act=comments&ads_id=&orderType=[
ASC / DESC ]&search=&orderBy=[SQL-INJECTION]
http://127.0.0.1/test/classifiedscript/admin.php?act=comments&ads_id=&orderType=[SQL-INJECTION]


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as
medium.
