Vulnerable: DataWatch Monarch BI v5.1

DataWatch's  Monarch BI admin section is prone to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and obtain sensitive information.

DataWatch Monarch BI v5.1 is known to be vulnerable. Other versions may also be vulnerable.

To exploit this issue, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting victim into following a malicious URI, for example:

Create a new Maintenance Task: 
POST http://127.0.0.1/ESAdmin/jsp/mainttaskact.jsp   
txtName=</option><script>alert(1)</script>

Then create a new or edit an existing   Maintenance process and add the malicious Maintenance Task to it. Click on Save. 
The script is executed when a user views or edits the created process 

Vendor informed and a patch was released on 12/07/2012. Vendor recommends installing the latest security updates.
