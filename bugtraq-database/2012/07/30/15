Vulnerable: TEMENOS T24 R07.03 

TEMENOS T24 is prone to an authentication bypass vulnerability as it fails to properly enforce access control on the password reset functionality.

An attacker may leverage this issue to reset any userï¿½s password and login as that user. This would have an impact on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data stored in the application. This would also have an impact on accountability.

TEMENOS T24 R07.03 is known to be vulnerable. Other versions may also be vulnerable.

An attacker can use a browser to exploit this vulnerability. This can be seen in the following example:

POST http://127.0.0.1/servlet/BrowserServlet
command=repeatpassword&requestType=UTILITY.ROUTINE&routineName=OS.PASSWORD&routineArgs=PROCESS.REPEAT%3AUSERNAME%3APASSWORD%3APASSWORD

Vendor is aware of this vulnerability.
