10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP StorageWorks File Migration Agent.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the HsmCfgSvc.exe service which listens by
default on TCP port 9111. When processing FTP archives the process does not
properly validate the size of the root path specified and proceeds to copy
the string into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. This can be exploited
to execute arbitrary remote code under the context of the running service.

- -- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard states:
The overall design of the File Migration Agent (FMA) assumes it runs as an
application on a Windows server. Given the stated purpose of FMA, and the
nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to
restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients
and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the HP
StorageWorks File Migration Agent should be permitted to communicate with
it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with
firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native
Windows Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
