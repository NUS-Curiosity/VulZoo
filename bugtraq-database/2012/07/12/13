- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC Autostart. Authentication is not required
to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ftAgent.exe service, which listens by
default on TCP port 8045. When handling messages with opcode 50 (0x32) and
subcode 02, the process performs arithmetic on an unvalidated user-supplied
value used to determine the size of a new heap buffer, allowing a potential
integer wrap to cause a heap buffer overflow. This vulnerability can be
leveraged to execute code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:
EMC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
found at:
