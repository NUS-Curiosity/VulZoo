Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered Persistent cross site scripting in Blackboard Learn v9.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-05-29:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Blackboard Learn v9 mobile application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
The persistent vulnerability is located in the Question answer module with the bound vulnerable smart text parameter. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable 
(persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account. 

Vulnerable Module(s): 
				[+] Question answer

Vulnerable Parameters(s): 
				[+] smart text - input


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

If there is a survey that is created by the administrator of the Blackboard and in that survey, there are some questions that you 
answer them, you can inject a malicious code as the answer of such a question. note: it is working when the input type of the 
answer is Smart Text, HTML, but not tested on TEXT as input. More details in image attached


Solution:
=========
There should be a validation on the input of the answer to survey questions. Also parse the section were the script is getting executed.
Moreover, it should be filtering or exception for some suspicious words i.e., iframe, script, tags etc.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
