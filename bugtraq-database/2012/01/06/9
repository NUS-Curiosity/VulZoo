Package        : squid3
Vulnerability  : invalid memory deallocation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4096 

It was discovered that the IPv6 support code in Squid does not
properly handle certain DNS responses, resulting in deallocation of an
invalid pointer and a daemon crash.

The squid package and the version of squid3 shipped in lenny lack IPv6
support and are not affected by this issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.1.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.
