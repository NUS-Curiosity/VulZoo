Main page says: "KnowledgeTree Community Edition is unsupported, untested software and not designed for production use. KnowledgeTree Inc. does not warrant this software in any way." and atest version is 3.7, which is released December 2009. Could you give me the URL where they responded to your contact and fixed this vulnerability?

Even their https://issues.knowledgetree.com/ says "Your KnowledgeTree account has been suspended."

If one does fill their form and download this they are still serving 3.7 version. In download-page there is also link http://www.scribd.com/doc/23362922/What%E2%80%99s-New-in-KnowledgeTree-3-7 to "What's new"-page, which is only about Commercial Edition.

Quality product..
