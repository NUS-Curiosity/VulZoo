CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2011-2183 CVE-2011-2213 CVE-2011-2898 CVE-2011-3353
                 CVE-2011-4077 CVE-2011-4110 CVE-2011-4127 CVE-2011-4611
                 CVE-2011-4622 CVE-2011-4914

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-2183

    Andrea Righi reported an issue in KSM, a memory-saving de-duplication
    feature. By exploiting a race with exiting tasks, local users can cause
    a kernel oops, resulting in a denial of service.
                 
CVE-2011-2213

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the INET socket monitoring interface.
    Local users could cause a denial of service by injecting code and causing
    the kernel to execute an infinite loop.

CVE-2011-2898

    Eric Dumazet reported an information leak in the raw packet socket
    implementation.

CVE-2011-3353

    Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a local denial of service issue issue in the FUSE
    (Filesystem in Userspace) support in the linux kernel. Local users could
    cause a buffer overflow, leading to a kernel oops and resulting in a denial
    of service.

CVE-2011-4077

    Carlos Maiolino reported an issue in the XFS filesystem. A local user
    with the ability to mount a filesystem could corrupt memory resulting
    in a denial of service or possibly gain elevated privileges.

CVE-2011-4110

    David Howells reported an issue in the kernel's access key retention
    system which allow local users to cause a kernel oops leading to a denial
    of service.

CVE-2011-4127

    Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat reported an issue in the ioctl passthrough
    support for SCSI devices. Users with permission to access restricted
    portions of a device (e.g. a partition or a logical volume) can obtain
    access to the entire device by way of the SG_IO ioctl. This could be
    exploited by a local user or privileged VM guest to achieve a privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2011-4611

    Maynard Johnson reported an issue with the perf support on POWER7 systems
    that allows local users to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2011-4622

    Jan Kiszka reported an issue in the KVM PIT timer support. Local users
    with the permission to use KVM can cause a denial of service by starting
    a PIT timer without first setting up the irqchip.

CVE-2011-4914

    Ben Hutchings reported various bounds checking issues within the ROSE
    protocol support in the kernel. Remote users could possibly use this
    to gain access to sensitive memory or cause a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-39squeeze1. Updates for issues impacting the oldstable distribution
(lenny) will be available soon.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+39squeeze1

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
