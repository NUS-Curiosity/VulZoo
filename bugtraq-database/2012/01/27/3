Subject: [HITB-Announce] Reminder: HITB2012AMS Call For Papers Closing Soon

HITBSecConf in Europe closes on the 18th of February! Send in your
submissions now!

This year, we're moving to a new, bigger and better venue -- the
award winning Okura Hotel right in middle of Amsterdam with easy access
via public transportation. #HITB2012AMS will be a quad-track conference
featuring keynote speakers Andy Ellis (Chief Security Officer, Akamai)
and Bruce Schneier (Chief Security Technology Officer, BT)!

As always, talks that are more technical or that discuss new and never
before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has
been covered several times before.

Submissions are due _no later than 18th February 2012_
