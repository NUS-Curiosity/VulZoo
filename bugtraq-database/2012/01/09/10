Subject: AppSec DC 2012 CFP EXTENDED!

All,

Many of you have written to us asking about the requirement for a
paper in our CFP hosted on EasyChair.  Due to an unforseen change in
the way EasyChair works, you are no longer able to configure a
submission to require only an abstract as we thought we had done, and
done in the past.  To be clear, we are ***NOT*** requiring papers with
our CFP submissions.  As we have already started the CFP and can not
move the platform we ask that anyone who does not have a paper simply
submit their abstract as a .txt file to satisfy the systems
requirement to upload a paper.

We apologize for this inconvience and the confusion it has caused and
as a result of the confusion, we are extending the AppSec DC CFP
deadline to Feburary 17th 2012 at 11:59 EST to allow all to submit
their topics.

Regards,
The AppSec DC Program Committee

This is in response to requests from a variety of our sponsors and vendors, and de-conflicts overlap in the OWASP conference schedule for North America.  OWASP AppSec DC 2012 will be held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on April 2nd through April 5th.  Plenary sessions will be on April 4th and 5th preceded by Application Security Training on April 2nd and 3rd.

Therefore we invite all practitioners of application security and those who work with or interact with all facets of application security to submit papers and participate in the conference.
