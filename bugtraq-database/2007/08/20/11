Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in the NVIDIA graphic drivers,
allowing for a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The NVIDIA drivers provide support for NVIDIA graphic boards.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                     /   Vulnerable   /         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers      < 100.14.09          >= 100.14.09
                                                          *>= 1.0.9639
                                                          *>= 1.0.7185

Description
===========

Gregory Shikhman discovered that the default Gentoo setup of NVIDIA
drivers creates the /dev/nvidia* with insecure file permissions.

Impact
======

A local attacker could send arbitrary values into the devices, possibly
resulting in hardware damage on the graphic board or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All NVIDIA drivers users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers"
