It doesn't even take an API. If you're running a virtual machine
from your own account, your account has control over the virtual
machine. It can subvert the hardware, it can modify the contents
of virtual memory, the virtual disk image, and so on.

This is a basic but often overlooked principle with virtualization:
a virtual machine is no more secure than the platform (or in this
case user account) it runs on.
