RESOLUTION
Until an update is available, HP has made the following procedure available to resolve the issue. 

1. Download the script "get_system_info.wrapper" from the following ftp site: 
ftp://ss071442:ss071442@...c.external.hp.com/ 

2 .Verify the cksum or md5 sum: 
cksum: 3713651406 5189 get_system_info.wrapper 
MD5 (get_system_info.wrapper) = 99d725b5b93115ae418ad6ec1b5ab60d 

3. As root, copy the script into a secure directory.

4. As root, run the script. The script will display the files it is replacing. 

For example: 

#$secure_directory/get_system_info_wrapper 
Replacing /opt/ignite/lbin/get_system_info with $secure_directory/get_system_info.wrapper 
Replacing /opt/drd/lbin/get_system_info with $secure_directory/get_system_info.wrapper 

where $secure_directory is the path to the secure directory containing the script. 

5. The script must be executed whenever a vulnerable version of the fileset Ignite-UX.MGMT-TOOLS or the fileset DRD.DRD-RUN is reinstalled.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
