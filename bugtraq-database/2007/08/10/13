 Inclusion Vulnerability

false advisory again here...


you should read the code, unless to do a basic search with your editor for :

-include($
-include_once($
-require($
-require_once($

dont you think you should try your "PoC" before you do send it on a professional bugtraq like securityfocus ?
plz guys stop diffusing this kind of false advisory.
