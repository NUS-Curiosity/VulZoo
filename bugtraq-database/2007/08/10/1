false advisory again here...

in every files you can see :  /*****************************************************
  ** Send safety signal to included files
  *****************************************************/
          define('IN_SCRIPT', 'true');

you should read the code, unless to do a basic search with your editor for :
-include($
-include_once($
-require($
-require_once($

plz guys stop diffusing this kind of false advisory.


regards laurent gaffiï¿½
