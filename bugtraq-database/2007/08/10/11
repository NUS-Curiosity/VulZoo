    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1600

Description:
    Previous versions of the firefox and thunderbird packages are
    vulnerable to multiple attacks.  One is a weakness that makes it hard
    for add-ons to defend against a user-assisted privilege escalation
    attack; the other can in some cases allow a user-assisted attacker
    to run possibly arbitrary programs as the user running firefox
    or thunderbird.
    
    As the 1.5.0.x versions of firefox and thunderbird are no longer
    being maintained, the new versions of the firefox and thunderbird
    packages are new major versions.  Of particular note, some firefox
    add-ons that are no longer maintained may no longer function with
    the new version of firefox.
