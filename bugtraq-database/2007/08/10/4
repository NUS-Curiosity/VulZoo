Subject: New Oracle Forensics Paper

Hey all,
I've just posted a new paper on Oracle Forensics and my Black Hat 
presentation to
http://www.databasesecurity.com/oracle-forensics.htm
The new paper is entitled "Oracle Forensics Part 5: Finding Evidence of Data 
Theft in the Absence of Auditing" and explores some of the ideas I discussed 
at Blackhat.
Cheers,
David Litchfield
