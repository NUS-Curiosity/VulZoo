Subject: Re: Skype Network Remote DoS Exploit

Skype made a funny "explanation" of the problem...

Lets say, people download updates on Tuesday in the US, on Wednesday in 
Europe and just happen to reboot their computers simultaneously on Thursday? 
:)

As I remember, there were two primary theories of the problem source:

  1.. Microsoft's updates
  2.. DoS attack
It seems Skype has decided to make their own theory based on these two: so 
it was a DoS, but not an attack, and it was updates fault, but not Microsoft's.



I do believe that the DoS Exploit, published at www.securitylab.ru, might 
have such an impact, but it's impossible to prove anything and it's not 
necessary. I just would like to say, that Skype could came up with more 
realistic story, for example: someone made a mistake in the code, or they 
were trying to implement new feature and everyone would believe, even me :)
