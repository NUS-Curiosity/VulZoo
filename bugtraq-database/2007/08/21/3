[HSC] Invision Power Board D22-Shoutbox HTML Injections



D22-Shoutbox suffers from improper validation of HTMl tags filtration. 
An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute
in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.
This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and
launch other attacks. A successful script could allow an attacker to compromise
the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the
underlying database implementation.
