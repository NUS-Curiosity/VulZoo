Synopsis
========

A Denial of Service vulnerability and a table structure information
leakage vulnerability were found in MySQL.

Background
==========

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/mysql      < 5.0.44                              >= 5.0.44

Description
===========

Dormando reported a vulnerability within the handling of password
packets in the connection protocol (CVE-2007-3780). Andrei Elkin also
found that the "CREATE TABLE LIKE" command didn't require SELECT
privileges on the source table (CVE-2007-3781).

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker could use the first vulnerability to
make the server crash. The second vulnerability can be used by
authenticated users to obtain information on tables they are not
normally able to access.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.0.44"
