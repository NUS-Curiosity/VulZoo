Didn't really work on my computer. The content of the address bar could be seen changing
continuously between swiecki.net and google.com, probably in a way similar to what happens with Safari.

Again, it didn't work. My address bar showed "%20@....swiecki.net/saft2.html", aligned to the right.
Sure, if you scroll all the way to the left you'll just see www.google.com, but otherwise the
address shown is what I reported above.
Tested with Konqueror 3.5.5, KDE 3.5.5, kernel 2.6.21-r4 (gentoo), 64bit version.
