Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.07.07: Apple Mac OS X mDNSResponder
 HTTP Request Heap Overflow Vulnerability

Apple Mac OS X mDNSResponder HTTP Request Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.07.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 07, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

mDNSResponder is part of the Bonjour suite of applications. Bonjour is
used to provide automatic and transparent configuration of network
devices. It is similar to UPnP, in that the goal of both is to allow
users to simply plug devices into a network without worrying about
configuration details. mDNSResponder runs by default on both Server and
Workstation. More information can be found on the vendor's website.

http://developer.apple.com/opensource/internet/bonjour.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Apple Inc.'s
mDNSResponder application may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
with root privileges.

The vulnerability exists within the Legacy NAT Traversal code. Unlike
the core of the mDNSResponder service, this area of code does not rely
on Multicast UDP. It listens on a dynamically allocated Unicast UDP
port.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing a malformed HTTP request. This
results in an exploitable heap overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with root privileges on a vulnerable host. No
authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

Failed attempts will result in the service crashing. Shortly after
crashing, it will be restarted.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Mac OS X
version 10.4.10, Server and Workstation, with mDNSResponder version
108.5. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
