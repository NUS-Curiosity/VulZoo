Subject: Pwnie Awards Ceremony

The call for Pwnie Award nominations is now closed. We had a tremendous number
of submissions and it was really hard to decide which ones are the best. The
list of nominees is finally up at http://pwnie-awards.org/awards.html
 
The Pwnie Awards ceremony will take place on Wednesday, August 1st. The
location is Palace Ballroom 3 at Caesar's Palace, right next to the BlackHat
reception area. We'd like to thank BlackHat for their generous offer to host
the awards.
 
We will start at 6pm. See you there!
