As opposed to pausing the VM, editing the virtual memory image and 
unpausing the VM?  No scripting interface is needed.  How about editing 
the virtual disk image and replacing one of the cron scripts with a 
shell-on-a-port?  Rebooting the VM and going single user?  If you control 
the VMware process, you control the guest.  Fully and Completely.
