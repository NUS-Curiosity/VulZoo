VMs can do just that, isolate the damage to the vm, with no impact to the
host.  This discussion never addressed that, though, it was focused on the
premise that vms should be protected from the host operating system, which
is exceedingly impractical.  The host was never in danger from the
techniques discussed here.

I think you may be referring to sandboxes like chroot & jails which are not
quite as effective at isolating processes as the vm route.  They have a hell
of a lot less overhead, though.
