 Death Signal Vulnerability

In my eyes this is definitely a security issue. But I cannot imagine a way to exploit this issue at the moment. First you have to find a suid binary which fork()'s. Next thing is that you need access to that binary. And then? If both conditions are really met, what's next? The possibilities are depending a little bit on the suid binary, am I right?
Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.
