Vulnerability Details
=========================
=========================



1. Windows Calendar (Vista) ICS File Denial of Service Vulnerability
   
=================================================================

Specially malformed ISC file, once imported to Windows Calendar, 
leads to Windows Calendar to a crash (after the remainder is set). 
Windows Calendar crashes every each time Vista is rebooted. The 
vulnerability stems from NULL pointer dereference and has been 
confirmed on fully updated Windows Vista. Successful at

MSRC has been informed and confirmed the situation. Both, Eleytt 
and MSRC consider this issue of low impact.




2. Toolbar vulnerabilities
   
=======================


   
a) The vulnerability in 'CallCmd' function in toolbar_gaming.dll
has its roots in NULL pointer dereference, which results in 
denial of service conditions.

b) The vulnerability lies in Toolbar.DLL library, in 'isChecked' 
function.
   
 
The registers' values are below:

EIP 01838C70
EAX 00000000
.
ESP 001BA90C -> Asc: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 

The crash itself happens here:  
   
1838C70	MOV ECX,[EAX+188]	


Stack dump is full of 'A', but SEH hasn't been overwritten. The problem
lies in NULL pointer dereference. The vulnerability, therefore, hasn't 
been proven exploitable. Arbitrary code execution is probably impossible.



c) The vulnerability lies in Toolbar.DLL library, in 'isChecked' 
function. The exactly the same kind of vulnerability that described
in b).
