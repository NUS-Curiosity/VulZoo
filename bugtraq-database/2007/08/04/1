This is a very weak case, I would say. With the way things work, status
bar is not and cannot be a reliable indicator of the target URL, and this
is known and had been abused for years:

<a href="http://www.example.com" onclick="location = 'http://www.slashdot.org/'; return false;">bar</a>

...but in your example, it seems to perform it's job pretty well, and it's
appearance is really not that confusing.
