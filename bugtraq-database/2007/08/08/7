Cisco Security Advisory: 
Cisco IOS Secure Copy Authorization Bypass Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20070808-scp

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070808-scp.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 August 08 1600 UTC (GMT)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The server side of the Secure Copy (SCP) implementation in Cisco
Internetwork Operating System (IOS) contains a vulnerability that
allows any valid user, regardless of privilege level, to transfer files
to and from an IOS device that is configured to be a Secure Copy
server. This vulnerability could allow valid users to retrieve or write
to any file on the device's filesystem, including the device's saved
configuration. This configuration file may include passwords or other
sensitive information.

The IOS Secure Copy Server is an optional service that is disabled by
default. Devices that are not specifically configured to enable the IOS
Secure Copy Server service are not affected by this vulnerability.

This vulnerability does not apply to the IOS Secure Copy Client
feature.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070808-scp.shtml.

Note: The August 08, 2007 publication includes four Security Advisories
and one Security Response. The advisories all affect IOS, one
additionally affects Cisco Unified Communications Manager as well. Each
advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability described in
the advisory, and the advisories also detail the releases that correct
the vulnerabilities in all four advisories. Individual publication

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices running certain 12.2-based IOS releases and configured to
offer Secure Copy server functionality are affected by this issue.

A device running a vulnerable Cisco IOS 12.2-based is affected if the
following command is present in the device configuration:

                ip scp server enable

The IOS Secure Copy server is disabled by default.

The Secure Copy server functionality is only available on
encryption-capable images. Devices that do not run an
encryption-capable images, which contain either k8 or k9 in the image
name, are not vulnerable. If a device is running an encryption-capable
image, the existence of the "ip scp server enable" command in the
configuration will determine whether the device is affected.

Please consult the table of fixed software in the Software Version and
Fixes section for the specific 12.2-based IOS releases that are
affected.

To determine the software running on a Cisco product, log in to the
device and issue the "show version" command to display the system banner.
Cisco IOS software will identify itself as "Internetwork Operating
System Software" or simply "IOS". The image name will be displayed
between parentheses on the next line of output followed by "Version"
and IOS release name. Other Cisco devices will not have the "show version" 
command or will give different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product running IOS release
12.2(18)SXF10:

    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) s72033_rp Software (s72033_rp-IPSERVICESK9-M), Version 12.2(18)SXF10, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Additional information about Cisco IOS release naming is available at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco devices that do not run IOS are not affected.

Cisco IOS devices that do not have the Secure Copy server feature
enabled are not affected.

The following IOS release trains are not affected:

  * 12.0-based releases
  * 12.1-based releases
  * 12.3-based releases
  * 12.4-based releases

Cisco IOS XR is not affected.

No other Cisco devices are known to be affected.

Details
=======

Secure Copy (SCP) is a protocol similar to the Remote Copy (RCP)
protocol, which allows for the transfer of files between systems. The
main difference between SCP and RCP is that in SCP, all aspects of the
file transfer session, including authentication, occur in encrypted
form, which makes SCP a more secure alternative than RCP. SCP relies on
the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which uses TCP port 22 by default.

The server side of the Secure Copy implementation in Cisco IOS contains
a vulnerability that allows any valid user, regardless of privilege
level, to transfer files to and from an IOS device that is configured
to be a Secure Copy server. This vulnerability could allow valid users
to retrieve or write to any file on the device's filesystem, including
the device's saved configuration. This configuration file may include
passwords or other sensitive information.

This vulnerability does not allow for authentication bypass; login
credentials are verified and access is only granted if a valid username
and password is provided. This vulnerability may cause authorization to
be bypassed.

A device with the Secure Copy server enabled is vulnerable regardless
of whether Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is
enabled. If access control is enabled on the Virtual Terminal (vty) via
the "login" command, which allows logins via Virtual Terminals, then the
device is affected.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsc19259.


Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 1.0.

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

may allow valid but unauthorized users to retrieve or write to any file
on the device's filesystem, including the device's saved configuration.
This configuration file may include passwords or other sensitive
information.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed in
the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended
Release" column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the
published vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory. A device
running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release
in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be
vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or later
than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the table.

Workarounds
===========

If the IOS Secure Copy Server functionality is not needed then the
vulnerability described in this document can be mitigated by disabling
the Secure Copy server. The Secure Copy server can be disabled by
executing the following command in global configuration mode:

                no ip scp server enable


If the Secure Copy server cannot be disabled due to operational
concerns, then no workarounds exist. The risk posed by this
vulnerability can be mitigated by following the best practices detailed
in "Improving Security on Cisco Routers" at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/21.html. Please refer to the 
Obtaining Fixed Software section for appropriate solutions to resolve 
this vulnerability.

Due to the nature of this vulnerability, networking best practices like
access control lists (ACLs) and Control Plane Policing (CoPP) that
restrict access to a device to certain IP addresses or subnetworks may
not be effective. If access is already granted to a specific IP address
or subnetwork, a user with low privileges will be able to establish a
Secure Copy session with the device, which would allow the user to
exploit this vulnerability.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed software
becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they
have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise
using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by the terms
of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html, or as otherwise 
set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com"
for software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades
for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml
for additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.
