Subject: Security Advisory for Bugzilla 3.0, 2.22.1, and 2.20.4

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers three security issues that have recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when filing bugs
  using the guided form.

+ When using email_in.pl, insufficiently escaped data may be passed to
  sendmail.

+ Users using the WebService interface may access Bugzilla's
time-tracking fields even if they normally cannot see them.

We strongly advise that 2.20.x and 2.22.x users should upgrade to 2.20.5
and 2.22.3 respectively. 3.0 users, and users of 2.18.x or below, should
upgrade to 3.0.1.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
- -------
Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Versions:    2.17.1 and above
Description: Bugzilla does not properly escape the 'buildid' field in
             the guided form when filing bugs. From 2.17.1 till 2.23.3,
             this field was based exclusively on the User-Agent string
             returned by your web browser. Since 2.23.4, this parameter
             can be defined in the URL passed to enter_bug.cgi,
overwriting the User-Agent string and may lead to cross-site scripting.
             The guided form is not usually used by Bugzilla
installations, as it is shipped only as an example to be modified for
their own use.

Issue 2
- -------
Class:       Command Injection
Versions:    2.23.4 and above
Description: Bugzilla 2.23.4 and newer use the Email:: modules instead
             of the Mail:: and MIME:: ones. The argument passed to the
- -f option of Email::Send::Sendmail() is insufficiently escaped
             and may lead to limited command injection when called from
             email_in.pl, a script which was also introduced in 2.23.4.
Reference:   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=386860

Issue 3
- -------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.23.3 and above
Description: Bugzilla's WebService (XML-RPC) interface allows you to
access the time-tracking fields (such as Deadline, Estimated Time, etc.)
             on all bugs, even if you normally cannot access
time-tracking fields.
