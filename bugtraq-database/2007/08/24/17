24th Chaos Communication Congress 2007: Call for Participation

24C3: Volldampf voraus!
24th Chaos Communication Congress
December 27th to 30th, 2007
Berlin, Germany

http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/

Overview
========

The 24th Chaos Communication Congress (24C3) is the annual four-day  
conference organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) in Berlin,  
Germany. First held in 1984, it since has established itself as “the  
European Hacker Conference”. Lectures and workshops on a multitude of  
topics attract a diverse audience of thousands of hackers,  
scientists, artists, and utopists from all around the world. The  
24C3s slogan is Volldampf voraus! – the German equivalent of “full  
steam ahead” – a particular request for talks and projects featuring  
forward looking hands-on topics. The Chaos Computer Club has always  
encouraged creative and unorthodox interaction with technology and  
society, in the good tradition of the real meaning of “hacking”.

Topics
======

The 24C3 conference program is roughly divided into six general  
categories. These categories serve as guidelines for your submissions  
(and later as a means of orientation for your prospective audience).  
However, it is not mandatory for your talk to exactly match the  
descriptions below. Anything that is interesting and/or funny will be  
taken into consideration.

# Hacking

The ‘Hacking’ category addresses topics dealing with technology,  
concentrating on current research with high technical merit.  
Traditionally, the majority of all lectures at 24C3 revolve around  
hacking.

Topics in this domain include but are in no way limited to:  
programming, hardware hacking, cryptography, network and system  
security, security exploits, and creative use of technology.

# Making

The ‘Making’ category is all about making and breaking things and the  
wonderful stuff you can build in your basement or garage. Most  
welcome are submissions dealing with the latest in electronics, 3D- 
fabbing, climate-change survival technology, robots and drones, steam  
machines, alternative transportation tools and guerilla-style knitting.

# Science

The ‘Science’ category covers current or future objects of scientific  
research that have the potential to radically change our lives, be it  
basic research or projects conducted for the industry.

We are looking for talks and papers on the state of the art in this  
domain, covering subjects such as nano technology, quantum computing,  
high frequency physics, bio-technology, brain-computer interfaces,  
automated analysis of surveillance cctv, etc.

# Society

Technology development causes great changes in society and will  
determine our future. This category is for all talks on subjects like  
hacker tools and the law, surveillance practices, censorship,  
intellectual property and copyright issues, data retention, software  
patents, effects of technology on kids, and the impact of technology  
on society in general.

# Culture

Shaping the world we live in means making it more interesting,  
entertaining and beautiful. The hacker culture has many facets  
ranging from electronic art objects, stand-up comedy, geek  
entertainment, video game and board game culture, music, 3D art to e- 
text literature and beyond. If you like to show your art and teach  
others how to make their lives more enjoyable, this category is for you.

# Community

In addition to individual speakers the Chaos Communication Congress  
is also inviting groups such as developer teams, projects and  
activists to present themselves and their topics.

Developer groups are also encouraged to ask for support to hold  
smaller on-site developer conferences and meetings in the course of  
the Congress.

Further Information
===================

The Chaos Communication Congress is a non-profit oriented event and  
speakers are not paid. However, financial help on travel expenses and  
accommodation is possible. It needs to be agreed upon after  
acceptance of the submission, though. Don't be shy and state your  
requirements when submitting your lecture and we'll work something out!

You can find the preliminary agenda and additional information on our  
24C3 website at http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/.

For further information and questions please feel free to contact  
24c3-content@...v.de

Submissions
===========

All proposals must be submitted online using our online lecture  
submission system at https://cccv.pentabarf.org/submission/24C3.  
Please follow the instructions given there. If you have any questions  
regarding your submission, feel free to contact us at 24c3- 
content@...v.de but do NOT submit your lecture via e-mail.

Language
========

24C3 is an international event and we want to have a lot of  
interesting talks in English for the benefit of our growing number of  
international guests. So ideally we are looking for speakers who can  
give lectures and/or workshops in either English or German. But while  
we are interested in maximum quality of presentation, the topic and  
its relevance to our community are our main concern. So don't worry  
about your English skills: the language of a submission is not a  
criteria for accepting or rejecting it!

If you feel insecure talking in English, have received criticism on  
your language skills from your audience before, or if you just fear  
that the value and understandability of your lecture might suffer,  
please offer your talk in German. Please tell us if you are a native  
speaker of English or have similar skills, when submitting your lecture.

Lecture Requirements
====================

Lectures should not exceed 45 minutes plus up to 10 minutes for  
questions and answers. Longer time slots are possible if we feel the  
topic demands it (please tell us if necessary). Workshops should  
include a talk on the basic principles and a practical hands-on section.

Dates and deadlines
===================

The deadline for submission is October 12th, 2007 Midnight UTC.  
Notification of acceptance will be sent by e-mail on November 11th,  
2007 the latest. However, you may very well get your notification  
earlier than that if needed. Final papers or slides are due by  
November 18th, 2007.
