Subject: Skype Network Remote DoS Exploit

Hi all!



On SecurityLab.ru forum an exploit code was published by an anonymous user. 
Reportedly it must have caused Skype massive disconnections today.



The PoC uses standard Skype client to call to a specific number. This call 
causes denial of service of current Skype server and forces Skype to 
reconnect to another server. The new server also "freezes" and so on ... the 
entire network.
