If nruns would be courageous enough, they would release this proof of concept tool to create prejustice and have the law checked.

To my feeling, the German security scene suffers from paranoia rather than trying to find out how the law is enforced.

nruns legal department should be able to cope with that case.

I hope nruns would go for it to enable the european security community to continue to work on good stuff.
