Subject: Immunity Debugger v1.1 Release

 The number one request this month was "Please implement a Python shell
so I  can write scripts and play with immlib features on the fly!". This
is now  done. Enjoy! Next to that we continued our efforts to improve
the overall
 debugging experience with two new libraries, libstackanalyze and Ero
 Carrera's pefile and two new scripts: searchcrypt and stackvar.   The
Immunity Debugger engine has also undergone changes to improve
reliability issues, fix reported memleaks and remove some well-know bugs
used for packers such as the printfloat format error (a.k.a the FLD
bug).   Keep in mind we still have a contest going for the best Immunity
Debugger script. The winner gets a free SILICA! Get more details from
http://forum.immunityinc.com/index.php?topic=12.0 . 
 We hope you enjoy this month's release. You can upgrade your current
Immunity Debugger by going to Help/Update or directly downloading from
http://debugger.immunityinc.com/register.html
