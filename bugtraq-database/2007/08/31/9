That is not exactly new news.

The devices are old and all that is "rootkit-like" about them is the
fact that they interact with the kernel in order to hide their own files

Not everything that interacts with the kernel is a rootkit. Or would
anyone want to classify GRSecurity as a rootkit? RBAC will let you hide
parts of your filesystem as well...
