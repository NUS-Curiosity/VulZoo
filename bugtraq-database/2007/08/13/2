Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Net::DNS Perl
module, allowing for a Denial of Service and a cache poisoning attack.

Background
==========

Net::DNS is a Perl implementation of a DNS resolver.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-perl/Net-DNS       < 0.60                             >= 0.60

Description
===========

hjp discovered an error when handling DNS query IDs which make them
partially predictable. Steffen Ullrich discovered an error in the
dn_expand() function which could lead to an endless loop.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted DNS request to the
server which could result in a Denial of Service with an infinite
recursion, or perform a cache poisoning attack.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Net::DNS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/Net-DNS-0.60"
