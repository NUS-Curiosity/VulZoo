Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SquirrelMail, allowing
for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP and
SMTP protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /   Vulnerable   /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/squirrelmail     < 1.4.10a-r2           >= 1.4.10a-r2

Description
===========

The functions deletekey(), gpg_check_sign_pgp_mime() and gpg_recv_key()
used in the SquirrelMail G/PGP encryption plugin do not properly escape
user-supplied data.

Impact
======

An authenticated user could use the plugin to execute arbitrary code on
the server, or a remote attacker could send a specially crafted e-mail
to a SquirrelMail user, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the underlying web server.
Note that the G/PGP plugin is disabled by default.

Workaround
==========

Enter the SquirrelMail configuration directory
(/usr/share/webapps/squirrelmail/version/htdocs/config), then execute
the conf.pl script. Select the plugins menu, then select the gpg plugin
item number in the "Installed Plugins" list to disable it. Press S to
save your changes, then Q to quit.

Resolution
==========

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.10a-r2"
