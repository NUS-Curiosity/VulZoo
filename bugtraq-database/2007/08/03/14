> How would you name it? "Winamp 5.35 (Infinite) M3U File Inclusion Stack
> Overflow Exception"?

I actually agree with the original poster. A stack overflow in a client side 
program such as winamp could hardly be labeled 'denial of service'. A user 
program is in general not 'a service'. With your definition every segfault 
could be labeled 'denial of service'.

In any case, I liked your new title much better because it is more accurate 
and does not sound as threatening to server administrators as your original 
one :)

With kind regards,
