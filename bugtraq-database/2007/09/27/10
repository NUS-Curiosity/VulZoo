I'd accept that. Can we agree on a term that means: "Right now you're 
learning about a vulnerability for which there is a working exploit, and no 
way to protect yourself short of impacting the availability of your systems 
by unplugging them or disabling the affected service."?

I'd propose "unpatched vulnerability with known working exploit", but it's 
kind of verbose, and I don't think some of the kids joining our ranks can 
string that many complete words together anymore (too much texting).
