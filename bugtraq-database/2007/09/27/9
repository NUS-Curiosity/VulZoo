I have tested this on a Windoze XP SP2 (fully patched).  Scanned with
Norton AV Corporate Edition v 10 and ClamAV 0.91.2 and both scans came
back just fine, no hanging.

Upon opening the file, it caused 50% CPU utilization at a constant
rate.  That could not be stopped until the computer was reboot.
Simply closing the program wasn't enough to stop the CPU from
stopping...

BTW - I'm running this on a P4 with HT.  Not a dual core...
