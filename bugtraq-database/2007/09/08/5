Information technology has become crucial to almost every part of
society.  IT infrastructures have become critical in the world-wide
economy, the financial sector, the health sector, the government's
administration, the military, and the educational sector.

Due to its importance the disruption or loss of IT capabilities results
in a massive reduction of operability.  Hence, IT security is
continously gaining importance.

Although security usually gets integrated into the design process of IT
systems nowadays, the process of maintaining security in the operation
of IT infrastructures still lacks the appropriate attendance in most
cases.  Especially the capability to manage and respond to IT security
incidents and their forensic analysis is established in the rarest
cases. The quickly rising number of security incidents worldwide makes
the implementation of incident management capabilities essential.

In order to advance the fields of IT-Incident Management and Forensics
the special interest-group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response

(SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI) organises an annual
conference, bringing together experts from throughout the world, to
discuss state of the art in the areas of Incident Management and
IT-Forensics (IMF). IMF promotes collaboration and exchange of ideas
between industry, academia, law-enforcement and other government bodies.
