Hi

         Your point is right. But there are a number of factors other 
than this
in exploiting pdf  in other sense. My latest research is working over the
exploitation of PDF.

Even if you look at the core then there are no restriction on READ in PDF
in most of the versions. Only outbound data is filtered to some extent. you
can even read /etc/passwd file from inside of PDF.

Other infection vector includes infection through Local Area Networks 
through
sharing and printing PDF docs and all.

My upcoming research feature everything regarding this and the issue you 
have
already discussed.
