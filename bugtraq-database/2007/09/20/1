Subject: Security Advisory for Bugzilla 3.0.1 and 3.1.1

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers a critical security issue that has recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:

* Even with account creation disabled, users can use the WebService to
  create an account.

We strongly advise that 2.23.x and 3.0.x users upgrade to 3.0.2
immediately. Users of CVS HEAD or 3.1.1 should upgrade to 3.1.2
immediately. This is critical if you have a "requirelogin" installation
and also have the WebService enabled.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Access
Versions:    2.23.3 and above.
Description: Bugzilla::WebService::User::offer_account_by_email does
             not check the "createemailregexp" parameter, and thus
             allows users to create accounts who would normally be
             denied account creation.
             The "emailregexp" parameter is still checked.
             If you do not have the SOAP::Lite Perl module installed on
             your Bugzilla system, your system is not vulnerable
             (because the Bugzilla WebService will not be enabled).
