rPath Security Advisory: 2007-0194-1
Published: 2007-09-20
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Major
Exposure Level Classification:
    Local Root Deterministic Unauthorized Access
Updated Versions:
    kdebase=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//1/3.4.2-3.14-1

rPath Issue Tracking System:
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1725

References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4569

Description:
    Previous versions of the kdebase package contain a kdm vulnerability in
    which an unprivileged user may, if auto-login is enabled, be allowed to
    log in as a another user (or as root) without supplying proper login
    credentials.  If kdm is also configured to service incoming XDMCP
    requests, remote root unauthorized access may be possible.
    
    In its default configuration, rPath Linux 1 is not vulnerable to this
    unauthorized access.
