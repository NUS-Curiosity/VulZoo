Subject: Re[2]: [Full-disclosure] Next generation malware: Windows Vista's gadget API

Dear Peter,

I have a few questions, maybe you have time to answer them.

PG> No, this is an entirely new level of attack,
"New level of attack", what makes you believe that?

PG> because it's moved the dancing
PG> bunnies problem onto the Windows desktop.
Huh ? What is different to let's say the southpark worm we saw years
ago? Or any other normal binary that promised to be a screensaver or
similar ?

PG> The level of warnings is
PG> irrelevant
Euhm ok, so in your logic the program shouldn't run at all ? What do
you perceive as "relevant" here.

PG> Given what an incredible attack vector they are
What is incredible in this attack vector ? What is actually new ?
What is the differnce with the  "User downloads screensaver and get's
owned" attack vector ?

PG>  I'm amazed there haven't been any serious
PG> exploits yet.
See Wikipedia definition of exploit :
