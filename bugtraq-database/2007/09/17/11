Irrespective of the rest of what Roger says (which I agree with FTR), this bit 
is simply wrong.  Look at the PoC that has been made public:

https://strikecenter.bpointsys.com/articles/2007/08/26/vista-gadget-patches-in-ms07-048

It's not (just) about downloading malware gadgets.  It's about exploiting 
vulnerabilities *in* gadgets (the default gadgets in Vista, in the case of 
the PoC).  Essentially anywhere a gadget calls for example eval() on 
untrusted data you *may* have a a problem.
