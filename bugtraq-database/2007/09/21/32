Dear Fatboy,

Let's put aside for a minute the fact that you have no idea what 
you are talking about and let's also, for the benefit of this very 
valuable debate, assume your definition is correct. First, please 
prove this bug was never used in the wild. After that, please prove 
your credibility in the realm of defining words related to illegal 
computer hacking. Thanks.

P.S. Talking about botnets doesn't count to satisfy part 1 OR part 2
