 Name calling and arguing about semantics is about as useful and
enjoyable as a fart in an elevator.

Sheesh.  I thought it was just the Quake players that got in to e-peen
pissing contests.

And yes, I'm top-posting!

Tell me something -- what do *you* think "zero day" means that
differentiates it from "not zero day"?  I keep seeing people use the
term "zero day" (or "0day" or however you want to spell it) without any
regard for how this is meant to differentiate it from some alternative
to "zero day", and I have to wonder what these people think the term
means.  Do you just regard it as a way to make discovery of a
vulnerability as more "important" or "exciting"?  Why exactly use the
term if it has no meaning other than "look at this!"?

There is no such thing as a "zero day vulnerability".  A "zero day
exploit" is an exploit that has been used to compromise systems by the
"bad guys" before the "good guys" discovered it or, arguably, an exploit
being used by the "bad guys" before the "good guys" have developed a
patch for it.  It's not a proof of concept that no "bad guy" has any use
for, and it's not a vulnerability that someone outside of a vendor
discovered before the vendor announced its discovery.  If you have a
definition of the term "zero day" in a computer security context that
contradicts mine, I'd love to read your reasoning and see your sources.
After all, I can't learn anything new if I ignore things that I don't
already know.
