Subject: ToorCon Final Lineup Announcement

Hey guys,

Just thought I'd shoot out a quick shameless plug for ToorCon and
mention that we've published our full speaker lineup and have
finalized our Seminars and Workshops schedule. We will be increasing
the registration prices on Sunday, September 23rd so if you're
interested in coming out, make sure you register before then or you'll
be stuck paying extra later. More information about ToorCon this year
can be found at http://www.toorcon.org.


WORKSHOPS - Thu, Oct 18th - $900

*NEW* - Penetrating the Epoxy Curtain: Hands-On Silicon Hacking
Instructors: Bunnie & Christopher Tarnovsky
Availability: 9 seats left

I'm really excited about this workshop. It'll involve dissecting a
stored value smart card die and reverse engineering the transistors to
determine what the different parts of the chip do and by the end of
the course be able to circumvent some of the card's hardware access
controls. We're gearing this workshop towards software reverse
engineerers that want to learn more about how the hardware ticks and
get a better understanding for how things are implemented at the even
lower levels. People attending this course will receive decaped parts,
large format prints of the die, flash drives with high-resolution
pictures of the die, and hands-on access to chip reverse engineering
equipment.

Building/Hacking Open Source Embedded Wireless Routers
Instructor: Ken Caruso & Matt Westervelt
Availability: 9 seats left

This workshop is setup to teach people how to deploy real-world large
scale wireless networks using open source hardware and software.
People attending this class will receive a free Soekris access point
setup and will get all of the software pre-packaged to readily boot it
up and run any of the standard mesh-networking protocols. This
workshop is run by the guys that run the Seattle Wireless community
network and have extensive experience with setting up wireless
networks all around the world.

Crash Course in Penetration Testing
Instructor: Joseph McCray
Availability: 5 seats left

This workshop has received a lot of attention recently and is filling
up quick. The premise behind this workshop is that the first half of
the class teaches the basics of penetration testing and the second
half involves running wild on a rootwars network setup in the
classroom and learning techniques with hands-on exercises. People
attending this workshop will leave with a 250GB 2.5" harddrive filled
with vmware images of challenge VMs and an attack VM pre-loaded with
all of the basic hacking tools needed to start playing. The goal is
that after people leave the class they'll be able to continue
developing their skills by completing further challenge levels in the
rootwars VMs.


All of these workshops are taking place at the Hotel Solamar in
Downtown San Diego on Thursday, October 18th. Workshop admission is
currently $900 which includes entrance to the general ToorCon
conference and we're offering a discount for people who wish to also
attend our Seminars on Friday, October 19th for only $1100, a $300
savings!
