The reason malicious use before there's a patch is significant is that it
indicates a greater risk profile for users of the software in question.
If it's being actively used to compromise systems, you can't just sit
around waiting for a patch and expect to call your systems "secure" in
any sense of the term: you have to find a work-around, or remove the
vulnerable systems from the environment in which they're vulnerable
(normally, this means "the Internet").  That's why the term zero day is
important, and why it should not be misused to refer to something
demonstrated in a lab somewhere but not publicly disclosed in any detail.

That's why it's important to differentiate from exploits "in the wild"
and discovered vulnerabilities or proofs of concept.
