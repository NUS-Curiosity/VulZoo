 Sign Extension Vulnerability

Multiple Vendor ImageMagick Sign Extension Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 09.19.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 19, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

ImageMagick is a suite of image manipulation tools (animate, composite,
conjure, convert, display, identify, import, mogrify and montage) that
are sometimes used by other applications for processing image files.
For more information about ImageMagick, visit the vendor's site at the
following URL.

http://www.imagemagick.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a sign extension vulnerability in ImageMagick, as
included in various vendors' operating system distributions, allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability specifically exists in the ReadDIBImage() as shown
below.

  558    image->columns=(unsigned long) dib_info.width
  ...
  620    bytes_per_line=4*((image->columns*dib_info.bits_per_pixel+31)/32);
  621    length=bytes_per_line*image->rows;
  622    pixels=(unsigned char *) AcquireMagickMemory((size_t) MagickMax(
  623      bytes_per_line,image->columns+256)*image->rows*sizeof(*pixels));
  ...
  629       count=ReadBlob(image,length,pixels);
  ...
  638       status=DecodeImage(image,dib_info.compression ? MagickTrue :
MagickFalse,pixels);

At line 558, "dib_info.width" is a signed short, which is extended to an
unsigned long and assigned to "image->columns". For example, a value of
0x8000 will be extended to 0xffff8000. Later, it is used as a
multiplier when calculating the allocation size. An integer overflow
occurs, leading to a heap block of insufficient size being allocated.
Consequently, a heap buffer overflow occurs.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the user.

One way of exploiting this vulnerability is to persuade a targeted user
to open a malicious image file with a program that utilizes the
ImageMagick library.

As the tools that are part of ImageMagick are sometimes used as helper
tools by other applications, this user may be the same as the web
server user. This scenario is somewhat more severe than the previously
described attack vector since the image processing can occur
automatically.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense Labs confirmed that ImageMagick version 6.3.4 is vulnerable. It
is suspected that other versions of ImageMagick are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Exposure to this vulnerability can be mitigated by moving or deleting
the related module files. The file locations may vary between
distributions. The globbing expression listed below corresponds to a
Red Hat Linux system.

  /usr/lib/ImageMagick-*/modules*/coders/dib.*

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The ImageMagick maintainers have addressed this vulnerability with the
release of version 6.3.5-9. More information is available from the
following URL.

http://studio.imagemagick.org/pipermail/magick-announce/2007-September/000037.html

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2007-4988 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
