Subject: AIM Local File Display in Notification Window

Upon further exploration of our previous bug, I discovered that the
rendered HTML was even capable of displaying local files. Specifically,
<img src="C:/WINDOWS/Zapotec.bmp"> was able to display the file from the
Windows directory without question. We further experimented with this and
tried including large files from the windows directory (ex. shell32.dll)
as scripts (ex. <script src=...) in attempt to overflow the buffer.
However, these attempts yielded no success.

Discovery credited to:
