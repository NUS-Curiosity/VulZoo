"Working in a white hat's lab" is not as urgent as "being abused right now in the wild".

Proposed:

1. A 0-day EXPLOIT is an Unpatched Vulnerability that we realize is being or has been abused.

2. A 0-day VULNERABILITY: no such thing. All vulnerabilities are either Unpatched or Patched. They start out in Unpatched status the moment some programmer creates them. They remain Unpatched until they are Patched.
