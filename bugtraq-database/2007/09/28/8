Subject: Re: 0trace - traceroute on established connections

I think it would be interesting to enumerate incoming connections. 

user (192.168.0.2) --> router (192.168.0.1) --> gateway/masquarade --> ~~~~ --> server (0trace).
What do you think about it? is it possible to enumerate internal "user" user network?
