Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Video Surveillance IP Gateway and
Services Platform Authentication Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20070905-video

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070905-video.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 September 5 1600 UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Video Surveillance IP Gateway video encoder and decoder, Services
Platform (SP), and Integrated Services Platform (ISP) devices contain
authentication vulnerabilities that allow remote users with network
connectivity to gain the complete administrative control of vulnerable
devices. There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has made free software available to address these vulnerabilities
for affected customers.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070905-video.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

These products are vulnerable:

  * Cisco Video Surveillance IP Gateway Encoder/Decoder (Standalone
    and Module) firmware version 1.8.1 and earlier
  * Cisco Video Surveillance SP/ISP Decoder Software firmware version
    1.11.0 and earlier
  * Cisco Video Surveillance SP/ISP firmware version 1.23.7 and
    earlier

Users should consult their Stream Manager configuration management
tool to determine the versions of firmware installed on deployed video
surveillance devices.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Video Surveillance IP Gateway video encoders and decoders allow
the video feeds of cameras to be sent over an IP network. This function
provides an upgrade path for users to convert from existing analog
surveillance systems. Cisco Video Surveillance Services Platforms and
Integrated Services Platforms record and aggregate video feeds received
from IP Gateways. Stored video can be viewed and manipulated using the
Cisco Video Surveillance Stream Manager software.

  * IP Gateway Encoder/Decoder Telnet Authentication Vulnerability:

    The Telnet server installed on Cisco Video Surveillance IP Gateway
    video encoders and decoders does not prompt for authentication.
    This may allow a remote user with network connectivity to gain
    interactive shell access with administrative privileges on
    vulnerable devices. This issue is documented in Cisco Bug ID
    CSCsj31729.

  * Services Platform/Integrated Services Platform Default
    Authentication Vulnerability:

    Cisco Video Surveillance Services Platform and Integrated Services
    Platform devices ship with default passwords for the sypixx and
    root user accounts. Users are not able to change these passwords
    due to application requirements. Users with knowledge of the
    default passwords may be able to gain interactive shell access with
    administrative privileges to vulnerable devices. This issue is
    documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsj34681.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerabilities in individual networks.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a FAQ to answer additional questions regarding VSS at

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities will result in the
ability for a remote user to gain complete administrative access to
vulnerable devices. An attacker with access to a vulnerable device may
be able to view, alter, or delete video streams processed by the device,
or cause a denial of service that may result in the loss of surveillance
coverage.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

Filtering traffic to affected systems on screening devices can be used
as a mitigation technique for both vulnerabilities. Access to the Telnet
service (TCP port 23) on vulnerable devices should be restricted to
authorized administration workstations.

There is currently no method to configure filtering directly on IP
Gateway encoders and decoders or Services Platform devices.

Filters blocking access to TCP port 23 should be deployed at the network
edge as part of a transit access list, which will protect the router
where the access control list (ACL) is configured and also other devices
behind it. Further information about transit access control lists is
available in the white paper Transit Access Control Lists: Filtering at
Your Edge, which is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070905-video.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Prior to deploying software, customers should consult their maintenance
provider or check the software for feature set compatibility and known
issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to
be bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found
at http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com"
for software upgrades.

Customers with vulnerable devices should contact the Cisco TAC or their
primary support organization to obtain fixed software and upgrade
instructions.
