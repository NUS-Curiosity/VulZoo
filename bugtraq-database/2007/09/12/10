I don't see what this has to do with PHP. If a user has been granted
the FILE privilege on MySQL, they can create and read files on the server
with the permissions of the mysqld user. That privilege should clearly
not be granted to untrusted users, at least not without using mysqld's 
--secure-file-priv=/some/safe/path option.
