Subject: Marshal MailMarshal TAR Unpacking Vulnerability

Marshal MailMarshal TAR Unpacking Vulnerability

Overview
--------
Vendor: Marshal (www.marshal.com)
Product: MailMarshal <= 6.2.1.3253
Vulnerability: Remote file overwrite, Remote execution
Risk: HIGH

Description
-----------
During a security audit for a customer we have discovered
a serios vulnerability in MailMarshal (an E-Mail Security Gateway)
when unpacking TAR archives.

MailMarshal uses an old version of GNU tar (1.11.8 + 1.5win32).
Sending a special crafted TAR file it is possible to traverse
through directories and even drives. Thus files can be spread
onto the system and existing files can be overwritten depending
on the privileges of running MailMarshal processes (default:
System privileges) This can lead to a complete system compromise.

Solution
--------
Install vendor patch. The vendor has released a patch at:
