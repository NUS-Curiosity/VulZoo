Details
Symantec was notified of a potential denial of service vulnerability in the device driver SYMTDI.SYS. A specially crafted IRP sent to an IOCTL handler function could allow memory to be overwritten because the address space was not properly validated in some versions of the driver. A potential attacker must be logged into the computer to attempt an exploit. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could potentially allow that user to crash their computer. 

Symantec Response
Symantec engineers have verified that the vulnerability exists in the products listed in the Affected Products section above, and have provided updates for all affected products. Consumer (Norton) products can be updated by running LiveUpdate.  Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition customers can obtain the update from the Symantec web site. 

Symantec is not aware of any customers impacted by this issue, or of any attempts to exploit the issue.
