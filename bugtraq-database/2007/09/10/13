Subject: New Whitepaper : g00gle CrewBots

Hello BugTraq,
there's a new whitepaper at http://www.gray-world.net/

g00gle CrewBots : http://www.gray-world.net/projects/papers/gbots-1.0.txt
gBot project        : http://www.gray-world.net/pr_gbot.shtml

g00gle CrewBots shows how it would be possible to set up covert channels through g00gle services over the http protocol.
The POC of the gBot project is a set of two python scripts allowing to set up communication channels over the G-Notebook and G-HistorySearch services, exploiting the techniques explained in the paper.

Cheers,
