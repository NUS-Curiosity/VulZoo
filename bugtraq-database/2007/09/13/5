Subject: Next generation malware: Windows Vista's gadget API

A paper has just been released on the Windows Vista's gadget API.  The 
abstract is as follows:

Windows has had the ability to embed HTML into itâ€™s user interface for many 
years. Right back to and including Windows NT 4.0, it has been possible to 
embed HTML into the task bar, but the OS has always maintained a sandbox, 
from which the HTML has been unable to escape. All this changes with Windows 
Vista. This paper seeks to inform system administrators, users and the
wider community on both potential attack vectors using gadgets and the 
mitigations provided by Windows Vista.

The full paper can be found at http://www.portcullis-security.com/165.php.

Cheers,
Tim
