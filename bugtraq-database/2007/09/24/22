Its a little less abstract than that. Consider that the United States
government might want to worry about whether some foreign nation is
banking a large pool of private 0day exploits in preparation for war.
Such a nation might farm these private 0day exploits by employing a pool
of vulnerability researchers and exploit developers, and just not
published the results.

This is a perfectly viable way to produce what amounts to Internet
munitions. The recent incident of Estonia Under *Russian Cyber Attack*?
<http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3678606> is an example
of such a network brush war in which possession of such an arsenal would
be very useful.
