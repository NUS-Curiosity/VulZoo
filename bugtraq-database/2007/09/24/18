I was under the impression that "0day" came from the hacking/cracking 
community and was synonymous with the concept of "private 0day" that has 
been used in this thread.

So, a hacker/cracker would have a variety of tools at their disposal 
including many exploits that were known to security professionals, 
vendors, and the public for various lengths of time, but also the "0day" 
exploits for which no vulnerable machines should be patched against.  As 
soon as the vulnerability is published, it no longer becomes a "0day" 
since even in the absence of vendor patches, admins could take actions to 
audit and protect their systems.

Under this definition, "0day" exploits should be not publically disclosed 
and to be pedantic should be actively being used to break into systems. 
Exploits generated by the grey-hat community, not used for malicious 
reasons, and published before vendor patches exist would not have gone 
through the "0day" stage.  Neither would exploits generated for publically 
known vulnerabilities before the vendor patches were released would be 
considered "0day" since the vulnerability was publically known and again 
there could be workarounds encountered by the hacker/cracker that would 
prevent gaining access.

It seems that the definition of the term has morphed in the past 10+ years 
though...
