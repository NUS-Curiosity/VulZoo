in brief
i) Pages with customized data view web parts or data view web parts linked to lists on other sites  are not accesible. Error message either "access denied" or "Unable to display this Web Part. To troubleshoot the problem, open this Web page in a Windows SharePoint Services-compatible HTML editor such as FrontPage. If the problem persists, contact your Web server administrator."

ii) No user can use the Edit in Datasheet view feature on lists. (Possible ok for admins).  When the 'Edit in Datasheet View' button is clicked the Datasheet control appears to load however the page is redirected back to the default view in every case.

Issues currently unconfirmed by Microsoft.
