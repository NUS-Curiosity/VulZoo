Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilites have been found in MIT Kerberos 5, which could allow
a remote unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.

Background
==========

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol. kadmind is the MIT Kerberos 5 administration daemon.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/mit-krb5     < 1.5.3-r1                     >= 1.5.3-r1

Description
===========

A stack buffer overflow (CVE-2007-3999) has been reported in
svcauth_gss_validate() of the RPC library of kadmind. Another
vulnerability (CVE-2007-4000) has been found in
kadm5_modify_policy_internal(), which does not check the return values
of krb5_db_get_policy() correctly.

Impact
======

The RPC related vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges
on the host running kadmind. The second vulnerability requires the
remote attacker to be authenticated and to have "modify policy"
privileges. It could then also allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.5.3-r1"
