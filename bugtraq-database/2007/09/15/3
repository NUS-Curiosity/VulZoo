Synopsis
========

A remote stack-based buffer overflow has been discovered in Eggdrop.

Background
==========

Eggdrop is an IRC bot extensible with C or Tcl.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/eggdrop      < 1.6.18-r2                     >= 1.6.18-r2

Description
===========

Bow Sineath discovered a boundary error in the file
mod/server.mod/servrmsg.c when processing overly long private messages
sent by an IRC server.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice an Eggdrop user to connect the bot to a
malicious server, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
on the host running Eggdrop.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Eggdrop users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/eggdrop-1.6.18-r2"
