"More effort" _unless_ the administrator has NOT changed the default
admin credentials or that he/she has NOT clicked on "Save Password" on
his browser auth prompt any time in the past. Any of these two
conditions would certainly make the attack more feasible. Just thought
it's worth it saying, that's all :-D

And yes, there are tricks so that when you get CSRFed on a browser
that has the basic auth credentials saved, the auth prompt will NOT
pop up in order to get confirmation from the user to submit the
request. I'm sure some people know what I'm talking about.

Good advisory and thank you for sharing it with us!

PS: Henri, please do not hesitate to contact me if you want feedback
on any 0days CSRF you might have at the moment.
