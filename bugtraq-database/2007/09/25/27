Okay. I think we exhausted the different views, and maybe we are now able 
to come to a conlusion on what we WANT 0day to mean.

What do you, as professional, believe 0day should mean, regardless of 
previous definitions?

Obviously, the term has become charged in the past couple of years with 
the targeted office vulnerabilities attacks, WMF, ANI, etc.

We require a term to address these, just as much as we do "unpatched 
vulnerability" or "fully disclosed vulnerability".

What other such descriptions should we consider before proceeding? 
non-disclosure?

 	Gadi.
