Seems to me that definitions, and language itself, is a product of
evolution. You can't just remove all previous meanings. Its better
anyway to stick to the most accepted, acknowledged and DOCUMENTED
definitions:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0day

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zero%20day

http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=what+is+0day&gwp=13

Even better:
