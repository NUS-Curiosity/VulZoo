That's not true at all; after leaving the Little Rascals TV show, 
William Thomas (Buckwheat) entered the fledgling field of security 
research.  Whenever he'd discover a vulnerability, he'd shout "O-tay!". 
  His peers soon started calling vulnerabilities "O-tays" and through 
typos and accents it eventually morphed into "O-days".
