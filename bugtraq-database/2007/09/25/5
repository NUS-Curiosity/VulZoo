Description:
    The previous version of the legacy openssl compatibility package
    may enable vulnerabilities to multiple attacks in applications that
    use this library, some of which which may allow a remote attacker
    Unauthorized Access.  Other vulnerabilities include Denials of
    Service and Information Exposure.
    
    This compatibility library was provided solely for transient
    compatibility with applications built for alpha releases of rPath
    Linux, to make it easier for alpha testers to upgrade their systems
    to rPath Linux 1.  rPath is not aware of any applications that
    currently use these libraries, and so it is unlikely that any
    systems will actually be vulnerable to these attacks.
