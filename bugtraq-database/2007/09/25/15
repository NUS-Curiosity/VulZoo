Hi Crispin,

I agree with almost everything you say until here:
"I continue to dismiss the requirement that an 0day be found
maliciously exploiting machines, because that requires inferring
intent."

IMO, everybody in this thread is taking this from an
inside-to-outside approach, whereas a '0day' is the opposite.

If I'm on a CERT team for a corporation then I don't give a flying F
if somebody's concocted a cool exploit for a vulnerability that
hasn't been patched; and moreover, I don't know about it.

I only care if there's malicious code running around in the real
world doing damage that has no patch for the vulnerability. That's
when I have to take some action or be completely helpless and in my
mind that's the only time I consider a '0day' to have any relevance.

Let me repeat: if it's a theoretical exploit, or even if it's hit
100,000 machines but has not been reported and is not "being in the
wild", then it has no relevance to me BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT
EXISTS and therefore to me it is not 0day.

Only through normal channels doing my daily CERT work (dCERT, FrSIRT,
Secunia, etc.) if I see an exploit on an unpatched vulnerability
doing real damage is when I would ever consider the term '0day'.

Very respectfully,
Ignacio
