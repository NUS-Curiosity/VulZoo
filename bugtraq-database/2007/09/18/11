 Vista's gadget API

Sirs,
The lack of a defense vector doesn't translate magically to a new attack vector. The absence of common security mitigating controls is referred to as a vulnerability. Really all old attack vectors apply.

The secure design model for this type of application should be a sandboxed by zone. The vulnerability is that the code is implicitly trusted no sandbox implemented and of course it will be difficult to hold evil gadget creators to task due to the transparent lack of any accountability by everyone. Fingers are already flying.

The issue is all about an un-sandboxed application where standard best practices use and vast prior experience should have dictated it should have been sand boxed. This is a divestiture away from signed controls and towards 3rd party security programs.

So once again we have no sandbox mitigating controls coupled with a firm lack of accountability per gadget means breached operating systems. Those who have additional security programs largely make up the difference and those who don't will always be wondering why and how the vendor let them get pwned.

I think bot herders will have a field day collecting new devices with this.

It's not so much the attack vector, it's the usability issue.  This makes it
just too easy to convince users to download and execute untrusted content.

On Joe Sixpack's PC in his den?
