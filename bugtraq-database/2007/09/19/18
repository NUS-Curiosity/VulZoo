Synopsis
========

Poppler is vulnerable to an integer overflow and a stack overflow.

Background
==========

Poppler is a cross-platform PDF rendering library originally based on
Xpdf.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/poppler     < 0.5.4-r2                       >= 0.5.4-r2

Description
===========

Poppler and Xpdf are vulnerable to an integer overflow in the
StreamPredictor::StreamPredictor function, and a stack overflow in the
StreamPredictor::getNextLine function. The original vulnerability was
discovered by Maurycy Prodeus. Note: Gentoo's version of Xpdf is
patched to use the Poppler library, so the update to Poppler will also
fix Xpdf.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to view a specially crafted program with a
Poppler-based PDF viewer such as Gentoo's Xpdf, Epdfview, or Evince, a
remote attacker could cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version of Poppler:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.5.4-r2"
