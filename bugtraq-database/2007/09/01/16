Subject: Re: Sony: The Return Of The Rootkit

There are many other options outside of the sony key without the rootkit 
problem. One of the best devices that I have read about is from stealth. 
While I have yet to personally evaluate this product as I understand it 
there is no software outside of the standard USB driver needed to recognize 
and use a standard usb key outside of the initial device programming or a 
lockout state.
