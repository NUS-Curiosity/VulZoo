Steps to reproduce:
1) login to the APC as a user from computer 1
2) Then attempt to login from another computer (we will call this computer 2), the User Name and Password will not be editable, so just click Log On. It will say someone is already logged in. leave this page up.
3) logout of computer 1
4) simply hit refresh on computer 2 and select to resend the headers. you will be logged in as the previously authenticated user.
