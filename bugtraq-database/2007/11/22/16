Subject: Re: Gadu-Gadu Local/Remote Buffer Overflow vulnerability

Hello,

1. you didn't wrote OS specification. It was Win XP or Vista? Which language? It was fully patched? DEP was turned on? Have you tried on privileged user?

2. Why did you wrote VERY HIGH threat? This is local buffer overflow. Moreover user has to replace original file. This vulnerability has more to do with SE :(.

3. I haven't debug this overflow event, could you tell me, how much bytes can you parse?

Nice find.

Cheers,
JD
