Subject: [Argeniss] Data0: Next generation malware for stealing databases (Paper)

Hey, I'm releasing this new paper, not big deal but
interesting.
http://www.argeniss.com/research/Data0.pdf

Abstract: 
This paper it's about Data0, a fictitious (or not)
simple PoC of new malware that after it's 
deployed on a computer in an internal network it will
automatically hack database servers and 
steal their data. Several techniques used by Data0
will be detailed. Data0 will be targeting 
Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database Server two of
the most used database servers. 
While Data0 could be used by the bad guys for evil
purposes, it could also be used by security 
professionals and organizations to determine how
strong networks, workstations, database 
servers, etc. are against this kind of attack. 
This paper is not intended to be a cook book for cyber
criminals, it's intended to show people 
that by implementing simple techniques malware can
become smarter and cause a lot more 
damage in a very near future.


Cesar.
