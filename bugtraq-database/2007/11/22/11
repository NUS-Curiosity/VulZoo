[HSC]MySpace Scripts - Poll Creator JavaScript Injection Vulnerability


Our MySpace Poll Creator script is the ultimate addition to your MySpace resource 
site. The script enables your user to quickly and easily create a poll that they 
can post to profile or bulletin to all their friends. Everyone loves to create a 
poll and gather opinions and this isn't something that's available on every other 
MySpace resource site.

Example of Advance Exploitation of the Application:

Once we have found that the application is vulnerable to JavaScript Injection we see
that there is a form that will be our source of input to alter page source code the Files.
Now we can advance this type of attack by injecting an evil script trough 
/poll/index.php?action=create_new. Now we can inject any code into the Raw From Box 
and submit. This will leave a persistent Code on the Server side.
