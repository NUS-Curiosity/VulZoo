ExoPHPdesk user profile XSS / profile SQL injection
http://exoscripts.com/exohelpdesk

You can inject script code into the website area where you create profile. Cookies are in place making an XSS more than possible.  

http://example.com/helpdesk/index.php?fn=profile&s=&user=admin' sql here
SQL injection in the profile area is possible if you choose a bad input.
