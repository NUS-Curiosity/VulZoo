As a native German speaker, allow me to clarify: with respect to IP
communication, the law mandates saving the following information for 6
months:

- which customer was assigned which IP for what timespan
- sender mail address, receiver mail address and sender IP for each mail
- in case of VOIP: caller and callee phone number and IP address

So it wouldn't make much sense to create connection noise on a TCP or
HTTP basis, as this stuff isn't logged. I think one should rather
concentrate on generating email noise in this regard.

Yours, Florian
