It's all in the ETSI version of the Transport of Intercepted IP Traffic
(http://www.opentap.org/documents/TIIT-v1.0.0.pdf) and the "FuncSpec"
document (http://www.opentap.org/documents/101WAI-GT-FuncspecV1.0.1.doc)

They might have updated it by now. It used to treat email different
from other traffic, but with IM now, I am sure that has changed.

See http://www.opentap.org/documents/ for other documents

Instead of creating noise, one should fix the problem of sending out
plaintext email, and encourage people to use email encryption such as
Enigma for Thunderbird. Encrypt IM conversations with OTR, and via
other ways pro-actively protect ones own privacy. That is a real
structural solution. Don't blame others for not using an envelope around
your own communication.
