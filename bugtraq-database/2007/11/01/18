Given the extremely small amount of space for randomization (16-bit query ID's) does a cryptographically strong PRNG really make difference? Aside from stopping an easy prediction, doesn't it just generate a little extra work for a determined malicious individual?

Seems to be a moot point to me---whether the PRNG is  cryptographically weak or not because of the small sequence number space.
