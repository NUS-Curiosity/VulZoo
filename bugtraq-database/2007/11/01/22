Let's see now, user must:

1) Navigate to porn site
2) Download Trojan
3) Either open file or have set 'Open Safe Files...'
4) Must allow install by typing admin password

Oh yeah, this will clearly hit Mac users hard, not. I don't see this as a big deal, more as Darwin in action (if you will not mind the pun). How this is a big deal is hard to see. Just a few more machines in the bot net.

Now a self-replicating virus, that might be an issue, but this is a dead end. Not even a very effective drive by.
