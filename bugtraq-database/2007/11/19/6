 Vulnerability

There is a well-known unpatched code execution type vulnerability reported originally in msjet40.dll version 4.00.8618.0 too.
This issue reported by HexView is known since March 2005:

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/12960
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0944

We probably don't see a fix for this issue.
