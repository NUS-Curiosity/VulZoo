Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Bochs, possibly
allowing for the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Bochs is a IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in C++.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-emulation/bochs        < 2.3                           >= 2.3

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a heap-based
overflow vulnerability in the NE2000 driver (CVE-2007-2893). He also
discovered a divide-by-zero error in the emulated floppy disk
controller (CVE-2007-2894).

Impact
======

A local attacker in the guest operating system could exploit these
issues to execute code outside of the virtual machine, or cause Bochs
to crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Bochs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/bochs-2.3"
