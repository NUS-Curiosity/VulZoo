Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Link Grammar.

Background
==========

The Link Grammar parser is a syntactic parser of English, based on link
grammar, an original theory of English syntax.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/link-grammar     < 4.2.4-r1                  >= 4.2.4-r1

Description
===========

Alin Rad Pop from Secunia Research discovered a boundary error in the
function separate_sentence() in file tokenize.c when processing an
overly long word which might lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to parse a specially crafted
sentence, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. Note that this
vulnerability may be triggered by an application using Link Grammar to
parse sentences (e.g. AbiWord).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Link Grammar users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/link-grammar-4.2.4-r1"

==========
