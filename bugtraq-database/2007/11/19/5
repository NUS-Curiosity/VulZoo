Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack
 Overflow Vulnerability

is it? If I recall correctly, the hexview advisory was the result of
something like a word-to-byte truncation followed by a byte
sign-extension (but its been long enough that I may be misremembering
it)

In this advisory it was not entirely clear what
the condition was, from what I remember reading of it the other day, it
didn't get into how/why, it just like used ecx or a register as a counter
but didn't show how it came to that value?

Whats interesting is that the hexview patching the bug itself is trivial
from the assembly (not taking into account the work encountered from bin patching
itself) and I know many organizations attempted to put a lot of pressure
to get it patched and failed to do so
