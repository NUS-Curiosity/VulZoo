Subject Name:            perl
Subject Summary:         Programming Language
Subject Home:            http://www.perl.com/
Subject Versions:        5.* <= 5.8.8

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2007-5116
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           arbitrary code execution

Description:
    Will Drewry and Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team have
    discovered a UTF-8 related heap overflow in the regular expression
    compiler of the Perl [0] programming language, probably allowing
    attackers to execute arbitrary code by compiling specially crafted
    regular expressions. The bug manifests in a possible buffer overflow
    in the polymorphic "opcode" support code, caused by ASCII regular
    expressions that really are Unicode regular expressions.
