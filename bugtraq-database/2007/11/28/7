    Thanks for all the replies, he got himself in, and they should be 
contacting local authorities or at least a lawyer today. It's a 
manufacturing company and for some reason 2 of the key services were ran 
under a user acct that once had admin permissions, without the 
administrative rights it wouldn't run and it couldn't be switched over 
to a system service because no one had rights to do so. A days worth of 
work down the drain, gotta love rogue employees is all i can say.

Thanks again :)
