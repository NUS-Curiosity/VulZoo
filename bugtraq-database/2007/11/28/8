It's good that he got it running (it's easy enough with physical
access), but your friend should probably plan for a rebuild in the near
future, or at least a comprehensive audit against the systems.  If the
ex-admin deleted accounts and changed passwords (which, btw, will land
him in jail if the company follows through with it as they should) then
you have no idea what else he's done to compromise the DC or any other
system he has access to.  It's probably too late to depend on any
forensic information to build a case against any additional damages
(since your friend has already stepped on the file system and AD) - but
who knows, a plea bargain including reparation for expenses could cover
the costs for them.

Bottom line is that the integrity of the install is compromised, and
you'll have no effective way of determining what level of trojans,
rootkits, malware, etc he has in place given his obvious propensity for
criminal behavior.  Leaving things "as is" and moving forward could be a
mistake.
