Subject: Re: Breaking RSA: Totient indirect factorization

Gandlf, I'm working on a bizarrely similar project (you don't happen
to hail from New York, do you?) and have found that using the totient
function, you'd need an absurdly large number of CPU cycles to factor
RSA properly, slightly less than brute force... like, 2^5 cycles less.
The algorithm has such an absurdly high order of complexity that you'd
be wasting your time. You'd sooner solve the Riemann Hypothesis.

I have books of data on what is seemingly an identical algorithm;
please e-mail me directly if you're interested in doing this type of
research
