That'd be a significantly different approach. Even grabbing data from  
the previously browsed cache would also work, as far as seeding  
dictionary goes.

If I read the law correctly, it requires retention of "what IP  
connected to another IP" and "which phone number called where." It  
doesn't bother retaining the URL called (my German is rusty, so I may  
be a little off in my interpretation). Connecting to a random IP on a  
random open port (80 and 443, for example) would be a good start to  
accomplish the goal creating chatter. The issue is that the search  
terms to find those ports could lead to connecting to a site that  
increases your profile against general background chatter, even as it  
is raised with random connection traffic.

In that light, I'd regard use of something akin to TOR a slightly  
better solution for protecting privacy and filling up logs.

I wasn't saying there was overselling the effectiveness. I do think  
the approach is innately flawed from a privacy standpoint.
