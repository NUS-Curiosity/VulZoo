Subject: PeopleAggregatory security advisory - re CVE-2007-5631

Hi all,

This is a notification that the remote file inclusion vulnerabilities reported 
in CVE-2007-5631 have been fixed in PeopleAggregator v1.2pre6-release-55, and 
are not exploitable if PHP's register_globals directive is disabled.

CVE entry: http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-5631

-----
Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in PeopleAggregator 1.2pre6 
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the 
current_blockmodule_path parameter to (1) 
AudiosMediaGalleryModule/AudiosMediaGalleryModule.php, (2) 
ImagesMediaGalleryModule/ImagesMediaGalleryModule.php, (3) 
MembersFacewallModule/MembersFacewallModule.php, (4) 
NewestGroupsModule/NewestGroupsModule.php, (5) 
UploadMediaModule/UploadMediaModule.php, and (6) 
VideosMediaGalleryModule/VideosMediaGalleryModule.php in BetaBlockModules/; and 
(7) the path_prefix parameter to several components.
-----
	
Notes from vendor: To be exploitable, the web server must be configured with 
PHP's register_globals directive ON.  To fix a vulnerable installation, either 
turn register_globals OFF in php.ini or via the php_flag Apache option, or 
upgrade to v1.2pre6-release-55.
