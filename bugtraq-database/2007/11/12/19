Subject: Alice - dns spoofer

Hi lists, sorry for crossposting.

On the wave of spoofer2.pl, i've recoded that poc in c and created a
nice makefile. This tool creates spoofed dns requests. If you set the
right domain names (with lots of A records) and dns servers (open,
recursive), you can easily get a traffic multiplication effect.
In a single word, i't a dos. Enjoy.
