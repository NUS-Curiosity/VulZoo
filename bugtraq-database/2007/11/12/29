Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities were found in FLAC possibly
allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Xiph.org Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) library is the reference
implementation of the FLAC audio file format. It contains encoders and
decoders in library and executable form.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/flac     < 1.2.1-r1                        >= 1.2.1-r1

Description
===========

Sean de Regge reported multiple integer overflows when processing FLAC
media files that could lead to improper memory allocations resulting in
heap-based buffer overflows.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted FLAC
file or network stream with an application using FLAC. This might lead
to the execution of arbitrary code with privileges of the user playing
the file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FLAC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/flac-1.2.1-r1"

You should also run revdep-rebuild to rebuild any packages that depend
on older versions of FLAC:

    # revdep-rebuild --library=libFLAC.*
