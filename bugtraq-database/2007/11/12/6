So let me get this straight, you are saying that when you search as admin, you can find posts from vip section, that admin can normally access ( what a surprise ), but when you log off, and act as non-logged in user, you cant find them? Or you cant just speak proper english and we cant understand you? ( maybe its problem for czech guys as me or jindrich tho )
