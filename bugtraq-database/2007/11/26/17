Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in CSTeX, possibly allowing to
execute arbitrary code or overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

CSTeX is a TeX distribution with Czech and Slovak support. It is used
for creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/cstetex     < 2.0.2-r2                       Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Packages marked with asterisks require manual intervention!

Description
===========

Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that CSTeX builds
upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). CSTeX also includes vulnerable
code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).

Impact
======

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
of the user running CSTeX via multiple vectors.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

CSTeX is not maintained upstream, so the package was masked in Portage.
We recommend that users unmerge CSTeX:

    # emerge --unmerge app-text/cstetex

As an alternative, users should upgrade their systems to use teTeX or
TeX Live with its Babel packages.
