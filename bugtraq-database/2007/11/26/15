Synopsis
========

A race condition might lead to theft of user credentials or information
disclosure in services using nss_ldap.

Background
==========

nss_ldap is a Name Service Switch module which allows 'passwd', 'group'
and 'host' database information to be pulled from LDAP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-auth/nss_ldap        < 258                             >= 258

Description
===========

Josh Burley reported that nss_ldap does not properly handle the LDAP
connections due to a race condition that can be triggered by
multi-threaded applications using nss_ldap, which might lead to
requested data being returned to a wrong process.

Impact
======

Remote attackers could exploit this race condition by sending queries
to a vulnerable server using nss_ldap, possibly leading to theft of
user credentials or information disclosure (e.g. Dovecot returning
wrong mailbox contents).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All nss_ldap users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/nss_ldap-258"

References
==========
