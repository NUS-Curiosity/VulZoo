[HSC] GWExtranet Script Injections & Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

Attackers may exploit this issue via a web client. An attacker may leverage this 
issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user 
in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based 
authentication credentials and launch other attacks. A successful exploit could 
allow an attacker to compromise the application by defacing by evil code injection.
