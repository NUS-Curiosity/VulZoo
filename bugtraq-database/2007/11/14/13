(a) (as you say) they can of course be trivially extracted from the
traffic flow at the provider level.  cf the current EFF / NSA / San
Francisco case - that (as I understand it) is probably in breach of
the US Constitution, yet it happened/is happening. The German law, and
similar laws in the UK and other countries, implicitly (at least)
enables such tactics;

(b) most mail users use mail servers at their employers or their local
ISP (ISPs with retail presence in multiple territories will of course
have mail servers in situated locally);

(c) the balance, excluding those weirdos running their own personal
MTA / MSAs, will be using webmail services like Hotmail and Gmail.


Tracerouting from the machine I'm typing this on (in the UK) shows a
route through my ISP, to LINX (the London IX), and then straight into
Google space. The RTT all the way to the final hop is in the 30ms
range:

[...]
 8  209.85.248.80 (209.85.248.80)  25.302 ms   24.348 ms   25.605 ms
   MPLS Label 548800 TTL=1
 9  209.85.248.79 (209.85.248.79)  27.972 ms   36.281 ms   26.562 ms
10  72.14.233.77 (72.14.233.77)  28.266 ms   29.057 ms   27.273 ms
11  66.249.94.146 (66.249.94.146)  29.517 ms   30.668 ms   30.179 ms
12  ik-in-f19.google.com (66.249.91.19)  28.092 ms   27.926 ms   28.564 ms


...which strongly suggests to me that the front-end Gmail webserver my
"mail" hits is probably pretty close to me.  It's certainly not on the
other side of the Atlantic. There's quite a lot of cooperation between
EU member states, would a "UKUSA"-type arrangement in the EU be very
surprising?
