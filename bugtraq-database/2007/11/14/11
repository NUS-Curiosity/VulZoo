The mail addresses can only be stored if the server through which the 
mail is relayed (or on which it originates) falls under the law.  I'd 
presume that's not a significant percentage of all mails sent out from 
any country.

Of course, it's also possible to track (snoop) all SMTP traffic on the 
network, but that's totally different from just keeping mail and AAA 
server logs and from my understanding that's not what this law 
mandates.
