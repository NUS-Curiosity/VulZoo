Hi Florian,

The issue with sending email noise is that there is already too much of
it already and it is already classified under the banner "spam".  I can
almost guarantee that were you to start sending random email to many
servers, most of their owners would block your IP immediately, or at
least look at ways of adding you to RBLs and reporting you to whichever
authorities are responsible for enforcing anti-spam and anti-DOS laws.
