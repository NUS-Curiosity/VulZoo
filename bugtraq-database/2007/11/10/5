Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 11.09.07: AOL AmpX ActiveX Control Multiple
 Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 11.09.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 09, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

America Online's AmpX is an ActiveX control associated with AOL Radio.
It is typically used for embedding streaming audio content in web
pages. For more information visit the following URL.

http://music.aol.com/radioguide/bb/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in AOL's
AmpX ActiveX control could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
with the credentials of the user visiting a malicious website.

Several methods within the vulnerable ActiveX control (CLSID
B49C4597-8721-4789-9250-315DFBD9F525) were found to be vulnerable to
stack-based buffer overflows. In each case, variable length attacker
supplied data is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer using the
strcpy() function. Since no input validation is performed, it is
possible to corrupt stack memory, resulting in an exploitable
condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the user viewing a malicious web page. In order to be successful, the
attacker must persuade a user with the vulnerable control installed into
viewing a malicious web page. No further interaction is required.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version
2.6.1.11 of America Online's AmpX.dll. Other versions are suspected to
be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

In order to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, an administrator
can set the kill-bit for the vulnerable control. While this does not fix
the vulnerability, it does prevent the control from being loaded in
Internet Explorer.
