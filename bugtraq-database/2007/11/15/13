Hi list,

Parameters being transferred per $_GET aren't sanitised properly.

Everyone can read any comment and its poster, although it should be
readable only for superiors

http://name.tld/CGI-Bin/frame.html?Mehr=xxx&SUPER=x
You can see, which supervisor the task was forwarded to and their UniqueIDs


Anyways, everything is acting really strange if you try to test something.
Out of 10 tries, u get
8x All information you want to get
1x a weird name instead of the real one
1x a Errorpage like 404, "session timed out", blank site,...

For all these tests it is not necessary to be logged in.
There might be a lot more bugs, but I can't look for them on a live system :(
