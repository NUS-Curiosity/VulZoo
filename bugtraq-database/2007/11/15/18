Subject: PR07-26: Persistent XSS on Aruba 800 Mobility Controller's login page

Date Found: 17th July 2007

Vendor informed: 23rd July 2007

Confirmed by vendor: 13th September 2007

Description:

Aruba 800 is vulnerable to a persistent XSS on the administrator login screen.

An unauthenticated user can re-write the hidden parameter 'url' by requesting a link under the /screens/ directory:

https://internalip:4343/screens/%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

The payload stays intact until another user makes a request under the /screens/ directory, prior to logging in.

Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code in the browser of an admin user. Such code would run within the security context of the target domain.

This type of attack can result in a persistent defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.: admin session IDs, passwords) to unauthorised third parties.

Since this XSS is of persistent nature, the admin user wouldn't have to be tricked to visit a specially-crafted URL, but rather simply visit the Aruba 800 login page at some point.

Severity: High
