If there's anyone from HP here, can you clarify whether or not HPUX
11.00 is omitted from the impacted list because it's not supported or
because it's not affected - thanks.

I know 11.00 is no longer supported, but we have a system running
"HP-UX Secure Shell A.04.10.004" on HP-UX 11.00 that we cannot upgrade
(due to application dependency), and I'd just like to know what our
exposure is.

The verbose product description is "HP-UX Secure Shell
A.04.10.004/005, based on OpenSSH 4.1p1", part number T1471-90004.

You don't have to go on the record - be as anonymous as you need.

Thanks
Nick Boyce
