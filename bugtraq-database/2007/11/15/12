  Do I understand correctly that this step of your proposed algorithm
can identify the private key corresponding to (e.g.) a 1024 bit public
key, but only by doing on the order of Sum(2..2^1024) = ~ 2^1025
modular exponentiations and storing the results?  If so, that would
come to approximately 1E307 modular exponentiation operations.

  Divide that out by (for example) teraflops and the expected lifetime
of the universe, and I don't think you will get a pleasing result.
