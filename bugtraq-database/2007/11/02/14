Windows 98 has no way to isolate administrative functions. Everyone has full 
access to all aspects of the operating system. I should know, I still use it 
for certain functions. Windows 98 may benefit from security by obscurity, but 
I would still hesitate to take it out onto the big, bad Internet.

The Mac OS is far better designed, but the option automatically to execute 
trusted file formats on download should never have been put there. Other 
things I wish Apple would do better: Have their security updates approach the 
speed achieved in many Linux distributions. Share a bit more, heck, have them 
share anything at all when it comes serious, reported vulnerabilities. 
Finally, from a security perspective, they should banish Quicktime.
