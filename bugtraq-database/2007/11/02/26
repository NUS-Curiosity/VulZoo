Subject: Re: mac trojan in-the-wild

NOTE: Resending this was blocked last time.

Profit-driven malware has gotten very good at using Social Engineering
(backed up with Exploits) to spread itself. Zlob and it Codecs are one
particular example that has worked very well on Windows, even by
simply getting the user to install the software willingly. The
Storm/Zhelatin/Russian Business Network group however are by far the
best at this. They have shown time and time the power of simple Social
Engineering in order to infect victims machines. Zlob may have been
the first for profit malware to make the jump, but if it proves
profitable it will not be long before the others follow.
