Heh-heh; he said "Steve Gibson"; heh-heh-heh

Seriously; Tim is right.
While Apple-oriented threats may not get either the validation or the publicity (on hardly equals the other) that Windows attacks do, it's hardly accurate (much less fair) to make those comparisons.
For all those comparative points, my Kaypro-4 running ZCPR is more secure than any Apple OS.

Let's not over-hype this-- while "Apple's day" has been coming, saying
that users
will be "hit hard" on something the user has to manually download,
manually execute,
and explicitly grant administrative privileges to is *way* over the top.

Not "the new Windows 98" by a long shot - saying that is just
irresponsible.  While Apple is not used to dealing with security in the
same way that other companies are, comparing OSX to Windows 98 is not
only a huge technical inaccuracy, but you also insult MAC users out
there.  OSX had "UAC-like unprivileged user controls" way before Vista
did - let's not try to start some holy-war on this like people have
tried to do with Windows vs Linux in the past.

If you want to report this, then report it-- but say what it is, a
totally lame user-must-be-drunk "exploit" that requires that all manner
of things go wrong before it works -- otherwise people will think that
you've dressed up as Steve Gibson for Halloween.
