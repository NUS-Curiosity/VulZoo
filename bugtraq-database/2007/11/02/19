There's a difference between ignoring something and making a statement like

'OS X is the new Windows 98.'

Its sensationalist and of no use, especially when posted to lists that
are supposedly populated with security experts. Everyone here is aware
of the consequences of malware and the manipulation of end users to
spread it. Of course its interesting that a criminal group has taken
to spreading this but hyping up the consequences of it do nobody any
good and is just spreading FUD. To me it seems like the original
poster is trying to get a quote in some tech/security/computer
magazine.

No one is suggesting that this the propogation of this malware amoung
macs isn't a threat and that its supposed mass spreading by a criminal
group is of course a cause for worry. What we have an issue with is
the manner in which it is reported and the hyberbole thats is becoming
more and more prevalent amoung security experts seeking to promote
themselves and their companies.

A useful post on this matter would be one that includes an analysis of
the malware itself, perhaps some statistics on its prevalence etc. i.e
hard facts

Some people would do well to remember that we are supposedly engineers
and scientists, not journalists and fiction writers.
