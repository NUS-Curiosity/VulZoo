Synopsis
========

Two Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL.

Background
==========

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/mysql      < 5.0.38                              >= 5.0.38
                                                                 < 5.0

Description
===========

mu-b discovered a NULL pointer dereference in item_cmpfunc.cc when
processing certain types of SQL requests. Sec Consult also discovered
another NULL pointer dereference when sorting certain types of queries
on the database metadata.

Impact
======

In both cases, a remote attacker could send a specially crafted SQL
request to the server, possibly resulting in a server crash. Note that
the attacker needs the ability to execute SELECT queries.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.0.38"
