Subject: Re: Retrieving "deleted" sms/mms from Nokia phone (Symbian S60)

Dear Davide Del Vecchio,

 It's also possible to recover deleted photos from almost any flash card
 in almost any device (camera, mobile, etc) - it's a way general purpose
 file  systems  work.  Requirement  to  delete  information  securely is
 enforced  in devices certified to e.g. process US military secretes. In
 this case, device must follow DoD 5220-22-M recommendations and you can
 expect  secure erase. In general purpose operation systems and devices,
 to    delete   information   securely   (wipe   it)   some   additional
 actions/utilities are usually required.
