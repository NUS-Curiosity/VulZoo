Subject: RE: Apple Safari on MacOSX may reveal user's saved passwords

John, i dont know how to exploit this without the execution of an applescript that's not possible if the victim user doesn't confirm it.
if you've found a way to execute applescripts by simply accessing a website it would be a much more interesting kind of vulnerability.
imho i see no other way to do this..
any suggestion is really appreciated

thanks,
