I think it is in newest SharePointServer but I haven't investigated yet
how wide the problem is.
But I have tried it to couple SP(server?) installations in the Internet,
and it seems to work on all new versions (2007, that is).

Microsoft Security Response Team is currently investigating the issue,
they should be able to tell more.
(they should have better lab than I have;))

Btw, sorry about delayed response, i have been too busy.
