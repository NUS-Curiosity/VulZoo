Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2007-0019

Package names:	   fetchmail, freetype, gd, libpng, python24 
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2007-05-25
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0.5
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  fetchmail
  Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended
  for use over on-demand TCP/IP links, like SLIP or PPP connections.
  Fetchmail supports every remote-mail protocol currently in use on the
  Internet (POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all IMAPs, ESMTP ETRN, IPv6,
  and IPSEC) for retrieval. Then Fetchmail forwards the mail through
  SMTP so you can read it through your favorite mail client.

  freetype
  The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
  engine, developed to provide TrueType support for a variety of
  platforms and environments. FreeType is a library which can open 
  and manages font files as well as efficiently load, hint and render
  individual glyphs. FreeType is not a font server or a complete
  text-rendering library.

  gd
  gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
  complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
  other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or
  JPEG file. This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
  where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images
  by most browsers.

  libpng
  libpng is a library of functions for creating and manipulating PNG
  (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

  python24
  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
  language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes
  modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and
  dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and
  libraries.

Problem description:
  fetchmail < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 >
  - New upsteam.
  - SECURITY Fix: A weakness has been identified which is caused
    by an error in the APOP protocol that fails to properly prevent
    MD5 collisions, which could be exploited via man-in-the-middle
    attacks and specially crafted message-IDs to potentially disclose
    the first three characters of passwords.
                                                                                                                           
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2007-1558 to this issue.

  freetype < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Victor Stinner has reported a vulnerability in
    FreeType, caused due to an error when parsing malformed TTF 
    fonts in src/truetype/ttgload.c and may be exploited when
    processing a specially crafted TTF font.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-2754 to this issue.
 
  gd < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Xavier Roche has reported a vulnerability in GD
    Graphics Library caused due to the incorrect use of libpng within
    the function "gdPngReadData()" when processing truncated data.
    This can be exploited to cause an infinite loop by e.g. tricking
    an application using the library to process a specially crafted file.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-2756 to this issue.

  libpng < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 >< TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2> 
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in libpng, caused
    due to an error in the "png_handle_tRNS" function in pngrutil.c.
    This can be exploited by tricking an application using the library
    to process a specially crafted PNG file containing a malformed
    tRNS chunk.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-2445 to this issue.

  python24 < TSL 3.0.5 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been identified, which could
    be exploited by attackers to gain knowledge of potentially
    sensitive information. This issue is caused by an off-by-one
    error in the "PyLocale_strxfrm()" [Modules/_localemodule.c]
    function when calculating the "n2" buffer size, which could be
    exploited by attackers to disclose and read portions of memory.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-2052 to this issue.
