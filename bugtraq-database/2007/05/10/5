Subject: RE: Defeating Citibank Virtual Keyboard protection using screenshot method

Defeating on-screen (or so called virtual) keyboards by capturing 10 x 10
area around mouse click is known since 1997 and is used in the wild by
several *advance* keyloggers and malwares. One such demo video was available
here http://nicob.net/SSTIC05/Demo-SSTIC05.avi The link presently seems to
be down. 

One well known worm which used this technique before was W32/Dumaru family.
That was an attack against the e-Gold keypad. Similarly there are several
such malwares which is using this technique. I personally know many
Brazilian folks who have been using this technique against the banks out
there :) 


Like any other key logger the screen caputure mechanism is also not
fool-proof as a smart user can still trick it in recording wrong password.
For example if my password is - "s3curity"  

To trick the keylogger, the user can click in the following manner - 

567[clear all]3[backspace]s5[backspace]curity 

The above method can always trick the keylogger in recording wrong password
if it is not able to track the right changes and extract the exact password.


Nearly 2 years back I was intrigued to write such a PoC keylogger to capture
CitiBank virtual keyboard texts which can not be easily tricked unlike
ordinary keyloggers. All that it does is hooks into IE by making COM calls
and directly monitors the User/Password box. Hence there is no logging
before the form POST occurs. This saves a lot of diskspace and captures the
last password that was present in the password box before the FORM POST. 

You can get this POC here -

Also looking at your advisory draft and subject line I can smell you must
already have gone through my PoC before writing yours ;o)

Even though I was the first to point out this is old news for the malware
scene in online/e fraud, I'd be the first to bow down before Int3 and say
"thank you for sharing your work with us". Many don't.

But your point above:
"without installing malware on the victim host"

Although true on some level, is bogus for the purpose of this work, as it
being written makes an automatic assumtion on working only after malware
is installed.

Although you are right, in practice this is already an heavily abused
technology, and.. 
'Getting malware on a system', who ever heard of such a ridiculous
idea? :)
