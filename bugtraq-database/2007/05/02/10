Subject: Vulnerability in InterVations' MailCopa

While developing one of our advanced security training movies, we
identified an exploitable vulnerability in the latest release of
InterVetions' MailCopa. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability
allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the
user executing MailCopa. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker
can insert a link in the following way:

<a href="mailto:test@...mple.com?subject=aaaaaaaaaaaa ... aaaaaaaaaaaaa">

If the user can be tricked into clicking on such a malicious link, an
overflow occurs, leading to code execution on the victim's system.


Countermeasures:
The vendor was informed on April 30, 2007 and published a patched
version just a few hours later. Amazing response time!
