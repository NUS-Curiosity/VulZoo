[ Introduction ]

  (*)Buffer Overflow or B0F: it is caused by a saturation 
on the stack at the momento when a strcpy() function is 
called and the string is LONGER than hoped.

  (*)AtomixMP3, it is an MP3 DJ mix software, was developed 
to make the technical aspect of djing literally as simple 
as clicking a mouse.

an strcpy function for allocate the route of the file, the risk 
comes when the name's file exceed the buffer located previously,
it cause an overflow leaving the posibility for execute
arbitrary code into the machine.
