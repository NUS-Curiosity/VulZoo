Tried and failed.
Exactly how have you configured your test SP site?

Hi!
I think this is a XSS in MS SharePoint, you can reproduce it in
SharePoint test server using for example following url:

http://www.example.com/sharepoint/default.aspx/%22);}if(true){alert(%22q
wertytis

This is due a lack of string stripping when putting the path into
javascript.
 
It seems to work at least on every main page.
 
I tried to check for this in the web, but I didn't found this hole
anywhere.
