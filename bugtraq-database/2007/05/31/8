Subject: Re: Progress Webspeed exploit for all releases

Attempted this exploit on Progress Webspeed/OpenEdge 10.1a and received this result:

<!-- Generated by Webspeed: http://www.webspeed.com/ -->

ERROR: 
webutil/_cpyfile.r is supported in Development Mode only.

So when the brokers are running in production mode, the exploit will not work.  

I assume the exploit runs in development mode but if that is available to the internet that is a bigger problem!
