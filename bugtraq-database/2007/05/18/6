If you have a smart-phone connected with your computer via bluetooth, a "super malware" can theoritically infect your smart-phone, too. After the infection it can forward the SMS to the bad guys. Nowadays it has little risk, and is only a theoritical fraud, but maybe in the future there would be "super malware" like this. Welcome to the brave new world :)
