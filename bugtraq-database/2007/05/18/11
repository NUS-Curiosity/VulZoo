After having published the XSS vulnerability on various sparkassen 
online banking sites 24 hours ago, I received feedback from the company 
sfze.

They informed me that the DO NOT operate the online banking portal which 
is affected by the vulnerability.

I therefore have to apologize: It was not my intention to blame the 
wrong company. sfze has nothing to do with the XSS vulnerability on 
german online-banking sites.

To say this clear: I do not know definitely which subsidiary company of 
Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe is responsible for the online banking portal, 
and is able to fix this problem.
