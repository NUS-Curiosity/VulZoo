Synopsis
========

GIMP is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/gimp      < 2.2.14                            >= 2.2.14

Description
===========

Marsu discovered that the "set_color_table()" function in the SUNRAS
plugin is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted .RAS file,
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user running GIMP.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GIMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/gimp-2.2.14"
