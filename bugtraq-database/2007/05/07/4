Synopsis
========

The X.Org X11 library contains multiple integer overflows, which could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

X.Org is an implementation of the X Window System. The X.Org X11
library provides the X11 protocol library files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/libX11     < 1.0.3-r2                        >= 1.0.3-r2

Description
===========

Multiple integer overflows have been reported in the XGetPixel()
function of the X.Org X11 library.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted image, an attacker could
cause a Denial of Service or an integer overflow, potentially resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All X.Org X11 library users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/libX11-1.0.3-r2"
