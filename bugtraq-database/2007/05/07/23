Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in Lighttpd, each allowing for
a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Lighttpd is a lightweight HTTP web server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/lighttpd      < 1.4.14                      >= 1.4.14

Description
===========

Robert Jakabosky discovered an infinite loop triggered by a connection
abort when Lighttpd processes carriage return and line feed sequences.
Marcus Rueckert discovered a NULL pointer dereference when a server
running Lighttpd tries to access a file with a mtime of 0.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could upload a specially crafted file to the server
or send a specially crafted request and then abort the connection,
possibly resulting in a crash or a Denial of Service by CPU
consumption.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.14"
