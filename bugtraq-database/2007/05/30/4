Subject: [tool] Etherbat - Ethernet topology discovery

Hello,

I would like to annouce Etherbat, a tool for Ethernet topology discovery
which I presented on Confidence 2007 conference in Krakow, Poland.
Etherbat performs topology discovery between 3 hosts: the local machine
and two other devices.
It could be usefull for an administrator tracking an intruder, an auditor performing a security audit or an attacker trying to find out more about the network structure.
Etherbat could be described as layer 2 equivalent of traceroute. No
manageable switches nor extra software on remote hosts is required.

Etherbat is released under GPLv2 license.
