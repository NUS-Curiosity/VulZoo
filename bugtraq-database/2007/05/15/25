-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Samba. User interaction is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of RPC requests to the LSA RPC
interface. When parsing a request to LsarLookupSids/LsarLookupSids2,
heap allocation is calculated based on user input.  By specifying
invalid values, heap blocks can be overwritten leading to remote code
execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Samba has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
