this is not rfi
the f_cms = INC_DIR
so  u cant include it  because it have a value and u cant include this value

$f_cms = INC_DIR . 'cmses/' . $GLOBALS['fc_config']['CMSsystem'] . '.php';
        if( !file_exists($f_cms) || !is_file($f_cms) )
            require_once(INC_DIR . 'cmses/statelessCMS.php');//free for all users
        else
            require_once( $f_cms );

so f_cms = INC_DIR --->CAN'T INCLUDE :D
