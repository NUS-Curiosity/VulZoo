Subject: ZoneAlarm Insufficient validation of 'vsdatant' driver input buffer
 Vulnerability

Hello,

We would like to inform you about a vulnerability in ZoneAlarm 6.


Description:

ZoneAlarm insufficiently protects its driver \Device\vsdatant against a manipulation by malicious applications and it 
fails to validate its input buffer. It is possible to open the driver's device and send arbitrary data to it, which are 
implicitly believed to be valid. It is possible to assemble the data in the input buffer such that the driver performs 
an invalid memory operation and crashes the whole operating system. Further impacts of this bug (like arbitrary code 
execution in the kernel mode) were not examined.


Vulnerable software:

     * ZoneAlarm Pro 6.5.737.000
     * ZoneAlarm Pro 6.1.744.001
     * probably all versions of ZoneAlarm products branches 6.x
     * possibly older versions of ZoneAlarm products


Not vulnerable software:

     * ZoneAlarm Pro 7.0.302.000 and higher
     * probably all versions of ZoneAlarm products branches 7.x and higher



More details and a proof of concept including its source code are available here:
