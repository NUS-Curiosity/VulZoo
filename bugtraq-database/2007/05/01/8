Subject: Radware Security Advisory - Yate 1.1.0 Denial of Service Vulnerability

Yate 1.1.0 Denial of Service Vulnerability



Risk: Medium


Background:


Yate (Yet Another Telephony Engine) is a production-ready next-generation telephony engine.

More information about this application could be obtained from the following site:

http://yate.null.ro/


Description:


The SIP channel module of Yate contains a denial of service vulnerability, introduced by a
null pointer dereference, which could be provoked by having the SIP module process SIP messages
containing the "Call-Info" header, without the "purpose" parameter as part of its value.

The flaw can be seen in the following source code snippet:

File:    yate/modules/ysipchan.cpp
Lines:   1585 - 1594

1:    const SIPHeaderLine* hl = m_tr->initialMessage()->getHeader("Call-Info");
2:    if (hl) {
3:        const NamedString* type = hl->getParam("purpose");
4:        if (!type || *type == "info")
5:            mp type->addParam("caller_info_uri",*type);
6:        else if (*type == "icon")
7:            m->addParam("caller_icon_uri",*type);
8:        else if (*type == "card")
9:            m->addParam("caller_card_uri",*type);
10:   }

Once the "Call-Info" header is found in the SIP message (line 1), there is an attempt to extract
the "purpose" parameter (line 3).
Afterwards, a decision is made to set the "caller_info_uri" parameter (line 5) to the value of the
"Call-Info" header, though due to a programming error, instead of assigning the parameter with the
header value, it is being assigned with the value of the "purpose" parameter - allowing for a null
pointer dereference, when the call to getParam() (line 3) returns 0 in case of a missing "purpose" parameter.


Analysis:

Exploiting this vulnerability could allow for denial of service to Yate and disruption of the VoIP
infrastructure.

By default no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, allowing for spoofed UDP SIP
messages to trigger the flaw.
