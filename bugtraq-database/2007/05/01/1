Cerulean Studios Trillian Multiple IRC Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 04.30.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 30, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Cerulean Studios Trillian is a multi-protocol chat application that
supports IRC, ICQ, AIM and MSN protocols. More information can be found
on the vendor's site at the following URL.

http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/learn/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in the Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) module of Cerulean Studios' Trillian could allow for the
interception of private conversations or execution of code as the
currently logged on user.

When handling long CTCP PING messages containing UTF-8 characters, it is
possible to cause the Trillian IRC client to return a malformed response
to the server. This malformed response is truncated and is missing the
terminating newline character. This could allow the next line sent to
the server to be improperly sent to an attacker.

When a user highlights a URL in an IRC message window Trillian copies
the data to an internal buffer. If the URL contains a long string of
UTF-8 characters, it is possible to overflow a heap based buffer
corrupting memory in a way that could allow for code execution.

A heap overflow can be triggered remotely when the Trillian IRC module
receives a message that contains a font face HTML tag with the face
attribute set to a long UTF-8 string.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to intercept
private communications for Trillian IRC users or execute code with the
credentials of the currently logged on user.

In order to exploit the highlighted URL vulnerability, users would have
to highlight the malicious URL.
