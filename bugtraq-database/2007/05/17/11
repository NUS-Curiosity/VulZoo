Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in mod_security, allowing a remote
attacker to bypass rules.

Background
==========

mod_security is an Apache module designed for enhancing the security of
the Apache web server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/mod_security       < 2.1.1                       >= 2.1.1

Description
===========

Stefan Esser discovered that mod_security processes NULL characters as
terminators in POST requests using the
application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding type, while other parsers
used in web applications do not.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted POST request, possibly
bypassing the module ruleset and leading to the execution of arbitrary
code in the scope of the web server with the rights of the user running
the web server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All mod_security users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/mod_security-2.1.1"
