Theoretically, this is possible. An advanced client-side MITM attack 
could be crafted, altering packets on-the-fly and returning a false 
confirmation page.

i.e.: 

normal response: "$100 USD has been transferred from your@...il.com to 
evil@...ker.com"
altered response: "$100 USD has been transferred from your@...il.com 
to your@...ipient.com"
