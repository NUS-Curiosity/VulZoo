Subject: Re: NOD32 Antivirus Long Path Name Stack Overflow Vulnerabilities

You could use in your shellcode any character allowed as a directory 
character in Windows. The path name will be then converted to Unicode by 
Nod32 process.
So you have to deal with this too. I used Alpha2 
(http://www.edup.tudelft.nl/~bjwever/documentation_alpha2.html.php from 
Berend-Jan Wever) to encode an alphanumeric shellcode that will be then 
converted to Unicode:

"*
--unicode*
Make shellcode unicode-proof. This means it will only work when it gets 
converted to unicode (inserting a '0' after each byte) before it gets 
executed.
