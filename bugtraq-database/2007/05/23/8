What's to stop someone from encoding the path(shellcode) in unicode(using both bytes of unicode/no null bytes)? Also, is there a special situation why it has to be strictly alphanumeric? Because, in general this is not the case.

I've worked with these guidelines myself in the past(http://fakehalo.us/xfinder-ds.pl), and I see no specific issue with doing similar for this, unless information to the contrary isn't included.
