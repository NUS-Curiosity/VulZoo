Subject: Re: UPDATED: CubeCart (v3.0.15) - CRLF Injection Vulnerability

3.0.16 will be released later today. Simple str_replace to fix in includes/session.inc.php and treatGet function on $_GET['ccUser']. 

## remove possible CRLF injection
$sessId = str_replace(array('%0d', '%0a'), '', $sessId);

Please report any potential security issues directly to us in the future rather than making them public immediately.
