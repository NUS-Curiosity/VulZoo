Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
The eFileCabinet software suite is used to house digital images of files.  Though the eFileCabinet HTTP interface is password protected, it is possible to bypass said access controls to gain partial access to the eFileCabinet software.  In order to bypass security, an attacker must supply a non-existent filecabinetnumber, such as 0.  An attacker can utilize this access to partially navigate the eFileCabinet HTTP interface.  Successful exploitation of this flaw could allow an attacker to create efileCabinet drawers or to potentially obtain access to sensitive information.
