Sorry about that but that's wrong. All the credits have to go to Stefano Di
Paola and Giorgio Fedon. They presented that stuff at the 23C3 in Berlin. The
only thing that I did was an overview and I found out, that it doesn't matter
how the parameter is called. I "just" forgot to copy paste the credits from my
original document, to the blog entry. I'm very sorry about that and of course I
putted it in my entry now.
