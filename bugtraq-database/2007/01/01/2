Subject: WinZip10.0 FileView ActiveX Controls CreateNewFolderFromName
 Method Buffer overflow

The first flaw is due to errors in the "WZFILEVIEW.FileViewCtrl.61" ActiveX control that does not validate input passed to CreateNewFolderFromName methods,When you pass a long string(length>235),It will bead to buffer overflow .which could be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted web page.
   Because of the prior vuln in FileView ActiveX Control,Micorsoft has disabled this ActiveX Controls,
		     To test this vuln,You can delete the key:
		     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{A09AE68F-B14D-43ED-B713-BA413F034904}]
         "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
         I have test the exploit on Windows 2000+sp4(CN) and Windows xp+sp2(CN) and Winzip 10.0(6667),you can try other version.
