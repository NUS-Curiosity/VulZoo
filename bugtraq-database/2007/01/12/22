You're missing what "searchable" means. It means you can cd into
the directory and you can access files within the directory *if*
you know their exact name (and have appropriate perms on those files)
but you *cannot* list the directory's contents. Thus if slocate
allows you to list the contents of such a directory just by
specifying the name of the directory, or a single character of
a file within the directory, it is laxer security than the directory
permissions allow. Not the world's most pressing security problem, 
but a problem nonetheless.
