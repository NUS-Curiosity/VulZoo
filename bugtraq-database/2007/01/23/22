Synopsis
========

libgtop improperly handles filenames, possibly allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libgtop facilitates the libgtop_daemon, which is used by GNOME to
obtain information about remote systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnome-base/libgtop      < 2.14.6                        >= 2.14.6

Description
===========

Liu Qishuai discovered that glibtop_get_proc_map_s() in
sysdeps/linux/procmap.c does not properly allocate memory for storing a
filename, allowing certain filenames to cause the buffer to overflow on
the stack.

Impact
======

By tricking a victim into executing an application that uses the
libgtop library (e.g. libgtop_daemon or gnome-system-monitor), a local
attacker could specify a specially crafted filename to be used by
libgtop causing a buffer overflow and possibly execute arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libgtop users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-base/libgtop-2.14.6"

==========
