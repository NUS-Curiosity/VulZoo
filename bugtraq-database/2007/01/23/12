Two lines above the previous code is the following two lines:

unset($CONFIG);
require_once("config.php");

Once again... security auditing via grep doesn't give you enough
information to post a complete and accurate bug/security report.
Honestly, do you have a bash one liner that you just feed scripts to,
that generates these bogus and pointless reports?

It is getting to the point where I almost don't bother to check the code
any more.
