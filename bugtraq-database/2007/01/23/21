Hi people,

I was wondering whether I was right or not about this vuln:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21978

Unfortunately, I don't have a Colfusion to test on.. What I would do is:
http://colfusion-server/an-existing-file.cfm%2500.cfm

and I expect the server to spit out the source code....

Am I right here? Did anybody try this out? If so, how did you do it?
Thank you.

Cheers,
Mateo
