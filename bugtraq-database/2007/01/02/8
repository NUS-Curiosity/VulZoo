agreed, however PHP core Developers will often overlook the PHP communities 
cries for security tools to implement secure practises.
The filter extension goes a long way to addressing this, but still we see issues
such as deprecated extensions like the Mimetype Functions that leave a gaping hole
in validation of file types without installing extra's from PECL (FileInfo) which is
not always available to the person, particularly in a shared hosting environment.
