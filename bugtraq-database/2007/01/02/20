Subject: Windows NT Message Compiler 1.00.5239 arbitrary code execution

Synopsis: Windows NT Message Compiler 1.00.5239 arbitrary code execution
Product:   Microsoft Windows XP



Issue:
======

A critical security vulnerability has been found in Windows NT Message Compiler.
Arbitrary code execution might be possible (local exploitation possible only).


Details:
========
MC (Windows NT Message Compiler) when provided a MC-filename longer than
requested crashed due to memory corruption. Memory corruption conditions
might allow the attacker to escalate privilleges.

When overwriting the buffer with "A" (0x41):

Unhandled exception at 0x01003468 in MC.EXE: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x41414141.
First-chance exception at 0x01003468 in MC.EXE: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x41414141.


Affected Versions
=================
Microsoft (R) Message Compiler Version 1.00.5239


Solution
=========

Proper bounds-checking.
