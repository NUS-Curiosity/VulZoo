Cisco Security Advisory: SIP Packet Reloads IOS Devices Not
Configured for SIP

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20070131-sip

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070131-sip.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 Jan 31 0900 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco devices running IOS which support voice and are not configured
for Session Initiated Protocol (SIP) are vulnerable to a crash under
yet to be determined conditions, but isolated to traffic destined to
Port 5060. SIP is enabled by default on all Advanced images which
support voice and do not contain the fix for CSCsb25337. There are no
reports of this vulnerability on the devices which are properly
configured for SIP processing. Workarounds exist to mitigate the
effects of this problem.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070131-sip.shtml

Affected Products
=================

IOS releases that include voice support after 12.3(14)T, 12.3(8)YC1,
12.3(8)YG and all of 12.4 are affected. Please see the fixed software
table for a complete list of fixed and vulnerable trains.

To determine if your device has SIP enabled, enter the commands 'show
ip sockets' and 'show tcp brief all'. Below is an example of a router
running code without the fix, and without the workaround enabled. The
router in this example is vulnerable to this issue. IOS image in
example: 7200-p-mz.124-3.bin

    Router#show ip sockets
    Proto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY OutputIF
    17 0.0.0.0             0  --any--          5060   0   0  211   0
    17 0.0.0.0             0 192.168.100.2       67   0   0 2211   0
    17 0.0.0.0             0 192.168.100.2     2517   0   0   11   0               
    

The first line with UDP Port 5060 shows that UDP SIP is enabled.

    Router#show tcp brief all
    TCB       Local Address           Foreign Address        (state)
    2051E680  *.5060                  *.*                    LISTEN
    2051E680  *.5060                  *.*                    LISTEN
    

The above lines with *.5060 show that TCP SIP is enabled.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Devices which do not support voice are not affected by this issue.
Devices which are properly configured for SIP processing are not
affected by this issue. We have no reports of this vunerability on
devices that are configured for SIP processing. We also have no
reports of affected IOS-XR devices, CatOS devices, or any device
which does not run IOS, but can not conclusively rule them out
without further testing. This advisory will be updated with more
information as it becomes available. Below is an example of a router 
not vulnerable to this issue. The router in this example is running
the fixed release c7200-js-mz.124-5b.bin.

    Router#show tcp brief all
    
    Router#show ip sockets
    Proto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY OutputIF
    17 0.0.0.0             0 192.168.100.2      67   0   0 2211   0
    

No lines with UDP Port 5060 are shown and UDP SIP is not enabled. In
this example UDP port 67 is used by DHCP is not related to this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

SIP is a protocol designed for use in IP phone networks, and is
widely used for Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) communications
worldwide. Cisco devices running an affected image which supports
voice services automatically enable SIP, which opens a listening port
on UDP port 5060. TCP port 5060 is also opened, but does not appear
to be related to the IOS crash detailed in this advisory.

CSCsb25337 turns off the listening ports TCP and UDP 5060, and there
have been no reports of this vulnerability in any images with this
fix integrated.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in a reload
of the device. The issue may be repeatedly exploited, leading to an
extended Denial Of Service (DOS) condition.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release
train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a
given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible
releases that contain the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the
anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the "Rebuild"
and "Maintenance" columns. A device running a release in the given
train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less
than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable. The release
should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later
version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label.

Workarounds
===========

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this advisory:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070131-sip.shtml

Turn off SIP processing
+-----------------------

Since this vulnerability is reported only in routers not configured
for SIP, the simplest and most effective workaround is to turn SIP
processing off.

    Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
    Router(config)#sip-ua
    Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport udp
    Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport tcp
    Router(config-sip-ua)#end
    

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

Cisco IOS software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and
12.4T support the Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature. CoPP may be
configured on a device to protect the management and control planes
to minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure
attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic sent to
infrastructure device in accordance with existing security policies
and configurations. The following example can be adapted to your
network.

        !-- Permit all TCP and UDP SIP traffic sent to all IP addresses
        !-- configured on all interfaces of the affected device so that it
        !-- will be policed and dropped by the CoPP feature
    
        access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060
        access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060
    
        !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4
        !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and
        !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
        !-- to infrastructure devices
        !
        !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
        !-- the CoPP feature
    
        class-map match-all drop-sip-class
          match access-group 100
    
        !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
        !-- Control-Plane of the device
    
        policy-map drop-sip-traffic
          class drop-sip-class
            drop
    
        !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the
        !-- device
    
        control-plane
          service-policy input drop-sip-traffic
    

Note: In the above CoPP example, the access control list entries
(ACEs) which match the potential exploit packets with the "permit"
action result in these packets being discarded by the policy-map
"drop" function, while packets that match the "deny" action (not
shown) are not affected by the policy-map drop function. Additional
information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be
found at

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6642/products_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.shtml

and
