Subject: Windows Vista and unexported kernel symbols (Part II, 32bits version)

Hi everyone,

I'm posting this message to announce the release of my new paper.

This paper exposes part II of my previous article about Windows Vista
and internals structures. This one is talking about the 32bits version
and aims to show new authencity tricks.

Download it from the following link:
