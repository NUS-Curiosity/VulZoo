Subject: OWASP JBroFuzz 0.4 Fuzzer Released!

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_JBroFuzz

Version 0.4 has just been released

JBroFuzz is an OWASP Project that emerged from penetration testing. It deals with fuzzing stateless network protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, XML, LDAP, etc.

Oh, and the motto goes: If you can't fuzz with JBroFuzz, you probably don't want to fuzz!

Thank you,

Subere
