===========
Description
===========
By sending a specially crafted packet to the LGSERVER.EXE process that
listens on TCP port 1900, it is possible to cause a stack overflow that
allows arbitrary code execution as Local System.

=================
Technical Details
=================
The format of the packet that's sent to LGSERVER.EXE that listens on TCP
port 1900 is as follows:

ddddddddddxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

where dddddddddd is a ten-character long zero-padded decimal value
equating to the length of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (ATOI). If dddddddddd is
set to 0000032767 and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is set appropriately, a stack
buffer is overwritten, and it is possible to gain control of execution. By
default on Windows, LGSERVER.EXE (the Mobile Backup Service) runs as Local
System.
