Description
===========
By sending a specially crafted packet to the LGSERVER.EXE process that
listens on TCP port 2200, it is possible to execute arbitrary code as
SYSTEM on a Windows Platform.

=================
Technical Details
=================
All packets to the Mobile Backup Service process (LGSERVER.EXE) on TCP
port 2200 appear to begin with the sequence "\x4e\x3d\x2c\x1b". Sending a
packet that contains \x4e\x3d\x2c\x1b followed by a string of 65535
characters causes the process to terminate.

The string overwrites the heap in memory it is possible to further
leverage the vulnerability so as to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM.
