They do get posted to bugtraq anyway. :)

Indeed, but for those of us trying to make some sense out of all this,
things are somewhat hazy. It is not about working hard or having more
work, it's about seeing if someone has any bright ideas on how to handle
this a bit better.

For example, remot file inclusion attacks are comparable to remote code
execution, testing each and every one of them is not always easy - but
something many of us do anyway.

Maybe it is time for a wiki/bugzilla sort of system to help get things run
more smoothly. Getting it running in this community won't be very easy
though.

You are right on the distribution..
