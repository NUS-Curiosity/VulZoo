========================================================================

Description
-----------
This is the description of the vulnerability recieved by JPCERT:

"We have confirmed that in admin-search.php, scripts included in
'keyword' parameter is shown without proper sanitization thus the
script could be executed.

However a user needs to login the system as administrator, which makes
the exploit technically difficult.

If this vulnerability is exploited, by script execution, a user's
session ID included in HTTP Cookie might be stolen. Also there's a risk
that the contents of phpAdsNew are falsified temporarily."
