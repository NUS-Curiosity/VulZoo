Here's an attack against this scheme:

Attacker sends the user a link to http://www.attacker.site/script.cgi

When the user requests http://www.attacker.site/script.cgi, the 
script.cgi requests file.pdf from vuln.site. It gets back a redirection 
URL and a session cookie. Then, it creates a Flash object that requests 
the URL with an injected Cookie header (with the session cookie) and 
serves this to the victim client. Voila.
