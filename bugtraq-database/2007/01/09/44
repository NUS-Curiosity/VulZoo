I can't find (on http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2_allversions.html) Acrobat Reader 8.0 for any flavor of Unix, nor for Mac prior to OS 10.4. Since these platforms may have browsers that may execute JavaScript, couldn't (for example) a cookie-stealing exploit work on them too? Thus am I correctly understanding that this is currently unpatched for everyone but Windows and Mac 10.4?
