It should be noted that this isn't as rare as just a few universities
and ISPs.  This also happens in lots of corporate networks (rogue user
on the internal network),  it happens with lots of internet cafe's, it
happens with AOL (~5MM users) and it happens with TOR users.  So while,
yes, I agree it is better than nothing it is hardly a rock solid
solution for anyone on a shared IP.
