Subject: SAP Security Contact

I do not like to bother this mailing list with such requests, but as you 
will see from below (SAP's response), I feel this is a last resort.  I have 
also phoned SAP leaving a voice mail but with no success.

So if anyone can assist with a contact email address at SAP, ideally an 
individual, this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Cheers

Mark

I am contacting SAP about:
General inquiry
Dear Sir / Madam,

I am conducting vulnerabvility research into SAP and the various components 
that make up SAP. So far my research has found 8 security vulnerabilities, 
some of which allow an attcker to execute code remotely on the SAP server as 
SYSTEM without the need for authentication.

I am looking for if possible, a security contact within SAP that I may share 
my findings with so the necessary code fixes can be put in place to prevent 
these issues.

Any assistance you could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Best Regards
