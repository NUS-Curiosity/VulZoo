Batten down the hatches!

Seriously, HTTP pipelining can accomplish EXACTLY the same thing with minimal
pain.  If you have an issue with this behavior, of HTTP, then you have an
issue with the behavior under FTP or a host of other protocols.  And as you
say, simple enough to find some 1.5mb pdf's.  But you expect 1gb window sizes
to actually succeed?

In 95% of the cases that follow your comment above, although the load may
be often be distributed between boxes based on computational intensity, it
is nearly always shoved down the same pipe in the end.

is exactly where your concern should lay - socket kernel-level control of
unrealistic window scaling, and similar scaling restrictions at the router
layer.

With the host of real issues out there in terms of massively parallel DDoS
infrastructures that abound, this is, as you say, quite a silly report.
