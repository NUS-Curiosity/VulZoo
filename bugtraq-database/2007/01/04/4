================================================================


Topics:
-------

This symposium, the 10th in an annual series, brings together leading
researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry
to discuss issues and technologies related to intrusion detection and
defense. The Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID)
International Symposium series is intended to further advances in
intrusion defense by promoting the exchange of ideas in a broad range
of topics. As in previous years, all topics related to intrusion
detection, prevention and defense systems and technologies are within
scope, including but not limited to the following:

* Intrusion detection and prevention techniques
* High-performance intrusion detection
* Intrusion detection in special environments (e.g., mobile networks)
* IDS cooperation and event correlation
* Formal models and analysis
* Attack response, countermeasures, and intrusion tolerance
* Survivability and self-protection
* Attacks against IDS and evasion
* Insider threat detection and mitigation
* Deception systems and honeypots
* Malicious code detection and containment
* Visualization techniques
* Intrusion detection assessment and benchmarking
* IDS interoperability standards and standardization
* Vulnerability analysis and risk assessment
* Legal and social issues

Submissions:
------------

RAID 2007 invites four types of submissions:

1. Full papers presenting mature research results: Papers accepted for
   presentation will be included in the RAID 2006 proceedings
   published by Springer Verlag in its Lecture Notes in Computer
   Science (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html)
   series. Papers are limited to 20 pages when formatted according to
   the instructions provided by Springer Verlag
   (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html), and must include
   an abstract and a list of keywords.

2. Short papers presenting original work that has not yet reached the
   maturity required for a full paper. These are limited to 10 pages
   using the same format required for full papers. Short papers can
   describe new research results or practical experience that
   demonstrates the limitations and capabilities of existing
   approaches to intrusion detection and network security. They will
   be reviewed by the program committee, and accepted papers will be
   included in the proceedings (in short form - not expanded to full
   papers - and with "Short paper" in the title) and presented orally
   during the symposium (in shorter speaking slots).

3. Posters describing work in progress: submissions must consist of a
   one-page abstract.

4. Panel proposals for presenting and discussing hot topics in the
   field of intrusion detection systems: The panel proposals should
   include both an outline of the format of the panel and a short
   rationale for the panel. Panels that include time for general
   discussion and questions-answers between the panelists and the
   audience are preferred.

All submissions (papers, panel, and poster proposals) must be
submitted electronically, details will be provided at a later
date. Papers should list all authors and their affiliations; in case
of multiple authors, the contact author must be indicated (RAID does
not require anonymized submissions). For accepted papers, it is
required that at least one of the authors attends the conference to
present the paper. Further questions on the submission process may be
sent to the program chair.  Submissions must not substantially
duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has
submitted in parallel to a journal or to any other conference or
workshop with proceedings. Simultaneous submission of the same work to
multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and
plagiarism constitute dishonesty or fraud. RAID, like other scientific
and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and
may, on the recommendation of the program chair, take action against
authors who have committed them.
