Subject: Re: [WEB SECURITY] Universal XSS with PDF files: highly dangerous

A slashdot user suggested the following


"One possible work around on the server side:
Direct your web server to serve .pdf files as mime type "application/octet"
That way the files will be saved to disk instead of opening in the browser plug in."

This may cause undesired effects on certain browsers on the otherhand.
