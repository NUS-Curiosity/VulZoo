Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Universal XSS with PDF files: highly
 dangerous

Possibly no, but I was just sending this reference to the lists:
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815960

"According to public reports, this vulnerability is addressed in Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.0."

Solution:
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html

But it is worth of mentioning that there are no all localized Reader 8 versions available yet.
If the organization (and a home user!) uses localized Reader product you have to disable 'Display PDF in browser' setting as a workaround.
