Subject Name:            WordPress
Subject Summary:         Weblog Publishing System
Subject Home:            http://wordpress.org/
Subject Versions:        * <= 2.0.5

Vulnerability Id:        none
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution

Description:
    According to a security advisory from Stefan Esser [0], a
    vulnerability exists in the Weblog publishing system WordPress
    [1], versions up to and including 2.0.5. WordPress supports
    decoding Trackbacks with different charsets when PHP's
    "mbstring" extension is activated (OpenPKG packages "php"
    build with option "with_mbstring=yes" or "apache" build with
    "with_mod_php_mbstring=yes"). Because the decoding happens after the
    database escaping is performed, choosing a suitable charset for the
    input data allows bypassing the protection against SQL injection.
