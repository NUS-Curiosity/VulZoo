I note from http://www.sap.com/solutions/security/index.epx -
"In addition, SAP follows a thorough security response process, which will 
soon include a security bulletin to keep SAP customers up-to-date as new 
security threats and vulnerabilities are uncovered and addressed"
Guess they are still working on it.
