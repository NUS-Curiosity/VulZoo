Argh, you're right. The problematic code is here:

interface/globals.php:

...
// required for normal operation because of recent changes in PHP:
$ps = strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],"myadmin");
if ($ps === false) {
         extract($_GET);
         extract($_POST);
}

// turn off PHP compatibility warnings
ini_set("session.bug_compat_warn","off");
?>

In other words: Turn off all those pesky security improvements, so that we 
may grasp defeat from the jaws of victory. Obviously the number of people 
that are running with the retarded allow_url_fopen setting on should be 
low but looking at the quality of this software I don't think finding 
vulnerabilities that can be exploited in real-life installations should be 
hard.
