This also works for the affected versions of Opera mentioned elsewhere
on the list (9.10, 8.54)...

I've had a better look at this now, and there seems to be a generic
server side solution through the content-disposition header (at least
for the versions of Firefox and IE which I have tested).  If it is
specified, the default installs of both products always produce a
download dialog and don't open inline.

Sample apache config for mitigation:

<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  <FilesMatch "\.pdf$">
	Header append Content-disposition "attachment;"
  </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
