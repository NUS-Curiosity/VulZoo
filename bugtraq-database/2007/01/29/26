How about letting them get posted to bugtraq as ppl test them out
anyway? Usually the testing reports from various ppl on bugtraq bring up
extra info such as "works on the previous version too" or "if foo=0 is
in the config it doesn't work" etc, otherwise someone will want ALL
versions tested before posting.

Bugtraq is probably about as automated as it gets, unless someone wants
to send all their stuff to iDefense or TippingPoint who probably aren't
going to touch the latest lame xss bug or php app bug.
