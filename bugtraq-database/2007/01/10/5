Subject Name:            MIT Kerberos
Subject Summary:         Kerberos Network Authentication System
Subject Home:            http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/
Subject Versions:        * <= 1.5.1

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2006-6143, cert:VU#481564, CVE-2006-6144,
                         cert:VU#831452, cert:TA07-009B
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           denial of service, arbitrary code execution

Description:
    According to vendor security advisories [0][1], two security issues
    exist in the Kerberos network authentication system implementation
    MIT Kerberos [2]. First, the RPC library could call an uninitialized
    function pointer, which created a security vulnerability for
    kadmind(8). Second, the GSS-API "mechglue" layer could fail to
    initialize some output pointers, causing callers to attempt to free
    uninitialized pointers. This caused another security vulnerability
    in kadmind(8).
