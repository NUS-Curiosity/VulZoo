1. apache does support socket level filtering but u must have the right code for every kind of attack. e.g. a default http accept filter on (free)bsd will just wait for the_request header. after that the web server will face the same problem. only delayed. ofcourse that filter should be seen more like an example
2. you get to fight again when sending the data - attacker wouldnt close the socket, but will slow down the read filling netbufs on server  side 
3. you have no chance to identify the bots without learning traffic patterns before ... 

offtopic, you can even use tor network - until one point (which?)  those *are* legit requests and tor network is slow enough to simplify the schedulers on attacker side :)
and i dont know how easy can be to proove attacker's guilt at the *real* value

not saying this is a big problem for everyone, but for most of the people it is and antiddos business sharks just waitin for the occasion to eat you more painful and prolly faster than attacker :P
