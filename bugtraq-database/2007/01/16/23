    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-939

Description:
    Previous versions of the libgd package are vulnerable to two denial
    of service attacks, one of which has been speculated to possibly
    enable a code injection attack.  The libgd library is not exposed
    via any privileged or remote interfaces within rPath Linux per se,
    but it is exposed by some web applications and so may enable a
    remote denial of service attack (application crash or unbounded
    CPU consumption) against those web applications.
