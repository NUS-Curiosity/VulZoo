Synopsis
========

LSAT insecurely creates temporary files which can lead to symlink
attacks allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

The Linux Security Auditing Tool (LSAT) is a post install security
auditor which checks many system configurations and local network
settings on the system for common security or configuration errors and
for packages that are not needed.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/lsat      <= 0.9.2                          Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

LSAT insecurely writes in /tmp with a predictable filename.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the LSAT script is executed, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the software, which
could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Since LSAT is not actively maintained anymore, this package has been
masked. All LSAT users are advised to unmerge it.

    
    # emerge --ask --unmerge "app-admin/lsat"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
