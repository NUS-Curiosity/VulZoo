hi there 

don't you think you can post a simple full path disclosure on the wordpress bugtracker website ?

"//SQL EXAMPLE ERROR:"
http://site.com/wp-admin/admin-functions.php
/home/user/www/htdocs/wp-admin/admin-functions.php

there's nothing about sql here ...
it's only because there's no htaccess on the folder and you can access the file directly ...
