Dear Laundrup, Jens,

C:\TEMP is not best example, but there are another.

Microsoft  Word creates temporary file with predictable name in the same
directory with document. In the case of directory permissions like:

Users: Add & List
Creator Owner: Full control

(one user should not read documents created by another user)

it  may  creates  security issue. And you may attempt to exploit it with
"preopen  files".

Tim  is right, it's attack vector, not vulnerability. You must have this
attack vector in mind during application development and administration.
I don't know if attack against e.g. Microsoft Word will work, it need to
be tested.
