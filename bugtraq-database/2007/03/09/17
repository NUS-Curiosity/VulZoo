So, let me get this. An app storing sensitive data doesn't make its own
temp storage folders in a secure location, and instead relies upon one
of the few folders in Windows that all users have Full Control to, and
this is a Windows problem?  In Linux, if an app uses \tmp, is that a
Linux issue?

Sounds like a developer issue to me.

I find your assessment somewhat short-sighted.  I have conducted code
reviews on several commercial apps which use C:\TEMP in very insecure
ways to store sensitive data.  It seems some of these attacks would be
possible in those situations.

Sure, Windows is already pathetically insecure against an attackers
already on the local system, but this would be yet another attack
vector.
