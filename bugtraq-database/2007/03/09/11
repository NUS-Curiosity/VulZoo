I find your assessment somewhat short-sighted.  I have conducted code
reviews on several commercial apps which use C:\TEMP in very insecure
ways to store sensitive data.  It seems some of these attacks would be
possible in those situations.

Sure, Windows is already pathetically insecure against an attackers
already on the local system, but this would be yet another attack
vector.
