Overview:
Quoting http://www.phprojekt.com/features.php?&newlang=eng 
"PHProjekt is a modular application for the coordination of group 
activities and to share informations and document via the web.
Components of PHProjekt: Group calendar, project management, time card 
system, file management, contact manager, mail client and many other 
modules.
PHProjekt supports many protocols like ldap, xml/soap and webdav and 
is available for 38 languages and 9 databases."



Description:
Multiple vulnerabilities have been found within different modules.
 
In detail, the following flaws were determined during a quick source 
code review for the modules Projects, Contacts, Helpdesk, Notes, Search
and Mail. 
During the validation the php.ini setting "magic_quotes_gpc" was 
deactivated.

a) The application suffers from a classical SQL Injection vulnerability 
   in the calendar module. 
b) A Blind SQL Injection can be triggered within the search module.
c) Furthermore it is possible to manipulate a cookie value, resulting in 
   another Blind SQL Injection when the user logs out.


Remarks
-------
There may be other modules which are affected, but they have not been 
subject to review at this point. 



Solution:
The vulnerabilities were reported on Dec 31 2006 and an update has 
been released on Mar 14 2007.
