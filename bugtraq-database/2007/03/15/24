Yes,  Vista  supports  Unix-style  symlinks  and  there  is "mklink". By
default,  only  member  of administrators group can create ones and this
policy  should  never  be  changed.  So,  again,  there  is  no  symlink
vulnerability in it's classic way in default configuration.

Only  if  you  change symlink policy, you get security hole. In terms of
Unix,  you'll  get  system with commonly used /tmp and without mkstemp()
ever used.
