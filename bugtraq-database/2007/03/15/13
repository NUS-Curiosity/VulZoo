Subject: Re: Phishing using IE7 local resource vulnerability

This appears to be mitigated in Vista by Protected Mode, which is on by default, and denies access to local resources. If people decide to disable UAC, they must accept the potential risks that come with it, such as this XSS attack. I appreciate that this is a valid risk for XP.
