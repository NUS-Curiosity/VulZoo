Subject: - Call for chapters - Handbook of Research on Digital Anti-forensics and In-security Governance 


Dear professionals,

This a new opportunity to share your findings, ideas
and research in information security and computer
forensic topics. Please share with all your
colleagues.

Call for Chapters for the
Handbook of Research on Digital Anti-forensics and
In-security Governance 

Editor: Jeimy J. Cano, Ph.D, CFE
Newport University, CA. USA and
Universidad de los Andes, COLOMBIA
Law Faculty


Introduction: 
Security management and computer forensics are topics
based on vulnerabilities and system failures. In this
way we need to study the duality of security:
insecurity, as a strategy to discover how the system
fails, what configurations make it fail, and how to
discover the evidence of failures. If we could learn
from information insecurity and anti- forensics
strategies, we could better understand new ways to
compromise the systems and rethink all security
considerations in place, as well as enhance them and
make them more resilient. Insecurity management is an
emergent distinction to harden our IT infrastructures,
knowing the mind of attacker.

This handbook will aim to promote new skills in
understanding insecurity management as a way to
enhance IT security areas and promote more reliable
procedures in computer and digital forensics. In this
sense, all contributions considered for this editorial
project will be analysis of current and new strategies
to evade computer forensic investigations and new
strategies to validate computer investigations. This
book will also aim to discover critical failures in
computer forensics software, reliability of security
systems, and discuss all issues that support and offer
ideas to security officers, security managers,
academics or practitioners in maintaining vigilance in
the event of an attack on IT infrastructure.

Coverage:  The Handbook of Research on Digital
Anti-forensics and In-security Governance will be
comprised of chapters (5,000-7,500 words) authored by
leading experts offering an in-depth description of
key terms and concepts related to different areas,
issues and trends in anti-forensics and insecurity
governance in modern organizations worldwide.

Recommended topics include, but are not limited to,
the following:
* Information Insecurity Governance
- The evolution of vulnerabilities: Challenges for
computer forensics
- Computer forensics limitations: Frontiers of digital
investigations
- Anti-forensics strategies: Past, present and future

* Digital forensics limitations:
- File systems failures
- Evading network traffic analysis
- Computer forensic certifications: Limitations and
the future
- Building reliable digital evidence: Technical and
legal issues


* Discovering anti-forensics
- Tracing secure deletion in file systems
- Breaking security measures in security software
- Computer forensic software validations
- Steganoanalysis: Present and future
- Forensic cryptoanalysis

* Studying attackers evasion techniques
- Hacking memory: Introduction to shell codes
- Breaking optical devices
- Advanced steganography

* The future of anti-forensics
- Anti-forensics and incident digital response
- Rethink computer forensics and software reliability
- New IT vulnerabilities challenges

Invited Submissions: Individuals interested in
submitting chapters (5,000-7,500 words) on the
above-suggested topics or other related topics in
their area of interest should submit via e-mail a 2-3
page manuscript proposal clearly explaining the
mission and concerns of the proposed chapter by May 1,
2007. We strongly encourage other topics that have not
been listed in the suggested list, particularly if the
topic is related to the research area in which you
have expertise.  Upon acceptance of your proposal, you
will have until September 15, 2007, to prepare your
chapter of 5,000-7,500 words and 7-10 related terms
and their appropriate definitions. Guidelines for
preparing your paper and terms and definitions will be
sent to you upon acceptance of your proposal.

Please forward your e-mail of interest including your
name, affiliation and a list of topics (5-7) on which
you are interested in writing a chapter to Jeimy J.
Cano, editor, at jjcano@...oo.com no later than May 1,
2007.  You will be notified about the status of your
proposed topics by June 1, 2007.  This book is
tentatively scheduled for publishing by Information
Science Reference (formerly Idea Group Reference) (an
imprint of IGI Global), www.info-sci-ref.com, in 2008.
