Subject: Busting The Bluetooth Myth

Dear List

During the last year, rumours had come to my attention that apparently
it is possible to transform a standard 30USD Bluetooth(r) dongle into
a full-blown Bluetooth(r) sniffer. Thinking you absolutely need
Hardware to be able to hop 79 channels 1600 times a second I was
rather suspicious about these claims.

This paper is the result of my research in this area, answering the
question whether it is possible or not..
