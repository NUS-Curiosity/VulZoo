Subject: Re: Horde Webmail Multiple HTML Injection vulnerability

This is lame.

Cpanel doesn't use Horde Groupware Webmail Edition.

The Cpanel demo server has an old version of Horde installed.

The search.php issues has been fixed in a release already and reported  
earlier, even on this list.

Re rule.php: what kind of XSS is that supposed to be, where the victim  
has to enter the offending code himself? Try entering  
"javascript:alert('XSS')" in your browser location field: i hacked you!

Do at least your basic homework if you want to be taken seriously.

Good luck.
