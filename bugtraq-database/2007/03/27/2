Subject: Re: Path Disclosure  - Wordpress 2.1.2

"All sites"? That's a bit of a stretch. Maybe you should rephrase that
to "All sites with 'display_errors = On'" in their php.ini, which by the
way is disabled in php.ini-recommended in 4.4.6 and 5.2.1.

There's even a comment in php.ini* about it:

"Print out errors (as a part of the output).  For production web sites,
you're strongly encouraged to turn this feature off, and use error
logging instead (see below).  Keeping display_errors enabled on
a production web site may reveal security information to end users,
such as file paths on your Webserver, your database schema or other
information."
