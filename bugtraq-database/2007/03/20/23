Synopsis
========

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including a heap buffer overflow,
potentially leading to the remote execution of arbitrary code under
certain conditions.

Background
==========

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/php     < 5.2.1-r3                           >= 5.2.1-r3
                                                         *>= 5.1.6-r11
                                                             *>= 4.4.6

Description
===========

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP by the Hardened-PHP Project
and other researchers. These vulnerabilities include a heap-based
buffer overflow in htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() if called with
UTF-8 parameters, and an off-by-one error in str_ireplace(). Other
vulnerabilities were also found in the PHP4 branch, including possible
overflows, stack corruptions and a format string vulnerability in the
*print() functions on 64 bit systems.

Impact
======

Remote attackers might be able to exploit these issues in PHP
applications making use of the affected functions, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code, Denial of Service,
execution of scripted contents in the context of the affected site,
security bypass or information leak.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-lang/php"
