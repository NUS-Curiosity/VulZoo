Yep - Windows Media Player put Real Media out of business while it
single-handedly eliminated any media format other than WM, all right...
..and oh, yeh - IE completely squashed the remaining Mozilla-based
development efforts.
Wait - does anyone remember Unix-based OS's?  Windows really wiped them
off the face of the Earth, didn't it?
</sarcasm>

Monoculture or not (silly argument for a single-OS company, wouldn't you
say?), if you base your business model on someone else's and they change
their model to your detriment, do you blame them, try to partner with
them or (gasp) adjust your model to the changing landscape?
Oh, wait - because it's Microsoft, the rules are fluid.
If MS intentionally limits product features to provide for ISV
opportunities (yes, this does happen quite often), they're intentionally
restricting user capabilities.
OTOH, if MS tries to license or purchase technology or the company that
owns it, it's guilty of "monopolism".
OTTH, if MS attempts to "reinvent a competitive wheel", it's abusing its
monopoly to wipe out the competition.

Make up (discover?) your collective mind, willya?
The fact of the matter is this - Windows users have made their
collective desires clear - "give me protection from myself".  Since this
product noise is being directed to MS, it makes one wonder if the
"competition" is all that worthy.

Speaking of those who got rich, any company that opted to license or
sell to MS haven't done all that badly, and there were no "Guidos" sent
in to force their decisions, either.

John-boy is whining - nothing more.

"There goes our business model.", said John Thompson.

The Microsoft mono culture has distinct advantages and has made
quite a few people rich.  But in the end, if Micrsoft does not buy
your business but feels it needs to provide a product like your,
you're toast.  (At least, that part of your business is)
