Subject: Re: Xbox 360 Hypervisor Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

We have discovered a vulnerability in the Xbox 360 hypervisor that allows privilege escalation into hypervisor mode. Together with a method to inject data into non-privileged memory areas, this vulnerability allows an attacker with physical access to an Xbox 360 to run arbitrary code such as alternative operating systems with full privileges and full hardware access.

Great Scott ... no wonder Microsoft is terrified!  Do you realize what this means??  It means Solaris 10 on the XBox 360 ... a dream come true!!  :-)
