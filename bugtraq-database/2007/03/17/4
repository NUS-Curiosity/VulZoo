Affected Product / OS
=====================
Product Name and Version: McAfee VirusScan Entreprise 8.5.0.i maybe older version too.

Tested on OS: Windows XP, 2003

Bug Type
========
Type: Bad Design
 
Bug Results
===========
Bypass Password Protection

Bug Description
===============
Mcafee virusscan Enterprise version allow you to lock the user interface using a password. A user write access windows registry.

The password is saved in UIP under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\McAfee\DesktopProtection

Or it can be under

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Network Associates\TVD\VirusScan Entreprise\CurrentVersion


If you remove the value of the UIP you will end up bypassing the password.


You can replace the value if you wish too with a known value, but why bother when you can remove the password.
I think this type of protection is not too secure.
