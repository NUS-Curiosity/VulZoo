The only conflict that occurs to me is the commercial pressure of an
OS vendor to retain their reputation of security, by providing less
disclosure than a security coordination group or security utility
company might present.  When RoI reigns supreme, the pressure to
downplay security issues, correct them silently, etc is much greater
than the desire to be candid with the end-user administrator community.
