Subject: April, 2007 is the "Month of Myspace Bugs"



April, 2007, will be designated the "Month of Myspace Bugs, Yuss!" Reasons:

   1. Myspace is important, in that there are a bazillion users and a
kajillion dollars involved.
   2. "Months of Bugs" are whiny, attention-seeking ploys for acceptance.
Myspace's design use is to enable whiny, attention-seeking ploys for
acceptance.
   3. "Months of Bugs" are annoying, so rather than suffering through
another, we figured it'd be better to just create our own where we
could at least direct the content a little.
