I haven't used Vista at all, but from reading the MS documentation about the 
new version of NTFS that it uses it appears that Unix style symlinks are 
supported. (From what I can tell they've been possible since the start, just 
not implemented)

So for any WIndows system that shares the new NTFS code with Vista this is a 
valid vuln. Although I'm not positive about whether MS actually released 
tools along with Vista to use this feature, I'm more than certain that it 
does exist. (However, this may be a moot point. MS might still flag a 
cross-reference like a Unix-style symlink as a filesystem error)
