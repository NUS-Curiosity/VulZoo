 Server Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

DataRescue IDA Pro Remote Debugger Server Authentication Bypass
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.23.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 23, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

DataRescue Inc.'s IDA Pro is a disassembler and debugger for Windows, Linux,
or Macintosh. It supports multiple binary formats as well as many processor
architectures. For more information about IDA Pro, visit the vendor's
website
at the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a password bypass vulnerability in DataRescue Inc.'s
IDA Pro Remote Debugger Server allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the user who is running the remote debugger server.

Since version 4.8, IDA Pro supports remote debugging of x86/AMD64 Windows PE
applications and Linux ELF applications over TCP/IP networks. The IDA
distribution ships with a debugger server for Windows, Linux, and (as of
version 5.1) MacOS X.

The IDA Pro debugger server allows a user to specify a password for
authentication by supplying the -P parameter. The vulnerability specifically
exists in the the processor_request() function. This function is used
for the
initial packet exchange as well as subsequent requests. This function
did not
ensure that the remote user has authenticated prior to calling the
perform_request() function. As such, attacker requests sent prior to
authenticating would be processed normally.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of the described vulnerability allows attackers to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user who starts the remote debugger
server.

It should be noted that the debugger server does not run as a service.
It must
be manually executed. Additionally, the remote debugger server can only
handle
one debugger session at a time. As such, this vulnerability can not be
exploited while the debugger server is in use.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the remote
debugger server for Windows and Linux from IDA Pro versions 5.0 and 5.1. It
is suspected that the MacOS X version and earlier versions are also
affected.

V. WORKAROUND

In order to reduce exposure to this vulnerability, the remote debugger
server
should not be left running when it is not in use.

Additionally, access to the port used by the remote debugger server could be
blocked with the use of a firewall.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

"Since this vulnerability is in the open part of IDA, we provide the
corrected
source code for the modified files."
