Synopsis
========

ClamAV contains two vulnerabilities allowing a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav       < 0.90                         >= 0.90

Description
===========

An anonymous researcher discovered a file descriptor leak error in the
processing of CAB archives and a lack of validation of the "id"
parameter string used to create local files when parsing MIME headers.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can send several crafted CAB archives with a
zero-length record header that will fill the available file descriptors
until no other is available, which will prevent ClamAV from scanning
most archives. An attacker can also send an email with specially
crafted MIME headers to overwrite local files with the permissions of
the user running ClamAV, such as the virus database file, which could
prevent ClamAV from detecting any virus.

Workaround
==========

The first vulnerability can be prevented by refusing any file of type
CAB, but there is no known workaround for the second issue.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.90"
