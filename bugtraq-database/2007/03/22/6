Description:
     Previous versions of the Firefox package were vulnerable to an 
information disclosure issue. Firefox's handling of PASV FTP connections 
could allow a specially crafted server to perform rudimentary port 
scanning on the client machine, giving the FTP server information about 
the client's system. In and of itself, this is not going to cause a 
remote code exploit, but could aid a malicious individual in other attacks.
