Subject: [NB07-09] Multiple vulnerabilities in Takebishi Electric DeviceXplorer FA-M3 OPC server


Multiple vulnerabilities in Takebishi Electric DeviceXplorer FA-M3 OPC
server
============================================================================
=

OPC servers provide a standard way to interoperate automation and control
systems, bridging data from several industrial protocols such as DNP3,
MODBUS, etc. to a more standard data access interface. They are often used
in SCADA systems to consolidate network device information in a single
point; as such OPC servers are usually considered critical applications.

Takebishi Electric commercialises an OPC Server ("Takebishi.FAM3.1"), more
information is available at http://www.takebishi.co.jp/.

ANALYSIS
--------

The product presents various security vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker
with access to the OPC interface to arbitrarily read and write the process
memory, leading to the execution of attacker-provided code.

The vulnerabilities reside in the server implementation of the following OPC
Data Access interface methods:

 * IOPCServer::RemoveGroup

By providing specially crafted OPC handles the attacker can force the server
to access arbitrary memory in read/write operations which can be leveraged
to execute arbitrary code in the OPC server.

VULNERABLE VERSIONS
-------------------

The vulnerability has been verified to be present in the following version
of the server:

  Server name: DeviceXPlorer FA-M3 OPC Server
  OPC Server CLSID: {3D738EE0-F978-11D3-A7F2-00105A820145}
  ProgID: Takebishi.FAM3.1
  Version: 3.11.6
  OS: Windows XP

The vulnerability was discovered during an OPC server group assessment for a
customer and is not known to be publicly exploited.

WORKAROUND
----------

The vendor has fixed the vulnerability and published an updated version.
