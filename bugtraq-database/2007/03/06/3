=== Overview ===

We ask you to participate in the third Chaos Communication Camp on  
August, 8th to 12th, 2007 near Berlin, Germany. The Chaos  
Communication Camp is organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC). It  
is an international, five-day open-air event for hackers and  
associated life-forms. The Camp features two conference tracks with  
interesting lectures. Workshops will take place in a central workshop  
area and in thematic "villages", organized by various groups.

You can participate! Bring your tent and join the villages. The Camp  
has everything you need: power, internet, food, music, sun and fun.  
The large area features enough space to camp.

The Camp is intended to promote the exchange of technical, social and  
political ideas and concepts to find ways to make this world a little  
bit more friendly for intelligent beings, be they carbon-based or  
otherwise.

The conference languages are English and German.



=== Topics ===

In general, lectures and workshops dealing with technology, ethics,  
science, security, art, philosophy, politics, culture and cooking are  
welcome.

The main theme of this year's camp is the world we want to live in  
tomorrow. We try, however, to create a certain focus on a number of  
topics that we regard as important for the near future. We want:

* flying and non-flying autonomous robots
* security, encryption and anonymity
* software projects
* technologies for the day after the climate change
* rapid prototyping and fabbing
* software and hardware for disaster-resistant infrastructure
* bringing broadband to the countryside
* politics and propaganda
* anti-crowd-control tactics and technologies
* lock picking
* alternative energy systems
* citizen surveillance, data mining technologies, and social networks
* data forensic methods
* all things radio (preferably digital)
* self-sustaining and -reproducing hardware
* pollution free transport systems
* hacker anthropology and sociology of the scene
* flying cars, saucers and carpets
* 42
* tesla generators
* telecommunication technologies
* FPGA based analysis
* military technologies
* all kinds of voting computers
* ebooks
* satellites and rockets
(and countermeasures against all of the above).



=== Lecture Requirements ===

Lectures are expected to be highly relevant in practice or better be  
darn funny. Sales droids and PR-people have been known to disappear  
without traces on past events. Interactive workshops are welcome.  
Hands-on anything are even more welcome.

Final presentations for talks should be up to 60 minutes, for  
workshops up to 60 or 120 minutes long. Additionally, a question-and- 
answer period will be provided. Follow-up discussions and hands-on  
workshops are strongly encouraged, there will be space for such  
activities available outside the main lecture shelters (if you don't  
prefer a nice sit-in on the grass in the sun).

Audio and video recordings of the lectures will be published online  
in various formats. All material will be available under a Creative  
Commons licence allowing free non-commercial redistribution of the  
material as long as the original credit to authors and publishers is  
retained.



=== Submissions ===

All proposals MUST be submitted online using our lecture submission  
system at https://pentabarf.cccv.de/submission/Camp+2007 . Please  
follow the instructions given there. You can provide papers and  
slides for the digital conference pack upon submission. Please make  
sure your submission contains all information we need to review your  
talk and send us everything in one go.

If you have any questions regarding your submission, feel free to  
contact us at camp-content@...v.de but do NOT submit your lecture via  
e-mail.

Accepted speakers are asked to hand in slides used in their talks.  
Please use a well-known format for your slides.



=== Dates and deadlines ===

The deadline for submission is May, 15th, 2007. This deadline is  
final. If there are remaining slots, we offer a second deadline on  
June, 5th. Accepted submissions between May, 15th, and June, 5th,
