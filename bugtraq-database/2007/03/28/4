Subject: Bypass phishing protection in Firefox / Opera

Hi, i've tested a simple way to bypass the phishing protection in Firefox 2.0.0.3 and Opera 9.10. Aparently both browsers fails to detect a phishing site if it is embeded in an IFRAME / OBJECT label.  

I've released some demostrations to test the above:

http://zonafirefox.googlepages.com/prueba.html (using Javascript to create an iframe object)

http://zonafirefox.googlepages.com/prueba2.html
(without Javascript)

Also, the following code can be used to bypass the phishing protection:

"<object type="text/html" classid="(phishing site)" data="(phishing site)"></object>"

The tests were realized using several many sites from Phishtank database. IE7 has no problems.

Any feedback and/or confirmation of the above will be very appreciated.

rgds,
nsp
