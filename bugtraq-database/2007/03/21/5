====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Evolution, which
can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a 
vulnerable system.

A format string error in the "write_html()" function in calendar/gui/
e-cal-component-memo-preview.c when displaying a memo's categories 
can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code via a specially
crafted shared memo containing format specifiers.

Successful exploitation requires that the user opens a shared memo in
their mailbox, clicks on "Accept", and views the memo under the "Memo"
tab.

NOTE: The categories are not displayed in the mailbox view of a shared
memo.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Do not open untrusted shared memos.

Various Linux vendors will issue patched versions soon.
