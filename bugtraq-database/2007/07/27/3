Subject: Re: Guidance Software response to iSEC report on EnCase

iSEC Partners will be presenting our complete results from a research project into the security of forensics software next week at the BlackHat USA conference.  The technical paper will be available before the talk at 4pm PST on Wednesday, August 1st at http://www.isecpartners.com/blackhat_2007.html.  

We will continue to assist Guidance in understanding these issues and look forward to releasing our findings.
