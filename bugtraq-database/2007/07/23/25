Subject: RE: Internet Explorer 0day exploit

Zero day is a serious misnomer from vendors that suggest that the counting
of time an exposure is known BY THE GOOD GUYS is some kind of trigger date
when in reality, many serious exploits are know BY THE BAD GUYS so the day
zero is really months or maybe years prior to the disclosure or notification
date. Look at the WMF vulnerability that caused a mad rush to patch it once
the good guys were put on notice. In this case, the vulnerability had been
present in Windows products since the early 90s and according to Kapersky
Labs there was even malware being sold that took advantage of it long before
there was even day zero notification.

So, I'd say that day zero is hype and misleading in that it takes us away
from the reality that EVERY PATCH fixes an exposure that existed from the
time the software was deployed and NOT from the day of reporting or
disclosure. Maybe if we tracked day zero as the installation day of the
faulty code we'd all have a better understanding of how untrustworthy our
base of COTS products really are!

Shouldn't that distinction be simply marked by the terms "patched" and
"unpatched"?

My understanding of the term "zero day exploit" is that it refers to a
vulnerability for which there is an exploit "in the wild" or known
publicly, concurrent with knowledge of the vulnerability itself.  Thus,
the exploit is out there on "day zero".

The term "zero day vulnerability" just seems to be an error of phrasing,
where "vulnerability" replaces "exploit", and as a result confusion such
as in this discussion arises.  Of course, I'm not "in charge" of
maintaining these terms' meaning, so I imagine my opinion of the matter
won't count for much.

It looks like the two of you are in violent agreement.
