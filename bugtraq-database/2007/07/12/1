 Integer Overflow Vulnerability

Apple QuickTime SMIL File Processing Integer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.11.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 11, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

QuickTime is Apple's media player product used to render video and other
media. For more information visit http://www.apple.com/quicktime/

The Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) provides a
high-level scripting syntax for describing multimedia presentations.
SMIL files are text files that use XML-based syntax to specify what
media elements to present, and where and when to present them.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in Apple
Computer Inc.'s QuickTime media player could allow attackers to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the targeted user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in QuickTime players handling of
the title and author fields in an SMIL file. When parsing an SMIL file,
arithmetic calculations can cause insufficient memory to be allocated.
When copying in user-supplied data from the SMIL file, a heap-based
buffer overflow occurs. This results in a potentially exploitable
condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the current user.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a user
into using QuickTime to open a specially crafted SMIL file. This could
be accomplished using a malicious SMIL file referenced from a website
under the attacker's control.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense Labs confirmed this vulnerability exists in version 7.1.3 and
7.1.5 of QuickTime on Windows and Mac OS X. Previous versions are
suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this
vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
