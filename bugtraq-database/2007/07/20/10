Exactly. Why is it that many people seem to agree that it's less likely
that something bad will happen if information is not disclosed. I'd say
it's an equal, if not bigger, chance that something good happens. It's
all about proportions really. There is likely more "good" people out
there than "bad". If x % of the good guys look at it, they will likely
count for a higher number of people as compared to an equal % x of the
bad. So, yes... I believe that immediate information disclosure about a
bug is better. It shortens the exposure window and it certainly does put
more pressure on the vendor to come up with a patch.

Yeah, let's stay away from speculation and assumptions for now.

Well thank you, perhaps I should do it more often.
