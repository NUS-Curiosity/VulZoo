Subject: Re: Menu Manager Mod for WebAPP - No Input Filtering

The issue is not yet secure at http://www.web-app.org 

1.) Guests can edit files on the server by:
http://victim-domain/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=menu
- There are approximately 35 webapporg sites of version 0.9.9.7 defaced with the issue. So it couldn't possibly be fixed for 0.9.9.7 as claimed above.

2.) Members/guests can add $values in the menu form. Allowing $ is madness, its it can be exploited to run direct cmd on the Perl shell.

I tried posting a message about it before here but  it was unnoticed and never published.

Kind regards
