This exploit is does not have any relativity with Eleytt. This exploit is a hoax email. Some one has used my name, but fortunately they mentioned their  o2.pl account. Kindly, note that Eleytt is not responsible for anything that happens related to the email as it is by no means affiliated to Eleytt.

Kind Regards,
