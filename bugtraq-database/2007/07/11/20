Subject: Re: XSS Tunnelling White Paper and Tool

This is very cool. This is a perfect example of an alternate means to
exploit lazy admins :)

Consider a small/medium managed hosting company with public support
forums. The forums aren't high on anyone's list to secure because
they've got better things to do. Mallory discovers some exploits in
the forum (or just un-checked HTML in postings) and posts an XSS
described in the whitepaper into the forums. Bob, the admin browses
the forums, gets infected and then browses to the admin interface of
one of his customer's boxes. Mallory now has control over the managed
server.

Better yet, embedded in a message to an HTML email client (to one of
those services that doesn't sanitize properly). The possibilities are
endless...

Thanks for the brilliant XSS demo tool.
