Subject: Re: Advisory - Clam AntiVirus RAR File Handling  Denial Of Service Vulnerability.

Hi,

The vulnerability also affects unrar (3.70 beta 3 freeware by Alexander 
Roshal), as it tries to read a negative location from a pointer reference in 
the SET_VALUE(false,Data,Addr-Offset) function (found in rarvm.cpp).

The values of Addr is 1666528 while Offset is 4546004 which of course results 
in -2879476 being accessed, or "even better" the value of 4292087820 as it is 
casted to an unsigned value without checking.
