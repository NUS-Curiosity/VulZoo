== Overview ==

http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&q=same+bug+different+app&meta=

My guess is that two years down the track, nobody really took any
notice.

EEYE posted out there advisory, a couple of days ago. Check it if you 
want the technical details.

Not surprising that it was also discovered by another person, and most
likely more than one.

1) Start-Regedit
2) Edit->Search->"editflags"
3) Find those that have a flag set of BINARY 00 00 01 00
4) *yawn*
5) Find a valid file of that type

6) Try a long string in an obvious place
7) Watch the debugger kick in
8) Finish your cup of coffee

== Solutions ==

SUN has released a patch
    http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102996-1

This class of vulnerability is well known, and future cases can be 
mitigated by removing or modifying the editflags value for all
registry entries that have 'Disable Open/Save dialog box' set.
