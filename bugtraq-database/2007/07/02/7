Subject: Re: Light Blog 4.1 XSS Vulnerability

The information on this website is incorrect. Do not download this version as it is not fixed. For a fixed version, download version 6+ from http://www.publicwarehouse.co.uk/php_scripts/lightblog.php

There also was never a file called Light.php, There isn't a file called LightBlog.zip. I suggest asking for information before guessing.
