Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in Firebird, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Firebird is an open source relational database that runs on Linux,
Windows, and various UNIX systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/firebird       < 2.0.1                            >= 2.0.1

Description
===========

Cody Pierce from TippingPoint DVLabs has discovered a buffer overflow
when processing "connect" requests with an overly large "p_cnct_count"
value.

Impact
======

An unauthenticated remote attacker could send a specially crafted
request to a vulnerable server, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firebird.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Firebird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/firebird-2.0.1"
