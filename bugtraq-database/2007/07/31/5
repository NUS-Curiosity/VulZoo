I guess no one ever explained to you how an RFI works?

In order you've just listed.

1. $classfile comes from internal function calls and is only included if ^\w+$ matches.

2. $nextitem comes from a database row.

3. $specialtemplates isn't even used.

Rather than just searching for require_once / include_once in the code maybe actually read the context or even do some testing?
