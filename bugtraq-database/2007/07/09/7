This does not crash on me, and I can't see a likely mechanism of action
that would lead to a DoS condition. The way I read it, the code does not

The PDF on your webpage claims it's a division-by-zero problem, not a
memory corruption flaw; but provides no information needed to verify this
report. Could you perhaps provide a more verbose analysis?
