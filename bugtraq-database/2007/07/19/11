It's been a while, but one of the great things I've seen Bugtraq used for is 
to look at the distribution of vulnerabilities. In the past few years, my 
perception is that there's been a decline in the number of buffer overflow 
attacks and most of what we see today are web attacks like cross-site 
scripting and remote file injection. Seeing these trends is important because 
it tells us as a community where we need to focus our efforts.

That too. Let me tell you, if I ever need to set up a web forum for 
something, I'm going to look at Bugtraq to see what the track record is for 
the systems I'm considering.

Great idea! Much like the RFP vendor notification policy (Which I haven't 
seen mentioned in a while, so I encourage everyone doing vulnerability 
research to see http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html). Anyone care to 
propose a template (presumably if someone who the community respects does so, 
it's more likely to catch on)?
