Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in Festival, allowing for a local
privilege escalation.

Background
==========

Festival is a text-to-speech accessibility program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                     /    Vulnerable    /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-accessibility/festival     < 1.95_beta-r4     >= 1.95_beta-r4

Description
===========

Konstantine Shirow reported a vulnerability in default Gentoo
configurations of Festival. The daemon is configured to run with root
privileges and to listen on localhost, without requiring a password.

Impact
======

A local attacker could gain root privileges by connecting to the daemon
and execute arbitrary commands.

Workaround
==========

Set a password in the configuration file /etc/festival/server.scm by
adding the line: (set! server_passwd password)

Resolution
==========

All Festival users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-accessibility/festival-1.95_beta-r4"
