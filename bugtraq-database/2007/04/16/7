Synopsis
========

xine-lib is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow.

Background
==========

xine-lib is the core library package for the xine media player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib     < 1.1.4-r2                    >= 1.1.4-r2
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to x86 users.

Description
===========

xine-lib does not check boundaries on data being read into buffers from
DMO video files in code that is shared with MPlayer
(DMO_VideoDecoder.c).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to play a specially crafted DMO video
file with a player using xine-lib, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
player.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users on the x86 platform should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.4-r2"
