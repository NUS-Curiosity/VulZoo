Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice.org,
allowing for remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/openoffice         < 2.1.0-r1              >= 2.1.0-r1
  2  app-office/openoffice-bin       < 2.2.0                  >= 2.2.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

John Heasman of NGSSoftware has discovered a stack-based buffer
overflow in the StarCalc parser and an input validation error when
processing metacharacters in a link. Also OpenOffice.Org includes code
from libwpd making it vulnerable to heap-based overflows when
converting WordPerfect document tables (GLSA 200704-07).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running OpenOffice.org.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.1.0-r1"

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.2.0"
