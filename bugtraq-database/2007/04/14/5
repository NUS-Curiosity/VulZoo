If your findings are true, it is utterly insecure. Worse than what you
found.

Can someone confirm this vulnerability?

If your findings are true, it is not encrypted, bute merely
access-controlled by the Steganos Software.

If it were encrypted - in the sense of "encrypted with the passphrase, so
unuseable without that" - the program would simply be unable to do something 
like:

This should be impossible, if the passphrase would play a role in the
encryption.

Yes - the key must be retrievable in some way, if the password can be
changed without knowledge of the prior password.
