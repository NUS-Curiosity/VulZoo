Subject: 3Com's TippingPoint Denial of Service

Vulnerability:       Denial of Service
Affected Product:    3Com's TippingPoint IPS
Affected Versions:   All

Author:              Corroded_Lunchmeats_X



Issue:
======

TippingPoint IPS is prone to DoS when a sequence of crafted packets are
destined for port 80.



Details:
========

When quickly flooded with packets destined for port 80, and an incrementing
source port this causes the software to consume a huge amount of CPU time,
due to a badly written loop, causing the device to stop responding.
