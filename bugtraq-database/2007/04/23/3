Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in 3proxy allowing for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

3proxy is a multi-protocol proxy, including HTTP/HTTPS/FTP and SOCKS
support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-proxy/3proxy      < 0.5.3h                          >= 0.5.3h

Description
===========

The 3proxy development team reported a buffer overflow in the logurl()
function when processing overly long requests.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted transparent request to
the proxy, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with privileges
of the user running 3proxy.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All 3proxy users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/3proxy-0.5.3h"
