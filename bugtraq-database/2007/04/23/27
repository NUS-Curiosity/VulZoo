The script simply hides or shows the link on the page which points to
sf.

Um .. when I click on the link for "FG-Injector" at the above site
with my NoScript-enabled Firefox all I see is what looks like a server
log entry for my interaction :

aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 /injector

This is presumably because the actual links are infested with Javascript
:

onClick="javascript:showStaff('injector')"

Since I'm following links in an email on a security mailing list I'm
disinclined to disable NoScript - any chance you can convert the links
into normal HREFs ?

I could go and grab your Javascript library and figure out what
'showStaff' does ... but I'd rather just click on an old-school link.

Cheers
