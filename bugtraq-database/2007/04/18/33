Subject: Re: Internet Explorer Crash

Tested on several machines- max CPU went to 25, and IE came up asking if I 
wanted to stop the script in all cases.  This is true of a default Vista 
install of IE 7 and XP Pro installs upgraded to IE 7.  Scripting has to be 
on as well...  Even on a dog computer, the prompt will come up (eventually). 
Non-issue here.
