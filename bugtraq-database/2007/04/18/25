Thank you for the clarification, Tim.
That is exactly what I wanted to say. :)

By the way, as regards recent Bind 9, birthday attack is much more
difficult to conduct because even if the attacker sends multiple
simultaneous recursive queries, Bind 9 aggregates these queries.

In addition, there is a patch written by Jinmei-san for Bind 9.4.0
(current release) to randomize source ports.
