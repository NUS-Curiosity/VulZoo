 Invalid Data Length DoS Vulnerability

McAfee E-Business Admin Server Invalid Data Length DoS Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.17.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 17, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

McAfee e-Business Server is used to provide transparent encryption for
corporate end users storing and sharing documents. It is composed of
two utilities; a command line program that encrypts/decrypts data and
manages the keyring, and an administration server that can be used to
update user profiles and manage keys remotely. More information can be
found on the vendor's web site at the following URL.

http://www.mcafee.com/us/enterprise/products/encryption/ebusiness_server.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in McAfee
Inc.'s E-Business Server could allow an attacker to crash the
administration server.

Prior to authentication, an attacker can crash the server by sending a
malformed authentication packet. The server will read in a length from
the packet header, and then attempt to read that many bytes from the
buffer. By specifying a large length value and sending a small packet,
the server can be caused to read off the end of mapped heap memory.
This will trigger an exception that is not handled, and the server will
exit.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the
administration server.

In this situation, the administrator will not be able to configure user
profiles, or add/remove/manage keys.

It is important to note that the core functionality of this product is
contained within the command line utility.

The command line utility would commonly be used by a web script that
needs to encrypt/decrypt data, or by a SMTP gateway that transparently
encrypts routed mail. This utility will continue to work regardless of
whether the administration server is running or not.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in McAfee
E-Business Server version 8.5.1.101 for Windows. Previous versions may
