-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Groupwise WebAccess. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the GWINTER.exe process bound by default on
TCP ports 7205 and 7211. During the handling of an HTTP Basic
authentication request, the process copies user-supplied base64 data
into a fixed length stack buffer. Sending at least 336 bytes will
trigger a stack based buffer overflow due to a vulnerable
base64_decode() call. Exploitation of this issue can result in
arbitrary code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
