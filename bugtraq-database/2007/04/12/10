Details
=======

The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) manages Cisco Aironet access
points using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP). This
protocol provides centralized management of wireless networks. The
WLC contains the following vulnerabilities:

Default SNMP Community Strings
+-----------------------------

The WLC uses the commonly known values of "public" and "private" for
its read-only and read-write SNMP community strings. This
vulnerability is documented by Cisco Bug ID CSCse02384.

Malformed Ethernet Traffic Crash
+-------------------------------

The WLC may crash in response to malformed Ethernet traffic. This
vulnerability is documented by Cisco Bug ID CSCsc90179.

Multiple NPU Lock-Up Vulnerabilities
+-----------------------------------

The Network Processing Unit (NPU) is responsible for handling traffic
within the WLC. It is possible to cause one or more NPUs to lock up
by sending certain types of traffic to an affected WLC. This traffic
includes crafted SNAP packets, malformed 802.11 traffic, and packets
with unexpected length values in certain headers.

Each NPU operates independently and serves two of the physical ports
on the WLC. A lock up in one NPU does not affect the others, so the
number of NPUs available and the configuration of the device
determine whether these vulnerabilities result in a partial or
complete inability to forward traffic. To clear a NPU lock up, the
WLC must be restarted. If the lock up condition prevents access to
the management interface, the restart must be performed via the
console port or service port.

Devices that implement the WLC functionality in software rather than
hardware do not contain a NPU and are not affected by these
vulnerabilities. These software-based devices are the 2000 Series
WLC, the 2100 Series WLC, and the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller
Module.

These vulnerabilities are documented by Cisco Bug IDs CSCsg36361
, CSCsg15901, and CSCsh10841.

Hard-Coded Service Password in Lightweight AP
+--------------------------------------------

The Cisco Aironet 1000 Series and 1500 Series Lightweight Access
Points contain a hard-coded service password that is used for
troubleshooting. This service account is only accessible via a
physical connection to the console port, but the password is common
to all units in these series. This vulnerability is documented by
Cisco Bug ID CSCsg15192.

WLAN ACL Does Not Persist Through Reboot
+---------------------------------------

The WLC contains a bug when processing WLAN ACLs that causes the WLAN
ACL configuration to be saved with an invalid checksum. When the
configuration is subsequently reloaded at boot time, the checksum
fails and the WLAN ACLs are not installed. This vulnerability is
documented by Cisco Bug ID CSCse58195.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at 
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html.

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at 
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.
