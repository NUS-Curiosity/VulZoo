Subject: Yet another SQL injection framework

Hi List,

FG-Injector is a free tool that leverages the pentester's work by
facilitating the exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

It includes a a powerful proxy feature for intercepting and modifying
HTTP requests, a network spy module to allow the analyst view HTTP
requests and their corresponding responses and an inference engine for
automating SQL injection exploitation.

The Inference Engine Module of the FG-Injector Framework automates the
generation and injection of SQL statements needed for exploitation of a
Blind SQL Injection. This module will work also for regular injections
using the same method. It can produce blind injections on web/app
servers using MS SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgresSql DBMSs.
