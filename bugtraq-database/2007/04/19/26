Okej... here's a bit more feedback..

Opera/9.10 (X11; Linux i686; U; en) (1.66Ghz Intel Core Duo as well.. 
Dell M65) Didn't even blink.. I wasn't sure I even had the correct page 
until..

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070304 
Firefox/2.0.0.2  Which gave me about 6 seconds of hd activity and the 
page loaded fine.  If you're in need of more inspiration.. visit any 
average teenagers myspace page.. There's always a ton of crap in there 
causing my browser to go into a fit..
