Agreed.  Previous patches worked as advertised with no adverse side
effects here.

eEye's patch only protects from attacks outside of %systemroot%.  If
an attacker can place a vulnerable file within %systemroot%, all bets
are off.

ZERT's patch, on the other hand, protects regardless of where the file
is located.  It specifically prevents the stack overflow condition by
blocking chunks larger than 36 bytes from being copied.

ISC is reporting problems with the Microsoft patch.  A problem with
the Realtek HD Audio Control Panel has been confirmed and patched by
Microsoft.  Other problems have been reported but no additional
information on them has been released at this point.,
