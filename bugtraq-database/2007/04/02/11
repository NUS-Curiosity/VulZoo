You do not have to rely on some other user running your trojan horse. You
can replace a program run automatically (e.g. by cron). Or something even
better: replace system dynamic libraries (e.g. /lib/tls) and run a
dynamically linked setuid program of your own choice. Instant ownage!
(Moreover, the latter approach is quite easy to exploit without making the
system unusable.)

This is a very serious vulnerability.
