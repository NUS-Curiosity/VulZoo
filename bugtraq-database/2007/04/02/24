Synopsis
========

Asterisk is vulnerable to two Denial of Service issues in the SIP
channel.

Background
==========

Asterisk is an open source implementation of a telephone private branch
exchange (PBX).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/asterisk      < 1.2.14-r2                   >= 1.2.14-r2
                                                         *>= 1.0.12-r2

Description
===========

The Madynes research team at INRIA has discovered that Asterisk
contains a null pointer dereferencing error in the SIP channel when
handling INVITE messages. Furthermore qwerty1979 discovered that
Asterisk 1.2.x fails to properly handle SIP responses with return code
0.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could cause an Asterisk server listening for SIP
messages to crash by sending a specially crafted SIP message or
answering with a 0 return code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-misc/asterisk

Note: Asterisk 1.0.x is no longer supported upstream so users should
consider upgrading to Asterisk 1.2.x.
