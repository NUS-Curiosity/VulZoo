Subject: Re: Drake CMS v0.3.2 < = RFi Vulnerabilities

This vulnerability has nothing to do with Drake CMS v0.3.2.

It affected Drake CMS v0.2.2 ALPHA and ONLY when PHP was with register globals active; since the product was ALPHA it was not released for production websites but only for ALPHA testers to spot bugs.
ALPHA testers keep themselves updated via SVN so this security report has no target audience, reports a wrong version information (should be v0.2.2 ALPHA) and a wrong vulnerability information, and furthermore refers about a specifically unstable product.
