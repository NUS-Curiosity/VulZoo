Description:
    Previous versions of the postgresql package are vulnerable to two
    attacks in which an authenticated database user can cause the
    database server process to crash (Denial of Service), and possibly
    also read privileged database content (Information Exposure).
    
    7 February 2007 Update: The security fix provided in PostgreSQL 8.1.7
    introduced a functional regression: it added an overly-restrictive
    check for type length in constraints and functional indexes.
    PostgreSQL 8.1.8 corrects this error.
