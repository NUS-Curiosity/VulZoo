As Neil Anderson mentioned in his reply to your message earlier,
you are probably seeing a brute force SSH scan from the host
nt.math.nknu.edu.tw, which is probably compromised.

If you have set up your users with strong passwords you should be
fine, although as Neil also mentioned, it would be a good idea to add
an access-class to the VTYs so only connections from authorized IP
addresses and/or networks are accepted.

The behavior you are seeing is normal - during the SSH authentication
phase you will see the user trying to log in in the output from the
"show users" command, or you may only see a machine name with no
username associated with it. This user is not really logged in (it is
just in the authentication phase) and it will go away as soon as the TCP
session is torn down.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
