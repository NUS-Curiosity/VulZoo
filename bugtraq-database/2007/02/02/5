Subject: Re: Sourceforge compromized?

If the content can be shown to be present due to the actions of the
YaPiG project site admins (e.g. using very weak passwords, being
fooled by a sourceforge.net phishing site that steals passwords,
putting the material up intentionally), a full code audit for
everything from sourceforge.net is probably not necessary.
