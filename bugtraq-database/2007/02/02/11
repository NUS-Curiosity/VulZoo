Subject: Re[2]: Ipswitch WS_FTP Server 5.04 multiple arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities

Dear Steven M. Christey,

 In  general  case,  FTP  site admin is not necessary host admin. He can
 only  be  allowed  to  manage  users and virtual hosts for FTP. This is
 privilege escalation vulnerability from FTP site administrator to local
 system account.

 In  addition,  FTP  authentication is usually cleartext, and ability to
 execute  code with local system privileges by any FTP account should be
 taken seriously because of Man-in-the-middle attack vector.
