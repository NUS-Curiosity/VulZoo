Subject: [SAMBA-SECURITY] CVE-2007-0453: Buffer overrun in nss_winbind.so.1
 on Solaris

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

==========================================================
==
== Subject:     Buffer overrun in NSS host lookup Winbind
==		library on Solaris
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2007-0453
==
== Versions:    Samba 3.0.21 - 3.0.23d (inclusive) running on
==		Sun Solaris
==
== Summary:     A potential overrun in the gethostbyname()
==		and getipnodebyname() in the nss_winbind.so.1
==		library on Solaris can potentially allow
==		for code execution.
==
==========================================================

===========
Description
===========

NOTE: This security advisory only affects Sun Solaris
systems running Samba's winbindd daemon and configured to
make use of the nss_winbind.so.1 library for gethostbyname()
and getipnodebyname() name resolution queries.  For example,

	## /etc/nsswitch.conf
	...
	ipnodes: files winbind
	hosts: files winbind

The buffer overrun is caused by copying a string passed
into the NSS interface into a static buffer prior to sending
the request to the winbindd daemon.


==================
Patch Availability
==================

A patch against Samba 3.0.23d has been attached to this
email.  This fix has be incorporated into the Samba 3.0.24
release.  Patches are also available from at the Samba Security
page (http://www.samba.org/samba/security).

==========
Workaround
==========

An unpatched Solaris server may be protected by removing
the 'winbind' entry from the hosts and ipnodes services in
/etc/nsswitch.conf.
