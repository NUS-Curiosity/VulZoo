Dear Casper Dik,

I wasn't crying wolf about a Backdoor, heck I am not Steve Gibson. I
was asking whether somebody will investigate why this hasn't been
caught by audits or simply Q&A ?

CDSC> And one which was too easy to discover;
You said it, it's "easy to discover", so who has discovered it? Sun ? Considering
it's that easy to catch, why hasn't SUN ? Maybe you can give us a
heads up on that ?

CDSC>  real back doors are better
I like that tautologie, "real backdoors", what makes a backdoor more
real than another one ? Is it the coolness, the stealth ? Or is it
simply the fact that it gives back door access ?

CDSC> masquared as buffer overflows you might not chance upon.
Nobody doesn't that anymore, everybody does code audits now and catches
bufferoverflows, right? I think other overflows are more interesting
to hide access.
