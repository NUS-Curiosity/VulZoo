What more information do you need? You have an advisory, access to the
source code, access to the change that resolved the problem and 
patient conversations with a very patient Casper Dik.

The onus is on you to demonstrate how this could be a backdoor.
Otherwise you are asking Sun to prove a negative.

IMO fixing security bugs at short notice is painful enough without
people like yourself and Steve Gibson casting assertions of malice.
