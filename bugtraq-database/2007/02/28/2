Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Catalyst 6000, 6500 and Cisco 7600
Series MPLS Packet Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20070228-mpls

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 February 28 

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Catalyst 6500 series systems that are running certain versions
of Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) are vulnerable to an
attack from a Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) packet. Only the
systems that are running in Hybrid Mode (Catalyst OS (CatOS) software
on the Supervisor Engine and IOS Software on the Multilayer Switch
Feature Card (MSFC)) or running with Cisco IOS Software Modularity
are affected.

MPLS packets can only be sent from the local network segment.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco Catalyst 6500 systems that run 12.2(18)SXF4 with Cisco IOS
    Software Modularity are affected.

    Images that support Cisco IOS Software Modularity have a "-vz"
    suffix in their image name.

    The following is a conclusive list of all image names that are
    running with Cisco IOS Software Modularity and are affected by
    this vulnerability.

      + s72033-adventerprisek9_wan-vz.122-18.SXF4.bin
      + s72033-advipservicesk9_wan-vz.122-18.SXF4.bin
      + s72033-entservicesk9_wan-vz.122-18.SXF4.bin
      + s72033-ipservices_wan-vz.122-18.SXF4.bin
      + s72033-ipservicesk9_wan-vz.122-18.SXF4.bin
      + s72033-ipservicesk9-vz.122-18.SXF4.bin

  * Cisco Catalyst 6000, 6500 and Cisco 7600 series systems with an
    MSFC2 or MSFC3 that run in Hybrid Mode are affected.

    In Hybrid Mode, Catalyst OS (CatOS) software runs on the
    Supervisor Engine and IOS runs on the MSFC. It is different from
    the Native Mode in which IOS runs both on the Supervisor Engine
    and MSFC.

    This vulnerability affects MSFC2, MSFC2a and MSFC3 that run
    certain images in Hybrid mode.

    In Hybrid Mode, IOS images that run on MSFC start with "c6msfc2",
    "c6msfc2a" or "c6msfc3". Several image names that run on MSFC in
    hybrid mode are provided below for reference:

      + c6msfc2a-adventerprisek9_wan-mz.122-18.SXF
      + c6msfc3-jsv-mz.122-14.SX2

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Systems that are running in Native Mode without Cisco IOS
    Software Modularity are not affected.
  * Systems without an MSFC2, MSFC2a or MSFC3 are not affected.

No other Cisco products are known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco IOS Software Modularity combines subsystems into individual
processes and enhances the Cisco IOS Software memory architecture to
provide process-level fault isolation and subsystem "In Service
Software Upgrade" (ISSU) capability. These enhancements are delivered
in Cisco IOS Software for the Catalyst 6500 Series Supervisor Engine
720 and Supervisor Engine 32. Cisco IOS Software Modularity was first
delivered as an option in a Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(18)SXF4.
More information on Modular IOS can be found at the following URL:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/prod_bulletin0900aecd80313e15.html

Not all 12.2(18)SXF4 images support Modular IOS. Only the images with
a "-vz" in the image name support Modular IOS and are affected by
this vulnerability. A conclusive list of all affected image names
that support Cisco IOS Software Modularity is provided in the
Affected Products section.

In Hybrid Mode, a CatOS image is used as the system software to run
the Supervisor Engine on the Catalyst systems. If an MSFC is
installed, a separate IOS Software image is used in order to run the
MSFC. CatOS provides the Layer 2 (L2) switching functionality. The
Cisco IOS on the MSFC provides the Layer 3 (L3) routing
functionality. It differs from the Native Mode, in which a single
Cisco IOS Software image is used as the system software to run both
the Supervisor Engine and MSFC on the Catalyst systems. IOS software
that runs on MSFC in Hybrid Mode is also affected by this
vulnerability. More information about the differences between Hybrid
and Native Modes can be found at the following URL:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/products_white_paper09186a00800c8441.shtml

MPLS packets received by a Route Processor (MSFC) Layer 3 interface
can potentially trigger this vulnerability. The system in question
does not need to be configured for MPLS to be vulnerable. MPLS
packets can only be sent from the local network segment, limiting the
scope of the exploitation.

This issue is documented in bug IDs CSCsd37415 ( registered customers
only) and CSCef90002 ( registered customers only) .

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Cisco will
provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then compute
environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at 
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html.

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at 
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in the reload
of the system on systems that are running with Cisco IOS Software
Modularity and the reload of MSFC on systems that are running in
Hybrid Mode.

Repeated exploitation may lead to a denial of service condition.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain that
the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release
train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a
given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible
releases that contain the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the
anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the "Rebuild"
and "Maintenance" columns. A device running a release in the given
train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less
than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable. The release
should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later
version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label).
