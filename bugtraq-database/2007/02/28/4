Amazing work. Now, of course, it's going to become harder to do the next time :-)

Obviously Microsoft is getting ready for the platform where the hardware can only execute the software they want (vs. the user wants), and then, the hardware platform will be split in two:

Hardware that can run Microsoft approved software.
Hardware that can run other software (and maybe Microsoft's)

Obviously, the first kind will be really cheaper, and most people will choose to buy hardware with all the protections in it, and then, of course, "other" software will slowly retrieve back to a small circle of fans who are willing to pay more money (more that twice the price) for the freedom of running Linux...

sad...

then, E.T. will come and think "How's possible that this people, with all this technology, have not evolved further?" and of course, the answer will be obvious, it's because economic interests are forcibly holding evolution back...
