Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Firefox focus stealing vulnerability (possibly other browsers)

here is an idea... we can combine both techniques into a single
attack... the hardest part of your hack is to force the user to type
:// plus several other / but if we steel the focus from the address
bar, unaware users will type something like this http://www.google.com
for example, which is what we want.
