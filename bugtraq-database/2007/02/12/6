Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Firefox focus stealing vulnerability (possibly other browsers)

phh :), I found something very interesting when testing your IE
example... every time I try to type something in the address bar, the
focus is redirected back to the input box. I wonder if it is possible
to capture what the user is typing in the address bar. That would be
neat... I am just checking your code to see what the hell is going on.
