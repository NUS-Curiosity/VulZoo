Actually, MSIE doesn't require drive specification in the filename, and
will probably accept relative paths as well (so you might not need \
either when picking files from the desktop or 'my documents' or whatnot).

Firefox won't settle for a path without drive specification (but it will
accept SMB requests ;-). On *nix systems, of course, aiming /etc/passwd is
easier than C:\whatever.

The problem with intercepting address bar input is that you can't echo the
entered text back there without unloading the current document and its
scripts; in my examples, I tried to make sure that it's hard for the user
to notice that his input is not going where it should (in MSIE example,
this includes simulation of a blinking cursor).
