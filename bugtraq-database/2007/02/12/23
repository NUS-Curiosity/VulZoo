Tested around, and it does indeed work, on all solaris 10 (sparc & x86).

OS packaging person here (the guy who defines the exact stripped version
we install on customer appliance) did test with root, and it worked. I
suspect it is dependent on whether root is enabled as allowed as a remote
login or not (a setting I dimly remember being available on solaris 10
years ago, I think).

We do, and we confirm. The info is spreading like wildfire, and justifiably
so - I thought this bug category (-fuser) was squashed last with AIX over
10 years ago.
