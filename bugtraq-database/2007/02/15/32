How about putting a backdoor into your C compiler such that it
generates "special code" when it recognises it is compiling
/bin/login that allows special access?

That doesn't show up in any code audit of /bin/login...

so you think about auditting the code that makes up the compiler..

where does the executable for that come from...

and so on back.
