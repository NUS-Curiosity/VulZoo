A public, false assertation of malice is called libel. 

The great and needed social role that the glaring light of the public
gets to weld to hold others accountable require that public allegations
have at least some reasonable basis, backed by evidence, for their
postulation.

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.

Assertions of malice are a good thing. Keeps people on their toes and
thinking about it.

There have also been too many times in the past when they have been
proven correct to ignore the possibility any longer.
