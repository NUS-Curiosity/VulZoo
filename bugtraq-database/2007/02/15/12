========================================================================

== Overview ==

The DjVu Browser Plug-in is the primary means of viewing DjVu documents.

It runs inside most modern browsers including IE, Firefox and Safari.

Versions prior to 6.1.1 are vulnerable to buffer overflows through
various functions. One such example is through the ExportImageAs method.

It should be noted that CERT contacted Lizardtech at about the same time

as we did, advising of numerous overflow problems as well. These have
also been addressed by this update.

== Solutions ==

- Upgrade to version 6.1.1 from the lizardtech website
