Steve,

I agree that both: iFTPAddU and iFTPAddH resemble administrator-level controls. Moreover, they are administrator-level controls. But, as ZARAZA said, the problem still remains. The successful exploitation of the issues might result in privilege escalation, therefore I called the aforementioned issues - the vulnerabilities. 

kind rgds,
