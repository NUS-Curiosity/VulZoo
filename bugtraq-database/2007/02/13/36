In the case of embedded devices, I think bugfix is not a matter of time.

Even if the hardware vendor is willing to build a new, bugfixed ROM for
a device that is outdated within 3 monthes of its release, nobody is
ever going to reflash his iPaq/SmartPhone/whatever, apart from a couple
of geeks who are willing to loose their data and reinstall all their
applications.

The hotfix is "buy a new one".
