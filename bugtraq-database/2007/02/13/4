Dear List,

GE>     telnet -l "-froot" [hostname]
GE> "but this bug isnt -froot, its -fanythingbutroot =P"

Should we really consider this a BUG ? With all due respect, this
reads, smells and probably tastes like a backdoor, and obvious one
granted but still, to my believe this raises the question are there
more of them ? I think the guys behind solairs should investigate and
post the result of their enquiry publicaly (to the vuln. post would be a
good idea) if they still want poeple to trust.
