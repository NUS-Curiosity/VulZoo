I said I agreed with you. But you can use secure software (or modify the 
unsecure ones you have), so that they don't enable a full path 
disclosure, even if you don't have the choice of your PHP configuration! 
Can't you? ;)

I said "for example", as I know this is how MediaWiki does:

if ( ! defined( 'MEDIAWIKI' ) )
     die( 1 );

How would you do it?
