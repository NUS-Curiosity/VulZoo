Well the ideal situation for incuding files is when your root is not 
yout webroot.
But if you dont have this you can make a workaround by placing every php 
file that is not directy called (but included) into a folder and place 
in it an .htaccess file with a deny from all command so it would not be 
accesible from anyone through a browser.
