I don't think that the method described in the paper you referenced 
above is applicable as-is, because the method requires that the state of 
the PRNG is known (the coefficients aren't), while in our situation, the 
coefficients are known, but the state isn't known in fullness (only 32 
bits out of the 48 are known).
