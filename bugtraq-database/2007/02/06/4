Subject: Unofficial SQL-Ledger patch for CVE-2007-0667

This patch was made against SQL-Ledger 2.6.18 but just modifies a few 
lines in the redirect() function in the Form.pm.  I have decided that it 
is probably best to release the patch and then wait a while before 
releasing full disclosure.  The author of SQL-Ledger has declined to use 
this patch.

Best Wishes,
Chris Travers
