Potential Security Impact: Remote unauthorized Denial of Service (DoS)

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX running IPFilter in combination with PHNE_34474. The vulnerability could be exploited by a remote unauthorized user to create a Denial of Service (DoS).

References: none

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.23 running IPFilter with PHNE_34474 installed.

BACKGROUND

A successful exploit will result in a system crash.

To determine if an HP-UX system has an affected version, search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset" for one of the filesets listed below. For affected systems verify that the recommended action has been taken.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

HP-UX B.11.23
=============
IPF-HP.IPF-MIN
 ->action: remove the patch, disable IPFilter, or install preliminary patch

END AFFECTED VERSIONS
RESOLUTION

Until a patch is available to resolve the issue, the potential vulnerability can be avoided in three ways:
(1) remove PHNE_34474 on HP-UX B.11.23 systems where IPFilter is in use or
(2) disable IPFilter or
 ->(3) install the preliminary patch, UNOF_35938.depot, or manually install libnet.a.

To Determine Whether IPFilter is in Use:

If 'ipfstat -io' returns the following, then IPFilter is not in use:

  # ipfstat -io
  empty list for ipfilter(in)
  empty list for ipfilter(out)

Alternative 1 - Remove PHNE_34474

If IPFilter is in use, PHNE_34474 can be removed to avoid the potential vulnerability.

Note that removing PHNE_34474 exposes the system to the possibility of a memory leak:

SR:8606414192 CR:JAGaf74051 - Connection oriented DLPI streams may see a small memory leak in rare conditions.

The patch documentation for PHNE_34474 should be consulted for a list of the other changes provided by PHNE_34474.

Alternative 2 - Disable IPFilter

Since IPFilter can be used as a defense against many types of exploits, the potential security impact should be considered before disabling IPFilter.

To disable IPFilter:

1. edit /etc/rc.config.d/ipfconf and set IPF_CONF and IPMON_START to 0.
2. run '/sbin/init.d/ipfboot stop'
3. run 'ipfstat -io' as discussed above to verify that IPFilter is no longer in use.

 ->Alternative 3 - Install UNOF_35938.depot or preliminary libnet.a

A preliminary patch is available. The library which resolves the vulnerability is also available for manual installation. The instructions and the patch files are available from hprc.external.hp.com (192.170.19.100):
