Subject: Technika - Attack Scripting Environment

http://www.gnucitizen.org/projects/technika/

Technika was developed for the computer security professionals to
automate common exploitative task from the browser. It acts like a
standard OS shell scripting environment. You can script everything
from the currently viewed page and also spawn processes, unrestricted
XMLHttpRequest connections and Sockets.

Technika was successfuly used to implement several Web and System
related exploits that run directly from the browser. Unfortunatley
their source code cannot be shown here for obvious reasons.

The extension is still in Alpha although it is mostly usable and quite stable.

If you have a proposal, question, suggestion or correction, please contact us.
