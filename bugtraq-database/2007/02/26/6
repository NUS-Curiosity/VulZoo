security conference. It is the aspiration of SyScan to congregate, in
Singapore, the best security experts in their various fields, to share their
research, discovery and experience with all security enthusiasts in Asia.

Besides main the conference, there will also be specialized security
training courses in SyScan'07. These classes will be held before the main
conference.

Hotel. The main conference will be held on 5th and 6th of July and the
