Subject: RE: Denial Of Service in Internet Explorer for MS Windows Mobile 5.0

A Couple points I'd like to make here...

1). 90 days is plenty of time to fix a vulnerability, and in this case
the author is merely stating the details of which will be revealed after
90 days. I doubt this will lead to any mass exploitation as I imagine
you will need to go to a "specially crafted" website to exploit this DoS
condition anyway.   "... should the device browser access a WML page
with malformed content..."

Seems pretty harmless, annoying, but harmless. You go to an "evil" page
and your mobile browser crashes and you need to hard reboot, yeah not a
lot of reason to mass exploit this imho. 

2). I'm pretty sure it's pwned, or owned, but not p0wned.

3). Thanks for the info on that DST patch issue, good to know.

With all due respect..... the "90 days fix it or else" on a mobile 
platform is being optimistic don't you think when I'm still struggling 
getting a cab file update on all of my mobile phones for the time change

issue.

Quite frankly a denial of service on IE on a phone will get me yelled at

...it won't get me p0wned.  I'm going to already be yelled at when their

calendars are all screwed up so quite frankly on the threat of being 
yelled at scale  .... right now Daylight Savings issues has a higher 
priority.

For those not aware, in a few weeks the USA time zones spring forward 
earlier than they have been. 
Mobile phones need a DST patch along with just about everything else....

Windows Mobile 5.0 (for smart phone and pocket PC) that impacts upon the
availability and security of devices operating on this platform. It is
possible for an attacker to create an overflow state within Internet
Explorer, resulting in the termination of the normal functionality of IE
and a Denial of Service, should the device browser access a WML page
with malformed content. Users of affected devices must perform a hard
battery reset in order to resume Internet Explorer and normal device
operations.
