Subject: Re: SYMSA-2007-002: Palm OS Treo Find Feature System Password Bypass

All this hype over Treo's bug using 'Find' feature is unnecessary. This is completely false that hacker can get access to data. I tested it myself on my treo 650 and found out that I can only see the results after executing Find function. As soon as I click on any one of the find results, treo takes me back to the phone screen and does not let me enter into any of the contacts, memos, calendar or anything.

The agencies reporting the bug are not giving complete information. They told that hacker can access the Find functiona and see the results. But they did not tell that hacker CANNOT access any treo entry by clicking on the find results.
