Solaris's /bin/login has never supported the "-f" command line option
until Solaris 10 (RTFM) so this exploit was just plain not possible.

The other avenue for passing command line args to telnet is through
the TERM telnet option, but Solaris stopped passing that through on
the command line a long time ago (maybe 2.3 or earlier?)

No.

More people should go back and read Casper's email where he explained
that it came about with a Kerberos project.
