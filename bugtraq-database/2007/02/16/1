Subject: EasyMail Objects v6.5 Connect Method Stack Overflow

========================================================================
= EasyMail Objects v6.5 Connect Method Stack Overflow
=
= Vendor Website: 
= http://www.quiksoft.com
=
= Affected Version:
= All versions of EasyMail Objects prior to v6.5 
=
= Public disclosure on February 16th, 2007.
========================================================================

== Overview ==

During a security review of the safe-for-scripting EasyMail objects,
a stack overflow was discovered in the connect method of EasyMail IMAP4 
(Object ClassID {703B353E-FA2E-4072-8DDF-F70AAC7E527E}).
This advisory is also available online at 
http://www.security-assessment.com/files/advisories/easymail_advisory.pdf

== Exploitation ==

When the object is initialized and the Connect method is called, a stack
overflow is possible when a large (500+ characters) host name is specified.
Once arbitrary data has been written to the stack, it is possible to
overflow the structured exception handler and gain command execution.

== Solutions ==

Security-Assessment.com has been in contact with Quiksoft and a 
new version of the software has been released to address the discovered
vulnerability.

Security-Assessment.com urges EasyMail users to upgrade to the latest
version
which is available at
http://www.quiksoft.com/download/emsetup.exe.
