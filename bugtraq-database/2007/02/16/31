And how does this relate to Sun purposely putting a backdoor into their
telnet service, as that was the suggestion, not a rogue attacker invading
a CVS/FTP server and patching the source.

No, I think you're changing it to suit your purposes.

I'm being dismissive of those of you who would prefer to believe that this
is something that was put into the source on purpose by Sun as opposed to
a developers mistake, Occam's razor and all that. There is a difference of
paranoia and utter absurdity, and the (serious) suggestion that this was a
bug placed on purpose by Sun crosses thats line. It was a silly bug
accidently placed by (most likely) an engineer at Sun who will never live
it up, not some stupid attempt at world domination via telnet.
