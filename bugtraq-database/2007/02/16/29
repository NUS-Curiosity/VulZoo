Subject: Re: Drive-by Pharming Threat

My ISP issues 2Wire modem/router/WAP boxes now.  I found it very
interesting to explore what (few) changes require a password and what
ones do not.

In particular, packet filter and port forwarding changes require no
password at all - so changing your password on the router wouldn't do
you any good against driveby changes to those settings.  I'll have to
look when I get home whether DNS server changes would.

A bit OT, but there's also the fact that since these devices are
considered ISP equipment - they include the modem that connects to
telco lines - the ISP has one, global, password for all home routers
on their network, and can admin them from the 'outside' of your home
network.  Given big telco security standards, not a very reassuring
thought.

Regards
Mark

When the page is viewed, the code makes a login attempt into the user's home broadband router and attempts to change its DNS server settings (e.g., to point the user to an attacker-controlled DNS server).   Once the user's machine receives the updated DNS settings from the router (e.g., after the machine is rebooted) future DNS request are made to and resolved by the attacker's DNS server.

Note that the attack does not require the user to download any malicious software - simply viewing a web page with the malicious JavaScript code is enough.
