The second vulnerability you mention was indeed affecting System V derived 
login. Furthermore, it was exploitable through a common telnet client (via 
the TTYPROMPT trick [1], which somehow reminds me of the recent Solaris 10 
exploit), locally, or through other attack vectors, such as rlogin [2] and 
even X.25 pad daemon, without the need to specify TTYPROMPT at all.
