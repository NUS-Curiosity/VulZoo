 Vulnerability

I'm somewhat surprised that the reporter does not list the HTML template editor as a potential XSS attack vector too. Perhaps he considers uploading files via FTP to be a means of attack too?

Yes, we allow *authenticated administrators* to enter HTML for certain values. This is the intended behaviour, and should the authenticated site administrator wish to include <script> tags in that HTML that is their perogative.

This is not a bug or a security flaw.
