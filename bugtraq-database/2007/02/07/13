 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

RARLabs Unrar Password Prompt Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.07.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 07, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Unrar is a command line archive extractor for Windows and Linux. For more
information visit the vendor's site at the URL shown below.

http://www.rarlabs.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in
RARLabs Unrar may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user opening the archive.

Unrar is prone to a stack based buffer overflow when processing specially
crafted password protected archives.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the file.
Exploitation would require that an attacker hosts a maliciously crafted
document on a website and entice users to visit the site. An attacker
could also e-mail the malicious document and use social engineering
techniques to trick the e-mail recipient into opening the document.

There are several mitigating factors for this vulnerability. Nearly all
Windows users will use the GUI based WinRAR to open archives, and it is
not vulnerable. If users are using the vulnerable command line based
unrar, they still need to interact with the program in order to trigger
the vulnerability. They must respond to the prompt asking for the
password, after which the vulnerability will be triggered. They do not
need to enter a correct password, but they must at least push the enter
key.

IV. DETECTION
