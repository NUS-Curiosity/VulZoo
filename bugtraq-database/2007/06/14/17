Subject: Re: RedLevel Advisory #23 - SalesCart Shopping Cart SQL Injection Vulnerability

Dear "Accounting",

I have legally posted vulnerability information on a mailing list  
specifically for this issue. The public is entitled to this  
information. It is up to the editors of the board to decide whether  
this vulnerability is fact or fiction. They don't post incorrect  
vulnerability information. Otherwise, I could simply say I have 15  
remote root vulnerabilities affecting every linux kernel.

If you would prefer for our company to look into your commercial  
product, we would be more than happy. For now, though, we would  
appreciate private and direct correspondence.

Thank you,
John Martinelli
