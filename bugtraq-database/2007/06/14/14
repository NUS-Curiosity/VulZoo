This is not true and is actually "slander". 

He says no one responded; however, I personally talked with Mr. Martinelli and explained to him he was looking at an old out-of-date demo on the website that is not indicative of the released product.

These tests were performed on a "non-commercial" product demo and are not indicative of the commercial product at all.  We were able to reproduce this sql injection on this demo code but not on the released product.  In addition, the product the customer is referring to is also completely "obsolete".

Mr. Martinelli's information is incorrect and down right slanderous in at least 3 or 4 accounts.
