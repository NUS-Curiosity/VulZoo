Thomas Lim though knows what he is doing and willing to stand behind
what he reports. Nowadays the vendors I am worried about are the open

This is not about lost maintainers or non-existent patches, that's been

depressing - and the replies you get (if any) are so annoying, that if
it was from Microsoft, they would have been grilled in the press already
for them.
