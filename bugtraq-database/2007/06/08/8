  clamav < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - Multiple Security Fixes.
  - Victor Stinner has reported a vulnerability in ClamAV, caused due to
    an error within the OLE2 parser when handling objects with malformed
    FAT partitions and large property sizes. This can be exploited to
    cause a DoS due to storage and CPU resource consumption by scanning
    a specially crafted OLE2 file.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2007-2650 to this issue. 

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
