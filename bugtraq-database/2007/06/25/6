Subject: Papoo CMS 3.6 - SQL Injection

Papoo Content Management System Backend SQL Injection               Jun 24 2007
_______________________________________________________________________________


* Product

  Papoo Content Management System


* Vulnerable Versions

  Papoo 3.6 and maybe prior

  
* Vendor Status

  The Vendor was notified and the issue was fixed.
  A patch is available at http://www.papoo.de/index/menuid/204/reporeid/215


* Details

  The Papoo Content Management System is prone to an SQL Injection that can be
  exploited by any user with access to the backend system and with privileges
  to modify the navigation menu.
  
  The application will get the read and publish privileges for every usergroup 
  and for every menu item that is meant to be edited and specified by the 
  `selmenuid' GET parameter. It fails to sanitize the value of the parameter.


* Impact

  Attackers may be able to execute arbitrary SQL queries.


* Exploit

  No exploit required.
