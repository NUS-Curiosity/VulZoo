Subject: Re: Buffer overflow in BusinessMail email server system 4.60.00

This problem was corrected within 14 days, and a new SMTP server was provided on our web site. This was back in 2005, we are now almost TWO YEARS ON, and you still claim it is a problem.

You **were** notified of the release of the fix, and we have many other confirmations that it is indeed a good fix.

We are now at 4.7 of BusinessMail, and that also still blocks this "vulenrability", and yet you continue to publich out of ate dand inaccurate information as being the truth.

Kindly update your published information as relevant to reflect the true facts of this buglet.

You can download an evaluation BusinessMail system from our web site to test this for yourself if you still do not beleive us.

Thank You
