Subject: Openedge _mprosrv buffer overflow

There is a potential for a buffer overflow in the database executable _mprosrv while reading a TCP/IP message that is incorrectly formatted.  To avoid this problem, additional checking has been added to the _mprosrv executable that will prevent incorrectly formatted messages from causing buffer overflows.

Bug# OE00148128 has been addressed in Progress 9.1E0422 and OpenEdge 10.1B01.  The 9.1E0422 version of this fix requires that 9.1E04 be installed prior to this fix being applied to the Progress installation.  These versions of Progress are available for download from the OpenEdge Download Center.
