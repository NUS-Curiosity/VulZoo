Subject: Re: Sitellite cms <= 4.2.12 RFI Vuln

Sitellite requires .htaccess capabilities from Apache to configure its content server, so the .htaccess "deny from all" which we include in the PhpDocumentor folder effectively prevents this exploit for all Sitellite installations.

PhpDocumentor is only accessible in Sitellite on the command line for the purposes of generating API documentation.  This has been the case since Sitellite 4.2.0-rc3.
