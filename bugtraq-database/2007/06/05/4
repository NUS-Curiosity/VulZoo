TPTI-07-08: Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation Scheduler Service
            Authentication Bypass Vulnerability 
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-07-08
June  4, 2007

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-2279

-- Affected Vendor:
Symantec

-- Affected Products:
Veritas Storage Foundation

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the functionality exposed by the Storage
Foundation for Windows Scheduler Service, VxSchedService.exe, which
listens by default on TCP port 4888. During normal use an administrator
may add schedules to be run using the management console which requires
authentication. However, if an attacker connects directly to the
scheduler service and issues the commands, there exists no validation
of credentials.

The packet is parsed for requests as shown in the following snippet:

.text:01016720 mov eax, [ebp-80h] ; controlled buffer
.text:01016723 dec eax ;
.text:01016724 mov byte ptr [ebp-4], 1
.text:01016728 jz create_registry
.text:0101672E dec eax
.text:0101672F jz short delete_registry
.text:01016731 dec eax
.text:01016732 dec eax
.text:01016733 jz short modify_registry

A malicious attacker is able to add, modify, or delete registry values
from
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Veritas\VxSvc\CurrentVersion\Schedules
which holds the schedules for snapshots. Each schedule has a PreScript
and PostScript field which allow for arbitrary commands to be executed
when the schedule is run. Modification or either of these fields will
allow for remote code execution.
