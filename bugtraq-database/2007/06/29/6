Subject: Re: eTicket version 1.5.5 XSS Attack Vulnerability

The severity of this bug is inaccurate.

Considering this bug is simply XSS, and only available when register_globals is On I would consider this "Very Low".

Ultimately eTicket is not designed to work with register_globals On, please turn it off. It is set to off in php.ini by default.
