[SecurInfos] PCSoft WinDEV .wdp Project File Handling Buffer Overflow

Release Date : 2007-06-28

Critical : Moderately critical. Level 3 of 5.
Impact : System access
Where : From remote

Solution Status : Unpatched

Software :
PCSoft WinDEV
(PCSoft WinDEV Express)
(PCSoft WinDEV Mobile)
(PCSoft WebDEV)

Description :
Jerome Athias has reported a vulnerability in PCSoft WinDEV, which can 
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the handling 
of a ".wdp" project file that contains an overly long string in the 
"used DLL" fields. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer 
overflow and allows arbitrary code execution when a malicious ".wdp" 
file is opened.
It is also possible to perform an infinite loop (DoS), resulting in the 
use of a large amount of CPU and memory ressources using a malformed 
project file.

The vulnerability has been reported in version 11 (latest release: 
01F110053p). Older versions and other products (WinDEV Express, Mobile 
and WebDEV) could also be affected.


Solutions :
Do not open ".wdp" files from non-trusted sources.
