Subject: Having Fun With PostgreSQL

Dear list,

I'd like to present a paper about security issues with PostgreSQL. The paper describes weaknesses in the configuration that may allow attackers to escalade privileges, execute shell commands and to upload arbitrary (binary) files via SQL injections.

You can either get the TXT version from http://www.leidecker.info/pgshell/Having_Fun_With_PostgreSQL.txt
Or as PDF at at http://www.portcullis.co.uk/uplds/whitepapers/Having_Fun_With_PostgreSQL.pdf

The paper comes with a tool called `pgshell' that can be downloaded at http://www.leidecker.info/pgshell/

Cheers,
Nico
