Subject: Local Denial of Service in Safari

Vulnerability at locally viewing files with the reference to document.location parameter leads to failure of a browser. In consequence of that there is a service crash. 

Tested on:

Safari 3.0.1 (522.12.2) &#1054;S Windows XP SP2
Safari 3.0   (522.11.3) &#1054;S Windows XP SP2

Example that can be injected in web-page: 

<script type='text/javascript'>
document.location = '';
</script>
