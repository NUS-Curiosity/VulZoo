Good Raining morning...

If he has access for example to /tmp directory or other directory on
hosted server (from another normal (maybe ftp) account in another domain),
he still can run XSS via his bug. In this case his domain can be another
domain (but on the same phisical machine) and IMHO vBulletin should check
path traversal.

btw: of course if he can use ../../ to take file from path outside root
path of vBulletin (like /tmp or another account dir)
