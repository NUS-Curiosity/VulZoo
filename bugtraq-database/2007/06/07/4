According to the comment that is output a few lines above, you are
supposed to "after you connect hold the enter key"

So the claim is probably, that a large number of <LF> or probably rather
<CR><LF> will do something to utorrent. However I have not even tried to
verify it, as this "advisory" contains almost no detail (like version,
effect on utorrent), etc.

To the OP: If you want to be taken seriously, you should take more time
to investigate the vulnerability and to learn the right tools (like perl
and netcat in this case) than to write silly scripts that ask for data
that could just be supplied on the commandline.


Kind regards,

Andreas Beck
