playing for fun with <=IE7 
Impact: who knows ...
Fix Available: no

-------------------------------------------------------


1) Bug 
2) Proof of concept
3)Conclusion



======
1) Bug 
======
it's possible to bypass the extension filter of <=IE7  this can result by downloading
an arbitrary exe file 

=====
2)proof of concept
=====
let's take this exemple :
http://dams083.free.fr/tmp/putty.exe
this is simply putty .
you click on this and then you will be prompted for downloading the file.
but what about if we do :
http://dams083.free.fr/tmp/putty.exe?1.txt
... the .exe is showed.
now let's go a bit ahead :
http://dams083.free.fr/tmp/putty.exe?1.cda
wow my .exe is downloaded directly and located in temporary files ( and """opened""" by windows media player).
works with theses extension :
.log
.dif
.sol
.htt
.itpc
.itms
.dvr-ms
.dib
.asf
.tif
etc ...
=====
5) Conclusion
=====
this is very funny , because actually it only works for .exe extensions.

.COM , .PIF , etc  you CANT do this. ( overwrite the extension , and then bypass the filter)
i guess we can wonder what the heck.
