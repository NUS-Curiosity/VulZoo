Subject: Re: CheckPoint Secure Platform Multiple Buffer Overflows

Please notice that when having admin access probably there are many other trivial ways to completely compromise a Secure Platform -get the "Expert" rights- but the paper interest is not this. What it is interesting is the high number of buffer overflows found in the CheckPoint applications and the fact that some times they can be exploited even if the platform is hardened via standard DAC policies + kernel patches, etc.
MAC policies or MLS System probably would have contained the attack.
