WifiZoo v1.2:

-Bug Fixes
-It now has a web GUI running on localhost:8000, it will hopefully
make its use more 'convenient'
-And it also has an 'http proxy' ala ferret/hamster. You can display
the captured cookies with the web gui, clicking on a cookie will set
that cookie on the wifizoo proxy. Set your browser to use the proxy,
and again, hopefully, that will do the trick.
