Subject: IRM Discover More Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS

In the last three months IRM has discovered a total of 13 new security
vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS. These vulnerabilities were reported to
Cisco and have all been allocated PSIRT reference numbers while the root
cause and potential impact of each is investigated. Cisco has taken all
the vulnerability reports extremely seriously and has already started
releasing patches and workarounds to mitigate them (e.g.
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20071010-lpd.shtml). As
the remaining patches or workarounds are developed, IRM will release
security advisories, which will include full technical details of each
vulnerability and links to patch download information.
