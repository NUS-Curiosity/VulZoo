   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-012
Advisory Title: Microsoft Windows CE IGMP Denial of Service
        Author: Ollie Whitehouse / ollie_whitehouse@...antec.com
  Release Date: 22-10-2007
   Application: Windows CE 5.01 / Windows Mobile 5
      Platform: Microsoft Windows
      Severity: Denial of Service
 Vendor status: Update Available
    CVE Number: CVE-2006-0021
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16645


Overview:

  This issue was originally discovered by Douglas Nascimento of
  Datacom and published in Microsoft security bulletin MS06-007 on
  Feburary 14th 2006 and subsequently updated March 17th 2006. A
  condition exists with the Microsoft IP stack wherein a specially
  crafted IGMP packet causes a denial of service condition. In
  Microsoft's original advisory, Windows CE was omitted as a
  vulnerable platform; however, In Symantec's testing it was
  discovered that Windows CE 5.01 (shipped as part of the Windows
  Mobile 5 PocketPC and SmartPhone editions) is vulnerable. Symantec
  notified Microsoft in Feburary 2006 of the fact that CE was
  affected with Microsoft releasing a patch in KB930642 in
  Feburary 2007.


Details:

  On the day of release Symantec developed a working trigger for this
  vulnerability. A public exploit for this issue was released by
  Alexey Sintsov on the 21st of March 2006. When an IGMP packet is
  supplied with invalid IP options then it will cause a denial of
  service condition. As IGMP can be sent both via unicast and mulicast
  it is possible to cause the issue to manifest itself in many devices
  with a single packet if appropiate network filtering is not in place.


Vendor Response:

  There is a security vulnerability that could allow for Denial of
  Service (DoS) by sending a specifically crafted TCP/IP packet to the
  mobile device. However most attempts to exploit this vulnerability
  would result in a Denial of Service Condition on the networking
  capabilities of the device.
  
  The following devices may be vulnerable to this issue:
  
  Windows CE 4.2 - Windows CE .NET 4.2 Platform Builder
      Monthly Update (September 2007)
  Windows Mobile 5.0 - A fix for this issue has been provided by
      Microsoft via  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930642
  Fixed in Windows Mobile 6.0.


Recommendation:

  Windows Mobile 5.0 customers please see your handset manufacturer to
  obtain the update customized for your device to Windows Mobile 6.

  OEMs which utilise Windows CE should ensure KB930642 is applied to
  their build environment. Details can be found here on Microsoft's
  support site - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930642/.

  Carriers should ensure appropiate network filtering is in place in
  order to protect affected handsets.
