   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-013
Advisory Title: Lotus Notes Memory Mapped Files Vulnerability
        Author: Ollie Whitehouse / ollie_whitehouse@...antec.com
  Release Date: 23-10-2007
   Application: Lotus Notes / Domino
      Platform: Microsoft Windows
      Severity: Session hijacking in shared user environments
                / Data leakage in shared user environments
 Vendor status: Updated Application Versions Available
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-5544
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26146


Overview:

  Lotus Domino is a client/server product designed for collaborative
  working environments. Domino is designed for e-mail, scheduling,
  instant messaging and data driven applications.

  There exists a vulnerability in the way memory mapped files are
  used under Windows. The result of which is that if the Lotus Notes
  Client is used in a Microsoft Terminal Services or Citrix
  environment users can read each others Lotus Notes session data
  including items such as E-Mail.

  This vulnerability also impacts the server product.


Details:

  The vulnerability arises due to the mechanism used for
  Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between NLNOTES and NTASKLDR.
  IPC is performed via memory mapped files. When the files are
  created a NULL is passed to the ACL parameter resulting in EVERYONE
  being granted 'full-control'.

  The result of this is that an attacker can read the contents of
  any users Lotus Notes session when deployed in shared user
  environments such as Terminal Services or Citrix. The data which is
  accessible ranges from e-mail through to databases and associated
  Lotus Script.

  It should be noted that this vulnerability could also be used to
  write to the memory mapped files. The impact of which is that an
  attacker could potentially inject active content such as Lotus
  Script.


Vendor Response:

  * Fixed for the Notes client with 6.5.6, 7.0.3 and 8.0
  * Fixed for the Domino server with 6.5.5 FP3, 6.5.6, 7.0.2
    FP1, 7.0.3, 8.0
    
  The fix requires that "SharedMemoryAllowOnly=1" be set in the
  notes.ini file. Additional details about the notes.ini variable
  is available in technote #1257030
  
  http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=477&uid=swg21257030


Recommendation:

  Update to a secure version of Notes client and Domino server.
  Implement the appropriate notes.ini fix.
