Subject: CFP for HITBSecConf2008 - Dubai now open

The CFP for HITBSecConf2008 - Dubai is now open.

Our 2008 event is expected to attract over 300 attendees from around the
EMEA region and will see keynote speakers Bruce Schneier (Founder and
CTO, BT Counterpane) and Jeremiah Grossman (Founder and CTO, White Hat
Security). The event is supported and endorsed by the UAE
Telecommunications and Regulatory Authority.

Being a deep-knowledge technical conference, talks that are more
technical or that discuss new and never before seen attack methods are
of more interest than a subject that has been covered several times
before. Summaries not exceeding 250 words should be submitted (in plain
text format) to cfp@...kinthebox.org for review and possible inclusion
in the programme.

Submissions are due no later than 1st January 2008.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

# 3G/3.5G/4G Cellular Networks
# Apple / OS X vulnerabilities
# SS7/Backbone telephony networks
# Smart Card Security and Biometric Systems
# UMTS, HSDPA, GPRS and CDMA Security
# Security of Wimax, WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS and other wireless technology
# Analysis of network and security vulnerabilities

involves an advertisement for a new product or service your company is
offering, please do not submit.
