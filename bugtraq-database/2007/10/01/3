Subject: ASP Product catalog SQL injection vulnerability

ASP Product catalog SQL injection vulnerability.


A nice little SQL injection vulnerability exists within ASP Product Catalog. The application fails to check for bad input from GET'd variables used in SQL query operations. In this case, the variable [cid] can be used for SQL injection queries. Example:

http://www.example.com/Catalog/catalog.asp?cid=8%20union%20all%20select%20Password,User_ID,Password,User_ID,Password,User_ID,Password%20from%20admin#

For those unfamiliar with how I got the table names and fields, it was retireved from the mdb file included with Asp Product catalog. A few oder by's reveals 9 columns...And we grab our username and password from the list. Now, we can login to our catalog and have fun.

http://www.example.com/catalog/login.asp

Stay secure.
