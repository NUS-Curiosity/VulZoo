Subject: Immunity Debugger v1.2 Release

This release we include a flurry of new exciting features!

 We are proud to announce the first beta version of our free
Vista Heap Library, which supports the new 'Freelist' and
Low Fragmentation Chunk.  Check out the new usage of the
!heap command for more details.

 Also included in this release the new recognition library using
heuristic patterns, with a huge database of known windows static
functions. Immunity Debugger includes this library both as a
PyCommand (use !recognize) and as a function for scripting
(use searchFunctionByHeuristic).

As an example usage, imagine you want to release your own script
and set a breakpoint on a unnamed function which might move or
change slightly across different versions of the program. Using
Immunity Debugger's API you can get the heuristic out of the
function and do:

 address = imm.searchFunctionByHeuristic( heuristic)
 imm.setBreakpoint( address )

 Finally, we include our own small version of peid called
!findpacker using Ero Carrera's pefile and Bob's UserDB with
around 1300 signatures for packers, cryptors and other loaders.

 Immunity is also moving the deadline for the PyCommands contest
to the 10th of December to give you more time to use the new features.

 Thanks for using Immunity Debugger! We hope you enjoy this month's
release. You+can upgrade your current Immunity Debugger by going to
Help/Update or by directly downloading the new installer from
