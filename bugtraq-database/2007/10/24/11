Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.23.07: IBM Lotus Notes Client TagAttributeListCopy
 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

IBM Lotus Notes Client TagAttributeListCopy Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.23.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 23, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Corp.'s Lotus Notes software is an integrated desktop client option
for accessing e-mail, calendars and applications on an IBM Corp. Lotus
Domino server. More information can be found by visiting the URL below.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in IBM Corp.'s
Lotus Notes mail user agent could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the current user.

When a Lotus Notes user receives an HTML email, the HTML is converted to
a format resembling RTF (Rich Text Format). When messages are replied
to, forwarded or copied to the clipboard, the e-mail format is
converted again.

The buffer overflow is the result of a call to "Cstrcpy" when copying an
attacker supplied variable length string into a fixed-sized stack
buffer. The overflow occurs at the "Cstrcpy" call inside the
"TagAttributeListCopy" function in nnotes.dll.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the recipient of the message. In order to be successful, an attacker
must social engineer the victim into processing a specially crafted
message in a certain way. Specifically, the victim must either forward,
reply with history, or copy the message to the clipboard in order to
trigger the vulnerability.

Additionally, non-printable ASCII characters are converted to the LMBCS
(Lotus MultiByte Character Set) before the overflow occurs. This
complicates, but does not prevent, exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version 7.0.2
of IBM Corp.'s Lotus Notes. Additionally, versions 6.5.1, 6.5.3 and

be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.
