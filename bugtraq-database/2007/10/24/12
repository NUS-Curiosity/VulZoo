Synopsis
========

The Gentoo MLDonkey ebuild adds a user to the system with a valid login
shell and no password.

Background
==========

MLDonkey is a peer-to-peer filesharing client that connects to several
different peer-to-peer networks, including Overnet and BitTorrent.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-p2p/mldonkey     < 2.9.0-r3                       >= 2.9.0-r3

Description
===========

The Gentoo MLDonkey ebuild adds a user to the system named "p2p" so
that the MLDonkey service can run under a user with low privileges.
This user is created with a valid login shell and no password.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could log into a vulnerable system as the p2p user.
This would require an installed login service that permitted empty
passwords, such as SSH configured with the "PermitEmptyPasswords yes"
option, a local login console, or a telnet server.

Workaround
==========

See Resolution.

Resolution
==========

Change the p2p user's shell to disallow login. For example, as root run
the following command:

    # usermod -s /bin/false p2p

NOTE: updating to the current MLDonkey ebuild will not remove this
vulnerability, it must be fixed manually. The updated ebuild is to
prevent this problem from occurring in the future.

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
