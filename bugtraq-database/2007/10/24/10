 Overflow Vulnerability

IBM Lotus Domino IMAP Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.23.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 23, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Lotus Domino Server software provides messaging, calendaring and
scheduling capabilities on a variety of operating systems. More
information about the product is available at the following URL.

http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/domino

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability within IBM
Corp.'s Lotus Domino allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the IMAP service.

This vulnerability exists within the IMAP component of a Domino Server.
The problem specifically lies in the handling of mailbox names within
specific commands. If a user has subscribed to a mailbox with an overly
long name, certain commands will copy the user-supplied mailbox name
into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper validation.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the IMAP service. In order to conduct the attack, the attacker must
be able to establish a TCP session with the IMAP service on TCP port
143. Valid credentials are required to access the vulnerable code.

Under Windows, the privileges gained are (by default) that of the SYSTEM
user. This allows an attacker to take complete control of the
compromised system.

Although the UNIX version of the service does not run as root, it does
run as the same user as many other components of the Lotus Domino
Server. Because of this an attacker may gain access to sensitive
information or be able to maliciously subvert the system in other ways.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability within
version 7.0.2.2 of Lotus Domino running on Linux as well as Windows
Server 2003. Previous versions, as well as builds for other platforms,
are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service will
mitigate exposure to this vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM Lotus has addressed this vulnerability within versions 6.5.6 Fix
Pack 2 (FP2), 7.0.3 and 8.0 of Lotus Domino. For more information,
