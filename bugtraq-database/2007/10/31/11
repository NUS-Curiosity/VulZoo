Subject: (tool announcement) bunny the fuzzer

Hi all,

Just a quick note - I would like to announce the availability of our
general-purpose closed loop protocol-blind fuzzer for open source C code:

  http://code.google.com/p/bunny-the-fuzzer/

Bunny uses automatically generated C-level instrumentation to focus on
runtime inputs observed to trigger new control flow paths or interesting
parameter variations - and to bail out early on dead-end fuzzing routes.

This notably improves flow path coverage and overall quality of the
fuzzing process.

The tool is designed to maintain a near-native execution speed, and
requires virtually no setup, even when dealing with complex and large
codebases. This is probably a major improvement over previous closed loop
solutions.

The software should be reasonably stable, though some bugs might still
need to be ironed out. Current documentation is available here:

Cheers,
/mz
