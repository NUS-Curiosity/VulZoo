Replying to the list as well now...

Yep, sorry about that, and thanks for noticing. It appears the HTML 
version of the paper has few lines of script missing from Appendix B. 
I'll have that fixed ASAP. Meanwhile, you can use the PDF version of the 
paper (http://www.trusteer.com/docs/BIND_8_DNS_Cache_Poisoning.pdf), it 
looks OK.

Good luck, and let me know if you need further assistance,
