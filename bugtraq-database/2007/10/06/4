Subject: Re[2]: URI handling woes in Acrobat Reader, Netscape, Miranda, Skype

Dear All,

mailto:test%../../../../windows/system32/calc.exe".cmd
I would deem 1 and 3 as resonable (intented) behaviour.

>2) now do the very same thing on a system with Windows XP and IE7.
>calc.exe is executed.
Confirmed here, that's definately a Problem, and should be linked to
the Windows URI Handler. (IMHO)


The behaviour is this :
The extension determines the handler to use to shell
"../../../../windows/system32/calc.exe"

Example :
mailto:test%../../../../windows/system32/calc.exe".cmd
Usese the cmd handler to open calc (which executes)

mailto:test%../../../../windows/system32/calc.exe".txt
uses notepad and tries to open calc.

Somethings definately broken with the URI handler (imho)
