In my opinion, every application should handle incoming data as bad data. 
Its poor programming to assume that incoming data is properly formatted and 
safe to process as is, even if the data is supposed to come from a process 
you own. Why so extreme? Because the bad guys are going to figure out how to 
get bad data to your code using pathways you didn't consider. In other 
words, I agree with Geo that each of the applications should inspect the URI 
before processing it. The OS components that are involved should too, but 
the 3rd party apps should never assume that IE or whatever has done so.
