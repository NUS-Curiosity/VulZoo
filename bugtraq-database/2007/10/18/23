Synopsis
========

An integer underflow vulnerability has been reported in The Sleuth Kit
allowing for the user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Sleuth Kit is a collection of file system and media management
forensic analysis tools.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-forensics/sleuthkit       < 2.0.9                    >= 2.0.9

Description
===========

Jean-Sebastien Guay-Leroux reported an integer underflow in the
file_printf() function of the "file" utility which is bundled with The
Sleuth Kit (CVE-2007-1536, GLSA 200703-26). Note that Gentoo is not
affected by the improper fix for this vulnerability (identified as
CVE-2007-2799, see GLSA 200705-25) since version 4.20 of "file" was
never shipped with The Sleuth Kit ebuilds.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run The Sleuth Kit on a file
system containing a specially crafted file that would trigger a
heap-based buffer overflow possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running The Sleuth Kit.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All The Sleuth Kit users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-forensics/sleuthkit-2.0.9"
