Subject: Official Windows binaries of "curl" contain vulnerable zlib 1.2.2 (CAN-2005-2096)

The Windows binaries of "curl", built by the author and maintainer of
curl and available for download at <http://curl.haxx.se/download.html>
are linked with zlib 1.2.2 <http://www.zlib.net/>, which is but
vulnerable to CAN-2005-2096:

| x:\>curl -V
| curl 7.17.0 (i586-pc-mingw32msvc) libcurl/7.17.0 zlib/1.2.2
| Protocols: tftp ftp telnet dict ldap http file
| Features: Largefile NTLM SSPI libz

A scan with ClamAV against the patterns published by Florian Weimer
at <http://www.enyo.de/fw/security/zlib-fingerprint/> verifies the
presence of the patterns of the vulnerable code:

| x:\>clamscan --database CAN-2005-2096.db
| CURL.EXE: CAN-2005-2096.zlib-1.2.2 FOUND
|
| ----------- SCAN SUMMARY -----------
| Known viruses: 16
| Engine version: 0.91.2
| Scanned directories: 1
