Depends on where the link comes from. If it's a shortcut on the users 
desktop no it's not untrusted, if it's in a PDF file you received in your 
email then yes it's untrusted.

Ok I'm game, so then show me this exploit without having Acrobat on your 
system. IE7 handles mailto links in untrusted web pages. Put the mailto link 
in an untrusted html page and make it work with IE7.
