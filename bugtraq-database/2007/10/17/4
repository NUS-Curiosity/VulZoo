Subject: Oracle RDBMS TNS Data packet DoS

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle RDBMS Data packet DoS
Systems Affected: Oracle 8.1.7.4, 10g Release 2 and 1, Oracle 9
Severity: High
Vendor URL: http://www.oracle.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl@...software.com ]
Reported: 23rd June 2006
Date of Public Advisory: 17th October 2007
Advisory number: #NISR17102007D


Description
***********
The Oracle RDBMS on receiving an invalid TNS data packet will use 100% of
the CPU's time introducing a Denial of Service condition.
 
Details
*******
Once a client connects to the database process and performs protocol
negoation (TNS packet type 1) and data type represenations (packet type 2)
it may then  send packets of type 6 - Data packets. If the server gets a
packet with the 2nd bit of the Data flags is set then the server runs at
100% CPU:

"\x00\x1D" // Packet Size
"\x00\x00" // Packet Checksum
"\x06" // Packet Type [DATA]
"\x00" // Flags
"\x00\x00" // Header Checksum
"\x00\x02" // Data flags
"\x03\x3B" // TTI Version function
..
..

The snippet of a packet above sets the Data flags to 0x0002 on a version
request. This DoS condition can be triggered prior to authentication. This
can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
