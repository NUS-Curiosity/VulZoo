Subject: Oracle TNS Listener DoS and/or remote memory inspection

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle TNS Listener DoS and/or remote memory inspection
Systems Affected: Oracle 8.1.7.4, 10g Release 2 and 1, Oracle 9
Severity: High
Vendor URL: http://www.oracle.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl@...software.com ]
Reported: 22nd June 2006
Date of Public Advisory: 17th October 2007
Advisory number: #NISR17102007C


Description
***********
The TNS Listener can be crashed by an attacker causing a Denial of Service;
alternatively the attacker can use the same flaw to expose memory contents
remotely. This may reveal sensitive information.
 
Details
*******
There is a bug in GIOP service that can allow an attacker to crash the TNS
Listener and/or dump memory. A DWORD in the connect GIOP packet is trusted
as the  size of the data in the packet. By setting this to a large value
(e.g. 0x1FFFF) causes the listener to allocate this much memory then attempt
to copy this  much data to it - which eventually leads to a read access
violation because the source data is less than this number and the process
lands in uninitialized  memory. If the attacker uses a smaller number, e.g.
0xFFFF they can dump this many bytes from memory. This may reveal sensitive
information such as the TNS  Listener password.

Fix Information
