Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco PIX and ASA
Appliances

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20071017-asa

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20071017-asa.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 October 17 1600 UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Two crafted packet vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco PIX 500 Series
Security Appliance (PIX) and the Cisco 5500 Series Adaptive Security
Appliance (ASA) that may result in a reload of the device. These
vulnerabilities are triggered during processing of Media Gateway
Control Protocol (MGCP) packets, or during processing of Transport
Layer Security (TLS) traffic that terminates on the PIX or ASA security
appliance.

Note: These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a device may
be affected by one and not by the other.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20071017-asa.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The Cisco PIX and ASA security appliances are affected by a crafted MGCP
packet vulnerability if MGCP application layer protocol inspection is
enabled and the device is running certain 7.x software versions. Version
6.3.x is not affected. MGCP inspection is not enabled by default. For
specific affected versions, refer to the "Software Versions and Fixes"
section.

The PIX and ASA security appliances are also affected by a crafted TLS
packet vulnerability that affects devices running certain 7.x software
versions if the software has one or more features configured that cause
TLS sessions to terminate on the PIX or ASA security appliance. These
functions include, but are not limited to, clientless WebVPN, HTTPS
management, cut-through proxy for network access, and TLS proxy for
encrypted voice inspection. Version 6.3.x is not affected. Features that
cause TLS sessions to terminate on the PIX and ASA security appliances
are not enabled by default. For specific affected versions, please refer
to the "Software Versions and Fixes" section.

In addition to the PIX and ASA security appliances,
the crafted MGCP packet vulnerability also affects the
Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM). More information
regarding the FWSM can be found in the companion advisory
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20071017-fwsm.shtml.

To determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of Cisco PIX
or ASA software, issue the "show version" command-line interface (CLI)
command.

The following example shows a Cisco ASA Security Appliance that runs
software release 7.2(3):

    ASA# show version

    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 7.2(3)

    [...]

Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to
manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed in
the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the ASDM
window. The version notation is similar to this:

    PIX Version 7.2(3)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

With the exception of the FWSM, no other Cisco products are known to
be vulnerable to the issues described in this advisory.

Details
=======

This Security Advisory describes two distinct vulnerabilities that are
independent of each other.

1. Crafted MGCP Packet

A PIX or ASA security appliance with the Media Gateway Control Protocol
(MGCP) application layer protocol inspection feature enabled may reload
when the device processes a crafted MGCP packet. MGCP application layer
protocol inspection is not enabled by default.

MGCP messages are transmitted over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP),
which does allow the crafted MGCP messages to be sourced from a spoofed
address. Only the MGCP for gateway application (MGCP traffic on UDP port
2427) is affected.

To determine whether MGCP inspection is configured on the PIX or ASA,
log in to the device and issue the CLI command "show service-policy
| include mgcp". If the output contains the text "Inspect: mgcp" and
some statistics, then the device has a vulnerable configuration. The
following example shows a vulnerable Cisco ASA Security Appliance:

    ASA# show service-policy | include mgcp
          Inspect: mgcp, packet 15, drop 0, reset-drop 0
    ASA#

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsi90468. The
corresponding Cisco Bug ID for the FWSM, included in the companion FWSM
Security Advisory, is CSCsi00694.

2. Crafted TLS Packet

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the replacement for the Secure Socket
Layer (SSL) protocol. It is a protocol that provides, via cryptography,
secure communications between two end-points.

The PIX and ASA security appliances rely on TLS to protect the
confidentiality of communications in a variety of scenarios. In all
these scenarios, the PIX and ASA may be affected by a vulnerability in
the handling of the TLS protocol that may lead to a reload of the device
when it processes specially crafted TLS packets.

The scenarios affected by this vulnerability are clientless WebVPN
connections, HTTPS management sessions, cut-through proxy for network
access, and TLS proxy for encrypted voice inspection.

Clientless WebVPN Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clientless WebVPN connections are enabled via the "webvpn" command. For
example, the following configuration shows an ASA running 8.0 software
with clientless WebVPN configured and enabled. In this case the ASA will
listen for WebVPN connections on the default port, TCP port 443:

    http server enable
    !
    webvpn
     enable outside

Note that with this particular configuration, the device is vulnerable
to attacks coming from the outside interface.

HTTPS Management Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTTPS management sessions are enabled via the "http server enable" and
"http" commands. For example, the following configuration shows an ASA
configured for remote HTTPS management:

    http server enable
    http 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 inside

Note that with this particular configuration the device is vulnerable to
attacks coming from the *inside* interface and from the 192.168.0.0/ 24
IP sub-network.

Cut-Through Proxy for Network Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cut-through proxy feature is used to authenticate users before
they can access the network. A configuration that requires users to
authenticate before they can be granted network access looks like the
following example:

    access-list auth-proxy extended permit tcp any any eq www
    access-list auth-proxy extended permit tcp any any eq telnet
    access-list auth-proxy extended permit tcp any any eq https
    !
    aaa authentication match auth-proxy inside LOCAL
    aaa authentication secure-http-client
    aaa authentication listener https inside port https

A configuration affected by this vulnerability will contain the command
"aaa authentication secure-http-client" or "aaa authentication listener
https inside port <port number>".

Note that with the particular configuration in the preceding example,
the device is vulnerable to attacks coming from the *inside* interface.

TLS Proxy for Encrypted Voice Inspection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This feature allows the security appliance to decrypt, inspect and
modify (as needed, for example, performing NAT fixup), and re-encrypt
voice signaling traffic while all of the existing VoIP inspection
functions for Skinny and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocols are
preserved. Once voice signaling is decrypted, the plain-text signaling
message is passed to the existing inspection engines. The security
appliance accomplishes this by acting as a TLS proxy between the IP
phone and Cisco Unified CallManager, which implies that TLS sessions are
terminating on the security appliance.

To determine whether the Cisco PIX or ASA security appliance is
configured to support inspection of encrypted voice, log in to the
device and issue the CLI command "show service-policy | include tls". If
the output contains the text "tls-proxy: active" and some statistics,
then the device has a vulnerable configuration. The following example
shows a vulnerable Cisco ASA Security Appliance:

    ASA# show service-policy | include tls
          Inspect: sip tls-proxy myproxy, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0
                   tls-proxy: active sess 0, most sess 0, byte 0
          Inspect: skinny tls-proxy myproxy, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0
                   tls-proxy: active sess 0, most sess 0, byte 0
    ASA#

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCsg43276 and
CSCsh97120. This vulnerability does not affect the FWSM.

Workarounds
===========

General Considerations
+---------------------

Filters that deny TLS packets using TCP port 443 and MGCP packets on UDP
port 2427 should be deployed throughout the network as part of a transit
ACL (tACL) policy for protection of traffic which enters the network at
ingress access points. This policy should be configured to protect the
network device where the filter is applied and other devices behind it.
Filters for TLS packets using TCP port 443 and MGCP packets on UDP port
2427 should also be deployed in front of vulnerable network devices so
that traffic is only allowed from trusted clients.

Additional information about tACLs is available in "Transit Access
Control Lists : Filtering at Your Edge":

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml.

Additional mitigations techniques that can be deployed on Cisco devices
within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence
companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20071017-asafwsm.shtml.

1. Crafted MGCP Packet

There is no workaround for this vulnerability other than disabling MGCP
application layer protocol inspection on the device.

Leveraging anti-spoofing techniques will help mitigate spoofed packets
from triggering this vulnerability.

Limiting MGCP application layer inspection to traffic between MGCP
gateways may help to mitigate this vulnerability since it would require
an attacker to have additional information (the addresses of the MGCP
gateways) to launch a successful attack. To limit MGCP application layer
inspection to traffic between certain devices, a class map that matches
only traffic between the gateways must be created. Then, MGCP inspection
must be performed on traffic in that class. The following example shows
how to accomplish this:

    ASA(config)# access-list mgcp_traffic permit udp host 192.168.0.1
        host 172.16.0.1 eq 2427
    ASA(config)# access-list mgcp_traffic permit udp host 172.16.0.1
        host 192.168.0.1 eq 2427
    ASA(config)# class-map MGCP
    ASA(config-cmap)# match access-list mgcp_traffic
    ASA(config-cmap)# exit
    ASA(config)# policy-map global_policy
    ASA(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
    ASA(config-pmap-c)# no inspect mgcp
    ASA(config-pmap-c)# exit
    ASA(config-pmap)# class MGCP
    ASA(config-pmap-c)# inspect mgcp
    ASA(config-pmap-c)# exit
    ASA(config-pmap)# exit
    ASA(config)#

Note that MGCP inspection is applied only to UDP traffic between hosts
192.168.0.1 and 172.16.0.1

See the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for additional
mitigation possibilities.

2. Crafted TLS Packet

ASDM is used to manage the Cisco PIX or ASA security appliance. Access
to ASDM should be allowed only on trusted interfaces and only from
authorized hosts. Restricting ASDM access to trusted hosts limits the
ability of an attacker to conduct these attacks.

For example, to limit ASDM access to a single host on the inside
interface with an address of 192.168.1.2, enter the following command:

    hostname(config)# http 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.255 inside

Additional information is available at:

Cisco Security Appliance Command Line Configuration Guide, Version 7.2
(http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa72/configuration/guide/mgaccess.html#wp1047288)

There are no workarounds if the clientless WebVPN, cut-through proxy for
network access, and TLS proxy for encrypted voice inspection features
are in use.
