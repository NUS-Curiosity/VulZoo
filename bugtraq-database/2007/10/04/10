Subject: Re: iDefense Security Advisory 10.02.07: Sun Microsystems Solaris FIFO FS Information Disclosure Vulnerability

Dear iDefense Labs,

Can  you  please  clarify this issue? According to subject it looks like
information  leak  (information  disclosure)  issue,  while according to
description, it looks more like memory leak (Denial of Service) issue.
