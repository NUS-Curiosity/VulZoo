I am still unable to replicate.  It launches FireFox (2.0.0.7) for me
on my system and yeilds the error page "Firefox can't find the server
at %xx..."

If I replace the "%xx" with a null byte (inspired by the recent
protocol handler problems in FF), then it still doesn't work, as per
the mIRC string: http: $+ $chr(0) $+
../../../../../../../../../../../windows/system32/calc.exe"

So far, with various permutations of protocol handlers and odd
characters, I can't reproduce this.
