 (CAN-2005-2096)

As a workaround, one could try to manually replace zlib32.dll in a Windows GSView 4.8 installation with the current zlib1.dll version 1.2.3.

"Applications linking statically with or using their own copy of zlib 1.1.3 or earlier must be recompiled to avoid the security problem described here. Otherwise it is sufficient to upgrade the shared zlib library then restart all applications using it."[1]
