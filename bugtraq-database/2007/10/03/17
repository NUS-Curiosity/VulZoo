Subject: Re: 0day: mIRC pwns Windows

is this a mirc bug or a mail client bug?

on systems with thunderbird installed, this opens a new mail window to %xx...
on systems with outlook/outlook express, this opens calc.exe
(both using mirc 6.3)

similar behavior as clicking start -> run and pasting the URI

regardless, unless you can pass arbitrary arguements or pass data on
to a server, i don't think you're going to find many already existing
executables on the user's system to do malicious tasks with this "mirc
bug". various tests can't even get notepad to open a simple txt file.
you can't even run shutdown.exe without specifying some arguments.

research kills frivolous 0day announcements.
