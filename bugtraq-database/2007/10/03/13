hi,
I tried to generate query ids by using the perl script provided by you in the "Appendix B ï¿½ Attack script for NSID_SHUFFLE_ONLY algorithm" 
found on the following webpage. But I see some syntax errors in the code. It would be very helpful if I Can get a copy of working script from you. http://www.trusteer.com/docs/bind8dns.html#chapter_31
