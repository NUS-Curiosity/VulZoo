I think it may be clearer to everyone if you release some kind of paper
describing (and including) the shellcodes. Also a fully commented
lpd-cisco-remote-shell exploit would help since it would *demonstrate* the
whole exploitation process :-) No offense, videos are nice but at last they
are pure marketing, they *demonstrate* nothing.
