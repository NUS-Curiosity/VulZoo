Subject: RE: [Full-disclosure] Remote Desktop Command Fixation Attacks

Defence in depth is in question? After more than 20 years in compsec,
the fallacy of the argument that defence in depth is dead is ironic.
D.I.D. means that if defence A fails, B comes in. If B fails C comes in
then D. etc. Though pdp is a very inventive youngster, it takes a few
grey hairs to master security.

Or perhaps we in the 'old scool' are deluded.
