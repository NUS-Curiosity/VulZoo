OpenSSL Security Advisory [12-Oct-2007]

OpenSSL Vulnerabilities
- -----------------------

Vulnerability A
- ---------------

Andy Polyakov discovered a flaw in OpenSSL's DTLS implementation which
could lead to the compromise of clients and servers with DTLS enabled.

DTLS is a datagram variant of TLS specified in RFC 4347 first
supported in OpenSSL version 0.9.8. Note that the vulnerabilities do
not affect SSL and TLS so only clients and servers explicitly using
DTLS are affected.

We believe this flaw will permit remote code execution.

This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2007-4995.

Versions Affected
- -----------------

All releases of 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8f.

Recommendation
- --------------

Either

a) Upgrade to the latest version of OpenSSL (0.9.8f) and rebuild all
packages using OpenSSL for DTLS.

or,

b) Disable DTLS.

Vulnerability B
- ---------------

Moritz Jodeit found an off-by-one error in SSL_get_shared_ciphers(), a
function that should normally only be used for logging or debugging.

The impact of this overflow is unclear.

This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2007-5135.

Versions Affected
- -----------------

All releases of 0.9.8 prior to 0.9.8f. All releases of 0.9.7 prior to
0.9.7m.

(Note that versions prior to 0.9.8d and 0.9.7l actually had a worse
problem in the same function).

Recommendation
- --------------

a) Don't use SSL_get_shared_ciphers().

OR

b) Upgrade to 0.9.8f.
