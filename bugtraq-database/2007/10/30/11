Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.30.07: IBM AIX 5.2 crontab BSS Buffer
 Overflow Vulnerability

IBM AIX 5.2 crontab BSS Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.30.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 30, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

The crontab program is a user utility that enables users to create,
remove, and edit cron jobs. The cron jobs will then later be executed,
on behalf of the user, at the specified time. Under AIX, the crontab
program is installed by default and is set-uid root. More information
can be found at the URL shown.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the crontab
program of IBM Corp.'s AIX 5.2 operating system allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

The problem specifically exists within the main function. While
processing command line arguments, the crontab program will copy a
user-supplied argument to a fixed size BSS (data segment) buffer. Since
no bounds checking is performed, it's possible to overwrite a large
portion of the data stored in the BSS memory area.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges. Local access is required to execute the crontab program.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability within AIX
version 5.2. Previous versions are suspected to be vulnerable. AIX 5.3
does not appear to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Removing the set-uid bit from the crontab program will protect against
exploitation. However, doing so will render the program unusable.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM Corp. has addressed this vulnerability by releasing interim fixes.
