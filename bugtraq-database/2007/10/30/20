With great sadness, I regret to inform you that Itojun
will not be presenting his great knowledge of IPv6 at
PacSec.  I have been informed by several sources
that he passed away yesterday. 

Funeral services will be held on Nov 7th at Rinkai-Saijo
in Tokyo. There aren't many details of his passing,
so please let his family and relatives mourn in peace 
for now.  My heartfelt condolances go out to them,
and all of his many friends.

I knew Itojun as one of the smartest and kindest people
I have ever met. He helped everyone around him. He
graciously hosted and assisted many foreigners new
to Japan at the PacSec conferences, and was a good
friend to all. He would go to extraordinary lengths to
help anyone around him. We will all miss him - and 
his work on IPv6 will continue to help us for a long 
time..

He once said to me, "When a professional race car
driver races, his pulse gets lower and he relaxes.
When I code it is the same thing." I'll miss him
driving around in his prized Fiat 500... and I hope
we can all proceed to help fix our V6 networks 
without his gentle and insistent coaching.

We will announce a replacement talk shortly.

If you knew or respected him, he would have
wanted any energy you put towards grief to 
be spent on speeding the adoption and the
robustness of the version 6 internet which
he devoted so much of his extraordinary 
life to.

May he rest in peace,
