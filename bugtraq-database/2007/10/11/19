Subject: Black Hat Tokyo + DC and Europe CfPs now open.

We've finalized the speaker lineup for Black Hat Japan 2007, and we're looking forward to a great show.  Attendees will be treated to a roster with more variety and depth than ever.  
The schedule and speaker bios are available on-line at:

As always, we've worked hard to create a show with timely, technical content and a broad range of topics.  Some highlights of this year's program include:

* A talk from Pedram Amini and Aaron Portnoy from Tipping Point about the Sulley fuzzing framework - a game changing, free, highly automated fuzzing suite.
* A talk from Halvar Flake, world-class reverse engineer and one of Black Hat's most sought-after speakers entitled "Automated Unpacking and Malware Classification."
* Brandon Baker of Microsoft will be speaking on the very timely topic of the security model of Windows Server Virtualization in Windows Server 2008.

Please bear in mind that on-line registration closes October 15, and it is a good idea to sign up now to avoid waiting in the long on site registration lines.
The Briefings  will once again be held in the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo, on Thursday, October 25 and Friday, October 26.  On site registration begins at 09:00 both days.
