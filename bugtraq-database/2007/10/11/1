Vulnerability Details
=========================
=========================



1. CA Erwin Datatype Standards File Denial of
   Service Vulnerability
   ============================================

The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of
certain abnormal conditions. The successful exploitation
leads to CA Erwin's denial of service conditions.




2. G DATA Antivirus ScanObjectBrowser.dll
   Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
   ==============================================

The buffer overflow in ScanObjectBrowser.DLL ActiveX
control (in function SelectPath) might lead to machine
compromise. The vulnerability is not however exploitable
via a web browser as the control is not marked safe for
scripting.




3. CA eTrust ITM r8.1 Web Console Script Redirection
   Vulnerability
   ==================================================

Computer Associates eTrust ITM (Threat Manager) is prone to
remote script redirection. By enticing the unaware victim to
open a specially crafted link (http://localhost:6689/...), an
attacker might lead the victim to a different web site. Such
issues might be used in phishing attacks as the victim does not
suspect such script's behavior.




4. VMware Virtual Disk Mount Service Local Denial of
   Service Vulnerability
   =================================================

Vmware-provided library Reconfig.DLL (function ConnectPopulatedDiskEx)
is prone to local denial of service vulnerability. The vulnerability
might be used by malware to cause denial of service conditions of
Vmware's Virtual Disk Mount Service (vmount2.exe). The control is not
marked safe for scripting, thus remote exploitation via a web browser
is not possible.




5.CA eTrust ITM r8.1 Web Console Sensitive Information
  Disclosure
  ====================================================

Computer Associates eTrust ITM (Threat Manager) is prone to
remote sensitive information disclosure. Sensitive information
is stored within log files (we can easily deduct the file names),
remote exploitation is possible. The attacker gains information
about the user logging history, user names and various directories.
It might be possible that other imporant information might be stored
in the log file but this has not been confirmed yet.
