the title is misleading at best. Defense in Depth has nothing to do
with security software. To the contrary. The paradigm describes an
approach where you assume that invidual (even multiple) elements of your
defense fall, in the worst possible way (which could be code
execution). What you are describing is people adding security software
_instead_ of applying a thorough defense in depth design.

Your presentation title suggests that one of the very few paradigms
that actually promises long term security benefits does not work.
Wrong. I suggest you find a better title.
