Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON chapter Christmas Party - 11th December

hi all,

you are cordially invited to the final DC4420 meet of 2007, which will 
be held on Tuesday the 11th December, at the usual location - Charing 
Cross Sports Club, Charing Cross Hospital:

we have the bar to ourselves and there will be no particular agenda 
other than drinking the place dry, eating good food and socialising, but 
we will definitely also be celebrating Alien's continued presence on our 
home planet after his near miss with the man in the black cloak!

all are welcome... "fight club" speaking rules are suspended for the 
evening, so bring a friend or two and make this a party to remember!

cheers,
MM
