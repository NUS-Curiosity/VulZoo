[HSC] McAfee SecurityCenter Privacy Service HTML Execution Vulnerability


McAfee provides a proactive PC and Internet security service that helps you avoid 
online attacks and protects what you value from hackers, identity thieves and other 
online criminals. 

A HTML execution vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute HTML scripts on 
the system under the context of the user. These scripts can perform any action that the 
user would. The flaw lies in the processing of filtering that is saved after exiting.
