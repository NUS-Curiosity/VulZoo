Subject: [WhitePaper (SecNiche)] Information Prone LDAP Garbage Dumps

Hi

The LDAP garbage dump that remains on web server results in information 
disclosure. Security
of LDAP may be compromised, if for instance a search engine crawls 
through untamed directories
on the web server and finds information through the ldap.xml file. This 
type of harvesting attack is
also termed “static information leveraging attack.” This article 
provides methods for dealing with
this type of attack and clarifying how to secure LDAP
