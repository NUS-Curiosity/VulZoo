   Advisory  ID:  SYMSA-2007-014
 Advisory Title:  SQL Injection Vulnerability in Beehive Forum
                  Software
         Author:  Nick Bennett
                  Robert Brown / robert_brown@...antec.com
   Release Date:  28-11-2007
    Application:  Beehive Forum 0.7.1 (earlier versions also
                  vulnerable)
       Platform:  All supported
       Severity:  Remotely exploitable / Information Disclosure
  Vendor status:  Updated Application Versions Available
     CVE Number:  CVE-2007-6014
      Reference:  http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26492


Overview:

  Beehive Forum is an open source web based forum application
  written in PHP.  A vulnerability exists in the Beehive Forum
  software that could allow a remote user to execute SQL injection
  attacks. These attacks could compromise sensitive data including
  usernames and passwords for the Beehive application. Arbitrary
  data from other applications hosted on the same server could also
  be compromised, depending on the configuration of MySQL.


Details:

  This vulnerability exists because of a failure in the application
  to properly sanitize user input for the variable "t_dedupe". This
  variable is accepted as input in the page "post.php". The value of
  this variable is then included in an SQL statement which is
  executed with the PHP function "@mysql_query". This function is
  specifically designed to mitigate the effects of an SQL injection
  attack by not allowing multiple SQL statements in one call.
  However, it is  still possible to manipluate the SQL statement
  through the "t_dedupe" variable to obtain arbitrary data from
  the database.


Vendor Response:

  There is a security vulnerability in Beehive Forum that could
  allow for user logon and password MD5 hash disclosure.

  This vulnerability has been fixed in the latest release of the
  product, Beehive Forum 0.8. It is recommend all users immediately
  obtain the newest version of Beehive Forum to protect against
  this threat.

  Project Beehive Forum is available for download from the project
  website at http://www.beehiveforum.net/

  If there are any further questions about this statement, please
  contact a member of the development team.


Recommendation:

  It is recommend all users immediately obtain the newest version of
  Beehive Forum to protect against this threat.  Project Beehive
  Forum is available for download from the project website at
  http://www.beehiveforum.net/.
