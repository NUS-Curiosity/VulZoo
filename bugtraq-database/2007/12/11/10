Hey BugTraq readers, Happy Holidays from Black Hat! Before the silly season
enters full swing I'd like to make a couple announcements:

BRIEFINGS AND TRAININGS
http://www.blackhat.com/
Black Hat is proud to be holding Trainings and Briefings in Washington D.C.,
Amsterdam, Las Vegas, Japan, and a mystery location in 2008. Please mark
your calendars!

NEW: An enhancement to all Black Hat Briefings allows all attendees greater
access to each presenter. Immediately following each session the presenters
are available for an additional hour to take questions in a break out room.

attendees interested in the same topics you are.
