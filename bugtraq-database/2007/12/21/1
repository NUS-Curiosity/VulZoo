1st CALL FOR PAPERS. - CISIS'08

International Workshop on
Computational Intelligence in Security for Information Systems (CISIS'08)

http://www.cisis2008.org

Genova(Italy)
Jolly Hotel Marina, Porto Antico

October 23-24th, 2008


Organized by:

SEA Lab (http://www.sealab.dibe.unige.it/),University of Genoa, Italy

GICAP (http://www.ubu.es/investig/grupos/ing_const/lsi-1/index_eng.html),
University of Burgos, Spain


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CISIS aims to offer a meeting opportunity for academic and
industry-related researchers belonging to the various, vast communities
of Computational Intelligence, Information Security, Data Mining, and
Biometry.
The need for intelligent, flexible behavior by large, complex systems,
especially in mission-critical domains, is intended to be the catalyst
and the aggregation stimulus for the overall event. CISIS´08 provides an
interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical
advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research
field.


We invite contributed paper for CISIS'08. Prospective authors are invited
to submit their manuscripts before March 14, 2008.
Accepted papers will be included in CISIS'08 Proceedings to be published
by Springer in the prestigious Advances in Soft Computing Serie.


*** JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE ***

The selected best papers will be published in a special issue of
Journal of Information Assurance and Security (JIAS)
http://www.softcomputing.net/jias/
