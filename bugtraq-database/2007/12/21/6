In addition, it is reported that breached SSL sessions have been traced
back to IP resources located in the North Pole and controlled by one
"Kr1S Kr1gL3" who has apparently privately purchased access rights to
all Hushmail data in an effort to determine which users have been
"naughty" and which have been "nice." 

Coincidence?  I don't think so.
