Subject: RE: Cryptome: NSA has real-time access to Hushmail servers

If you insist on sending these, can you at least save them for the first calendar day in April or perhaps include a smiley or two?  These claims rely solely on loosely-associated data (not "facts") and present little more than a basic unicorn argument; the basis for any "good" conspiracy theory.

Thx,
Jim

Subject: Cryptome: NSA has real-time access to Hushmail servers

A frequent source 'A' sending updated NSA-Affiliated IP resources to Cryptome's Web site has reported the following new information:

"Certain privacy/full session SSL email hosting services have been purchased/changed operational control by NSA and affiliates within the past few months, through private intermediary entities."

Reportedly the following services are controlled:

Hushmail / Canada (http://www.hushmail.com/ ),
Guardster / USA (http://www.guardster.com/ ), and
SAFe-mail.net / Israel (http://www.safe-mail.net/ )
