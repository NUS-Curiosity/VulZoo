Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

However, above statement is not correct. Both the sing packages in
Debian oldstable (Sarge) and Debian stable (Etch) do not provide a setuid
root binary by default. The override status is handled by debconf and
defaults to no:

|  For 'sing' to work for non-root users, it needs to be suid.
