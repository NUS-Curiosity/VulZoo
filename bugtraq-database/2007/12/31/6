Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Opera, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code and cross domain scripting.

Background
==========

Opera is a fast Web browser that is available free of charge.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.25                             >= 9.25

Description
===========

David Bloom reported two vulnerabilities where plug-ins (CVE-2007-6520)
and Rich text editing (CVE-2007-6522) could be used to allow cross
domain scripting. Alexander Klink (Cynops GmbH) discovered an issue
with TLS certificates (CVE-2007-6521). Gynvael Coldwind reported that
bitmaps might reveal random data from memory (CVE-2007-6524).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilites, possibly leading
to the execution of arbitrary code and cross domain scripting.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.25"
