In the meantime an updated version 4.9 of GSView is available from
<http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/> that fixes CAN-2005-2096 (zlib)
as well as CAN-2005-0953 and CAN-2005-0758 (libbz2).

The latter had been disclosed to the author/maintainer only until now.

The zlib32.dll distributed in the installation is now the "official"
zlib1.dll from zlib.net; due to a lack of an "official" libbz2.dll this
one is provided by the maintainer.
