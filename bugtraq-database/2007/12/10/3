Subject: Call for Papers - Security and High Performance Computing System 2008

                 Call For Papers
  The 2008 Workshop on Security and High Performance Computing Systems
           (http://www.diiga.univpm.it/~spalazzi/nicosia/)

             As part of The 2008 International Conference
           High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS�08)
                        and in conjunction with
  The 22nd European Conference on Modelling and Simulation (ECMS 2008)

                         Nicosia, Cyprus
                         June 3 - 6, 2008

              (Submission Deadline: February 21, 2008)

Brief Description:
------------------
Providing high  performance  computing and security is a challenging
task.  Internet,  operating  systems  and  distributed  environments
currently suffer from poor security support and cannot resist common
attacks.  Adding security measures typically degrade performance.
This  workshop  addresses  relationships  between  security and high
performance systems in three directions.  First, it considers how to
add security properties (authentication, confidentiality, integrity,
non-repudiation, access control) to high performance computing systems. 
In this case, safety properties can also be addressed, such as
availability and fault tolerance for high performance computing systems. 
Second, it covers how to use high performance computing systems to solve
security problems.  For instance, a grid computation can break an
encryption code, or a cluster can support high performance intrusion
detection.  More generally, this topic addresses every efficient use of a
high performance computing system to improve security.  Third, it
investigates the tradeoffs between maintaining high performance and
achieving security in computing systems and solutions to balance the two
objectives.  In all these directions, various performance analyses or
monitoring techniques can be conducted to show the efficiency of a
security infrastructure.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting
novel research on all  theoretical and practical aspects of computer
and  network  security,  as well as  case studies and implementation
experiences.   Papers  should  have  practical  relevance  to  the
construction, evaluation, application, or operation of secure systems.

This workshop covers (but is not limited to) the following topics:

Access Control
Accounting and Audit
Anonymity
Applied Cryptography
Authentication
Commercial and Industry Security
Cryptographic Protocols
Data and Application Security
Data/System Integrity
Database Security
Digital Rights Management
Formal Verification of Secure Systems
Identity Management
Inference/Controlled Disclosure
Information Warfare
Intellectual Property Protection
Intrusion and Attack Detection
Intrusion and Attack Response
Key Management
Privacy-Enhancing Technology
Secure Networking
Secure System Design
Security Management
Security for Mobile Code
Security for Specific Domains (e.g., E-Government, E-Business, P2P)
Security in IT Outsourcing
Security in Mobile and Wireless Networks
Security in Operating Systems
Security Location Services
Security of Grid and Cluster Architectures
Smartcards
Trust Management Policies
Trust Models


Paper Submissions:
------------------
Submitted  papers  must  not  have been published or simultaneously
submitted elsewhere.  Submission  should  include a cover page with
authors' names, affiliation addresses,  fax numbers, phone numbers,
and email addresses.  Please,  indicate  clearly  the corresponding
author  and  include up to 6 keywords  from  the  above list and an
abstract of no more than 350 words.   The full manuscript should be
at most 7 pages using the two-column IEEE format.  Additional pages
will be charged additional fee.  Please include page numbers on all
submissions  to  make  it  easier  for reviewers to provide helpful
comments.  All submissions should be appropriately anonymized (i.e.,
papers  should  not  contain  author names, affiliations, or obvious
citations).  Please, submit a PDF copy of your full manuscript using
the conference web site submission link at:

   http://www.diiga.univpm.it/~spalazzi/nicosia/submission/ .

Only PDF files will be accepted.  Each paper will receive a minimum
of three reviews.   Authors  of  accepted papers must guarantee that
their papers will be presented at the workshop.  Accepted papers will
be  published  by  ECMS  in the conference proceedings which will be
available at the time of the meeting.

If you have any questions about paper submission or the workshop,
please contact the organizers.
