 [HSC] Bitweaver XSS & SQL Injection Vulnerability


Bitweaver is an open source content management system. Its speed and
power are ideal for large-scale community websites and corporate applications,
but it is simple enough for non-technical small site users to set up and
administrate. It comes fully featured on install but is easy to extend.

Persistent XSS:

If comments are allowed, attackers can use this url /wiki/index.php?page_id=1#editcomments
to POST evil scripts and PHP code into the page. Sanitizing the input will prevent intrusion.

Also we see that on forums there is the same issue: (NEED TO SANITIZE THE INPUT)

/forums/index.php?t=1&post_comment_reply_id=1&post_comment_request=1#editcomments
