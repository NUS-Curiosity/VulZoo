Description:
    Previous versions of the rsync package contain two vulnerabilities
    in the rsync server which can allow users to bypass security
    restrictions under certain specific configurations.  As these
    vulnerabilities are only exposed when running the rsync server,
    default configurations are not vulnerable.
