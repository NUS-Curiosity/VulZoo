.vuln/
There isn't any kind of file extentions check in: "uu_file_upload.js" and  "uber_uploader_file.js".

.extentions/
you can submit files with extensions like: .html, .txt, .asp, etc...
you can upload all extensions, except: sh, php, php3,php4, php5, py, shtml, phtml, cgi, pl, plx, htaccess, htpasswd.

.PoC/
http://www.localhost/uu_file_upload.php
http://www.localhost/uber_uploader_file.php

.deface/
Once the file is uploaded you can see it in /uploads/
http://www.localhost/uploads/[YourFile]

.fixed/
To fix it, you have to modify "Check for illegal file extentions" and "Check for legal file extentions" in the file "uu_file_upload.js" or "uber_uploader_file.js".
It doesn't go on if its diferent to the allowed extensions.

[code]

// Check for illegal file extentions

function checkAllowFileExtensions(){
	if(!check_allow_extensions){ return true; }
else{
alert('Sorry, uploading a file with the extension "' + file_extension + '" is not allowed.');
return true;
}
}

// Check for legal file extentions

function checkAllowFileExtensions(){
	if(!check_allow_extensions){ return false; }
else{
alert('Sorry, uploading a file with the extension "' + file_extension + '" is not allowed.');
return true;
}
}

[/code]

.dork/
