Dear Mr. Naujoks,

thanks for the feedback.

Considering that the MetaData not protected by the signature contains
among others:
1.) Author
2.) Dates of creation and last change
3.) State Information
I do think that most people, certainly the users, would feel that this
data belongs to the "document", and would be protected when the
"document" is signed.

Considering that the signature creation time is stored and protected by
the digital signature might help against modified creation times (and
mitigate 2). But applications must consider this, and at least in MS
Word the signature creation time is not displayed next to the other
metadata, but (at least) next to the signature properties.

I think that there are other ways of adding additional MetaData, from
the signer's point of view these are third-party MetaData. And, yes  I
think that any data (including MetaData) set by the author should be
protected by the author's digital signature:
1) Store it in an additional file inside the OOXML ZIP container
2) Apply a suitable transformation during the signature creation to
protect user defined Meta-data entries, then what ever the user did not
fill in before signing is not protected, but here we have a problem
communicating this via GUI to the user.
3) probably several other ways ...

Looking at the GUI[1], unsigned MetaData is displayed above the
document, and next to the document it displays the statement of
a valid signature.
How a user would distinguish digitally signed data (Document-Content and
formatting) from unsigned data (MetaData)?
Or to use your example: What is the envelope and what is the inside?

One big problem I see is that the user is left alone answering this
question, and I have my doubts that a user would even ask
herself/himself this question in the first place.
