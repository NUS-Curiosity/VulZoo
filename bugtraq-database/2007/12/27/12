It's true, I don't know the coolplayer but I see and it's the same software, so I searched any change in the virtual machine and I saw this: 

C:\Archivos de programa\OneStepSearch

If a person downloaded and executed this software you have to erase this, now I'm seeing the malware but it's seems that it isn't any danger.

Sorry, I download a lot of software for fuzz and I don't review this details.

Thanks Luigi ;)

PD:Sorry for my english jeje
