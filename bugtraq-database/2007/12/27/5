BACKGROUND

HP Compaq business notebook PCs and HP Pavilion and Compaq Presario consumer notebook PCs ship with Quick Launch Button (QLB) software preinstalled. Quick Launch Buttons enable and control features such as Function (Fn) shortcut keys and dedicated program buttons (i.e. Presentation Mode and HP Info buttons) that vary by model. The Quick Launch Button software package also includes the HP Info Center application that enables quick access to pertinent system information on HP Compaq business notebook PC models.

RESOLUTION
HP has provided the following software patches to resolve this vulnerability.

HP Pavilion and Compaq Presario consumer notebook PCs
 HP SoftPaq SP38166
 
- ->HP Compaq nc, nx, nw and tc Series business notebook PC models (for example, nc6230, nw8440)
- ->HP 500, 510, 520 and 530 business notebook PC models
 HP SoftPaq SP38181
 
- -> HP Compaq business notebook PC model numbers ending in the letter b, p, s or w (for example, 6515b, 6910p, 8510w)
 HP SoftPaq SP38171

HP SoftPaq SP38166 , HP SoftPaq SP38166, and HP SoftPaq SP38171 are available for download using the following procedure.

1. Open a web browser and visit http://www.hp.com 
2. In the Search field, type the applicable SoftPaq number form the list above (SP38166, SP38181, or SP38171). Start the search. 
3. Select an item from the search results. 
4. Select Installation Instructions for further information. 

Note: Removing or un-installing Quick Launch Button software does not eliminate the vulnerability. HP suggests that all HP notebook PCs have the applicable security patch promptly applied. 

- ->Note (for SP38166 only): Installing SP38166 will cause a known script error when launching HP Info Center. After installing the security patch, do not install any version of Quick Launch Button software except v6.4 or later (to be available at a future date). This Security Bulletin will be revised when Quick Launch Button software v6.4 is available. If the security patch is installed and Quick Launch Button software v6.3 or earlier is subsequently installed, the notebook PC will again become vulnerable to this concern and the security patch should be re-installed. Other HP Quick Launch Buttons and features are not affected by the installation of this security patch and should continue to function as designed.
