Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco UCS Director Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20170215-ucs

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2017 February 15 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary workflow items with just an end-user profile.

The vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) after the Developer Menu is enabled in Cisco UCS Director. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by enabling Developer Mode for their user profile with an end-user profile and then adding new catalogs with arbitrary workflow items to the profile. An exploit could allow attackers to perform any actions defined by these workflow items, including actions affecting other tenants.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
