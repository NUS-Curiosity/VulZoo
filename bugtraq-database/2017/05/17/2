Introduction:
-------------
With PingID MFA, you can easily control when your users need to authenticate with a
second factor. You can configure your policies based upon the following:
    Group - Require MFA for members of a specific group.
    Application - Require MFA for specific applications.
    Geofence - Require MFA if the user is outside a pre-set geofence.
    Rooted or Jailbroken device - Require MFA if the user's device is rooted or jailbroken.
    Network IP - Require MFA if the device isn't in a specific IP range.
PingID MFA delivers the granular security that your policies require with the ease
of use your users want. [1]

Compass Security discovered a web application security flaw in PingID's authentication
process, which allows an attacker to manipulate the resulting website. This allows,
for instance, attacking the user's browser or redirecting the user to a phishing website.


Technical Description
---------------------
During the authentication process, a message parameter is used, which can
be manipulated. If this parameter contains JavaScript code, it is executed
in the user's browser. Exploiting the vulnerability will lead to so-called
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the execution of JavaScript in the
context of the victim.

Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
The vendor has addressed the vulnerability. In general, this issue can be fixed by
properly encoding all output, which is posted back to the user.
For instance, using HTML encoding, to convert < to &lt; and > to &gt;.
