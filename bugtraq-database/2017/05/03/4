Package        : tomcat8
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-5647 CVE-2017-5648
Debian Bug     : 860068 860069

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in tomcat8, a servlet and JSP
engine.

CVE-2017-5647

  Pipelined requests were processed incorrectly, which could result in
  some responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request.

CVE-2017-5648

  Some application listeners calls were issued against the wrong
  objects, allowing untrusted applications running under a
  SecurityManager to bypass that protection mechanism and access or
  modify information associated with other web applications.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.0.14-1+deb8u9.

For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 8.5.11-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.
