Technical Details & Description:
================================
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Super File Explorer v1.0.1 iOS mobile application. 
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files to compromise for example the file system of a service.

The vulnerability is located in the developer path that is accessable and hidden within next to the root path.
Remote attackers are able to upload malicious files like webshells to the developer path to access within a next 
step the `/etc/passwd` file of the ftp service. Thus allows the attacker to gain finally access to the root access 
credentials of the ftp application to compromise the service or mobile device. The permission rights within the 
developer path allows an attacker to gain access to the passwd files and other sensitive data. 

By default there is no password setup for the ftp or web ui account. Attackers can for example access the ftp via console 
to upload a local file to the developer path. After that the attacker can remotly access the at same time activated ftp 
web ui service to execute the file. Then the attacker downloads the passwd file and can login with the ftp root credentials 
to the service.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as high with a common vulnerability scoring system count of 7.0. 
Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires a low privilege ftp application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability results in application or device compromise.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The arbitrary file upload web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privilege application 
user account or user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided 
information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1.  Install the vulnerable mobile ios application to your test idevice (iphone)
2.  Start the mobile device software
3.  Start the ftp and web-server via remote manager button push
4.  Open the ftp via console and login as random user with any credentials
5.  Move to the developer path in the upper folder
6.  Upload of a remote system or the local system path via network a webshell
7.  Open ftp web ui url (http://localhost) and move to the developer path
8.  Open the webshell and request via GET the "/etc/passwd" file that is accessable
9.  Login again to the ftp server using the root:smx7MYTQIi2M
10. Successful root access to compromise the ftp server and mobile via arbitrary file upload vulnerability!

Note: Now, open the web interface and surf on the ftp web ui to the webshell in the developer path 
which owns user executable rights in the root path. Open the download module and insert the following 
value "get /etc/passwd". The passwd file is tranfered with the following accounts ...

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be resolved by a change of the root credentials, in combination with the setup of secure access permission 
rights for the web ui in the developer path. Disallow to use /../ to request the static root path as developer without permission.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the mobile ftp application is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.0)
