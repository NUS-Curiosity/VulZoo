Package        : strongswan
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-9022 CVE-2017-9023

Two denial of service vulnerabilities were identified in strongSwan, an
IKE/IPsec suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.

CVE-2017-9022

    RSA public keys passed to the gmp plugin aren't validated sufficiently
    before attempting signature verification, so that invalid input might
    lead to a floating point exception and crash of the process.
    A certificate with an appropriately prepared public key sent by a peer
    could be used for a denial-of-service attack.

CVE-2017-9023

    ASN.1 CHOICE types are not correctly handled by the ASN.1 parser when
    parsing X.509 certificates with extensions that use such types. This could
    lead to infinite looping of the thread parsing a specifically crafted
    certificate.

A fix for a build failure was additionally included in the 5.2.1-6+deb8u4
revision of the strongSwan package.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.1-6+deb8u3.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 5.5.1-4

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
