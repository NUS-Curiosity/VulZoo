RESOLUTION

HPE Aruba has provided hotfixes for ClearPass 6.6.5, 6.6.4, and 6.5.7. Use
one of the following methods to install the appropriate hotfix:

Install the Hotfix Online Using the Software Updates Portal:
 
   1. Open ClearPass Policy Manager and go to Administration - Agents and
Software
   Updates - Software Updates.  
   
   2. In the Firmware and Patch Updates area, find the "ClearPass 6.5.7
Hotfix
   Patch for CVE-2017-5638" or "ClearPass 6.6.4 Hotfix Patch for
CVE-2017-5638"
   patch and click the Download button in its row. 
    
   3. Click Install.  
   
   4. When the installation is complete and the status is shown as "Needs
   Restart", proceed to restart ClearPass. After reboot, the status for the
   patch will be shown as Installed. The ClearPass Policy Manager version
   number will not change.  

   
Installing the hotfix Offline Using the Patch File from
