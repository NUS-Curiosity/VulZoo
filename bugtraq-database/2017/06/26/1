Subject: [CVE-2017-8831] Double-Fetch Vulnerability in Linux-4.10.1/drivers/media/pci/saa7164/saa7164-bus.c

Hi all,

I found this double-fetch vulnerability when I was doing my research on double fetch issue analysis, and Iï¿½d like to make an announcement here. 

This was found in Linux kernel file Linux-4.10.1/drivers/media/pci/saa7164/saa7164-bus.c. The kernel (driver) use memcpy_fromio() to fetch twice the same block of device data from I/O memory to the kernel, and malicious data change by the peripheral device between the two fetches will cause data inconsistency for the kernel use, which will lead to consequences like array over-access on the kernel buffer.
===========================================
1. Affected Versions: Linux Kernel 4.10.1 and earlier versions.

2. Detailed description: Kernel Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195559

3. Patch: This has been confirmed by the maintainers and patched:
https://github.com/stoth68000/media-tree/commit/354dd3924a2e43806774953de536257548b5002c

4. CVE: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2017-8831 to this issue. 

Kind regards
