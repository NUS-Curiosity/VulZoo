Potential Security Impact: Remote: Code Execution

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
HPE StoreFabric C-series Switch Software uses Ciscos Prime Data Center
Network Manager (DCNM). Cisco has identified a remote code execution
vulnerability in two versions of Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager
(DCNM) which HPE had included for download for customers under contract from
the HPE Support Center. The affected versions of DCNM are 10.1(1) and
10.1(2). HPE bundled these DCNM versions with the following MDS and Nexus
firmware downloads:

 * MDS 7.3(0)DY(1), released February 2017
 * MDS 7.3(1)DY(1), released April 2017
 * Nexus 5.2(1)N1(9b), released May 2017

**Note:** A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC)
functionality of Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or
execute arbitrary code with root privileges on an affected system. The
vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication and authorization
mechanisms for a debugging tool that was inadvertently enabled in the
affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely
connecting to the debugging tool via TCP. A successful exploit could allow
the attacker to access sensitive information about the affected software or
execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system.
