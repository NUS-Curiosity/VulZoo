Vulnerability:
Information disclosure.

Example:
/user/edit.php?id= reveals account owner name

1. Log in to http://demo.moodle.net/ as user student:sandbox.
2. Click view profile when logged in (student is id=4).
3. Change id parameter from 4 to 3, which is the teacher
(http://demo.moodle.net/user/profile.php?id=3). The HTML response says
'Terri Teacher' who the 'student' user has access to.
4. Change id parameter to 2
(http://demo.moodle.net/user/profile.php?id=2). The HTML response says
"The details of this user are not available to you" and the navigation
bar above says "Home / My profile / View profile / User".
5. Note that it says "User" - but hides the name!
6. Change the URL from profile.php to edit.php
(http://demo.moodle.net/user/edit.php?id=2).
7. The HTML message is "Sorry, but you do not currently have
permissions to do that (Edit user profile)" ... BUT, the navigation
bar says "Home / Users / Admin User".
Voil√†! The account name is "Admin User"

Effective on university websites which have 1+ million end users.
