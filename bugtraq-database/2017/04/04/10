Subject: Tweek!DM Document Management Authentication bypass, SQL injection

https://www.osisecurity.com.au/tweekdm-document-management-authentication-bypass-sql-injection-vulnerabilities.html

Date:
04-Apr-2017

Product:
Tweek!DM Document Management

Versions affected:
Unknown

Vulnerabilities:
1) Authentication bypass - the software sends a 301 Location redirect
back to the login page, if an unauthenticated user requests an
authenticated administration page. However on the PHP side the script
does not exit(0); therefore you can use the system as an administrator
and execute admin functions regardless, such as modifying documents by
ignoring the redirect and interacting with the HTML content.

2) There is a SQL injection in the user edit form e.g
https://[target]/admin/users/edit.php?id=1

(which is accessible as an "administrator" - exploit unauthenticated
as per above).
