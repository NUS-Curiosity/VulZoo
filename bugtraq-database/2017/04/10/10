CVE-2017-5648 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17
Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.11
Apache Tomcat 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41
Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.75
Apache Tomcat 6.0.x is not affected

Description
While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to
application listeners did not use the appropriate facade object. When
running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was
therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference
to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify
information associated with another web application.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M18 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.12 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.42 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.76 or later

Credit:
This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team.
