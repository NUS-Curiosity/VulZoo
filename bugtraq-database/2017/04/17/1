Subject: Watchguard Fireware XXE DoS & User Enumeration

Watchguardâ€™s Firebox and XTM are a series of enterprise grade network
security appliances providing advanced security services like next
generation firewall, intrusion prevention, malware detection and
blockage and others. Two vulnerabilities were discovered affecting the
XML-RPC interface of the Web UI used to manage Fireware, the operating
system running on Watchguard Firebox and XTM appliances. To exploit
any of the flaws discovered, no authentication on the Web UI is
needed.

XML-RPC External Entity Expansion DoS

Credit
David Fernandez of Sidertia Solutions

Versions Affected
Fireware v11.9 version was found to be vulnerable and vendor confirmed
v11.12 Update 1 (latest when we reported to vendor) was vulnerable as
well.

CVE Reference
As far as we know, no CVE has been requested for this vulnerability.
Vendor assigned internal id 92867 to vulnerability and will release a
knowledge Base article following this advisory.

Vendor Fix
Vendor fixed the vulnerability in their v11.12.2 release.

Vulnerability Type
Denial of service.

Description
While attempting to abuse the XML parser of the interface by mean of
External Entity Expansion (XXE) attacks, we discovered that after
repetitive attempts the XML-RPC agent crashes causing a severe
disruption in the functionality and performance of the device.

Impact
On Fireware version v11.9, after a discrete number of injection
attempts, the XML-RPC agent (wgagent) crashes and is not able to
recover, causing a lockout in the Web UI which will be unavailable for
ten minutes, thus making impossible to manage the firewall. Besides
that, it causes either service interrupt or a serious degradation in
performance in connections traversing the firewall (for example, RDP
clients were unable to connect or did it in slow connection mode). On
Fireware version v11.12 Update 1, the agent recovers correctly after
each crash, although by continuously executing the XXE attacks the
negative effects on the device are the same than the ones observed in
v11.9.

Proof of concept
Below is an example of one of the requests that, after several
attempts, causes a crash in the XML-RPC agent:

POST /agent/login HTTP/1.1

XML-RPC User Enumeration

Versions Affected
Fireware v11.9 version was found to be vulnerable and vendor confirmed
v11.12 Update 1 (latest when we reported to vendor) was vulnerable as
well.

CVE Reference
As far as we know, no CVE has been requested for this vulnerability.
Vendor assigned internal id 92884 to vulnerability and will release a
knowledge base article following this advisory.

Vendor Fix
Vendor fixed the vulnerability in their v11.12.1 release.

Vulnerability Type
Information disclosure

Description
When a login attempt is made directly over the login endpoint of the
XML-RPC interface using a blank password, we discovered the response
from the device was different for valid users in Web UI than for
non-existing ones.

Impact
The flaw allows to enumerate existing users in the management
interface of the device. The Web UI allows to use as user repository
an internal database (Firebox-DB), Active Directory or a Radius
server, although this flaw was only tested authenticating against
Firebox-DB.

Proof of concept
Below is a request for an existing user login attempt with blank
password in Firebox-DB:

POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: fireware-host:4100
Connection: close
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.116 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Accept-Language: es,en;q=0.8,ca;q=0.6
Cookie: sessionid=dasdasdas
Content-Length: 268
Content-Type: application/xml

<methodCall><methodName>login</methodName><params><param><value><struct><member><name>password</name><value><string></string></value></member><member><name>user</name><value><string>admin</string></value></member></struct></value></param></params></methodCall>

Which will answer with a 200 OK with no body content for an existing
user and with a 200 OK with an XML message (Invalid Credentials) in
case it does not.
