Business recommendation:
------------------------
The patch should be installed immediately if cURL functions are disabled.

Furthermore, SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review of
this software.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Server-Side Request Forgery
An attacker is able to initiate socket connections with arbitrary systems using
the internal network interface of the server via the web application's "Change
Avatar" function. This vulnerability can be used to identify internal hosts and
perform internal port scanning.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Server-Side Request Forgery
This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with a registered account
as low as a normal account. If the server which is hosting the web application
disallows cURL functions, the application will use the "fsockopen" function as an
alternative. Below is the example on how the SSRF issue can be exploited.

URL     : http://$DOMAIN/usercp.php
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : avatarurl=http://$IP:$PORT:80


Vulnerable / tested versions:
