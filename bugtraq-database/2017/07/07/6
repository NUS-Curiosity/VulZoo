Authors of Advisory: Micha Borrmann (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Microsoft Office 365 Enterprise E3 is a software-as-a-service (SaaS)
product that provides access to different Microsoft productivity
software (see [1]).

Due to an error in the session management, it is possible to still use
Sharepoint after the user logged out via the provided logout function.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the application is not properly invalidating
the used session cookies rtFa and FedAuth when the provided logout
function is used.

If an attacker can gain access to these two session cookies of an
authenticated user, he can still use Sharepoint in Office 365, even if
the user logged out via the logout function, the user was disabled in
the Azure AD and the license to use Office 365 was revoked for this
user, too.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The described security issue concerning the session management of
Microsoft Office 365 Enterprise E3 could be successfully demonstrated
via an interception proxy like Burp Suite.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The SySS GmbH found out, that deletion of the user within Azure AD
make it impossible for the user to use Office 365 anymore.
However, this is a work around and not a rock solid solution.
