Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends not to use this device in production until a thorough
security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Internet Explorer
This vulnerability can be exploited by deactivating or bypassing the
integrated XSS-filter of the Internet Explorer.

A reflected cross site scripting vulnerability was identified because of an
initialization error in "<IP>/files/index/". An attacker can exploit this
vulnerability by tricking a victim to visit a malicious website. The attacker
is able to hijack the session of the attacked user. If the user is currently
not logged in, the injected JavaScript code can start a bruteforce attack
(for example, with the default credentials ubnt:ubnt). After a session has
been established, the code has full control over the system via the CLI feature
which is basically a shell wrapper. By abusing this vulnerability an attacker
can open ports on the router or start a reverse shell.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Internet Explorer
The following URL can be used as PoC:

https://192.168.1.1/files/index/0/aaa<svg><script>alert(1)<br>

The characters "=" and "/" are not allowed in this injection.
This restriction can be bypassed in Internet Explorer via the use
of a SVG and BR tag.
Since "/" is not allowed the <script> tag can't be closed and therefore
browsers will not execute the supplied code. Moreover, event handlers
(e.g. <svg onload=alert(1)>) can't be used because of the "=" restriction.
However, Internet Explorer can be tricked to parse the script via the use of
the SVG and BR tags.
It can be assumed that similar tricks exit for other browsers.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
EdgeRouter X SFP - Firmware v1.9.1
