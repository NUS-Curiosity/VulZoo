High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A token bypass vulnerability has been discovered in the official Bitdefender online service web-application (my.bitdefender).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the secure protection mechanism of verification procedure in the online-service.

A vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the token which responsible for confirming the owner of current email address to get a 
confirmed account from bitdefender for security products. The vulnerability considerd as method followed by remote attackers to bypass the 
correct method of verfication . and located in module which reponsible for registering new customers [/lv2/account?login=] . a semia col 
added to parameter [ action] which expose the verfication token , which used later for bypassing.

The security risk of the token filter bypass web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 5.9. 
Exploitation of the token filter bypass web vulnerability requires no privileged user account or user interaction. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in unauthorized verification of user credentials in the online service web-application.

Request Method: 
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Module:
				[+] /lv2/account?login=

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] [action]

Affected Domain(s): 
				[+] my.bitdefender.com


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The token bypass web vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attackers without privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerbility ...
1. The remote attacker registers wih my.bitdefender.com , after registration the current status of un-verfied accounts is [4] while the [1] is verfied 
2. Now the attacker add a semia col to action parameter like: action='  with GET Request:
