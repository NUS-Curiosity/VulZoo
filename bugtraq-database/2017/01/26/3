Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Expressway Series and TelePresence VCS Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20170125-expressway

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2017 January 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the received packet parser of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient size validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted H.224 data in Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets in an H.323 call. An exploit could allow the attacker to overflow a buffer in a cache that belongs to the received packet parser, which will result in a crash of the application, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
