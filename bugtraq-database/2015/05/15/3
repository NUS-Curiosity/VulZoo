Package        : libmodule-signature-perl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3406 CVE-2015-3407 CVE-2015-3408 CVE-2015-3409
Debian Bug     : 783451

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libmodule-signature-perl, a
Perl module to manipulate CPAN SIGNATURE files. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2015-3406

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature could parses the
    unsigned portion of the SIGNATURE file as the signed portion due to
    incorrect handling of PGP signature boundaries.

CVE-2015-3407

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
    files that are not listed in the SIGNATURE file. This includes some
    files in the t/ directory that would execute when tests are run.

CVE-2015-3408

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature uses two argument
    open() calls to read the files when generating checksums from the
    signed manifest. This allows to embed arbitrary shell commands into
    the SIGNATURE file that would execute during the signature
    verification process.

CVE-2015-3409

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
    module loading, allowing to load modules from relative paths in
    @INC. A remote attacker providing a malicious module could use this
    issue to execute arbitrary code during signature verification.

Note that libtest-signature-perl received an update for compatibility
with the fix for CVE-2015-3407 in libmodule-signature-perl.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.68-1+deb7u2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.73-1+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.78-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.78-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libmodule-signature-perl packages.
