Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Fortinet
Product: FortiAnalyzer & FortiManager - Appliance Web Application 5.2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Fortinet FortiAnalyzer & FortiManager v5.2 appliance web-application.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate client-side application to browser requests to compromise user/admin session information.

The vulnerability is located in the `query and name` values of the `Reports > Advanced > Dataset > View Dataset` module. Remote attackers are able to 
inject malicious script codes to client-side application requests. Remote attackers are able to prepare special crafted weblinks to execute client-side 
script code that compromises the fortinanalyzer user/admin session data. The execution of the script code occurs in the test query display module.
The attack vector of the vulnerability is located on the client-side of the online-service and the request method to inject or execute the code is GET.

The appliance web-application filter prevents to execute script code tags after the request by the vulnerable inputs. To bypass the validation filter 
and protection mechanism of the fortinalayzer use the img, embed and iframe tags with onload to inject client-side script code. The problem is that 
the input filter does not capture the the context with the correct encoding as result the code bypass the filter of the appliance and executes as dom.

The security risk of the non-persistent cross site vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5.
Exploitation of the non-persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability requires no privileged web application user account and low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing, non-persistent external redirects, non-persistent load 
of malicious script codes or non-persistent web module context manipulation.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Reports > Advanced > Dataset

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] name
				[+] query

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable name and query input fields in the data set view module.
Restrict the input fields and disallow special chars. Encode the test code display output to prevent client-side script code injection attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting vulnerability in the dataset view module is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.5)
