Cisco Security Advisory: Command Injection Vulnerability in Multiple Cisco TelePresence Products

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150513-tp

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 May 13 16:00  UTC (GMT) 

+----------------------------------------------------------------------


Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web framework of multiple Cisco TelePresence products could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with the privileges of the root user.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted input to the affected parameter in a web page. Administrative privileges are required in order to access the affected parameter. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute system commands with the privileges of the root user.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available. This advisory is available at the following link:
