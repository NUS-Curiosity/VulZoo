RESOLUTION

HP recommends either of the two following workarounds for the vulnerabilities
in the HP SDN VAN Controller.

  - The network for the server running the HP SDN VAN Controller management
VLAN should be on a separate and isolated "management" VLAN.

  - Configure the firewall on the server running HP SDN VAN Controller so
that the only network traffic allowed to the REST port is from trusted
servers on the network that need to use the REST layer. For example: the
Microsoft Lync Server for Optimizer.

    For more detailed information, please refer to the "Securing REST layer
Access on HP VAN SDN Controllers" article at the following location:
