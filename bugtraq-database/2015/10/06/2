Subject: Advisory: web-based VM detection and coarse-grained fingerprinting

Hi

In three browser families researched (Edge, Internet Explorer and
Firefox - all on Windows 7 or above), it is possible to extract the
frequency of the Windows performance counter, using standard HTML and
Javascript. With the Windows performance counter frequency, it is
possible to remotely detect some virtual machines and to coarse-grain
fingerprint physical machines.

The full advisory is here:

A demo page for this advisory is here:

A fix is available in Firefox 41:
