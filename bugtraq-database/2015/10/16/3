Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] URL Open Redirect in Google
 generic TLD and ccTLD

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2015-005
- Original release date: October 5, 2015
- Last revised:  October 15th, 2015
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 2/5
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in Google generic
TLD and ccTLD

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
The generic TLD (www.google.com) and country code top-level domain
(ccTLD) are affected by this vulnerability.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
An open redirect is a vulnerability that occurs when an application
that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value
without any validation. This vulnerability is used for phishing
attacks for redirecting users to visit malicious sites without against
their will.

Google is affected by this vulnerability in the images search
functionality.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
When a user search an image, generates a link as the following:

http://www.google.es/imgres?imgurl=http://weknowyourdreams.com/images/lizard/lizard-07.jpg&imgrefurl=http://weknowyourdreams.com/lizard.html&h=1200&w=1920&tbnid=1OhPmwC22CBC5M:&docid=UbceIEKQCmsGbM&ei=dQYdVt3QF8i3UcX4jfAO&tbm=isch&ved=0CDUQMygAMABqFQoTCJ3fsp7Gv8gCFchbFAodRXwD7g

The imgrefurl is not properly validated, so an open redirect can be
exploited through this parameter.

We can exclude some parameters in the GET request, because not affect
the expected results. Only this parameters are mandatory:
- imgrefurl: the vulnerable parameter
- tbnid: must have the ":" character in the last position
- docid: can have a null value

Reproduction steps:

1. The attacker generates a link that includes a malicious URL (for
example: www.isecauditors.com) in the "imgrefurl" parameter.

Example:
http://www.google.es/imgres?imgrefurl=http://www.isecauditors.com&tbnid=:&docid=

2. The Google response page contains a link to confirm the redirection
to the malicious URL.

Example:
...
La p√°gina en la que te encuentras te intenta dirigir a <a
href="/url?q=http://www.isecauditors.com&ust=1444061310739930&usg=AFQjCNF649gyi70n6zC89N2u_PLb1dd4dg">http://www.isecauditors.com</a>.

...

3. The attacker extract the previously generated URL with the new
parameters.

Example:
http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.isecauditors.com&ust=1444061310739930&usg=AFQjCNF649gyi70n6zC89N2u_PLb1dd4dg

Now, The attacker have a time slot (several hours) where the request
does not ask for user confirmation, and redirects users to malicious URL.

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
The user may be redirected to an untrusted page that contains malware
which may then compromise the user's machine. This will expose the
user to extensive risk and the user's interaction with the web server
may also be compromised if the malware conducts keylogging or other
attacks that steal credentials, personally identifiable information
(PII), or other important data.
	
The user may be subjected to phishing attacks by being redirected to
an untrusted page. The phishing attack may point to an attacker
controlled web page that appears to be a trusted web site. The
phishers could then steal the user's credentials and then use these
credentials to access the legitimate web site.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
The generic TLD (www.google.com) and country code top-level domain
(ccTLD) are affected by this vulnerability.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
This vulnerability have been corrected.
