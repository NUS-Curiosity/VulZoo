~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Kaspersky Internet Security is an endpoint protection software with many
features defending users against different threats.

The vendor Kaspersky describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Protects your privacy, your money & your kids from Internet risks
* Protects your PC against todayï¿½s Internet threats
* Adds extra security for online banking & shopping
* Safeguards your privacy and personal information
* Helps protect your children against online threats
* Combines superior security & optimized performance"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The Kaspersky Internet Security software allows users to disable the
offered protection by entering a so-called unload password. Beside the
graphical user interface (GUI) authentication, it is also possible to
manually deactivate the protection over the command-line interface using
the Kaspersky software tool avp.exe.

By analyzing the password-based authentication for unloading the
Kaspersky Internet Security protection, the SySS GmbH found out, that
the password comparison is done within the process avp.exe (actually 
within the used module shell_service.dll), which runs or can be run in
the context of the current Windows user, who can also be a standard,
limited user.

This fact allows a further analysis and the manipulation of the password
comparison during runtime without administrative privileges, as every 
user is able to debug and manipulate the processes running with her user
privileges.

In order to bypass the password-based authentication to deactivate the 
protection of Kaspersky Internet Security in an unauthorized manner, an
attacker only has to patch this password comparison, so that it always
returns true, for example by comparing the correct unload password with
itself or by modifying the program control flow.

The SySS GmbH also found out, that by modifying the software tool
avp.exe, the Kaspersky Internet Security can also be deactivated
completely even when no password was set for protecting administrative
functions. The intended behavior of the software tool avp.exe in this
case is to deny access to the requested function, for example "exit",
due to a disabled password protection.

Thus, a limited Windows user or malware running in the context of such a
user is able to unload Kaspersky Internet Security in an unauthorized
manner regardless of the configured password protection.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH developed a proof-of-concept software tool named UnloadKIS
for deactivating Kaspersky Internet Security in an unauthorized manner.

The following output exemplarily shows a successful deactivation of
Kaspersky Internet Security:
