3) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Oracle Outside
In Technology, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a
DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise an application using the SDK.

1) An error in the vstga.dll when processing TGA files can be
exploited to cause an out-of-bounds write memory access.

2) An error in the libxwd2.dll when processing XWD files can be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of
arbitrary code.
