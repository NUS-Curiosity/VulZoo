Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7446 CVE-2015-7799 CVE-2015-7833 CVE-2015-8104
                 CVE-2015-8374 CVE-2015-8543

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information leak
or data loss.

CVE-2013-7446

    Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a particular sequence of valid
    operations on local (AF_UNIX) sockets can result in a
    use-after-free. This may be used to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-7799

    It was discovered that a user granted access to /dev/ppp can cause a
    denial of service (crash) by passing invalid parameters to the
    PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl. This also applies to ISDN PPP device nodes.

CVE-2015-7833

    Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke and Ralf Spenneberg discovered a
    flaw in the processing of certain USB device descriptors in the
    usbvision driver. An attacker with physical access to the system can
    use this flaw to crash the system. This was partly fixed by the
    changes listed in DSA 3396-1.

CVE-2015-8104

    Jan Beulich reported a guest to host denial-of-service flaw
    affecting the KVM hypervisor running on AMD processors. A malicious
    guest can trigger an infinite stream of "debug" (#DB) exceptions
    causing the processor microcode to enter an infinite loop where the
    core never receives another interrupt. This leads to a panic of the
    host kernel.

CVE-2015-8374

    It was discovered that Btrfs did not correctly implement truncation
    of compressed inline extents. This could lead to an information
    leak, if a file is truncated and later made readable by other users.
    Additionally, it could cause data loss. This has been fixed for the
    stable distribution (jessie) only.

CVE-2015-8543

    It was discovered that a local user permitted to create raw sockets
    could cause a denial-of-service by specifying an invalid protocol
    number for the socket. The attacker must have the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability in their user namespace. This has been fixed for the
    stable distribution (jessie) only.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u1. In addition, this update contains several
changes originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u1. In addition, this update contains several
changes originally targeted for the upcoming Jessie point release.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
