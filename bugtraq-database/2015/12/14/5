3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

An attacker can ask victims to visit a malicious site with special
content, where external SWF and resourceModuleURLs attributes can
force vulnerable SWF of NetWiewer Portal 7.4 to execute a query, in
the context of the victim and send private data to attacker's site.
1) The attacker can steal anti-SCRF tokens and read private data
2) Also, the attacker can create an XSS vulnerability.Cross-site
scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication
information, such as data related to their current session. An
attacker who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the
user and access all information with the same rights as the target
user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of the
application may be fully compromised.
