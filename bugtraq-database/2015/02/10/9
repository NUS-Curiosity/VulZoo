RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following instructions to resolve these vulnerabilities.

Follow these steps to update the HP Insight Control for Linux Central
Management Server Pre-boot Execution Environment:

NOTE: The following procedure updates the bash shell on the Linux Pre-boot
Execution Environment. Please update the Bash shell version on the HP Insight
Control for Linux Central Management Server also.

1. On the Production RHEL 6.2 OS:

a. Prepare temporary directory for Bash update software:

# mkdir -p $HOME/tmp/bash
# cd $HOME/tmp/bash
# pwd
<home directory>/tmp/bash

b. Download the file 'bash-4.1.2-15.el6_4.2.i686.rpm' for Insight Control for
Linux Red Hat 6.2 i386 from https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html
to the temporary directory '$HOME/tmp/bash'.

c. Extract the Bash update software package.

# rpm2cpio bash-4.1.2-15.el6_4.2.i686.rpm| cpio -idmv

d. Verify the version of the Bash update software:

# ./bin/bash --version
GNU bash, version 4.1.2(1)-release (i686-redhat-linux-gnu)

e. Verify version dependencies:

# ldd ./bin/bash

linux-gate.so.1 => (0x008a7000)
libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00459000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x002c0000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x0012e000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00108000)

f. Create archive file from '/lib' to copy and install on the Insight Control
for Linux Central Management Server Pre-boot Execution Environment system:

# mkdir $HOME/tmp/lib
# cd /lib
# cp * $HOME/tmp/lib
# cd $HOME/tmp
# pwd
<home directory>/tmp
# tar cvf bash_lib.tar *

2. Download the new archive file '$HOME/tmp/bash_lib.tar' from the Production
RHEL 6.2 OS system to the Insight Control for Linux Central Management Server
Pre-boot Execution Environment system.

3. On the HP Insight Control for Linux Central Managment Server Pre-boot
Execution Environment system:

a. Create a temporary folder for the toolkit and copy the toolkit there :

# mkdir -p $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit
# cp /usr/share/systemimager/boot/i386/standard/toolkit.tar.gz
$HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit

b. Extract the file 'toolkit.tar.gz' into the temporary folder:

# cd $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit
# tar zxvf toolkit.tar.gz
# mv $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/toolkit.tar.gz /tmp

c. Verify the version of the toolkit Bash:

# $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/bin/bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.0(1)-release (i386-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 2005
Free Software Foundation, Inc.

d. Verify dependencies versions:

# ldd $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/bin/bash

linux-gate.so.1 => (0xffffe000)
libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2 (0xf7f8c000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x008bf000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00777000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00755000)

e. Extract the archive 'bash_lib.tar' to directory '$HOME/tmp/bash_lib' .
Then copy the bash binary and the library files to their respective
locations:

# tar xvf $HOME/tmp/bash_lib
# cp $HOME/tmp/bash_lib/bash/bash $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/bin
# cp $HOME/tmp/bash_lib/lib/* $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/lib

f. Create the updated toolkit gzipped archive file and place in
/usr/share/systemimager/boot/i386/standard

# tar czvf toolkit.tar.gz *
# cp toolkit.tar.gz /usr/share/systemimager/boot/i386/standard
