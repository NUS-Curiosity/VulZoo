HPSBGN03237 rev.1 - HP Insight Remote Support v7 Clients running SSLv3,
Remote Disclosure of Information

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as
soon as possible.

Release Date: 2015-02-02
Last Updated: 2015-02-02

Potential Security Impact: Remote disclosure of information

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP Insight Remote
Support v7 Clients running SSLv3 which may affect WBEM, WS-MAN and WMI
connections from monitored devices to an HP Insight Remote Support Hosting
Device, such as an HP Insight Remote Support Central Management Server (CMS)
.

This is the SSLv3 vulnerability known as "Padding Oracle on Downgraded Legacy
Encryption" also known as "Poodle", which could be exploited remotely to
allow disclosure of information. HP Insight Remote Support 7.2 allows the
Hosting Device administrator to disable SSLv3 ciphers. Some monitored devices
may require an update to support TLS encryption, while others may not support
TLS encryption at all. Disabling SSLv3 on the hosting device can result in
loss of communication with such monitored devices. HP has provided the
ability to address POODLE in the Insight Remote Support 7.2 release, but
disabling SSLv3 requires the Hosting Device administrator to take specific
actions to address this vulnerability.

HP Insight Remote Support 7.2 Upgrade Guide
HP Insight Remote Support 7.2 Installation and Configuration Guide
NOTE: Certain monitored clients cannot communicate using the TLS protocol.
These clients may require a firmware update to enable communication with the
Hosting Device using the TLS protocol. Disabling SSLv3 on the HP Insight
Remote Support Hosting Device may result in loss of communication with such
clients. Check with your HP Support Representative to determine if your
monitored devices can communicate using TLS 1.x prior to disabling SSLv3 to
ensure continued communications with HP Insight Remote Support.

Step 1: Update the HP Insight Remote Support Version 7.2 Client:

As an administrator, log on to the Insight Remote Support user interface.

Access the Administrator Settings page
Click the Software Updates tab
Select Insight Remote Support version 7.2.0.0026 (or later)
Click INSTALL and follow the prompts

Step 2: Disable SSLv3 on Hosting Device (Caution: see Note above)

As an Administrator, log on to the Hosting Device

Open a command window Run the following commands:
rsadmin config -set uca.listeners.excludeprotocols=SSLv3
Net stop hprsmain
Net start hprsmain
Close the command window and log off
