Subject: CVE-2015-1593 - Linux ASLR integer overflow: Reducing stack entropy
 by four

Hi,

A bug in Linux ASLR implementation for versions prior to 3.19-rc3 has
been found. The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly
randomized on some 64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow.

Affected systems have reduced the stack entropy of the processes by four.
