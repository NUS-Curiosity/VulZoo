[Overview]
Going into our seventh year, Shakacon offers attendees a unique
opportunity to really network with
some of the world's top security professionals in casual and friendly
setting.  At its heart, the
Shakacon security conference is a laid back conference where industry,
government, academia
and independent experts will get together to share knowledge and
experience in one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.

The conference committee strives to build a balanced schedule that
appeals to all security practitioners
with talks covering all different aspects of the information security
landscape.  There will be something
for everyone and if sitting through talks isn't your cup of Hawaiian
coffee you can step into one of the
social areas and talk with our sponsors, staff, and attendees.


[Training Opportunities]
Don't want to speak at the Con but have an uncanny ability to teach and
a proven track record for
delivering quality courseware and want to come to Hawaii? We will be
evaluating trainers for two days of
training leading up to Shakacon (July 6-7).  Submit a synopsis/class
agenda, prior teaching experience,
and maybe you'll get selected to teach in Hawaii.  Revenue is split
50/50 between the trainer and conference.
The conference will cover all venue related costs (A/V, Food, Drinks,
etc.).  The trainer is expected
to cover their own travel costs (unless they are also selected as a
speaker).  All selected trainers
will receive free admission to the conference.


[CFP Details]
We have up to sixteen (16) spots and typically receive 100+ submissions
to speak.  If you are serious about
speaking please submit your abstract as soon as possible.

(1) Abstract for papers must be submitted to the review committee by
March 6, 2015.

(2) Selection notification will occur by March 13, 2015 and abstracts
posted to the site
by March 20, 2015.

(3) Full Slides for your papers must be submitted by May 31, 2015.


As mentioned, there are a limited number of speaking sessions for which
the conference organizers will provide
travel and accommodations so please submit your abstract early if you
are interested in speaking.  Speaking
slots will be 50 minutes long (45 minutes for your talk and 5 minutes
for Q&A).

The audience will be a broad mix of professional, academic, and
enthusiast, so we welcome both technical
and non-technical submissions on all aspects of security.  The key
criteria are practicality and timeliness.
We want to provide our attendees with up to date materials they can take
away and immediately gain
benefit from, as well as new research or tools.  Absolutely NO SALES
presentations will be accepted.
