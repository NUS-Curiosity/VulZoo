Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
ZTE Corporation
Product: Datacard  MF19 (Mobilis) - Software V1.0.0B04 (PCW_MOBILISALGV1.0.0B03


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local privilege escalation vulnerability has been discovered in the official ZTE Datacard mobiconnect MF19 0V1.0.0B04 application software.
The local security vulnerability allows an attackers to gain higher access privileges by exploitation of a insecure permission misconfiguration.

The application is vulnerable to an elevation of privileges vulnerability which can be used by a simple user that can change the executable file 
with a binary of choice. The vulnerability exist due to the improper permissions, with the `F` flag (full) for the `Everyone`(Tout le monde:F) 
and `Users` group, for the all binary file. The files are installed in the `Ucell Internet` directory which has the default `Everyone` group 
assigned to it with full permissions making every single file inside vulnerable to changeby any user on the affected machine. After an attacker 
replaced the binary with a rootkit, he gain access to SYSTEM privileges after the reboot.

The security risk of the local privilege escalation vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) 
count of 6.0. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a local privileged systen user account without user for interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the privilege escalation web vulnerability results in software- or system compromise.

The second discovered issue is a dll hijacking vulnerability in the mms_dll_r.dll and mediaplayerdll.dll. The issue allows local attackers 
with process privileges to inject own code to the affected libraries.

The third discovered vulnerability is a denial of service bug that affects the local process. Local attackers are able to manipulate the 
networkCfg.xml to crash the application with a runtime error that results in a unhandled exception.



Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by local attackers with restricted account privileges and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
