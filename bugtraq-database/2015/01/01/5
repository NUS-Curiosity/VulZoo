Subject: [KIS-2014-18] Mantis Bug Tracker <= 1.2.17 (ImportXml.php) PHP Code
 Injection Vulnerability

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mantis Bug Tracker <= 1.2.17 (ImportXml.php) PHP Code Injection Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.mantisbt.org/


[-] Affected Versions:

All versions from 1.2.0 to 1.2.17.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /plugins/XmlImportExport/ImportXml.php script:

106.	printf( "Processing cross-references for %s issues...", count( $importedIssues ) );
107.	foreach( $importedIssues as $oldId => $newId ) {
108.		$bugData = bug_get( $newId, true );
109.	
110.		$bugLinkRegexp = '/(^|[^\w])(' . preg_quote( $this->source_->issuelink, '/' ) . ')(\d+)\b/e';
111.		$replacement = '"\\1" . $this->getReplacementString( "\\2", "\\3" )';
112.	
113.		$bugData->description = preg_replace( $bugLinkRegexp, $replacement, $bugData->description );
114.		$bugData->update( true, true );
115.	}

User input passed through the "description" field (and the "issuelink" attribute) of the uploaded XML
file when importing data through the Import/Export plugin is not properly sanitized before being used
in a "preg_replace()" call with the 'e' modifier at line 113. This can be exploited by unauthenticated
attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a specially crafted XML file. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability requires the Import/Export plugin to be enabled (disabled by default).


[-] Solution:

Update to version 1.2.18.
