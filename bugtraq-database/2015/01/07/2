Confirmed Vulnerable	Brother MFC-J4410DW with F/W Versions J and K

The printer administration web application on Brother MFC-J4410DW model printers with firmware versions older than version L (released 18th December 2014) are susceptible to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequately sanitised user input. An attacker may leverage this issue to run JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser.

F/W Versions J and K have been confirmed as vulnerable. Other versions may also be vulnerable.

The vulnerability affects all pages which accept the "url" querystring parameter. The following proof-of-concept example demonstrates this, using the "status" web page.

http://[printer]/general/status.html?url="/><script>alert("XSS!")</script><input type="hidden" value="

The vendor was notified of this issue in October 2014, and has reported that the vulnerability is addressed in the latest firmware version.
