Package        : sympa

A vulnerability has been discovered in the web interface of sympa, a
mailing list manager. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw in
the newsletter posting area, which allows sending to a list, or to
oneself, any file located on the server filesystem and readable by the
sympa user.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.1.11~dfsg-5+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.1.23~dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.
