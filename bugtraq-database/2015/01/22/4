Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Macroplant
Product: iExplorer 3.6.3.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Macroplant iExplorer could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. The application does not directly specify the fully 
qualified path to a dynamic-linked library (itunesmobiledevice.dll) when running on Microsoft Windows. By persuading a victim to open a 
specially-crafted file from a WebDAV or SMB share using a vulnerable application, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a 
specially-crafted library to execute arbitrary code on the system.
