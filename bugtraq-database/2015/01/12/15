Package        : php5

It was discovered that libmagic as used by PHP, would trigger an out
of bounds memory access when trying to identify a crafted file.

Additionally, this updates fixes a potential dependency loop in dpkg
trigger handling.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.36-0+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
