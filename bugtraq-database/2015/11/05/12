Cisco Mobility Services Engine Static Credential Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20151104-mse-cred

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 November 4 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) could 
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the MSE with 
the default oracle account. This account does not have full administrator 
privileges.

The vulnerability is due to a user account that has a default and static 
password. This account is created at installation and cannot be changed 
or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. An attacker 
could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected 
system via SSH using this account. A successful exploit could allow the 
attacker to log in to the MSE using the default oracle account.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. A 
workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available.
