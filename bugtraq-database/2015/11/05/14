=======

A vulnerability in the certificate generation process in the admin web interface of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system with root-level privileges.
 
The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of parameters passed to the affected system scripts.
