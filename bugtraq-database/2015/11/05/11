Cisco Email Security Appliance Anti-Spam Scanner Bypass Vulnerability 

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150612-esa

Revision 2.0

For Public Release 2015 November 4 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the anti-spam scanner of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco
Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote 
attacker to bypass the anti-spam functionality of the ESA.

The vulnerability is due to improper error handling of a malformed 
packet in the anti-spam scanner. An attacker could exploit this 
vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS Sender Policy Framework (SPF) 
text record. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass 
the anti-spam scanner and generate a malformed packet alert.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 
There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
