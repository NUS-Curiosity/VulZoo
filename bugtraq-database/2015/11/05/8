Cisco Web Security Appliance Cache Reply Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20151104-wsa1

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 November 4 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the proxy cache functionality of Cisco AsyncOS for 
Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, 
remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because 
the device runs out of system memory.

The vulnerability is due to improper memory operations by the affected 
software. The software fails to free a memory object when it retrieves 
data from the proxy server cache to terminate a TCP connection. An 
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening many proxy 
connections through the WSA. An exploit could allow the attacker to 
cause the WSA to stop passing traffic when enough memory is leaked.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 
A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is also available.
