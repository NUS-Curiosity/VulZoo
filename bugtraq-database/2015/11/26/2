Package        : smokeping
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0859

Tero Marttila discovered that the Debian packaging for smokeping
installed it in such a way that the CGI implementation of Apache httpd
(mod_cgi) passed additional arguments to the smokeping_cgi program,
potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in response to crafted
HTTP requests.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.6.8-2+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.9-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your smokeping packages.
