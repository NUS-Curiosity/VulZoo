Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-10-16: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local buffer overflow (SEH) software vulnerability has been discovered in the official Free WMA MP3 Converter v1.8 software.
The vulnerability allows a local attacker to process the windows software by exploitation of a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.

The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.5. 
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the local
vulnerability results in system compromise by elevation of privileges via overwrite of the registers.
