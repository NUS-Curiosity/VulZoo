Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting 
this data? Our security researchers and user community. If you find a site that isn`t following our policies, or a vulnerability 
inside our system, please tell us right away.

Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple client-side cross site request forgery web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Magento online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to manipulate client-side web-application to browser requests to unauthorized execute application functions.

The vulnerability is located in the document form POST method request of the vulnerable `/ce/user_guide/` and `/products/bug-tracking/report/saveIssue/` modules.
Remote attackers with low privileged web-application user accounts are able to inject own malicious script codes to unauthorized execute application functions with 
valid session credentials. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the client-side of the magento online-service.

The security risk of the cross site web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.4. Exploitation of the cross 
site request forgery web vulnerabilities requires a low privileged web application user account and low or medium user interaction. Successful exploitation results in 
client-side account theft by hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected service modules.

Request Method(s):
							[+] POST

Vulnerable Service(s):
							[+] magentocommerce.com
							[+] merch.docs.magento.com
							
Vulnerable Module(s):
							[+] /ce/user_guide/
							[+] /products/bug-tracking/report/saveIssue/


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged magento web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
