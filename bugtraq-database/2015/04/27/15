 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:207

 Package : perl-Module-Signature
 Date    : April 27, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated perl-Module-Signature package fixes the following security
 vulnerabilities reported by John Lightsey:
 
 Module::Signature could be tricked into interpreting the unsigned
 portion of a SIGNATURE file as the signed portion due to faulty
 parsing of the PGP signature boundaries.
 
 When verifying the contents of a CPAN module, Module::Signature
 ignored some files in the extracted tarball that were not listed in
 the signature file. This included some files in the t/ directory that
 would execute automatically during make test
 
 When generating checksums from the signed manifest, Module::Signature
 used two argument open() calls to read the files. This allowed
 embedding arbitrary shell commands into the SIGNATURE file that would
 execute during the signature verification process.
 
 Several modules were loaded at runtime inside the extracted module
 directory. Modules like Text::Diff are not guaranteed to be available
 on all platforms and could be added to a malicious module so that
 they would load from the &#039;.&#039; path in \@INC.
