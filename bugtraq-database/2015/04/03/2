Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security restrictions or
denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.6.0-1~deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 31.6.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.6.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
