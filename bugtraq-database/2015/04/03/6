Vulnerability:
From wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-presentation/vp/vw_upload.php 

*Update*  You can directly execute php by uploading file extension ending in .phtml or .rhtml as long as the extension isn't defined in the 
apache mime.types.

Allows various remote unauthenticated file uploads,  among the file types is html where the last 4 characters are only being checked 
in a file name to match which types are allowed.  Because of this .shtml can be passed through and remote code execution is SSI is 
allowed.  The code does not do any user access validation and therefore anyone can upload the following files to an unsuspecting 
wordpress site:

.shtml,swf,.zip,.rar,.jpg,jpeg,.png,.gif,.txt,.doc,docx,.htm,html,.pdf,.mp3,.flv,.avi,.mpg,.ppt,.pps

The if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit; can be by passed by using the extension .Php but the file extension check would allow 
files like test.Php.shtml

<?php

if ($_GET["room"]) $room=$_GET["room"];
if ($_POST["room"]) $room=$_POST["room"];
$filename=$_FILES['vw_file']['name'];

include_once("incsan.php");
sanV($room);
if (!$room) exit;
sanV($filename);
if (!$filename) exit;

if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit;

//do not allow uploads to other folders
if ( strstr($room,"/") || strstr($room,"..") ) exit;
if ( strstr($filename,"/") || strstr($filename,"..") ) exit;

$destination="uploads/".$room."/";
if ($_GET["slides"]) $destination .= "slides/";

$ext=strtolower(substr($filename,-4));
$allowed=array(".swf",".zip",".rar",".jpg","jpeg",".png",".gif",".txt",".doc","docx",".htm","html",".pdf",".mp3",".flv",".avi",".mpg",".ppt",".pps");

if (in_array($ext,$allowed)) move_uploaded_file($_FILES['vw_file']['tmp_name'], $destination . $filename);
?>loadstatus=1

OSVDB:
Exploit Code:
	 <?php
