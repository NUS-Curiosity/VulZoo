~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Panda Antivirus Pro 2015 is an antivirus software with many features
defending users against different threats.

The vendor Panda Security describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Panda Antivirus Pro 2015 is truly 'install and forget'. Remove viruses
and any other threats or malware from your computer. Essential anti
virus that offers real-time protection for your PC."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The endpoint protection software Panda Antivirus Pro 2015 offers a
password protection in order to restrict access to the management
console. With an enabled password protection, changing settings or
deactivating the protection features requires the set password.

By analyzing the password-based authentication of the implemented
password protection, the SySS GmbH found out, that the password
comparison is done within the process PSUAMain.exe (actually within the
used module PSUNConsole.dll), which runs in the context of the current
Windows user, who can also be a standard, limited user.

This fact allows a further analysis and the manipulation of the password
comparison during runtime without administrative privileges, as every 
user is able to debug and manipulate the processes running with her user
privileges.

In order to bypass the password-based authentication, for example to
deactivate the protection of Panda Antivirus Pro 2015 in an unauthorized
manner, an attacker only has to patch this password comparison, so that
it always returns true, for example by comparing the correct unload
password with itself or by modifying the program control flow.

The SySS GmbH also found out, that the actual set password for the
password protection can be extracted as cleartext during runtime from
the process PSUAMain.exe.

Thus, a limited Windows user or malware running in the context of such a
user is able to deactivate Panda Antivirus Pro 2015 in an unauthorized
manner and furthermore to extract the actual password as cleartext.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH developed a proof-of-concept software tool named
UnloadPanda for deactivating the Panda protection in an unauthorized
manner.

The following output exemplarily shows a successful bypass of the
password-based authentication and of the cleartext password extraction:

>UnloadPanda.exe
