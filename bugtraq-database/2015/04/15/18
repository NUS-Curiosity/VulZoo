Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Secure Desktop Cache Cleaner Command Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150415-csd

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 April 15 16:00  UTC (GMT) 

+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======
A vulnerability in a Cisco-signed Java Archive (JAR) executable Cache Cleaner component of Cisco Secure Desktop could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the client host where the affected .jar file is executed. Command execution would occur with the privileges of the user.

The Cache Cleaner feature has been deprecated since November 2012.

There is no fixed software for this vulnerability. Cisco Secure Desktop packages that includes the affected .jar files have been removed and are not anymore available for download.

Because Cisco does not control all existing Cisco Secure Desktop packages customers are advised to ensure to ensure that their Java blacklists controls have been updated to avoid potential exploitation. Refer to the "Workarounds" section of this advisory for additional information on how to mitigate this vulnerability.

Customers using Cisco Secure Desktop should migrate to Cisco Host Scan standalone package.
