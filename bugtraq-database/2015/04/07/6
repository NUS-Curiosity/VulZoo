Subject: [CVE-2015-0779]: Novell ZenWorks Configuration Management remote code execution

Hi,

I've found a reported an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in
Novell ZenWorks Configuration Management which can be abused to
achieve remote code execution.

The full advisory text is below, and can also be obtained from my repo
[1]. A Metasploit module has been submitted and should hopefully be
accepted soon [2].

Regards,
Pedro

This vulnerability is present in ZENworks Configuration Management
(ZCM) which is part of the ZENworks Suite.
A blast from the past? This is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 /
OSVDB-63412, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet.
However this time Novell:
- Did not bother issuing a security advisory to their customers.
- Did not credit me even though I did responsible disclosure.
- Refused to provide a CVE number for months.
- Did not update their ZENworks Suite Trial software with the fix (you
can download it now from their site, install and test the PoC /
Metasploit module).
- Does not list the fix in the ZCM 11.3.2 update information
(https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7015776).


>> Technical details:
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload and directory traversal
CVE-2015-0779
Constraints: none; no authentication or any other information needed
Affected versions: ZENworks Configuration Management 11.3.1 and below

POST /zenworks/UploadServlet?uid=../../../opt/novell/zenworks/share/tomcat/webapps/&filename=payload.war
<WAR file payload in the body>

The WAR file will be automatically deployed to the server (on certain
Windows and Linux installations the path can be "../webapps/"). A
Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.


>> Fix:
Upgrade to version ZENworks Configuration Management 11.3.2.
