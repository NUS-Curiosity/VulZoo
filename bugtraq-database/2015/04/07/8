Package        : libxml2
Debian Bug     : 774358

The update for libxml2 issued as DSA-3057-1 caused regressions due to an
incomplete patch to address CVE-2014-3660. Updated packages are
available to address this problem. For reference the original advisory
text follows.

Sogeti found a denial of service flaw in libxml2, a library providing
support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an
application using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption
(denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if
entity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior.
(CVE-2014-3660)

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.
