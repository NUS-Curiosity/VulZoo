Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
PayPal is a global e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. Online money 
transfers serve as electronic alternatives to paying with traditional paper methods, such as checks and money orders. Originally, 
a PayPal account could be funded with an electronic debit from a bank account or by a credit card at the payer s choice. But some 
time in 2010 or early 2011, PayPal began to require a verified bank account after the account holder exceeded a predetermined 
spending limit. After that point, PayPal will attempt to take funds for a purchase from funding sources according to a specified 
funding hierarchy. If you set one of the funding sources as Primary, it will default to that, within that level of the hierarchy 
(for example, if your credit card ending in 4567 is set as the Primary over 1234, it will still attempt to pay money out of your 
PayPal balance, before it attempts to charge your credit card). The funding hierarchy is a balance in the PayPal account; a 
PayPal credit account, PayPal Extras, PayPal SmartConnect, PayPal Extras Master Card or Bill Me Later (if selected as primary 
funding source) (It can bypass the Balance); a verified bank account; other funding sources, such as non-PayPal credit cards.
The recipient of a PayPal transfer can either request a check from PayPal, establish their own PayPal deposit account or request 
a transfer to their bank account.

PayPal is an acquirer, performing payment processing for online vendors, auction sites, and other commercial users, for which it 
charges a fee. It may also charge a fee for receiving money, proportional to the amount received. The fees depend on the currency 
used, the payment option used, the country of the sender, the country of the recipient, the amount sent and the recipient s account 
type. In addition, eBay purchases made by credit card through PayPal may incur extra fees if the buyer and seller use different currencies.

On October 3, 2002, PayPal became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay. Its corporate headquarters are in San Jose, California, United 
States at eBay s North First Street satellite office campus. The company also has significant operations in Omaha, Nebraska, Scottsdale, 
Arizona, and Austin, Texas, in the United States, Chennai, Dublin, Kleinmachnow (near Berlin) and Tel Aviv. As of July 2007, across 
Europe, PayPal also operates as a Luxembourg-based bank.

On March 17, 2010, PayPal entered into an agreement with China UnionPay (CUP), China s bankcard association, to allow Chinese consumers 
to use PayPal to shop online.PayPal is planning to expand its workforce in Asia to 2,000 by the end of the year 2010.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
PayPal Inc
Product: Marketing Application & Service (HK) 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in the JDWP protocol of the PayPal Inc Marketing online service web-server.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute system specific code against a target system to compromise the webserver.

The Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) is the protocol used for communication between a debugger and the Java virtual machine (VM) which it 
debugs (hereafter called the target VM). JDWP is one layer within the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA). JDWP does not use any 
authentication and could be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server. 

The tool that i used to disclose is the jdwp-shellifier. I scanned the marketing site and it had opened port 8000 (pre-auth) than i just 
executed after accepted connection my commands and finally disclosed a remote code execution issue.

Vulnerable Protocol(s):
				[+] JDWP

Port(s):
				[+] 8000


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote code execution web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the security vulnerability ...
1. Scan the site with the jdwp-shellifier tool (https://github.com/IOActive/jdwp-shellifier)
2. Open port 8000 and connect to the service without auth
3. Execute own server-side commands as root user
4. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!

Note: Please watch the poc demo video!


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
2015-04-09: Vendor Fix/Patch (PayPal Inc - Developer Team)


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote code execution vulnerability in the jdwp protocol is estimated as critical. (CVSS 9.3)
