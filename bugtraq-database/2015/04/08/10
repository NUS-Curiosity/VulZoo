Subject: [HITB-Announce] HITB GSEC 2015 Singapore - Call for Papers

The Call for Papers for the inaugural Hack In The Box GSEC conference in
Singapore is now open.

Call for Papers: http://gsec.hitb.org/call-for-papers/
Event Website: http://gsec.hitb.org/sg2015/

HITB GSEC is a three-day security conference limited to 111 attendees
who vote on the final agenda of talks. Attendees can also opt to be
introduced to speakers and each other based on the votes they cast.

Held at the Sheraton Towers in Singapore from October 12th till the
16th, we'll start off with 2 days of hands-on intensive training classes
followed by a 3-day conference featuring keynotes by Kristin Lovejoy, GM
of IBM's Security Services Division and security thought leader, Winn
Schwartau.

We are looking for 60-minute, offensive focused deep-knowledge
presentations. Research that is new, novel and most importantly material
that has not been presented elsewhere prior.

Submission Process:

1.) Register for an account at http://gsec.hitb.org/cfp/
2.) Send us the following:

 - Presentation abstract (1000 - 1500 words)
 - White paper (3500 - 5000 words)
 - Supporting material (poc code, slides, video etc)
 - A recent photograph

3.) When CFP closes, audience voting begins. Each registered delegate
gets 3 votes to cast against any presentations they like.

4.) When a presentation receives 8 votes it is removed from voting. You
then receive an email introduction to voters which allows you to further
fine tune your presentation to suit the audience profile.
