CA20150407-01: Security Notice for CA Spectrum

Issued: April 7, 2015

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to multiple potential
risks with CA Spectrum. Two vulnerabilities exist that can
potentially allow a remote authenticated attacker to gain sensitive
information or escalate privileges.

The first issue is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability,
CVE-2015-2827, which occurs due to insufficient validation of
requests. An authenticated remote attacker can potentially execute
script with increased privileges.

The second issue, CVE-2015-2828, occurs due to insufficient
validation of data sent using serialized Java objects. A remote
authenticated attacker can potentially gain administrative privileges
on the host.
