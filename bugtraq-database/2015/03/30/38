 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:111
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libxml2
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated libxml2 packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 It was discovered that libxml2, a library providing support to
 read, modify and write XML files, incorrectly performs entity
 substituton in the doctype prolog, even if the application using
 libxml2 disabled any entity substitution. A remote attacker could
 provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead
 to the exhaustion of CPU and memory resources or file descriptors
 (CVE-2014-0191).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in libxml2, a library providing
 support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
 could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by
 an application using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption
 (denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if
 entity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior
 (CVE-2014-3660).
