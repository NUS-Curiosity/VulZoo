 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:096
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : stunnel
 Date    : March 28, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated stunnel package fixes security vulnerability:
 
 A flaw was found in the way stunnel, a socket wrapper which can provide
 SSL support to ordinary applications, performed (re)initialization of
 PRNG after fork. When accepting a new connection, the server forks and
 the child process handles the request. The RAND_bytes() function of
 openssl doesn&#039;t reset its state after the fork, but seeds the PRNG
 with the output of time(NULL). The most important consequence is
 that servers using EC (ECDSA) or DSA certificates may under certain
 conditions leak their private key (CVE-2014-0016).
 
 The updated packages fix this issue by using threads instead of new
 processes to handle connections.
 
 Also an issue has been corrected where the directory for the pid file
 was not being created when the package is installed.
 
 An issue currently exists in Mageia 4 where it fails trying to use
 FIPS SSL (mga#13124). This can be worked around by adding fips =
 no into the config.
