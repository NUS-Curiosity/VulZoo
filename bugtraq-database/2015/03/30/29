 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:101
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : jbigkit
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated jbigkit packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 Florian Weimer found a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in the libjbig
 library (part of jbigkit).  A specially-crafted image file read by
 libjbig could be used to cause a program linked to libjbig to crash
 or, potentially, to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2013-6369).
 
 The jbigkit package has been updated to version 2.1, which fixes
 this issue, as well as a few other bugs, including the ability of
 corrupted input data to force the jbig85 decoder into an end-less loop.
