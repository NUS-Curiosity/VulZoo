 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:110
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : postgresql
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated postgresql packages fix multiple security vulnerabilities:
 
 Granting a role without ADMIN OPTION is supposed to prevent the
 grantee from adding or removing members from the granted role, but
 this restriction was easily bypassed by doing SET ROLE first. The
 security impact is mostly that a role member can revoke the access
 of others, contrary to the wishes of his grantor. Unapproved role
 member additions are a lesser concern, since an uncooperative role
 member could provide most of his rights to others anyway by creating
 views or SECURITY DEFINER functions (CVE-2014-0060).
 
 The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
 during CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal SQL functions
 that a user can call explicitly. Calling a validator on a function
 actually written in some other language was not checked for and could
 be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves
 adding a call to a privilege-checking function in each validator
 function. Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this
 change to their own validator functions, if any (CVE-2014-0061).
 
 If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
 activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different
 table than other parts. At least in the case of CREATE INDEX, this
 can be used to cause the permissions checks to be performed against
 a different table than the index creation, allowing for a privilege
 escalation attack (CVE-2014-0062).
 
 The MAXDATELEN constant was too small for the longest possible value of
 type interval, allowing a buffer overrun in interval_out(). Although
 the datetime input functions were more careful about avoiding buffer
 overrun, the limit was short enough to cause them to reject some valid
 inputs, such as input containing a very long timezone name. The ecpg
 library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own
 (CVE-2014-0063).
 
 Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an
 allocation size without checking for overflow. If overflow did
 occur, a too-small buffer would be allocated and then written past
 (CVE-2014-0064).
 
 Use strlcpy() and related functions to provide a clear guarantee
 that fixed-size buffers are not overrun. Unlike the preceding items,
 it is unclear whether these cases really represent live issues,
 since in most cases there appear to be previous constraints on the
 size of the input string. Nonetheless it seems prudent to silence
 all Coverity warnings of this type (CVE-2014-0065).
 
 There are relatively few scenarios in which crypt() could return NULL,
 but contrib/chkpass would crash if it did. One practical case in which
 this could be an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute
 unapproved hashing algorithms (e.g., FIPS mode) (CVE-2014-0066).
 
 Since the temporary server started by make check uses trust
 authentication, another user on the same machine could connect to it
 as database superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of
 the operating-system user who started the tests. A future release will
 probably incorporate changes in the testing procedure to prevent this
 risk, but some public discussion is needed first. So for the moment,
 just warn people against using make check when there are untrusted
 users on the same machine (CVE-2014-0067).
 
 A user with limited clearance on a table might have access to
 information in columns without SELECT rights on through server error
 messages (CVE-2014-8161).
 
 The function to_char() might read/write past the end of a buffer. This
 might crash the server when a formatting template is processed
 (CVE-2015-0241).
 
 The pgcrypto module is vulnerable to stack buffer overrun that might
 crash the server (CVE-2015-0243).
 
 Emil Lenngren reported that an attacker can inject SQL commands when
 the synchronization between client and server is lost (CVE-2015-0244).
 
 This update provides PostgreSQL versions 9.3.6 and 9.2.10 that fix
 these issues, as well as several others.
