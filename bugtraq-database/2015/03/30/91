 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:159
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : jasper
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated jasper packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Josh Duart of the Google Security Team discovered heap-based buffer
 overflow flaws in JasPer, which could lead to denial of service
 (application crash) or the execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2014-9029).
 
 A double free flaw was found in the way JasPer parsed ICC color
 profiles in JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could
 cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute
 arbitrary code (CVE-2014-8137).
 
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way JasPer
 decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause
 an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
 code (CVE-2014-8138).
 
 An off-by-one flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found
 in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted
 file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly,
 execute arbitrary code (CVE-2014-8157).
 
 An unrestricted stack memory use flaw was found in the way JasPer
 decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause
 an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
 code (CVE-2014-8158).
