 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:116
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libtasn1
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated libtasn1 packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Multiple buffer boundary check issues were discovered in libtasn1
 library, causing it to read beyond the boundary of an allocated buffer.
 An untrusted ASN.1 input could cause an application using the library
 to crash (CVE-2014-3467).
 
 It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der()
 could incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from
 ASN.1 input. This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in
 an application using libtasn1, for example in case if application
 tried to terminate read value with NUL byte (CVE-2014-3468).
 
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1&#039;s
 asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application
 called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to
 determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from
 the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference
 the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash
 (CVE-2014-3469).
