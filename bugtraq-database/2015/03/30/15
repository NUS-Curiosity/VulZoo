 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:089

 Package : freetype2
 Date    : March 28, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated freetype2 packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 It was reported that Freetype before 2.5.3 suffers from an
 out-of-bounds stack-based read/write flaw in cf2_hintmap_build()
 in the CFF rasterizing code, which could lead to a buffer overflow
 (CVE-2014-2240).
 
 It was also reported that Freetype before 2.5.3 has a denial-of-service
 vulnerability in the CFF rasterizing code, due to a reachable assertion
 (CVE-2014-2241).
 
 It was reported that Freetype before 2.5.4 suffers from an
 out-of-bounds stack-based read/write flaw in cf2_hintmap_build()
 in the CFF rasterizing code, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
 This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2240.
 
 The tt_sbit_decoder_load_image function in sfnt/ttsbit.c in FreeType
 before 2.5.4 does not properly check for an integer overflow, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted OpenType
 font (CVE-2014-9656).
 
 The tt_face_load_hdmx function in truetype/ttpload.c in FreeType
 before 2.5.4 does not establish a minimum record size, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TrueType font
 (CVE-2014-9657).
 
 The tt_face_load_kern function in sfnt/ttkern.c in FreeType before
 2.5.4enforces an incorrect minimum table length, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TrueType font
 (CVE-2014-9658).
 
 The _bdf_parse_glyphs function in bdf/bdflib.c in FreeType before 2.5.4
 does not properly handle a missing ENDCHAR record, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted BDF font
 (CVE-2014-9660).
 
 type42/t42parse.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 does not consider that
 scanning can be incomplete without triggering an error, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Type42 font
 (CVE-2014-9661).
 
 cff/cf2ft.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 does not validate the return
 values of point-allocation functions, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted OTF font (CVE-2014-9662).
 
 The tt_cmap4_validate function in sfnt/ttcmap.c in FreeType before
 2.5.4 validates a certain length field before that field&#039;s value
 is completely calculated, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted cmap SFNT table (CVE-2014-9663).
 
 FreeType before 2.5.4 does not check for the end of the data during
 certain parsing actions, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted Type42 font, related to type42/t42parse.c
 and type1/t1load.c (CVE-2014-9664).
 
 The tt_sbit_decoder_init function in sfnt/ttsbit.c in FreeType before
 2.5.4 proceeds with a count-to-size association without restricting
 the count value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (integer overflow and out-of-bounds read) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted embedded bitmap (CVE-2014-9666).
 
 sfnt/ttload.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 proceeds with offset+length
 calculations without restricting the values, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and
 out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted SFNT table (CVE-2014-9667).
 
 Multiple integer overflows in sfnt/ttcmap.c in FreeType before 2.5.4
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 read or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
 via a crafted cmap SFNT table (CVE-2014-9669).
 
 Multiple integer signedness errors in the pcf_get_encodings function
 in pcf/pcfread.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (integer overflow, NULL pointer dereference,
 and application crash) via a crafted PCF file that specifies negative
 values for the first column and first row (CVE-2014-9670).
 
 Off-by-one error in the pcf_get_properties function in pcf/pcfread.c
 in FreeType before 2.5.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted
 PCF file with a 0xffffffff size value that is improperly incremented
 (CVE-2014-9671).
 
 Array index error in the parse_fond function in base/ftmac.c in
 FreeType before 2.5.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (out-of-bounds read) or obtain sensitive information
 from process memory via a crafted FOND resource in a Mac font file
 (CVE-2014-9672).
 
 Integer signedness error in the Mac_Read_POST_Resource function in
 base/ftobjs.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted Mac font (CVE-2014-9673).
 
 The Mac_Read_POST_Resource function in base/ftobjs.c in FreeType before
 2.5.4 proceeds with adding to length values without validating the
 original values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted Mac font (CVE-2014-9674).
 
 bdf/bdflib.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 identifies property names by
 only verifying that an initial substring is present, which allows
 remote attackers to discover heap pointer values and bypass the ASLR
 protection mechanism via a crafted BDF font (CVE-2014-9675).
