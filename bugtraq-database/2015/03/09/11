ocPortal ->
Version:   		9.0.16
Type:      		XSS
Severity:   		Critical
Info Exploit:  		There are MANY possibilities to execute XSS on the new released ocPortal.

All XSS attacks are done by a new registered user, so no extra rights are given. It's all standard.

#######################################################
Events/Calendar, vulnerable to XSS attack:
URL:  http://{target}/ocportal/cms/index.php?page=cms_calendar&type=ad
Title & text field, enter XSS code in both fields. Somewhere else the title XSS is executed, and elsewhere the Text/info XSS code is executed.

When entering an XSS attack, on the events page, when mouse-over the just made event, it also reproduces an XSS.
URL: http://{target}/ocportal/index.php?page=calendar&type=misc&id=2015-02&view=month
XSS Vulnerability on the events which ALSO affects the Admin Panel, when Admin visits the panel and wants to edit it.
#######################################################

Poll, vulnerable to XSS-attack.
URL: http://{yourwebsite}/ocportal/cms/index.php?page=cms_polls&type=ad
Just fill some XSS-code into the fields. Publish and see the result
#######################################################

Forum, vulnerable to XSS-attack
URL: http://{target}/ocportal/forum/index.php?page=topics&type=new_topic&id=2

Creating a new topic with all the fields XSS-ed, performs the XSS attack when an user is browsing the homepage.
This is happening when the active topics are shown on the index page. 
But on the forum page itself, it isn't working.
#######################################################

New PT (private topic/private message), vulnerable to XSS-attack
URL: http://{target}/ocportal/forum/index.php?page=topics&type=new_pt

Now, because I got a new private message, this XSS is executed everywhere!!
