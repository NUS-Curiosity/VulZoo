 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:075
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python
 Date    : March 27, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated python packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 A vulnerability was reported in Python&#039;s socket module, due to
 a boundary error within the sock_recvfrom_into() function, which
 could be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.  This could be used
 to crash a Python application that uses the socket.recvfrom_info()
 function or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions
 of the user running vulnerable Python code (CVE-2014-1912).
 
 This updates the python package to version 2.7.6, which fixes several
 other bugs, including denial of service flaws due to unbound readline()
 calls in the ftplib and nntplib modules (CVE-2013-1752).
 
 Denial of service flaws due to unbound readline() calls in the imaplib,
 poplib, and smtplib modules (CVE-2013-1752).
 
 A gzip bomb and unbound read denial of service flaw in python XMLRPC
 library (CVE-2013-1753).
 
 Python are susceptible to arbitrary process memory reading by a user
 or adversary due to a bug in the _json module caused by insufficient
 bounds checking. The bug is caused by allowing the user to supply a
 negative value that is used an an array index, causing the scanstring
 function to access process memory outside of the string it is intended
 to access (CVE-2014-4616).
 
 The CGIHTTPServer Python module does not properly handle URL-encoded
 path separators in URLs. This may enable attackers to disclose a CGI
 script&#039;s source code or execute arbitrary scripts in the server&#039;s
 document root (CVE-2014-4650).
 
 Python before 2.7.8 is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the buffer
 type (CVE-2014-7185).
 
 When Python&#039;s standard library HTTP clients (httplib, urllib,
 urllib2, xmlrpclib) are used to access resources with HTTPS, by
 default the certificate is not checked against any trust store,
 nor is the hostname in the certificate checked against the requested
 host. It was possible to configure a trust root to be checked against,
 however there were no faculties for hostname checking (CVE-2014-9365).
 
 The python-pip and tix packages was added due to missing build
 dependencies.
