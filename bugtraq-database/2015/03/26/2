RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following release of HP Process Automation which includes
updates to avoid the vulnerability.

  HP Process Automation v7.5.2

HP has provided the following procedure to avoid the vulnerability in earlier
versions of HP Process Automation.

  A standard HP Process Automation installation with HTTPS enabled has SSL
3.0 enabled by default and could be vulnerable to the POODLE attack. This
assumes that a standard installation has been performed using the
installer/configurator without manual edits or other servers involved (e.g. a
front-end Web server), and that HTTPS is enabled. The recommended workaround
is to disable the SSL 3.0 protocol in the HP Process Automation server.

  The following procedure can be used to disable SSL 3.0 on the HP Process
Automation server and leave only TLS enabled for HTTPS connections.

    1. Edit the file "PA_INSTALL_PATH/xmlbase/conf/server.xml" as follows:

      a. Find the <Connector> tag for HTTPS. NOTE: The entry that is NOT
commented out.

      b. Add the following attribute to that tag based on the version of HP
Process Automation:

        PA v7.4.1 and earlier: sslProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"

        PA v7.5 and 7.5.1: sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"

    2. After editing, the <Connector> tag should look similar to the
following example:

      <Connector port="443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" URIEncoding="UTF-8"
SSLEnabled="true" minSpareThreads="25" maxThreads="150" tcpNoDelay="true"
enableLookups="false" acceptCount="300" scheme="https" secure="true"
clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2" disableUploadTimeout="true"
keystoreFile="..." keystorePass="..." redirectPort="443" />
