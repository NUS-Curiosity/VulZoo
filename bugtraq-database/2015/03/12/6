Package        : gnupg
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3591 CVE-2015-0837 CVE-2015-1606

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard:

CVE-2014-3591

    The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
    quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.

CVE-2015-0837

    The modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a
    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
    accessing its internal pre-computed table.

CVE-2015-1606

    The keyring parsing code did not properly reject certain packet
    types not belonging in a keyring, which caused an access to memory
    already freed. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (crash) via crafted keyring files.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u7.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 1.4.18-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
