Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting

with low privileged user accounts are able to perform a malicious request of other users without auth. The request method is POST and the 
issue attack vector is client-side (non-persistent).

The security risk of the csrf web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.5. 
Exploitation of the cross site request forgery vulnerability requires no privileged web application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the web vulnerability results in unauthorized execution of web functions via client-side in the users web context. 

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] magento-connect/claim/claim/new/
