Subject: Google Chrome Address Spoofing - Google's Opinion

It's public now:
https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=497588

Interesting Points:

They did reproduce
"I can reproduce this locally"

They say it's DoS
"seems like any renderer denial-of-service"
(The browser does not crash!)

They say it's not security issue
"remove security flags from this bug"

Finally, they stopped replying
"Jun 10" to "Jul 2"
(unbelievable huge delay)

In the end, they get it
"Lots of phishing attacks these days tell you to call a phone number"
"No interactions"

Currently, it's "Severity-Medium".

Kind Regards,
