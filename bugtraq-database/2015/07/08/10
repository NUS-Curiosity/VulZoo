HPSBUX03363 rev.1 - HP-UX Apache Web Server running OpenSSL, Remote
Disclosure of Information

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as
soon as possible.

Potential Security Impact: Remote disclosure of information

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with OpenSSL which may
impact HP-UX Apache Web Server with SSL/TLS enabled.

This is the TLS vulnerability using US export-grade 512-bit keys in
Diffie-Hellman key exchange known as "Logjam" which could be exploited
remotely resulting in disclosure of information.

Note: The default configuration of HP-UX Apache Web Server is not vulnerable.

References:

  CVE-2015-4000 (SSRT102106)

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX Apache Web Server - all versions if both EDH and EXPORT ciphers are
enabled.

  Reference              Base Vector             Base Score
CVE-2015-4000    (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)       4.3
===========================================================
             Information on CVSS is documented
            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following workaround to resolve the vulnerability in
HP-UX Apache Web Server.

  Note: The HP-UX Apache Web Server with default configuration is not
vulnerable because the default configuration does not support the DH ciphers.

  Since the HP-UX Apache Web Server might be vulnerable if both EDH and
EXPORT ciphers have been enabled, run the following commands to check:

    # openssl s_client -connect <server_name>:443 -cipher "EDH"

    # openssl s_client -connect <server_name>:443 -cipher "EXP"

  If both connections succeed, then the following workaround should be
applied.

  Workaround:

    Change the following Apache configuration settings to disable the
vulnerable DH and EXPORT ciphers:

      Example from the default configuration file:

      1. Edit the Apache SSL configuration file: "httpd-ssl.conf".

      2. Change "+EXP" to "!EXP" or append ":!EXP" if not in the list:

        SSLCipherSuite
!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:!EXP:+eNULL

      3. Restart the Apache Web Server.
