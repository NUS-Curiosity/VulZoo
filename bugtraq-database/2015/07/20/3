Sand Studio
Product: Airdroid - Online Service (Web-Application) 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side jsonp callback vulnerability has been discovered in the official Airdroid online-service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate client-side application to browser requests to compromise session data.

The vulnerability is located in the callback parameter value of the vulnerable signIn.html file. The vulnerability allows remote 
attackers to inject script code by client-side manipulated GET method requests. The vulnerability allows remote  attacker to call 
an callback JSONP for get the information about the user

The vulnerability allows remote attackers to callback script code by client-side manipulated GET method requests. Thus can result in an id 
account or device compromise. The attack vector of the vulnerability is located on the client-side and the request method to inject/execute 
is GET. The service replies via jsonp by a callback with wrong cleanup which results in the unexpected behaviour. 

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 5.6. 
Exploitation of the cross site scripting web vulnerability requires no privilege web application user account and low user interaction (click). 
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects and non-persistent 
manipulation of affected or connected service modules.

Request Method(s):
							[+] GET
							
Vulnerable Module(s):
							[+] Login [Web] (./p14/user/)
							
Vulnerable File(s):
							[+] signIn.html

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
							[+] callback


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side callback vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privilege application user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Parse in the jsonp GET method request the vulnerable callback value to prevent client-side script code injection attacks.
Restrict the callback input by a whitelist and disallow special chars on server-side or client-side GET method requests.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the vulnerability in the android id login web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 5.6)
