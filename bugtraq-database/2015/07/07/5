            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

HP recommends the following software updates and workaround instructions to
resolve the vulnerabilities for HP IceWall SSO Dfw, SSO Certd, MCRP, and
Federation Agent.

  1. IceWall SSO Dfw v10.0 and Certd v10.0, which are running on RHEL, could
be using either the OS bundled OpenSSL library or the OpenSSL bundled with
HP
IceWall. If still using the OpenSSL bundled with HP IceWall, please switch
to
the OpenSSL library bundled with the OS, and then follow the instructions in
step 2.

  Documents are available at the following location with instructions to
switch to the OS bundled OpenSSL library:

    http://www.hp.com/jp/icewall_patchaccess

  2. For HP IceWall products running on RHEL and are using the OS bundled
OpenSSL, RHEL has provided a patch, for RHEL6 only, at the following
location:

    https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1072.html

  3. For IceWall products running on HP-UX which are using the OS bundled
OpenSSL, please follow the WORKAROUND INSTRUCTIONS.

WORKAROUND INSTRUCTIONS

  HP recommends the following information to protect against potential risk
from CVE-2015-4000 for the following HP IceWall products.

    HP IceWall SSO Dfw and MCRP

      - If possible, do not use the SHOST setting which allows IceWall SSO
Dfw or MCRP to use SSL/TLS protocol to back-end web servers.

      - If possible, do not use EXPORT-grade ciphers on the back-end web
servers.

    HP IceWall SSO Certd

      - If possible, do not use the LDAPSSL setting which allows IceWall SSO
Certd to connect to the LDAP server using SSL/TLS protocol.

      - If possible, do not use EXPORT-grade ciphers on the LDAP server.

    IceWall Federation Agent

      - If possible, use "bindings:HTTP-POST" instead of
"bindings:HTTP-Artifact" setting in the service provider meta file. The
"bindings:HTTP-POST" setting would disable IWFA to use SSL for communicating
with IdP server.

Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.
