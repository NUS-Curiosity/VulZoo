Cisco Security Advisory: OpenSSL Alternative Chains Certificate Forgery Vulnerability (July 2015) Affecting Cisco Products

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150710-openssl

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 July 10 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

On July 9, 2015, the OpenSSL Project released a security advisory detailing a vulnerability affecting applications that verify certificates, including SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) clients and SSL/TLS/DTLS servers using client authentication.

Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the OpenSSL package affected by this vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed, enabling the attacker to forge "trusted" certificates that could be used to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.

This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Cisco will release free software updates that address this vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability may be available.
