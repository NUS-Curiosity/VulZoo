Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
ThaiWeb Network
Product: ThaiWeb - Web Application 2015 Q3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official ThaiWeb content managament system´(web-application).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or database management system.

The vulnerabilities are located in the id_run value of the `index.php` file. Remote attackers are able to execute own sql commands by manipulation 
of the GET method request with the vulnerable id_run parameter. The request method to inject the sql command is GET and the location of the issue 
is application-side.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.6.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privilege web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
						[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
						[+] index.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] id_run


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privilege application user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The security vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable id_run parameter value in the index.php file.
Restrict the input and use a prepared statement to secure the sql statement request via GET method.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerability in the id value is estimated as high. (CVSS 8.6)
