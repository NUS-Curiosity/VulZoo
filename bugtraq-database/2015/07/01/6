Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting 
this data? Our security researchers and user community. If you find a site that isn`t following our policies, or a vulnerability 
inside our system, please tell us right away.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Ebay Inc.
Product: Magento - Connect Web Application 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Magento Connect web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script code to the application-side of the affected application module.

Remote attackers are able to inject own script code to the url description link input of the send message module in magento-connect.
Remote attackers are able to inject in the profile description url own script code to compromise user/moderator/admin session data.
The request method to inject is POSt and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the affected module.

The security risk of the application-side cross site vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8.
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious source 
and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules (api).

Vulnerable Service(s):
						[+] Magento Connect
						
Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] send message magento-connect
						
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] url link description


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the security vulnerability ...
1. Register an magento account
2. Login to the service
3. Surf to the profile service
4. Inject own script code payload with document.cookie/domain request to the url description input field
5. Save the input
6. The script code execution occurs in the next layer were the input is visible as profile
7. Successful reproduce of the security vulnerability!
