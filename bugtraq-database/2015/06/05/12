Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
How many times have you watched a video with a fantastic piece of music on it? Wouldn`t it be great if you could make an MP3 file to play on 
your computer, or MP3/media player? 1Click Extract Audio is a totally FREE audio extractor, which provides you a handy tool to extract audio/sound 
or background music from videos. One handy utility that everyone needs nowadays is a software program that can extract audio, sound, or background 
music from home movies, YouTube videos, or any other video file. With just one click, you can easily extract audio tracks from AVI, MPEG, MPG, 
FLV (Flash Video), DAT, WMV, MOV, MP4, 3GP video files and save them as MP3, WAV and AC3 formats. It also has the ability to extract audio from 
only a portion of the video, instead of the entire file. This is a very basic editing feature, but it’s really helpful because you don’t have to 
download any sound editing software if you want only some parts of the audio.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered an activex buffer overflow vulnerability in the official 1 Click Extract Audio v2.3.6 software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-06-05: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
DVDVideoTool
Product: 1 Click Extract Audio - Software (Windows) 2.3.6


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An activeX buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official 1 Click Extract Audio v2.3.6 software.
The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local  attackers to compromise a target system or 
to gain higher access privileges for further exploitation.

The buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the COM component used by the product SkinCrafter.dll (dynamic library).
The vulnerability is available with poc demo code and security video to demonstrate how to exploit the issue via activex component. 

The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.1. 
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in system compromise by elevation of privileges via overwrite of the registers.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The activex buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
