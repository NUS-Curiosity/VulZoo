Subject: [KIS-2015-03] Concrete5 <= 5.7.4 (Access.php) SQL Injection Vulnerability

-----------------------------------------------------------
Concrete5 <= 5.7.4 (Access.php) SQL Injection Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://www.concrete5.org/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 5.7.3.1, 5.7.4, and probably other versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in /concrete/src/Permission/Access/Access.php:

168.	protected function buildAssignmentFilterString($accessType, $filterEntities)
169.	{
170.	    $peIDs = '';
171.	    $filters = array();
172.	    if (count($filterEntities) > 0) {
173.	        foreach ($filterEntities as $ent) {
174.	            $filters[] = $ent->getAccessEntityID();
175.	        }
176.	        $peIDs .= 'and peID in (' . implode($filters, ',') . ')';
177.	    }
178.	    if ($accessType == 0) {
179.	        $accessType = '';
180.	    } else {
181.	        $accessType = ' and accessType = ' . $accessType;
182.	    }

The Access::buildAssignmentFilterString() method uses its $accessType parameter to construct a SQL query
without a proper validation at line 181. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with privileges to edit page permissions.


[-] Solution:

Update to version 5.7.4.1 or later.
