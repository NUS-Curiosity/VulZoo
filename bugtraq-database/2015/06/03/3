Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
JilidFTP is a powerful ftp-client program for Windows, it fast and reliable and with lots of useful features. It supports multi-thread file upload or 
download , so you can upload or download several files at the same time. The job manager integrates with the Windows scheduler engine ,this provide
you more freedom and flexibility to upload or download your files. It can also traces changes within a local directory and apply these changes to 
remote ftp server .The user-friendly interface lets your software distribution, uploading files to a web-server, and providing archives for various

Product: Jildi FTP Client 1.5.2 (Build 1138)


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A buffer overflow software vulnerability has been discovered in the official Jildi FTP Client v1.5.2 (Build 1138) software.
The buffer overflow vulnerability allows to include unicode strings to basic code inputs from a system user account to 
compromise the software process or system.

A fail to sanitize the input of the `Name or Address` results in compromise of the software system process. Local attackers are 
able to include large unicode strings to overwrite the registers (eip, ebp and co.) and gain higher system access privileges.
The issue is a classic unicode buffer overflow that is exploitable by local attackers with low or restricted system user accounts.

The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.2. 
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in system compromise by elevation of privileges via overwrite of the registers.

Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] Name
						[+] Address


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The buffer overflow web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privilege system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Copy the AAAA...string from Jildi_FTP.txt to clipboard
2. Open Jildi Ftp and press Connect
3. Paste the data in the Option `Name or Address` and press connect
4. Successful reproduce of the buffer overflow vulnerability!
