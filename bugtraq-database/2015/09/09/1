Subject: Oracle Hyperion password disclosure

Hello, all.
 
Oracle Hyperion Rapid Deploy installer leaves plaintext passwords in configuration files and logfiles.  Oracle has known about this issue for 2 years (see below).  Oracle says they have fixed the issue in the Hyperion 11.1.2.4 (the latest version).  I have not verified the fix.  Oracle has decided not to patch previous versions.  Customers running Oracle Hyperion are advised to review configuration files and logfiles for presence of passwords, and redact the passwords as appropriate.

Hi Jeff,
           I wanted to follow up on this issue. This issue was fixed in the latest version of Hyperion (11.1.2.4) before it was GA . 

         The 'Rapid Deployment Installer' is not supported for use in a Production environment. The documentation for  11.1.2.4 and 11.1.2.3 about Rapid Deployment reflects this. Hence we do not plan to release any patches for 11.1.2.3 , which is the version that introduced Rapid Deployment.

         Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about this.

Thank you,
Umang Desai

Jeff:

Thanks for the input.    I'd like to see if we can handle this properly without needing outside encouragement unlike the E-Business Suite issue.

Chok:  Can you please make sure this Hyperion SR gets properly and expeditiously handled?  The last person that handled this SR was NAGABHUSHAN.K.N@...cle.com.   Can you get me a status on Friday at the 10AM meeting.

Thanks
Bruce
