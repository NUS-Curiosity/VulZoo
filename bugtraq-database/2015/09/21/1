Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.

    the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).

CVE-2015-5279

    Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw
    in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-6815

    Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
    the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
    to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).

CVE-2015-6855

    Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a flaw in the IDE
    subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's
    WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a
    drive. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a
    denial of service (QEMU process crash).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u11.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u4.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:2.4+dfsg-3 or earlier.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.4+dfsg-3 or earlier.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
