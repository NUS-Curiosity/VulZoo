Affected Product(s):
====================
Shopify Inc.
Product: Shopify - Online Service (Web-Application) 2015 Q3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side validation vulnerability has been discovered in the official Shopify online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to comrpomise user accounts by persistent malicious inject of script codes.

The vulnerability has been located in the `attachment%5Bfilepath` value of the `attachments` module POST method request. Remote attackers 
are able to inject malicious script codes to the application-side of the online-service module. The request method to inject is POST and 
the attack vector is located on the application-side of the service. The attacker manipulates via live session tamper the `attachment > 
filepath` value to compromise the follow up application GET method requests. 

The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.1. 
Exploitation of the input and validation web vulnerability requires low or medium user interaction and no privilege web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent redirects to external 
malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Page:
				[+] attachments 

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] attachment%5Bfilepath


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privilege application user account and low user interaction.
