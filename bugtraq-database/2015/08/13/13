Subject: Nuance PowerPDF Advanced Metadata Information Disclosure Vulnerability
 (low|local)


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Vendor:
=======
Nuance Communications

Product:
========
PowerPDF Advanced Version 1.0
PowerPDF Advanced Version 1.1

Advisory Information:
=====================
Local Information Leakage / Disclosure

Severity Level:
===============
Low
 
Vulnerability Details and Impact:
=================================
The software permits the encoding/editing of meta-data such as Title,
Author, Subject, Keywords, etc.. When the information is removed or
overwritten within the interface, it appears that the previous
information is lost. However, the information remains within the PDF
file. This is a leak of potentially sensitive information after  a user
believes they have edited or removed it.

Individuals or organizations wishing to protect sensitive meta-data of a
PDF file may be unable to do so. This may cause inadvertent leakage of
information (previous authors, keywords, subjects, titles, etc..) that
an individual or organization does not wish to expose.

Exploit Methods:
================
There are no remote exploit methods for this vulnerability. The steps to
reproduce the vulnerability locally are detailed at the following
