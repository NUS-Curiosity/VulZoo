Debian Bug     : 784603

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Wordpress, the popular
blogging engine.

CVE-2015-3429

    The file example.html in the Genericicons icon font package and
    twentyfifteen Wordpress theme allowed for cross site scripting.

CVE-2015-5622

    The robustness of the shortcodes HTML tags filter has been
    improved. The parsing is a bit more strict, which may affect
    your installation.

CVE-2015-5623

    A cross site scripting vulnerability allowed users with the
    Contributor or Author role to elevate their privileges.

The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only affected by CVE-2015-5622.
This less critical issue will be fixed at a later time.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.3+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
