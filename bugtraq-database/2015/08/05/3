Nonsense. That only becomes an issue if anyone other than the user
putting the code into the location is supposed to be running something
from that location.

Otherwise you'd have to prevent users from putting scripts or
standalone executables anywhere they have write access. Which is
somewhat less than desirable (or feasible) in most environments.

The problem with browser extensions is that they're exposed to input
from the outside world, which could make them remotely exploitable in
case of a vulnerability, and that user-installed extensions are not
subject to company software update procedures.
