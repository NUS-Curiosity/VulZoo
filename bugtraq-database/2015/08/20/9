Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered  in the WebSolutions India Design CMS 2015Q3.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or database management system.

the issue is located on the application-side of the online-service. The sql vulnerability allows an attacker to remotly gain unauthorized access to the 
account system of the content management system.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.7.
