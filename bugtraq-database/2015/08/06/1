Really?

Are you SURE that everybody who installs TB 38 knows or recognizes
that TB writes executable code to their user profile(s)?
Who is but the user who puts the code into that location in the first
place?
The user who executes TB and let it create/update the profile?
The administrator who installs TB?
The creator of TBs installer?

No. Writing executable code is NOT the problem here.
The problem is running this code AFTER it has been tampered.
(Not only) Mozilla but does NOT detect tampered code.

I recommend to get the idea of "write Xor execute"...

That's still ANOTHER problem.
