Agreed.  Many sites limit users to at most SymLinksIfOwnerMatch for that 
very reason, not to mention limits on CGI privileges. AllowSymlinks, 
IMO, ought to be reserved for the sysadmin on the server and used 
sparingly. You can, of course, even require .htaccess configurations to 
be set in the server's configuration files instead of in the user 
account areas (in conjunction with the AllowOverride None setting).
