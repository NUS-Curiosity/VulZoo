It is for this specific reason that utilities like suPHP can be used as 
a powerful tool to at least keep the account user from shooting anyone 
but him/herself in the foot because of any configuration or broken 
security issues. Allowing suexec to anyone but a seasoned, responsible 
admin is IMO a recipe for disaster.
