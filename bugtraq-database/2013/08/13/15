Precisely.  This entire thread is filled with people who not only do not know how Apache works, but how Bugtraq works either.  That said, this issue is of course not a bug, but a feature-- a feature which if used, opens a mild to moderate vulnerability which can be corrected on the substrate in any number of ways.
