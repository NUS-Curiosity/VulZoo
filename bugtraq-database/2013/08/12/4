If you say so: OK.

JFTR: untrustable <> vulnerable!

Read again what I wrote, carefully.

If you'd have a clue you may have heard of concepts like "fail safe"
or "safe default configuration".
ANY software with an insecure default configuration is DEFECTIVE!

JFTR: why should gazillions of users/administrators fix the fault(s)
of a single/few developer(s)?

Why not: I expect every developer to exercise all due diligence,
test the code, and ship it with a SECURE default configuration.
Software with an insecure default configuration is DEFECTIVE!

Again: symlinks are well-known as attack vector for years!

It's not the user/administrator who develops or ships insecure
code!
