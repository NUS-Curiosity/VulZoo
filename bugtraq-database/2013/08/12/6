and that's why any admin which is not clueless
disables the symlink function - but there exists
code which *is* secure, runs in a crontrolled
environment and make use of it for good reasons

> It's not the user/administrator who develops or ships insecure code!

but it's the administrator which has the wrong job if
create symlinks is possible from any random script
running on his servers

anyways, i am done with this thread

the topic is *not* "Apache suEXEC privilege elevation" it
is "admins not secure their servers" - period
