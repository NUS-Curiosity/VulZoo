it was the admin who did not RTFM and rolled out default

not entirely untrue, but anybody who thinks he can install
whatever server-software with defaults, not RTFM and call
hiself a serious admin is a fool

again:
symlinks are to not poision always and everywhere
they become where untrusted customer code is running
blame the admin which doe snot know his job and not
the language offering a lot of functions where some
can be misused
