+1. All software should be shipped "secure out of the box". Its
amazing so many folks keep making the same mistakes from the 1980s and
1990s.

The "more eyes the better" theory is hogwash. I cringe when I hear
anyone discussing the security of crowd sourcing. There's two problems
with their arguments: first is Cognitive Biases, and second is the
Bystander Effect. The biases are being demonstrated by NB and RH, and
its results are typical (no offense NB and RH). The Bystander Effect
ensures that the more people see a bug, the less likely they are going
to do anything about it because they believe someone else has already
done something.

They are well known problems in Security Engineering. See Peter
Gutmann's Engineering Security
(www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/book.pdfâ€Ž) or Ross Anderson's
Security Engineering (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html).
