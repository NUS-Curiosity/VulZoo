I would prefer a more "literarily" neutral approach than that 
thought-filled, swear-prone discussion.

The problem disclosed is interesting and the solution provided smooth. The 
pejoration in words really makes me think to which extents could the 
affirmations be true or just blow outs. "sloppy developers", "finite 
wisdom", the form sentences are made with adjectives that clearly shows 
personal insatisfaction to the subject takes out credits of the report.

It would make a perfect reading if it followed the proposal of the subject 
"security in depth" without so much personal thought put in.
