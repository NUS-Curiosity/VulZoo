Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - August Meet - Tuesday 27th August 2013

Bank holiday's over and it's time to get back to work, which totally 
sucks! However, what doesn't suck is that we've got a meet so we can all 
drink beer and cry about it together... :)

In the absence of any other speakers coming forward, this month I'll be 
talking about our latest project...


1st Speaker:

   RFIDler - A Software Defined RFID Reader/Writer/Emulator
             Adam "Major Malfunction" Laurie - Aperture Labs


I've gone back to my roots and starting playing with RFID again, but 
this time I've got Chip Monkey to help so we've gone right to heart of 
the problem and figured out what's really going on under the hood... You 
may find it somewhat surprising, like we did, and as a result we've 
started a kickstarter project to get the resulting device out there. In 
this talk I'll discuss how RFID really works and how we can apply the 
concepts of Software Defined Radio to the technology...

Spoiler Alert!!! If you are coming to the talk, don't read my blog entry:
