i am one of the developers who are admin

why?

because maintaining servers where only internal developed
software gives you the power to make security as tighten
as possible - and yes security is *always* first

not the admins which are developers are the problem

crap like wordpress, joomla, phpBB is the problem because
these developers have no idea how to secure maintain a
server and try to develop software which can be installed
by any random fool on whatever webserver without understand
the implications

thats's why these applications are *strictly* forbidden
on any machine i am responsible for, it's enough to write
abuse mails each time one of these installations outside
got hacked and is starting attacks on 3rd parties
