Package        : otrs2
Vulnerability  : SQL injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4717

It was discovered that otrs2, the Open Ticket Request System, does not
properly sanitise user-supplied data that is used on SQL queries. An
attacker with a valid agent login could exploit this issue to craft SQL
queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code through manipulated URLs.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.9+dfsg1-3+squeeze4. This update also provides fixes for
CVE-2012-4751, CVE-2013-2625 and CVE-2013-4088, which were all fixed for
stable already.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.7+dfsg1-8+deb7u3.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.9-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.
