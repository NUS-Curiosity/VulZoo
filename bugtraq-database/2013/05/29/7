RUCKUS ADVISORY ID 031813-1

Customer release date: March 25, 2013
Public release date: May 27, 2013


TITLE

Unauthenticated TCP tunneling on Ruckus devices via SSH server process


SUMMARY

An user authentication bypass vulnerability has been discovered during
standard internal bug reporting procedures in some of the Ruckus
devices. This vulnerability may permit an unauthenticated malicious
user with network access to port 22 to tunnel random TCP traffic to
other hosts on the network via Ruckus devices.



AFFECTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS AND DEVICES

    Device                        Affected software branches
- -------------------------        --------------------------
ZoneDirector Controllers        9.2.x, 9.3.x, 9.4.x, 9.5.x
ZoneFlex  Access Points            9.2.x, 9.3.x, 9.4.x, 9.5.x, 1.x.x
SmartCell Access Points            1.x.x
Smart Cell Gateway                NOT AFFECTED

Any products not mentioned in the table above are not affected


DETAILS

Ruckus allows for SSH connectivity to its devices for debuggability
and maintenance reasons. It was discovered that a malicious user could
abuse the TCP tunneling feature of the SSH daemon on Ruckus devices to
proxy random TCP streams through the Ruckus devices. The user does not
have to be authenticated to the Ruckus device for requesting and
establishing such a tunnel. Once tunnel is established, the user's TCP
stream would be carried over SSH to the Ruckus device, which would
forward the traffic to an IP and port of the user's choosing.        


IMPACT

An unauthenticated malicious user may be able to establish a SSH
forwarding tunnel to a Ruckus device and use this tunnel to forward
random TCP streams to other hosts in connectivity with the Ruckus
device. SSH daemon is enabled by default on Ruckus devices.

CVSS v2 BASE METRIC SCORE: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)


CHECK IF YOU ARE VULNERABLE

 - Malicious user requires network access to port 22 on the target
Ruckus device to carry out this attack.

 - Smart Cell Gateway is NOT affected by this issue.

 
WORKAROUNDS

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.  However, in the event that a patch cannot
immediately be applied, the following steps will help to mitigate the
risk:

 - Do not expose management interfaces of Ruckus devices (including
SSH access) to untrusted networks such as the Internet.

 - Use a firewall to limit SSH traffic to/from Ruckus devices to
trusted hosts.
 
 - If limiting SSH access is not possible, an extreme workaround is to
disable SSH access to the Ruckus device via a firewall in the path or
via the HTTPS Web Interface of the device itself.


SOLUTION

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.

The following patches have the fix (any later patches will also have
the fix):


Branch        Software Patch
- ---------    ------------------
9.2.x        ZF7731_9.2.0.0.168
9.3.x        9.3.4.0.17
9.4.x        9.4.3.0.16
9.5.x        9.5.1.0.50
1.x.x        1.1.1
