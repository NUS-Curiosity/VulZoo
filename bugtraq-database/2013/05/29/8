TITLE

User authentication bypass vulnerability in ZoneDirector
administrative web interface


SUMMARY

An user authentication bypass vulnerability has been discovered in
ZoneDirector controllers during standard internal bug reporting
procedures. This vulnerability may allow a malicious user to gain
unauthorized access to the ZoneDirector administrative web interface.



AFFECTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS AND DEVICES


    Device                                        Affected software
- -------------------------        ------------------
ZoneDirector Controllers                 9.3.x, 9.4.x, 9.5.x


Any products not mentioned in the table above are not affected


DETAILS

A weakness has been discovered in the administrative web interface of
the ZoneDirector controller devices. A malicious user with network
access to the device's web interface may obtain unauthorized access
and perform administrative actions via the web interface.

This issue only applies if ZoneDirector web interface is configured to
authenticate admin user via remote authentication methods - RADIUS,
LDAP or AD. The user does not have to be authenticated to the web
interface for this attack to be successful. This issue does not affect
any other Ruckus devices besides ZoneDirector controllers.         


IMPACT

A malicious user with network access to the administrative web
interface of the ZoneDirector controller device may obtain
unauthorized access and perform administrative actions via this
interface.

CVSS v2 BASE METRIC SCORE: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)


CHECK IF YOU ARE VULNERABLE

This issue is applicable only in certain configuration

 - This issue is applicable ONLY if ZoneDirector administrative web
interface is configured to authenticate admin user via remote
authentication methods: RADIUS, LDAP or AD.

 - ZoneDirector controller is NOT vulnerable if local authentication
or TACACS is being used for authenticating admin user to the web
interface.

 - No other Ruckus devices are vulnerable to this issue besides
ZoneDirector controllers.


    
WORKAROUNDS

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.  However, in the event that a patch cannot
immediately be applied, the following steps will help to mitigate the
risk:

 - Do not expose management interfaces of Ruckus devices (including
administrative web interface) to untrusted networks such as the Internet.

 - Use a firewall to limit traffic to/from ZoneDirector's
administrative web interface to trusted hosts.

 - Switch to using local authentication or TACACS for ZoneDirector
administrative web interface.


SOLUTION

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.

The following patches have the fix (any later patches will also have
the fix):


Branch        Software Patch
