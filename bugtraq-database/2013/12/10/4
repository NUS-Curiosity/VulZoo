Murray McAllister discovered multiple integer and buffer overflows in the
XWD plugin in Gimp, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed 
in version 2.6.10-1+squeeze4. This update also fixes CVE-2012-3403, 
CVE-2012-3481 and CVE-2012-5576.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.2-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.
