Package        : samba
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4408 CVE-2013-4475

Two security issues were found in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and 
login server:

CVE-2013-4408

    It was discovered that multiple buffer overflows in the processing
    of DCE-RPC packets may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2013-4475

    Hemanth Thummala discovered that ACLs were not checked when opening
    files with alternate data streams. This issue is only exploitable
    if the VFS modules vfs_streams_depot and/or vfs_streams_xattr are
    used.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze11.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.6-6+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
