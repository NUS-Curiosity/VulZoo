0x03 Proof of Concept

- File Names - this issue is really similar to CVE-2013-7003. LiveZilla fixed it by escaping displayed file name when customer want send it to operator. Unfortunately it is unescaped after succesful upload.
- Also - after upload LiveZilla creates 'resources' with those files. Filenames are escaped properly there, but names of customers don't. We can use simple, widely-known XSS payloads to exploit this vulnerability.
