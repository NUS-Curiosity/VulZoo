Debian Bug     : 699887

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2013-0169

    A timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding
    allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical
    analysis of crafted packages, known as the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.

CVE-2013-1621

    An array index error might allow remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service via vectors involving a crafted padding-length value
    during validation of CBC padding in a TLS session

CVE-2013-1622

    Malformed CBC data in a TLS session could allow remote attackers to
    conduct distinguishing attacks via statistical analysis of timing
    side-channel data for crafted packets.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the  unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.4-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
