Calling all practitioners in the field of IT security!
The 11th edition of the international IT security conference, CONFidence 
2013, is taking place in May 28/29, 2013 (as usual it will be close to 
BerlinSides and PXE so if you plan to be around Krakow or Berlin you 
have to try be a part of all of that:)

########################
We invite all to send the proposed topic and abstracts of presentation 
till the 28th Fabruary 2013. Please, remember that CONFidence is an 
open, international conference and all presentations should be given in 
English.
If you want to send a hot, fresh topic we can wait for your submission 
till the 5th March 2013 but we have to know about it so you have to send 
us short note.

The answer to CfP should include:
# name, last name and e-mail address of the potential speaker
# speaker's short bio, describing his experience and skills
# speaker's place of residence
# presentation topic with short description of proposed lecture (no more

DISCLAIMERS
Everybody say that but we really do not accept marketing, non-technical 
presentations aimed at presenting and selling any products. If your 
lecture presents company or its product, please do not send it!
