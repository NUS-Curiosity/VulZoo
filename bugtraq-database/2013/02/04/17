                               IMF 2013

                      7th International Conference
           on IT Security Incident Management & IT Forensics

Conference Background
=====================
Today IT security is an integral aspect in operating IT-Systems.  Yet,
despite high-end precautionary measures taken, not every attack or
security mishap can be prevented and hence incidents will go on
happening.  In such cases forensic capabilities in investigating
incidents in both technical and legal aspects are paramount.  Thus,
capable incident response and forensic procedures have gained essential
relevance in IT infrastructure operations and there is ample need for
research and standardization in this area.

In law enforcement IT forensics is an important branch and its
significance constantly increases since IT has become an essential part
in almost every aspect of daily life. IT systems produce traces and
evidence in many ways that play a more and more relevant role in
resolving cases.


Conference Goals
================
The IMF conference provides a platform for experts from throughout the
world to present and discuss recent technical and methodical advances in
the fields of IT security incident response and management and IT
forensics.  It shall enable collaboration and exchange of ideas between
industry (both as users and solution providers), academia,
law-enforcement and other government bodies.
