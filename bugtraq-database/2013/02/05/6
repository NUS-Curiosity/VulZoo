Discovered by: David Vieira-Kurz of MajorSecurity

Vulnerability Details
=============
David Vieira-Kurz has discovered some vulnerabilities in Sony PS Vita based on firmware 2.05 .
The weakness is caused due to an error within the handling of URLs when using javascript's window.open() method.
This can be exploited to potentially trick users into supplying sensitive information to a malicious web site,
because information displayed in the address bar can be constructed in a certain way,
which may lead users to believe that they're visiting another web site than the displayed web site.

Steps to reproduce
=============
1) Visit http://majorsecurity.com/psvita/psvita-demo.html with a PS Vita with firmware 2.05 installed
2) click the "demo" button
3) The web browser will open a new window with "http://de.playstation.com/psvita/" in the adress bar,
but in fact "http://de.playstation.com/psvita/" is being displayed inside an iframe within
the host http://www.majorsecurity.com

Proof of Concept
=============
A proof-of-concept code is available here:
