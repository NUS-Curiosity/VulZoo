Package        : gnupg
Vulnerability  : information leak
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4242
Debian Bug     : 717880

Yarom and Falkner discovered that RSA secret keys could be leaked via
a side channel attack, where a malicious local user could obtain private
key information from another user on the system.

This update fixes this issue for the 1.4 series of GnuPG. GnuPG 2.x is
affected through its use of the libgcrypt11 library, a fix for which
will be published in DSA 2731.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.10-4+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.14-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
