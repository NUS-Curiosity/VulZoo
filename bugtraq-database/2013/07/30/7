Vulnerable      MojoPortal 2.3.9.7

MojoPortal is prone to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability because it
does not escape the titles of forum threads when inserting into the page title
element.

An attacker may leverage this issue to run JavaScript in the context of another
user's browser.

MojoPortal 2.3.9.7 is known to be vulnerable. Other versions may also be
vulnerable.

To exploit this issue, an attacker must create a crafted post, for example:

POST /Forums/EditPost.aspx [txtSubject=+</title><script>alert("XSS!")</script>]

The vendor has released an updated version (2.3.9.8) which is believed to
resolve this issue. See the announcement at
