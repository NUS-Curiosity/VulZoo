Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Software

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130717-ips

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 July 17 16:00  UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities:

	Cisco IPS Software Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability
	Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability
	Cisco IPS NME Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability
	Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability

The Cisco IPS Software Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the MainApp process to become unresponsive.

The Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive due to memory corruption or could cause the reload of the affected system. 

The Cisco IPS NME Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of a Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Network Module Enhanced (IPS NME).

The Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the kernel of the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Intrusion Detection System (IDSM-2) Module to become unresponsive.

Successful exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address all the vulnerabilities in this advisory with the exception of the Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability. Customers running a vulnerable version of the Cisco IDSM-2 Module should refer to the "Workarounds" section of this advisory for available mitigations. 

Workarounds that mitigate the Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability and Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability are available.
