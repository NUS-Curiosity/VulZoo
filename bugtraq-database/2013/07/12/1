Subject: Re: Windows 7/8 admin account installation password stored in the
 clear in LSA Secrets

Two things:
1. This was made public sometime in 2012 or earlier IIRC.
2. Exploiting this requires the same permission levels that would be 
required to change or access the password anyway. Where's the realistic 
security threat?
