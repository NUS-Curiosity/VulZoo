Subject: Meet the folks of ws-attacker, BeEF, WAHH, sqlmap, Zed Attack Proxy,
 OWASP Top10, DOMinator, Minion, Mallodroid, and the inglorious bastards aka
 HackPra Allstars


... at this year's OWASP AppSec Research 2013 (https://appsec.eu/) , which takes place in less than 4 weeks in Hamburg.

Excerpt:

A: Awesome trainings  (https://appsec.eu/trainings/)

Two days of pre‐conference technical training with a focus on builders (PHP, Java, JavaScript), a bit

and much much more!

The conference will be held from August 22-23, 2013 (trainings from August 20-21) at the Emporio Hamburg.
It's centrally located in the heart of the city with a splendid view over Binnen-, Aussenalster and River
Elbe.

As ticket prizes are subsidized by sponsors (anybody still interested? http://is.gd/QY8PT2), thus entry
fees are low (excl. VAT):

* 350 EUR€ (ISACA/ISC2/OWASP member)
* 420 EUR normal prize

trainings come extra.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a global open project composed of individuals, educational
organizations and supporting corporations from around the world. OWASP has quickly become the de facto
standards body for web application and software security by providing free, vendor‐neutral, practical,
cost‐effective application security guidelines.
