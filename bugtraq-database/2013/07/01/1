    Papers accepted by the Program Committee will be presented at
GreHack 2013. Each paper must include an abstract and a list of
keywords, be formatted in a single-column format, use at least

affiliations must be mentioned. For accepted papers, at least one of
the authors must attend the conference and present the paper. Papers
must neither have been previously accepted for publication nor
submitted in another conference or journal with formal proceedings.
Industry conferences such as BlackHat do not have formal proceedings.

Further questions on the submission process may be sent to the program
chairs at pc-chairs-2013@...hack.org.
