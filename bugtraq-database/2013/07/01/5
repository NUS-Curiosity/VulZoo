Summary: 

The node secret in affected products was stored using an encryption key and encryption algorithm that is no longer considered effective by RSA standards. An attacker could potentially exploit this to eavesdrop on or modify network communications.
 

Details: 

The node secret is a symmetric encryption key that RSA� Authentication Manager, RSA Authentication Agents, and RSA� Access Manager use to protect network communications. In affected products, the node secret is encrypted and stored on the agent host using a dated encryption algorithm and weak key.

All agent software which leverages the RSA SecurID Authentication API has been updated to use stronger encryption and stronger keys.

Note: All agent software, whether shipped by RSA or one of its RSA Secured Partners, which leverage the RADIUS Protocol is NOT affected by this issue.

Following is the recommendation for action to be taken to obtain this security fix:

 

RSA Authentication Agent for Microsoft Windows 6.1.3

Recommendation: Please upgrade to RSA Authentication Agent for Microsoft Windows 6.1.4

 

RSA Authentication Agent for Microsoft Windows 6.4.2 and 7.0

Recommendation: Please upgrade to RSA Authentication Agent for Microsoft Windows 7.1.
