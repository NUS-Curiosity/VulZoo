Subject: [OVSA20131108] OpenVAS Manager And OpenVAS Administrator Vulnerable To Partial Authentication Bypass

Summary

It has been identified that OpenVAS Manager and OpenVAS Administrator are
vulnerable to authentication bypass due to an incorrect state assignment when
processing OMP and OAP requests.  It has been identified that this
vulnerability may allow unauthorised access to OpenVAS Manager and OpenVAS
Administrator on vulnerable systems.  CVE-2013-6765 has been assigned to this
vulnerability in Manager and CVE-2013-6766 to the same vulnerability in
Administrator.

It should be noted that not all of the newly available commands are functional
and that exploitation typically requires SSH access to the host on which the 
services are installed.

Current Status

As of the 8th November, the state of the vulnerabilities is believed
to be as follows.  Patches have been supplied by Greenbone Networks which
it successfully resolves this vulnerability.  New releases of both OpenVAS
Manager and OpenVAS Administrator have also been created which incorporate
these patches.

Thanks

OpenVAS would like to thank Antonio Sanchez Arago for his help in reporting
the vulnerability and apologise to all concerned for the substantial delay
in triaging his report.
