Package        : nbd
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no

It was discovered that nbd-server, the server for the Network Block
Device protocol, did incorrect parsing of the access control lists,
allowing access to any hosts with an IP address sharing a prefix with
an allowed address.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.9.16-8+squeeze1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2-4~deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.
