--[ Description

BugCON Security Conference is one of the most important security
conferences in Mexico. BugCON 2014 will take place in Mexico City from
May 7th to 9th, 2014.

----[ Background

BugCON Security Conference: Safety is just a myth...! is the biggest
security conference in Mexico since 2008.

    BugCON 2008: The security event with the highest technical level
in Mexico...
    BugCON 2009: More than 2800 attendees...
    BugCON 2010: More than 40 talks and trainings...
    BugCON 2012: Speakers from Argentina, USA, Spain, Ecuador, Mexico...
    BugCON 2013: The oldest CON from Mexico ;)

--[ Approach

BugCON is merely a technical security conference. BugCON is focused in
getting together security researchers, security professionals,
companies, universities and goverment agencies with the purpose of
showing their latest research, networking with people involved in
security fields and get drunk ;) ... all taking place in an uncensored
environment.

This is the reason why BugCON only accepts really hardcore technical
talks and workshops related with security areas like: research, new
techniques, vulnerabilities, projects, etc. No business talks...
neither "CSI of computers" nor yellow scarves.
