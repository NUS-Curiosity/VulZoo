 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:132
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : tor
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated tor package fixes security vulnerabilities:
 
 Tor before 0.2.2.34, when configured as a client or bridge, sends a TLS
 certificate chain as part of an outgoing OR connection, which allows
 remote relays to bypass intended anonymity properties by reading this
 chain and then determining the set of entry guards that the client
 or bridge had selected (CVE-2011-2768).
 
 Tor before 0.2.2.34, when configured as a bridge, accepts the CREATE
 and CREATE_FAST values in the Command field of a cell within an OR
 connection that it initiated, which allows remote relays to enumerate
 bridges by using these values (CVE-2011-2769).
 
 Use-after-free vulnerability in dns.c in Tor before 0.2.2.38 might
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash)
 via vectors related to failed DNS requests (CVE-2012-3517).
 
 The networkstatus_parse_vote_from_string function in routerparse.c
 in Tor before 0.2.2.38 does not properly handle an invalid flavor
 name, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read and daemon crash) via a crafted (1) vote document
 or (2) consensus document (CVE-2012-3518).
 
 routerlist.c in Tor before 0.2.2.38 uses a different amount of time
 for relay-list iteration depending on which relay is chosen, which
 might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about
 relay selection via a timing side-channel attack (CVE-2012-3519).
 
 The compare_tor_addr_to_addr_policy function in or/policies.c in
 Tor before 0.2.2.39, and 0.2.3.x before 0.2.3.21-rc, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon
 exit) via a zero-valued port field that is not properly handled during
 policy comparison (CVE-2012-4419).
 
 Tor before 0.2.2.39, when waiting for a client to renegotiate, allowed
 it to add bytes to the input buffer, allowing a crash to be caused
 remotely (tor-5934, tor-6007).
 
 Denial of Service vulnerability in Tor before 0.2.3.25, due to an
 error when handling SENDME cells and can be exploited to cause
 excessive consumption of memory resources within an entry node
 (SA51329, CVE-2012-5573).
 
 The version of Tor shipped in MBS1 did not have correctly formed
 systemd unit and thus failed to start.
 
 This updated version corrects this problem and restores working
 behaviour.
