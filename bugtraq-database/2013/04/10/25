 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:117
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated python packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 A race condition was found in the way the Python distutils module
 set file permissions during the creation of the .pypirc file. If a
 local user had access to the home directory of another user who is
 running distutils, they could use this flaw to gain access to that
 user&#039;s .pypirc file, which can contain usernames and passwords for
 code repositories (CVE-2011-4944).
 
 Additionally, python has been built against the system expat and
 ffi libraries, to avoid any future issues with those (mitigates
 CVE-2012-0876 for expat).
