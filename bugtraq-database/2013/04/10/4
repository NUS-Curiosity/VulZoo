 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:096
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : keepalived
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated keepalived package fixes security vulnerability:
 
 The pidfile_write function in core/pidfile.c in keepalived 1.2.2
 and earlier uses 0666 permissions for the (1) keepalived.pid, (2)
 checkers.pid, and (3) vrrp.pid files in /var/run/, which allows local
 users to kill arbitrary processes by writing a PID to one of these
 files (CVE-2011-1784).
 
 A security issue due to syslog being used inside of sighandlers has
 also been fixed.
 
 Finally, keepalived was failing to load the ip_vs kernel module
 because of an incorrect modprobe option. This has also been corrected.
