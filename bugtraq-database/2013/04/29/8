 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:153
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : subversion
 Date    : April 26, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in subversion:
 
 Subversion&#039;s mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will use excessive
 amounts of memory when a large number of properties are set or deleted
 on a node. This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of
 this problem being observed in the wild (CVE-2013-1845).
 
 Subversion&#039;s mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when
 a LOCK request is made against activity URLs. This can lead to a
 DoS. There are no known instances of this problem being observed in
 the wild (CVE-2013-1846).
 
 Subversion&#039;s mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash in
 some circumstances when a LOCK request is made against a non-existent
 URL. This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of this
 problem being observed in the wild (CVE-2013-1847).
 
 Subversion&#039;s mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when
 a PROPFIND request is made against activity URLs. This can lead to a
 DoS. There are no known instances of this problem being observed in
 the wild, but the details of how to exploit it have been disclosed
 on the full disclosure mailing list (CVE-2013-1849).
 
 Subversion&#039;s mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when
 a log REPORT request receives a limit that is out of the allowed
 range. This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of this
 problem being used as a DoS in the wild (CVE-2013-1884).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 1.7.9 version which
 is not affected by these issues.
