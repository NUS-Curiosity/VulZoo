 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:066
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : bugzilla
 Date    : April 8, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerablilities was identified and fixed in bugzilla:
 
 The get_attachment_link function in Template.pm in Bugzilla 2.x and 3.x
 before 3.6.10, 3.7.x and 4.0.x before 4.0.7, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before
 4.2.2, and 4.3.x before 4.3.2 does not check whether an attachment
 is private before presenting the attachment description within a
 public comment, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 description information by reading a comment (CVE-2012-1969).
 
 Auth/Verify/LDAP.pm in Bugzilla 2.x and 3.x before 3.6.11, 3.7.x and
 4.0.x before 4.0.8, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.3, and 4.3.x before
 4.3.3 does not restrict the characters in a username, which might
 allow remote attackers to inject data into an LDAP directory via a
 crafted login attempt (CVE-2012-3981).
 
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Bugzilla 4.1.x and
 4.2.x before 4.2.4, and 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4rc1, allows remote
 attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a field value
 that is not properly handled during construction of a tabular report,
 as demonstrated by the Version field (CVE-2012-4189).
 
 Bugzilla/Attachment.pm in attachment.cgi in Bugzilla 2.x and 3.x before
 3.6.12, 3.7.x and 4.0.x before 4.0.9, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.4,
 and 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4rc1 allows remote attackers to read
 attachment descriptions from private bugs via an obsolete=1 insert
 action (CVE-2012-4197).
 
 The User.get method in Bugzilla/WebService/User.pm in Bugzilla 3.7.x
 and 4.0.x before 4.0.9, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.4, and 4.3.x
 and 4.4.x before 4.4rc1 has a different outcome for a groups request
 depending on whether a group exists, which allows remote authenticated
 users to discover private group names by observing whether a call
 throws an error (CVE-2012-4198).
 
 template/en/default/bug/field-events.js.tmpl in Bugzilla 3.x before
 3.6.12, 3.7.x and 4.0.x before 4.0.9, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.4,
 and 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4rc1 generates JavaScript function
 calls containing private product names or private component names
 in certain circumstances involving custom-field visibility control,
 which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by
 reading HTML source code (CVE-2012-4199).
 
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Flash component
 infrastructure in YUI 2.8.0 through 2.9.0, as used in Bugzilla 3.7.x
 and 4.0.x before 4.0.9, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.4, and 4.3.x and
 4.4.x before 4.4rc1, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
 script or HTML via vectors related to swfstore.swf, a similar issue
 to CVE-2010-4209 (CVE-2012-5883).
 
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in show_bug.cgi in Bugzilla
 before 3.6.13, 3.7.x and 4.0.x before 4.0.10, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before
 4.2.5, and 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4rc2 allows remote attackers to
 inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the id parameter in conjunction
 with an invalid value of the format parameter (CVE-2013-0785).
 
 The Bugzilla::Search::build_subselect function in Bugzilla 2.x and 3.x
 before 3.6.13 and 3.7.x and 4.0.x before 4.0.10 generates different
 error messages for invalid product queries depending on whether a
 product exists, which allows remote attackers to discover private
 product names by using debug mode for a query (CVE-2013-0786).
 
 The updated packages have upgraded to the 4.2.5 version which is not
 vulnerable to these issues
