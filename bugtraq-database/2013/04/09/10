 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:072
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : dnsmasq
 Date    : April 8, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated dnsmasq packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 When dnsmasq before 2.63 is used in conjunctions with certain
 configurations of libvirtd, network packets from prohibited networks
 (e.g. packets that should not be passed in) may be sent to the dnsmasq
 application and processed. This can result in DNS amplification
 attacks for example (CVE-2012-3411).
 
 This update adds a new option --bind-dynamic which is immune to
 this problem.
 
 Updated dnsmasq packages fix security vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-0198):
 
 This update completes the fix for CVE-2012-3411 provided with
 dnsmasq-2.63. It was found that after the upstream patch for
 CVE-2012-3411 issue was applied, dnsmasq still:
 
 - replied to remote TCP-protocol based DNS queries (UDP protocol
 ones were corrected, but TCP ones not) from prohibited networks,
 when the --bind-dynamic option was used,
 
 - when --except-interface lo option was used dnsmasq didn&#039;t answer
 local or remote UDP DNS queries, but still allowed TCP protocol based
 DNS queries,
 
 - when --except-interface lo option was not used local / remote TCP
 DNS queries were also still answered by dnsmasq.
 
 This update fix these three cases.
