[ESNC-2013-003] Remote OS Command Execution in SAP BASIS Communication Services

Please refer to www.esnc.de for the original security advisory,
updates and additional information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Business Impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability allows executing arbitrary operating system
commands on the remote SAP system with the rights of the SAP
application user.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can take complete
control of the SAP application and data remotely via e.g. RFC protocol
or over the web via SAP's RFC-SOAP interfaces. Attacker can therefore
manipulate/extract business data and control the business logic.

Although vendor claims confidentiality, integrity and availability is
only partially affected (C:P/I:P/A:P) resulting a CVSS score of 6.0,
we believe this does not reflect the actual risk.

Risk Level: High
