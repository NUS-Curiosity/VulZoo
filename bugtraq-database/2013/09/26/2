Cisco IOS Software IPv6 Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130925-ipv6vfr

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 September 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the implementation of the virtual fragmentation reassembly (VFR) feature for IP version 6 (IPv6) in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to hang or reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to a race condition while accessing the reassembly queue for IPv6 fragments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of valid IPv6 fragments. Repeated exploitation may result in a sustained DoS condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
