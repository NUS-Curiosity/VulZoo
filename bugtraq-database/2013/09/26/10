Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4296

Daniel P. Berrange discovered that incorrect memory handling in the
remoteDispatchDomainMemoryStats() function could lead to denial of
service.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.12-11+deb7u4. This update also includes some non-security

We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.
