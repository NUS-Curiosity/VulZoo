Cisco IOS Software Multicast Network Time Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130925-ntp

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 September 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) feature in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of multicast NTP packets that are sent to an affected device encapsulated in a Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) Source-Active (SA) message from a configured MSDP peer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multicast NTP packets to an affected device. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround is available to mitigate this vulnerability.
