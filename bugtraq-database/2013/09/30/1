Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-2141

    Emese Revfy provided a fix for an information leak in the tkill and
    tgkill system calls. A local user on a 64-bit system maybe able to
    gain access to sensitive memory contents.

CVE-2013-2164

    Jonathan Salwan reported an information leak in the CD-ROM driver. A
    local user on a system with a malfunctioning CD-ROM drive could gain
    access to sensitive memory.

CVE-2013-2206

    Karl Heiss reported an issue in the Linux SCTP implementation. A remote
    user could cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2013-2232

    Dave Jones and Hannes Frederic Sowa resolved an issue in the IPv6
    subsystem. Local users could cause a denial of service by using an
    AF_INET6 socket to connect to an IPv4 destination.

CVE-2013-2234

    Mathias Krause reported a memory leak in the implementation of PF_KEYv2
    sockets. Local users could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2013-2237

    Nicolas Dichtel reported a memory leak in the implementation of PF_KEYv2
    sockets. Local users could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2013-2239

    Jonathan Salwan discovered multiple memory leaks in the openvz kernel
    flavor. Local users could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2013-2851

    Kees Cook reported an issue in the block subsystem. Local users with
    uid 0 could gain elevated ring 0 privileges. This is only a security
    issue for certain specially configured systems.

CVE-2013-2852

    Kees Cook reported an issue in the b43 network driver for certain Broadcom
    wireless devices. Local users with uid 0 could gain elevated ring 0 
    privileges. This is only a security issue for certain specially configured
    systems.

CVE-2013-2888

    Kees Cook reported an issue in the HID driver subsystem. A local user,
    with the ability to attach a device, could cause a denial of service
    (system crash).

CVE-2013-2892

    Kees Cook reported an issue in the pantherlord HID device driver. Local
    users with the ability to attach a device could cause a denial of service
    or possibly gain elevated privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32-48squeeze4.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze4

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
