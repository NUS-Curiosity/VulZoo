Vulnerability Details:
File contents are sanitized to avoid script execution be rogue content. For performance reasons, the sanitation takes place for requests where the MIME type indicates that the content will be displayed/executed within the browser context. While the most commonly used MIME-types are covered (text/html), some browsers also execute script code within files signalled with text/xml MIME-type.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.)

Solution:
Users should update to the latest available patch releases.

Internal reference: 28538 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type:  CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers) aka 'HTTP Response Splitting'
Vulnerable version: prior to 7.2.2
Vulnerable component: backend
Fixed version: 7.0.2-rev16, 7.2.2-rev20
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Vendor notification: 2013-08-27
Solution date: 2013-09-12
Public disclosure: 2013-09-30
CVE reference: CVE-2013-5690
CVSSv2: 5.7 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:LM/TD:H/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)

Vulnerability Details:
It's possible to use the /ajax/defer servlet to create malicious HTTP responses by injecting crafted HTTP headers. This issue occurs when using AJP as a backend connector to OX while HTTP based connectors return an error message for that request.

Risk:
A user may be tricked to open a link pointing to a trusted URL. However, by crafting malicious parameters to this request, it's possible to inject HTTP headers. These may be used to redirect the user to an unexpected website or offer unsolicited content in the context of a trusted domain.

Solution:
Users should update to the latest available patch releases.
