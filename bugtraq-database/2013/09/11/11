Subject: OWASP Zed Attack Proxy 2.2.0

Hi folks,

ZAP 2.2.0 is now available from http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/downloads/list

This includes support for scripts embedded in ZAP components like the
active and passive scanners as well as support for Zest - a new
security focused scripting language from the Mozilla security team.
It also supports Mozilla Plug-n-Hack, localization in 20 languages,
various minor enhancements and lots of bug fixes.

For more details see the release notes:

If you use ZAP then please fill in the ZAP User Questionnaire linked

This will help us prioritize features for future releases.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.

Cheers,

Simon
