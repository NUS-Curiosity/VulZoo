Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
buffer overflows may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

The Iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with security updates.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
