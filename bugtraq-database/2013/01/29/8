APPLE-SA-2013-01-28-1 iOS 6.1 Software Update

iOS 6.1 Software Update is now available and addresses the following:

Identity Services
Available for:  iPhone 3GS and later,
iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  Authentication relying on certificate-based Apple ID
authentication may be bypassed
Description:  An error handling issue existed in Identity Services.
If the user's AppleID certificate failed to validate, the user's
AppleID was assumed to be the empty string. If multiple systems
belonging to different users enter this state, applications relying
on this identity determination may erroneously extend trust. This
issue was addressed by ensuring that NULL is returned instead of an
empty string.
CVE-ID
CVE-2013-0963

International Components for Unicode
Available for:  iPhone 3GS and later,
iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-
site scripting attack
Description:  A canonicalization issue existed in the handling of the
EUC-JP encoding, which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack on
EUC-JP encoded websites. This issue was addressed by updating the
EUC-JP mapping table.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3058 : Masato Kinugawa

Kernel
Available for:  iPhone 3GS and later,
iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  A user-mode process may be able to access the first page of
kernel memory
Description:  The iOS kernel has checks to validate that the user-
mode pointer and length passed to the copyin and copyout functions
would not result in a user-mode process being able to directly access
kernel memory. The checks were not being used if the length was
smaller than one page. This issue was addressed through additional
validation of the arguments to copyin and copyout.
CVE-ID
CVE-2013-0964 : Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security

Security
Available for:  iPhone 3GS and later,
iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept
user credentials or other sensitive information
Description:  Several intermediate CA certificates were mistakenly
issued by TURKTRUST. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to
redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other
sensitive information. This issue was addressed by not allowing the
incorrect SSL certificates.

StoreKit
Available for:  iPhone 3GS and later,
iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  JavaScript may be enabled in Mobile Safari without user
interaction
Description:  If a user disabled JavaScript in Safari Preferences,
visiting a site which displayed a Smart App Banner would re-enable
JavaScript without warning the user. This issue was addressed by not
enabling JavaScript when visiting a site with a Smart App Banner.
CVE-ID
CVE-2013-0974 : Andrew Plotkin of Zarfhome Software Consulting, Ben
Madison of BitCloud, Marek Durcek

WebKit
Available for:  iPhone 3GS and later,
iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an
unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
Description:  Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit.
These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.
