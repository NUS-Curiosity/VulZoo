         CVE Name       CVE-2012-5976                                         

    Description  Asterisk has several places where messages received over     
                 various network transports may be copied in a single stack   
                 allocation. In the case of TCP, since multiple packets in a  
                 stream may be concatenated together, this can lead to large  
                 allocations that overflow the stack.                         
                                                                              
                 In the case of SIP, it is possible to do this before a       
                 session is established. Keep in mind that SIP over UDP is    
                 not affected by this vulnerability.                          
                                                                              
                 With HTTP and XMPP, a session must first be established      
                 before the vulnerability may be exploited. The XMPP          
                 vulnerability exists both in the res_jabber.so module in     
                 Asterisk 1.8, 10, and 11 as well as the res_xmpp.so module   
                 in Asterisk 11.                                              

    Resolution  Stack allocations when using TCP have either been eliminated  
                in favor of heap allocations or have had an upper bound       
                placed on them to ensure that the stack will not overflow.    
                                                                              
                For SIP, the allocation now has an upper limit.               
                                                                              
                For HTTP, the allocation is now a heap allocation instead of  
                a stack allocation.                                           
                                                                              
                For XMPP, the allocation has been eliminated since it was     
                unnecessary.
