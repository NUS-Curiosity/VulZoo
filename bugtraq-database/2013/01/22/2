Subject: [HITB-Announce] REMINDER: #HITB2013AMS Call for Papers Closes 8th Feb

Happy belated 2013 everyone! This is a gentle reminder that the The
Call for Papers for #HITB2013AMS (the fourth annual HITBSecConf in
Amsterdam) closes on the 8th of February. We're looking for talks that
are highly technical, but most importantly, material which is new and
cutting edge. In short, please don't submit if you're merely going to
rehash your talks from last year ;)

HITB CFP: http://cfp.hackinthebox.org/

#HITB2013AMS takes place at the Okura Hotel in Amsterdam from the 8th
till the 11th of April. We kick off as always with two-days of hands
on technical trainings (8th and 9th) featuring a new Shellcode Lab by
Ty Miller, Mobile Hacking II by Blake 'Hotwan' Turrentine and Joshua
'p0sixninja' Hill plus Marc 'van Hauser' Heuse's 2-day course on
'Recent Advances in IPv6 Insecurities'.

We then continue with a triple track conference with keynotes by Eddie

Chief Security Officer at Twitter. The closing keynote will be
presented by Winn Schwartau.
