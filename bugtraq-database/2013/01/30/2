Package        : rails
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0333
Debian Bug     : 699226

Lawrence Pit discovered that Ruby on Rails, a web development framenwork,
is vulnerable to a flaw in the parsing of JSON to YAML. Using a specially
crafted payload attackers can trick the backend into decoding a subset of
YAML.

The vulnerability has been addressed by removing the YAML backend and
adding the OkJson backend.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14-6 of the ruby-activesupport-2.3 package.

The 3.2 version of rails as found in Debian wheezy and sid is not
affected by the problem.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
