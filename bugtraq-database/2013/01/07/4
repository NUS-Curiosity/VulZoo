Package        : nss
Vulnerability  : mis-issued intermediates
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no

Google, Inc. discovered that the TurkTrust certification authority
included in the Network Security Service libraries (nss) mis-issued
two intermediate CA's which could be used to generate rogue end-entity
certificates. This update explicitly distrusts those two intermediate
CA's. The two existing TurkTrust root CA's remain active.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.13.6-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.1.with.ckbi.1.93-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
