Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5976 CVE-2012-5977

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Asterisk, a PBX and telephony
toolkit, that allow remote attackers to perform denial of service
attacks.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in

these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
