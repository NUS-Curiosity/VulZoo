Subject: Verax NMS Password Replay Attack (CVE-2013-1351)

Verax NMS Password Replay Attack (CVE-2013-1351)

I. BACKGROUND
----------------------
Verax NMS provides a service-oriented, unified
management & monitoring of networks, applications
and infrastructure enabling quick problem detection,
root-cause analysis, reporting and automating recovery,
reducing costs and shortening downtimes of IT service delivery.

Source: http://www.veraxsystems.com/en/products/nms

II. DESCRIPTION
----------------------
The primary client-side UI component of Verax NMS is a
flash component named clientMain.swf. In addition to
the Flash UI, Verax NMS uses AMF remoting for client/server
communications.

As part of the login process, when a user logs in to the
application, two parameters (username and password) are passed to
the authenticateUser operation, which is part of the userService
destination. Before this information is sent to the server, the
password is encrypted client-side using an implementation of RSA.
Due to the fact that the private and public keys are hardcoded into
clientMain.swf the encrypted password could be captured and replayed
against the service by an attacker.

III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
----------------------
All versions of Verax NMS prior to 2.1.0 are vulnerable.

IV. RECOMMENDATION
----------------------
Users should upgrade to version 2.1.0 of Verax NMS.

V. CREDIT
----------------------
This vulnerability was discovered by Andrew Brooks.\
