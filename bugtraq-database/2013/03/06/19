Subject: Verax NMS Hardcoded Private Key (CVE-2013-1352)

Verax NMS Hardcoded Private Key (CVE-2013-1352)

I. BACKGROUND
----------------------
Verax NMS provides a service-oriented, unified
management & monitoring of networks, applications
and infrastructure enabling quick problem detection,
root-cause analysis, reporting and automating recovery,
reducing costs and shortening downtimes of IT service delivery.

Source: http://www.veraxsystems.com/en/products/nms

II. DESCRIPTION
----------------------
In versions prior to 2.1.0 of VeraxNMS, the server-side component
eadministratorconsole-core-1.5.2.jar, contains a method named
decryptPassword(). This method provides the functionality
to decrypt a user's password using an implementation of RSA.
Within com.veraxsystems.eadministratorconsole.remote.service.impl,
it has been discovered that decryptPassword() uses a static,
hardcoded private key to facilitate this process. As a result,
these passwords should be considered insecure due to the fact
that recovering the private key is decidedly trivial.

III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
----------------------
All versions of Verax NMS prior to 2.1.0 are vulnerable.

IV. RECOMMENDATION
----------------------
Users should upgrade to version 2.1.0 of Verax NMS.

V. CREDIT
----------------------
This vulnerability was discovered by Andrew Brooks.
