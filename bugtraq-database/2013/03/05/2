Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3499 CVE-2012-4558 CVE-2013-1048

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.

CVE-2012-3499

    The modules mod_info, mod_status, mod_imagemap, mod_ldap, and
    mod_proxy_ftp did not properly escape hostnames and URIs in
    HTML output, causing cross site scripting vulnerabilities.

CVE-2012-4558

    Mod_proxy_balancer did not properly escape hostnames and URIs
    in its balancer-manager interface, causing a cross site scripting
    vulnerability.

CVE-2013-1048

    Hayawardh Vijayakumar noticed that the apache2ctl script created
    the lock directory in an unsafe manner, allowing a local attacker
    to gain elevated privileges via a symlink attack. This is a Debian
    specific issue.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze11.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-13.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-13.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
