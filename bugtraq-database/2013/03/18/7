Subject: [SE-2012-01] The "allowed behavior" in Java SE 7 (Issue 54)


Hello All,

We decided to release technical details of Issue 54 that was
reported to Oracle on Feb 25, 2013 and that was evaluated by
the company as the "allowed behavior".

As of Mar 18, 2013 we have no information that Oracle treats
Issue 54 as a security vulnerability. We believe that 3 weeks
(from Feb 25 to Mar 18) constitutes enough time for a major
software vendor to deliver a final confirmation or denial of
a reported issue. This especially concerns a vendor that has
been a subject of a considerable criticism regarding competent
and prompt handling of security vulnerabilities in its software.

Security Explorations is publishing the following material in
a hope a wider public could conduct an independent evaluation
of Issue 54 and deliver an unbiased judgment of both companies
claims:

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
