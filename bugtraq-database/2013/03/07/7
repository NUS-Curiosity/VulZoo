Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered an untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability in Corel WordPerfect. Opening of a malicious WPD (WordPerfect Document) causes immediate application crash, resulting in a loss of all unsaved current application data of the user.


1) Untrusted Pointer Dereference Vulnerability in Corel WordPerfect X6: CVE-2012-4900

The very beginning of the crash occurs within the WPWIN16.DLL module in the STARTAPP function when the application attempts to call the STRNICMP procedure in the MSVCR80 module. Due to a specially crafted WPD file and as a result of the stack modification, it is possible to partially control the destination pointer [EDI] inherited by the STRNICMP function.

Crash details:
eax=0225a848 ebx=0224ce48 ecx=00000008 edx=00000008 esi=0224ce48 edi=0225a848

In order to exploit the vulnerability remotely the attacker has to send a malicious file to the victim by email. In a web-based scenario, the attacker can host a malicious file on a website or WebDav share and trick the victim to download and open the file. 

As a PoC (Proof of Concept) a file "PoC.wpd" is <a href="https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23114-PoC.rar">provided</a>, which causes immediate application crash. Password for archive: k2-0xj)Dhfjhlfs
