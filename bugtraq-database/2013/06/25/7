Subject: Barnraiser Prairie OpenID idp: Directory traversal attack

The OpenID idp software "Barnraiser Prairie" 
http://www.barnraiser.org/prairie/ is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks:

./get_file.php does not limit the given path and allows directory traversal attacks with full public access to all images on the server.


Example exploit:
get_file.php?avatar=..&width=../../../../../../../../usr/share/apache2/icons/apache_pb.png
