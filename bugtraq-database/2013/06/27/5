Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Content Security Management Appliance

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130626-sma


Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 June 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software for Cisco Content Security Management Appliance
is affected by the following vulnerabilities:

  * Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability
  * IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability
  * Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability


These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected
by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.

Successful exploitation of the Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection
Vulnerability could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute
arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.
Successful exploitation of either of the two denial of service vulnerabilities
could cause several critical processes to become unresponsive and make the
affected system unstable.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available. This advisory is
available at the following link:
