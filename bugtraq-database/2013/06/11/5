Introduction:
=============
Bluetooth application has small but pleasant features that promise to facilitate your life a little and add charm to it.
Firstly, it allows user to turn on Bluetooth easily and quickly with just one tap without entering device settings. And that 
means that you can manage your Bluetooth distantly i.e. more conveniently and quickly. Secondly, the application allows managing 
your private on-line chat between two devices where you can chat with your talker freely and with no limits locating pretty 
far away from him/her.

You don’t need to stop an interesting talk to your friend, business partner or beloved person during lectures, business meetings 
or at somebody’s presence. Bluetooth will let you have a talk quietly and without being noticed, to discuss what’s going on, to 
exchange your ideas and to send prompts and correct answers to each other. Bluetooth chat let you exchange quick messages with a 
friend of yours conveniently, amazingly and for free. Easy and compact interface allows you typing and sending your messages 
without any difficulties and connection problems. Bluetooth will make you and your talker feel private in everyone’s hearing 
allowing to talk to each other silently and without being noticed staying in a public place. Feel double happy – enjoy free and 
virtual talk and artfully turn on and off your Bluetooth for a pretty short period of time.

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the in the Bluetooth Connect Chat v1.0 iOS Application (Apple - iPad & iPhone).


Report-Timeline:
================
2013-05-31:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Apple AppStore
Product: Bluetooth Chat Connect 1.0


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
A persistent input validation web vulnerability is detected in the in the Bluetooth Connect Chat v1.0 iOS Application (Apple - iPad & iPhone).
The vulnerability typus allows remote attackers to inject own malicious persistent (application-side) script codes to compromise the iOS application.

The persistent input validation web vulnerability is located in the message board listing when processing to display manipulated messages.
Attacker can inject own malicious script code to execute the context persistent from the message listing. To inject the code the remote attacker 
needs to bypass the basic validation of the client which is possible with a standard obfuscated char to char injection.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a free but low privilege application user account.
Successful exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability results in persistent session hijacking, persistent web phishing, 
persistent external redirects or persistent module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Message Board - Chat

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] message (context)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Message Board Listing


1.2
A denial of service vulnerability is detected in the Bluetooth Connect Chat v1.0 iOS Application for Apples iPad & iPhone.
The vulnerability typus allows remote attackers to freeze, block or stable crash down the application or software.

The remote DoS vulnerability is located in the chat name and chat message encoding when processing to load a message special crafted message.
The remote attacker uses any random html or quote tag as chat name. After including the tag as name the attacker connects to an existing 
chatroom via bluetooth or w-lab. Now he writes the name (used to logon for chatting) as message. The result is a stable iOS app crash 
(shutdown) on both sides because of a collision in the message client when processing to load both strings with an unknown exception.

Exploitation of the remote vulnerability requires no user interaction and a free but low privilege application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote denial of service bug results in stable application crash and unauthorized shutdowns.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Message Board - Chat

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Chatname
				[+] Message Context


Solution:
=========
1.1
The persistent issue can be addressed by a restriction to the chat-name input fields. 
Parse the chat name input fields itself and encode the chat user name with a secure filter mask.
Escape, filter or encode the message listing to prevent the execution of persistent script codes.

1.2
The denial of service issue can be patched by a secure parse of the collision when processing to handle the same string 2 times as message.


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the client is estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the remote denial of service vulnerability in the client is estimated as medium(-).
