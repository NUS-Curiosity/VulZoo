Apache Struts 2 Command Execution Vulnerability in Multiple Cisco Products

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20131023-struts2

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 October 23 16:00  UTC (GMT)
======================================================================

Summary
- -------

Multiple Cisco products include an implementation of Apache Struts 2 component that is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability. 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests consisting of Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. 

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability for all the affected products except Cisco Business Edition 3000. Cisco Business Edition 3000 should contact their Cisco representative for available options.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available. This advisory is available at the following link:
