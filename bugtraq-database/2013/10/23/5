Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Identity Services Engine

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20131023-ise

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 October 23 16:00  UTC (GMT)
======================================================================

Summary
- -------

Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) contains the following vulnerabilities:

	Cisco ISE Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability
	Cisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other.

Successful exploitation of Cisco ISE Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability may allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.
Successful exploitation of Cisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information including administrative credentials.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available. This advisory is available at the following link:
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131023-ise

Note: Cisco ISE Software is also affected by the Apache Struts Command Execution Vulnerability described in a separate Cisco Security Advisory available at the following link:
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131023-struts2

Cisco ISE customers should consult that advisory before making decision on the upgrade path.
