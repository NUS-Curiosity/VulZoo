Subject: Re: RPS/APS vulnerability in snom/yealink and others

The video was taken down by the the conference organizer at the
request of a vendor.

It has now been re-uploaded and can be seen here;

The video has been split into two parts due to YouTube HD restrictions.

Enjoy and apologies for the delay in getting this fixed
