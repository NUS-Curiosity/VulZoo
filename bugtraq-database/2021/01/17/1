Bugtraq has been a valuable institution within the Cyber Security community for 
almost 30 years. Many of our own people entered the industry by subscribing to it
and learning from it. So, based on the feedback we’ve received both from the
community-at-large and internally, we’ve decided to keep the Bugtraq list running.
We’ll be working in the coming weeks to ensure that it can remain a valuable asset
to the community for years to come.   - Accenture Security
