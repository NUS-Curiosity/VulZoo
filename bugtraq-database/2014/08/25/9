WORKSHOP FORMAT

The Information Systems and Technologies research and industrial community is invited to submit proposals of Workshops for WorldCIST'15 � 3rd World Conference on Information Systems and Technologies to be held at S�o Miguel, Azores, Portugal, 1st-3rd of April 2015.

Workshops should focus on a specific scientific subject on the scope of WorldCIST'15 but not directly included on the main conference areas. Each workshop will be coordinated by an Organizing Committee composed of, at least, two researchers in the field, preferably from different institutions and different countries. The organizers should create an international Program Committee for the Workshop, with recognized researchers within the specific Workshop scientific area. Each workshop should have at least 10 submissions and 5 accepted papers in order to be conducted at WorldCIST'15.

The selection of Workshops will be performed by WorldCIST'15 Conference/Workshop Chairs. Workshops full and short papers will be published in the conference main proceedings in specific Workshop chapters published by Springer in a book of the AISC series. Proceedings will be submitted for indexation by ISI Thomson, SCOPUS, DBLP, EI-Compendex among several other scientific databases. Extended versions of best selected papers will be published in journals indexed by ISI and SCOPUS.
