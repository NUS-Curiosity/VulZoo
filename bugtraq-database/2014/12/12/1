Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-7824

Simon McVittie discovered that the fix for CVE-2014-3636 was
incorrect, as it did not fully address the underlying
denial-of-service vector.  This update starts the D-Bus daemon as root
initially, so that it can properly raise its file descriptor count.

In addition, this update reverts the auth_timeout change in the
previous security update to its old value because the new value causes
boot failures on some systems.  See the README.Debian file for details
how to harden the D-Bus daemon against malicious local users.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problem have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u5.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problem have been fixed in version 1.8.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
