Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Wordpress
Product: iTwitter - Wordpress Plugin 0.04


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site request forgery issue and a cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the iTwitter 0.04 Wordpress Plugin.
The client-side cross site request forgery vulnerability allows remote attackers to force client-side requests to execute application functions.
The client-side cross site scripting vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script codes to compromise administrator session data.

The xss vulnerability is located in the username and userpass values of the iTwitter.php file POST method request. Remote attackers are able to inject 
malicious script codes to the client-side application request. The csrf vulnerability is located in the same value request and allows to request the 
account session data. Both issues are only exploitable on the client-side of the application and the request method to inject is POST.

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.5.
Exploitation of the client-side web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities result in non-persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, non-persistent external redirect 
to malicious sources and client-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
					[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] Settings

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] username
					[+] userpass

Affected Module(s):
					[+] iTwitter.php


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site request forgery issue and a cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerabilities ...
You can use the following exploit code to verify the vulnerability.  Save the code as .html. 
The malicious page needs to be surfed by a non expired administrator session to take over the user session data.

PoC: iTwitter.php
