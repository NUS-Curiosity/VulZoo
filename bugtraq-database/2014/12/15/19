 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:242
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : yaml
 Date    : December 14, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated yaml and perl-YAML-LibYAML packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 An assertion failure was found in the way the libyaml library parsed
 wrapped strings. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input
 into an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash
 (CVE-2014-9130).
 
 The perl-YAML-LibYAML package is also affected, as it was derived
 from the same code.  Both have been patched to fix this issue.
