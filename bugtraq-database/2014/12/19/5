Vendor description:
-----------------------------
"eDirectory(TM) is a full-service, secure LDAP directory providing incredible
scalability and an agile platform to run your organization's identity
infrastructure and multi-platform network services."

URL: https://www.netiq.com/products/edirectory/


Business recommendation:
------------------------
An attacker without an account on the NetIQ eDirectory NDS iMonitor is able
to gain administrative access by luring an authenticated administrator to
visit an attacker-controlled web site. Moreover, an authenticated attacker
is able to retrieve internal data which potentially contains sensitive
data.

As the NetIQ eDirectory is often used to maintain a centralized user database
it is a very attractive target for an attacker. By compromising this system,
an attacker may be able to conduct further attacks on other systems.

SEC Consult recommends to immediately conduct a full security review of
this software, especially if used as a centralized user database.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Memory Disclosure (CVE-2014-5213)
Using crafted HTTP requests an administrative user can retrieve parts of the
virtual memory from the service. This potentially discloses secret data like
passwords.

2) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS, CVE-2014-5212)
A reflected cross site scripting vulnerability was identified. An attacker
could take over the user account of a valid administrator.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Memory Disclosure (CVE-2014-5213)
When accessing the following URL as an authenticated user, parts of the virtual
memory can be retrieved:

https://<host>:8030/nds/files/opt/novell/eDirectory/lib64/ndsimon/public/images

2) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS, CVE-2014-5212)
The following URL demonstrates a reflected XSS flaw:

https://<host>:8030/nds/search/data?scope=st&rdn=%3C/script%20%3E%3Cscript%20%3Ealert%28%22XSS%22%29%3C/script%20%3E


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been verified to exist in the NetIQ eDirectory NDS
iMonitor version 8.8 SP8, which was the most recent version at the time of
discovery.

            policy and PGP keys
