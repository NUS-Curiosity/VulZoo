WORKAROUND INSTRUCTIONS

  HP recommends the following information to protect against potential risk
for the following HP IceWall products.

    HP IceWall SSO Dfw and MCRP

      - If possible, do not use the SHOST setting which allows IceWall SSO
Dfw or MCRP to use SSL/TLS protocol to back-end web servers.

      - The following steps should be applied if SSL/TLS protocol to back-end
web servers must be used:

        o For MCRP: apply MCRP patch release 1
        o For Dfw: apply Dfw patch release 7 or later
        o Set SSL_PROTOCOL parameter to TLSv1

    HP IceWall SSO Certd

      - For Certd version 10.0 and 8.0R3: apply DB plugin patch release 2

      - If possible, do not use the LDAPSSL setting which allows IceWall SSO
Certd to connect to the LDAP server using SSL/TLS protocol.

      - If SSL/TLS protocol must be used to LDAP server, configure the LDAP
server to use only TLSv1 as a mitigation for the vulnerability. For example,
on an OpenLDAP server (slapd), Set the TLSProtocolMin parameter.

Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.
