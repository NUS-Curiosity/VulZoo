CA20141103-01: Security Notice for CA Cloud Service Management

Issued: November 3, 2014

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to four resolved
vulnerabilities with CA Cloud Service Management. Four vulnerabilities
existed that could potentially allow a remote attacker to access user
sessions, gain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service
condition. CA Technologies fixed these vulnerabilities in all
production environments as part of the Cloud Service Management
Summer 2014 Upgrade.

attacker would have needed access to a user's environment in order to
carry out this attack.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2014-8472, involved Identity Provider
authentication token verification. An attacker would have needed to
manipulate a user in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2014-8473, is a cross-site request
forgery vulnerability. An attacker would have needed to manipulate a
user in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2014-8474, is an XML external entity
