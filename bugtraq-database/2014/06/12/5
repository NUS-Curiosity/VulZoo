Cisco IOS XR Software IPv6 Malformed Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140611-ipv6

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 June 11 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the parsing of malformed Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) packets in Cisco IOS XR Software for ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a Network Processor (NP) chip and a line card processing traffic. Only Trident-based line cards on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are affected by this vulnerability.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient logic in parsing malformed IPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of malformed IPv6 packets to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of an NP chip and a line card, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.


Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. 
There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
