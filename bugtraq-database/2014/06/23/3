Package        : samba
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0178 CVE-2014-0244 CVE-2014-3493
Debian Bug     : 

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed in Samba, a SMB/CIFS
file, print, and login server:

CVE-2014-0178

    Information leak vulnerability in the VFS code, allowing an
    authenticated user to retrieve eight bytes of uninitialized memory
    when shadow copy is enabled.

CVE-2014-0244

    Denial of service (infinite CPU loop) in the nmbd Netbios name
    service daemon. A malformed packet can cause the nmbd server to
    enter an infinite loop, preventing it to process later requests to
    the Netbios name service.

CVE-2014-3493

    Denial of service (daemon crash) in the smbd file server daemon. An
    authenticated user attempting to read a Unicode path using a
    non-Unicode request can force the daemon to overwrite memory at an
    invalid address.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u4.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
