          CVE Name        CVE-2014-4047                                       

    Description  Establishing a TCP or TLS connection to the configured HTTP  
                 or HTTPS port respectively in http.conf and then not         
                 sending or completing a HTTP request will tie up a HTTP      
                 session. By doing this repeatedly until the maximum number   
                 of open HTTP sessions is reached, legitimate requests are    
                 blocked.                                                     

    Resolution  The patched versions now have a session_inactivity timeout    
                option in http.conf that defaults to 30000 ms. Users should   
                upgrade to a corrected version, apply the released patches,   
                or disable HTTP support.
