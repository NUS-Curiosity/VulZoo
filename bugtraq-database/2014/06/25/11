1. Summary

    VMware product updates address security vulnerabilities in Apache 
    Struts library

2. Relevant releases

    VMware vCenter Operations Management Suite prior to 5.8.2

3. Problem Description

   a. The Apache Struts library is updated to version 2.3.16.2 to 
      address multiple security issues.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the names CVE-2014-0050, CVE-2014-0094, and
      CVE-2014-0112 to these issues. 

      CVE-2014-0112 may lead to remote code execution. This issue was 
      found to be only partially addressed in CVE-2014-0094.

      CVE-2014-0050 may lead to a denial of service condition.

      vCenter Operations Management Suite (vCOps) is affected by both 
      CVE-2014-0112 and CVE-2014-0050. Exploitation of CVE-2014-0112
      may lead to remote code execution without authentication. 

      vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) is affected by CVE-2014-0050 and not 
      by CVE-2014-0112.
