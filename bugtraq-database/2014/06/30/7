Notes:

Updating the library firmware requires a reboot of the library.
If the library firmware cannot be updated, HP recommends following the
Mitigation Instructions below.

Mitigation Instructions

The following configuration options that allow access to the Heartbeat
function in the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL are not enabled by default.
Verify that the following options are "disabled" using the Tape Library GUI:

Product Configuration Options to Disable TLS Heartbeat Functions

Secure SMI-S
CVTL User

Note: Disabling these features blocks the vulnerable OpenSSL function in both
the ESL G3 Tape Library and the StoreEver Enterprise Library LTO-6 Tape
Drives. The basic functionality of the library is not affected by these
configuration changes and SSL access to the user interface is not affected by
this configuration change or setting.
