[Who we are]
Hacktivity 2014 will be held between October 10-11 2014. Hacktivity conference traditionally brings together the official and alternative representatives of information security profession with all those interested in the area, in an informal, yet educational, and sometimes deep into the technical form.
[How to participate as a speaker]
This year we are offering three alternatives: you can either give a presentation as usual or you can give a hello workshop.
[Presentations]
This is the business as usual. We require similar thing as in any other IT security conference CFP. We are accepting presentations from a wide spectrum of topics including: vulnerabilities of mobile devices, hardware hacking,  attack vectors of telecommunication networks, network security, security of operating systems, browser based attacks, misuse of popular applications, database security, possibilities arisen from server errors, information gathering from business applications, malicious and mobile codes, hacking tools, information warfare, hacker subculture, social engineering, digital forensics, privacy, questions of intellectual properties. But this is just our ideas! It is up to you to apply for a presentation which is in line with the spirit of Hacktivity, namely presenting the vulnerabilities of information and communication technologies from the attackers view and techniques to avoid these attacks.
You should prepare your slide deck in English, while the presentation language can be either English or Hungarian.
As a speaker you will have a 45-minute slot to present your topic.

[Hello workshop]
We all know there is a huge difference between seeing and doing. Real knowledge grows from issuing your first command. Therefore, to help visitors start off learning we organize hello workshop again. A hello workshop should meet the following requirements 
- participants should acquire a definite and useful piece of knowledge;
- it is expected that participants bring their own laptop and that�s all;
- workshop will not have more than 16 attendees;
- it should fit into 20 plus 20 minutes (seeing plus doing) from preparation to take-aways.

It is a challenge isn�t it? But we are sure you can make it! Some of our ideas to get started:
- hello iptables (configuration of sample network, VPN configuration)
- hello metasploit
- hello buffer overflow
- hello rootkits (how to detect)
- hello virus (watch how to catch)
- hello web attacks (XSS, CSRF etc)
- hello injections (SQL, LDAP etc.)
