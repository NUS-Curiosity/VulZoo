         CVE Name       CVE-2014-3566                                         

   Description The POODLE vulnerability - described under CVE-2014-3566 - is  
               described at                                                   
               https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566.  
               This advisory describes the Asterisk's project susceptibility  
               to this vulnerability.                                         
                                                                              
               The POODLE vulnerability consists of two issues:               
                                                                              
               1) A vulnerability in the SSL protocol version 3.0. This       
               vulnerability has no known solution.                           
                                                                              
               2) The ability to force a fallback to SSLv3 when a TLS         
               connection is negotiated.                                      
                                                                              
               Asterisk is susceptible to both portions of the vulnerability  
               in different places.                                           
                                                                              
               1) The res_jabber and res_xmpp module both use SSLv3           
               exclusively, and are hence susceptible to POODLE.              
                                                                              
               2) The core TLS handling, used by the chan_sip channel driver, 
               Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), and the Asterisk HTTP        
               server, defaults to allowing SSLv3/SSLv2 fallback. This allows 
               a MITM to potentially force a connection to fallback to SSLv3, 
               exposing it to the POODLE vulnerability.                       

    Resolution  Asterisk has been patched such that it no longer uses SSLv3   
                for the res_jabber/res_xmpp modules. Additionally, when the   
                encryption method is not specified, the default handling in   
                the TLS core no longer allows for a fallback to SSLv3 or      
                SSLv2.                                                        
                                                                              
                1) Users of Asterisk's res_jabber or res_xmpp modules should  
                upgrade to the versions of Asterisk specified in this         
                advisory.                                                     
                                                                              
                2) Users of Asterisk's chan_sip channel driver, AMI, and      
                HTTP server may set the "tlsclientmethod" or                  
                "sslclientmethod" to "tlsv1" to force TLSv1 as the only       
                allowed encryption method. Alternatively, they may also       
                upgrade to the versions of Asterisk specified in this         
                advisory. Users of Asterisk are encouraged to NOT specify     
                "sslv2" or "sslv3". Doing so will now emit a WARNING.
