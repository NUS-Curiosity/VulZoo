 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:209
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : java-1.7.0-openjdk
 Date    : October 24, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in
 java-1.7.0-openjdk:
 
 Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot
 components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet
 could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2014-6506, CVE-2014-6531, CVE-2014-6502, CVE-2014-6511,
 CVE-2014-6504, CVE-2014-6519).
 
 It was discovered that the StAX XML parser in the JAXP component in
 OpenJDK performed expansion of external parameter entities even when
 external entity substitution was disabled. A remote attacker could
 use this flaw to perform XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attack against
 applications using the StAX parser to parse untrusted XML documents
 (CVE-2014-6517).
 
 It was discovered that the DatagramSocket implementation in OpenJDK
 failed to perform source address checks for packets received on a
 connected socket. A remote attacker could use this flaw to have their
 packets processed as if they were received from the expected source
 (CVE-2014-6512).
 
 It was discovered that the TLS/SSL implementation in the JSSE component
 in OpenJDK failed to properly verify the server identity during
 the renegotiation following session resumption, making it possible
 for malicious TLS/SSL servers to perform a Triple Handshake attack
 against clients using JSSE and client certificate authentication
 (CVE-2014-6457).
 
 It was discovered that the CipherInputStream class implementation
 in OpenJDK did not properly handle certain exceptions. This could
 possibly allow an attacker to affect the integrity of an encrypted
 stream handled by this class (CVE-2014-6558).
 
 The updated packages provides a solution for these security issues.
