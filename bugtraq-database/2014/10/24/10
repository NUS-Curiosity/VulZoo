Subject: OpenBSD <= 5.5 Local Kernel Panic

OpenBSD <= 5.5 (All architectures) is prone to a local DoS condition by triggering a kernel panic through a malformed ELF executable.

A patch has been released to address this issue. See "013 Reliability Fix" at: 
http://www.openbsd.org/errata55.html#013_kernexec
