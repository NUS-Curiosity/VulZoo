Background:
This is exactly the XSS vulnerability that made IE fall in 2004:
"US Government warns against Internet Explorer"
http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037530/us-government-warns-internet-explorer
"Vulnerability Note VU#713878", "HTTP Redirection", "showModalDialog"
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878
Microsoft had not fixed it properly for a decade.
I am the original author of this vulnerability.
I made IE market share fall in 2004, and changed the web permanently.
Back then, there was no "Local Machine Zone Lockdown", and XSS could get remote code execution.

It's cross "language family".
For English "divine", I could have chosen "deity".
For Chinese "tiānzhŭ", I could have chosen "tien"(天 Wade-Giles, meaning: sky/god/day).

Got this name "Dieyu" from sky when I was born:
There was an extremely huge butterfly("die"), and extremely heavy rain("yu").
