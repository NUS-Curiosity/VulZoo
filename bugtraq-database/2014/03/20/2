[Overview]
Going into our sixth year, Shakacon offers attendees a unique
opportunity to really network with
some of the world's top security professionals in casual and friendly
setting.  At its heart the 
Shakacon security conference is a laid back conference where industry,
government, academia 
and independent experts will get together to share knowledge and
experience in one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.  

The conference committee strives to build a balanced schedule that
appeals to all security practitioners
with talks covering all different aspects of the information security
landscape.  There will be something 
for everyone and if sitting through talks isn't your cup of Hawaiian
coffee you can step into one of the 
social areas and talk with our sponsors, staff, and attendees.


[Trainer Opportunities]
Don't want to speak at the Con but have an uncanny ability to teach and
a proven track record for 
delivering quality courseware and want to come to Hawaii? We will be
evaluating trainers for one day of
training leading up to Shakacon (June 23rd).  Submit a synopsis/class
agenda, prior teaching experience, 
and maybe get selected to teach in Hawaii.  Revenue is split 50/50
between the trainer and conference.
The conference will cover all venue related costs (A/V, Food, Drinks,
etc.).  The trainer is expected
to cover their own travel costs (unless they are also selected as a
speaker).  All selected trainers
will receive free admission to the conference.

 
[CFP Details]

We have up to sixteen (16) spots and typically receive 100+ submissions
to speak.  If you are serious about
