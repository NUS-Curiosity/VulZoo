Subject: [oCERT-2014-003] LibYAML input sanitization errors


#2014-003 LibYAML input sanitization errors

Description:

The LibYAML project is an open source YAML 1.1 parser and emitter written in
C.

The library is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow which can lead to
arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is caused by lack of proper
expansion for the string passed to the yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes()
function.

A specially crafted YAML file, with a long sequence of percent-encoded
characters in a URL, can be used to trigger the overflow.

Affected version:

LibYAML <= 0.1.5

Fixed version:

LibYAML >= 0.1.6
