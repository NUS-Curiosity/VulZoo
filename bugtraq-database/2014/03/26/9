Cisco IOS Software Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140326-ikev2

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 March 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device that would lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to how an affected device processes certain malformed IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device that would lead to a DoS condition.

Although IKEv2 is automatically enabled on Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software devices when the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) is enabled, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv2 packet.

Only IKEv2 packets can trigger this vulnerability.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.
There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
