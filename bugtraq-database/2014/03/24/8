 vulnerability

Deutsche Telekom CERT Advisory [DTC-A-20140324-004]

Summary:
An Off-by-one memory access was found in the web gui of nagios.

A patch was applied to the core master branch of nagios (http://sourceforge.net/p/nagios/nagioscore/ci/d97e03f32741a7d851826b03ed73ff4c9612a866/).
This resolution is announced to be rolled into the 4.0.3 version of Nagios Core once testing has been completed.

There has been no feedback regarding the Version 3.5 branch of nagios, but the current sources seem to indicate that the issue was patched in version 3.5 as well. The issue should be fixed in the next release.

Recommendations:
Bug fixes in the source code available. Install updated packages as soon these packages are available.

a1) Nagios 3.5.0 [CVE-2013-7108]
b1) Off-by-one memory access
c1) 4.9 AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P
d1) The icinga and nagios web gui are susceptible to an "off-by-one read" error, which is resulting from an improper assumption in the handling of user submitted CGI parameters. To prevent buffer overflow attacks against the web gui, icinga/nagios checks for valid string length of user submitted parameters. Any parameter, which is bigger than MAX_INPUT_BUFFER-1 characters long will be discarded. However, by sending a specially crafted cgi parameter, the check routine can be forced to skip the terminating null pointer and read the heap address right after the end of the parameter list. Depending on the memory layout, this may result in a memory corruption condition/crash or reading of sensitive memory locations.
