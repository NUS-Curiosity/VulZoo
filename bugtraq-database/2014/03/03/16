Subject: CFP: Passwords^14, Las Vegas, August 5-6

PasswordsCon will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, August 5th & 6th, at
Tuscany Suites & Casino, 255 East Flamingo Rd., Las Vegas.

Yes, we are teaming up with BsidesLV and co-locating with them. 2-for-1
conference action - all for the low, low price of FREE!

For the first time we'll expand into 2 tracks, offensive & defensive.

We are looking for tools & techniques on creating, retrieving, cracking,
storing, sending & resetting passwords and PINs. Think you have *the*
replacement for passwords? Please, challenge us. We'd like to see common
japanese passphrases analyzed. Enterprise password management solutions.
Adaptive online rate-limiting algorithms for logins & password resets.
Visual cryptography passwords. Grammar-based passphrase generators for
Russian, Swedish, Arabic and Yiddish. Keystroke dynamics, fingerprint
spoofing, you name it. Pretty much anything that has to do with
passwords & PINs basically.

Previous speakers at PasswordsCon include:
Jens Steube (Hashcat), Joan Daemen (AES, SHA-3), Dmitry Sklyarov
(Elcomsoft), Andrey Belenko (viaForensics), Dmitry Sumin (Passware),
Jeremi Gosney, BitWeasil (Cryptohaze), James Nobis (freerainbowtables),
