Debian Security Advisory DSA-2938-1                   security@...ian.org

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial organisation and setup of Squeeze LTS has now happened and 
it is ready for taking over security support once the standard security 
support ends at the end of the month:


Information for users
=====================

Support for Squeeze LTS will end five years after the release of Squeeze, 
i.e. until the 6th of February 2016.

You need to enable the apt sources for squeeze-lts manually. 
Information on how to do this can be found at
https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Add_squeeze-lts_to_your_sources.list

You should also subscribe to the new annoucement mailing list for 
security updates for squeeze-lts:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/

A few packages are not covered by the Squeeze LTS support. These can be
detected with the new tool debian-security-support. Information on how
to run it can be found here:
https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Check_for_unsupported_packages

If debian-security-support detects an unsupported package which is 
critical to you, please get in touch with debian-lts@...ts.debian.org
(see below).

squeeze-backports will continue to be supported for the lifetime of 
Squeeze LTS.



Information for Debian maintainers
==================================

First of all, Debian package maintainers are not expected to work on 
updates of their packages for squeeze-lts. Package updates for 
squeeze-lts will be handled by the Debian LTS team.

However, if you _are_ interested in doing so (and the maintainer always
knows best on a package), you're certainly welcome to do so; everyone
in the Debian.org and Debian maintainers key ring can upload to the 
squeeze-lts suite. Information on how to upload a fixed package can 
be found at https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Upload_Packages



Mailing lists
=============

The whole coordination of the Debian LTS effort is handled through the
debian-lts mailing list: https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/

Please subscribe or follow us via GMANE (gmane.linux.debian.devel.lts)

Aside from the debian-lts-announce list, there's also a list for 
following all uploads in debian-lts: 
https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-changes/



Security Tracker
================

All information on the status of vulnerabilities (e.g. if the version in 
squeeze-lts happens to be unaffected while wheezy is affected) will be 
tracked in the Debian Security Tracker:  

http://security-tracker.debian.org

If you happen to spot an error in the data, please see 
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report
