Subject: t2'14: Call for Papers 2014 (Helsinki / Finland)

# t2'14 - Call For Papers (Helsinki, Finland) - October 23 - 24, 2014
#

Do you feel like Las Vegas is too hot, Berlin too bohème, Miami too humid, Singapore too clean and Pattaya just totally confusing ? No worries! Helsinki will be the perfect match for you – guaranteed low temperature, high tech and just enough regulation to make everything appear to be under control. This is the country where indestructible mobile phone and Linux kernel were invented.

Helsinki, the capital of Finland, known for the Finnish design and casual-yet-almost-sophisticated drinking culture offers you the chance to familiarize yourself with the birth place of many popular PC, console and mobile games. The murder rate of only 2.2 per 100 000 people makes Finland one of the safest countries for delivering a presentation. Do polar bears roam free in Helsinki? How do you go from being silent in three languages to having incoherent discussions in all of them? What does 176% mobile penetration look like? Come and see for yourself!

t2'14 is looking for technical infosec presentations with original content. Whether it’s your complicated relationship with the APT, embedded device exploitation, tactics and operational procedures in high stress / high risk operations, implementing or avoiding global surveillance, latest advances in offensive/defensive applications of computer science, the gospel of weird machine, breaking the Internet, reverse engineering milware or something totally different, we’d like to hear about it.

The advisory board will be reviewing submissions until 2014-07-04. First come, first served. No returns, no refunds.
