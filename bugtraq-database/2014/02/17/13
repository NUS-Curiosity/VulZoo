Package        : file
Vulnerability  : denial of service
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1943
Debian Bug     : 738832

It was discovered that file, a file type classification tool, contains a
flaw in the handling of "indirect" magic rules in the libmagic library,
which leads to an infinite recursion when trying to determine the file
type of certain files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
ID CVE-2014-1943 has been assigned to identify this flaw. Additionally,
other well-crafted files might result in long computation times (while
using 100% CPU) and overlong results.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.04-5+squeeze3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.11-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.
