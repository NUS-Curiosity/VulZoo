Subject: ASUS AiCloud Enabled Routers 12 Models - Authentication bypass and
 Sensitive file/path disclosure

ASUS routers, which are enabled with the AiCloud service (SSL ports),
are vulnerable to bypass of authentication and sensitive file
disclosure. This vulnerability has been observed in all firmware
versions, though the latest version increases the complexity of the
attack. By sending a special crafted packet, an attacker can exploit a
weakness in the software by calling a non existent file /smb.xml. This
attack leads to sensitive path disclosure and directory traversal.

On the latest 3.0.0.4.374.2xxx firmware versions, specifically in the
the 66 and 68 series routers, have shown a weakness that may allow an
attacker to exploit the /smb.xml vulnerability with a specially
crafted packet to cause a short term denial of service to the AiCloud
service.

The full details were disclosed to the Vendor last month. There are no
known patches or workarounds at this time other than turning off any
remote access to the AiCloud service.

This is not directly related to the clear text password disclosure
made last July. Also, it is strongly advised that the password to the
administrative side of the router be changed from the default, since
hijacking the routers VPN service becomes trivial once access to the
admin console is obtained.
