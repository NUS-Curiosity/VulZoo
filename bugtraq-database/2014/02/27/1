Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Barracuda Backup Service is a complete and affordable data backup solution. The Barracuda Backup 
Server provides a full local data backup and is combined with a storage subscription to replicate 
data to two offsite locations. This approach provides the best of both worlds - onsite backups for 
fast restore times and secure, offsite storage for disaster recovery. Block level deduplication is 
applied inline to reduce traditional backup storage requirements by 20 to 50 times while also 
reducing backup windows and bandwidth requirements. Cloud Storage with Deduplication

Barracuda Backup Subscription plans provide diverse offsite storage at affordable monthly fees that 
scale to meet increasing data requirements.

    * Secure backup to two geo-separate data centers
    * Deduplicated efficient backup storage
    * Redundant disk-based storage
    * Best-of-breed data retention policies
    * Web interface multi-location management
    * Restore by Web, FTP and Windows software

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Barracuda Networks Backup appliance web-application.
The bugs allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code on the application side (persistent) of the service.

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `remote_host` value of the `Extern Backup` module. Remote attackers are able 
to inject via POST method request own malcious script codes as remote_host. The result is the persistent (application-side) 
execution out in the vulnerable remote_host list module. The attack vector is persistent on the application-side and the 
request method to inject is POST. The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as 
medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5(+)|(-)3.6.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a low privileged web-application appliance 
user account. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent session hijacking (admin/auditor), persistent 
phishing (application-side), persistent external redirect and persistent manipulation of affected or connected vulnerable modules.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Section(s):
				[+] Jetz Sichern

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Extern Backup > Ziel hinzufügen (Add Target) - Listing 

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] remote_host (Exception-Handling) - Error (Invalid)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with low privileged application user account and 
low required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the remote_host value in the `Extern Backup` module of the `Ziel hinzufügen` function.
Restrict the remote_host input fields and filter the POST method request after the regular mask validation to prevent script code injection attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent web vulnerability is estimated as medium because of  the location in the remote_host exception-handling.
