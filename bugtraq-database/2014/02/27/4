Vendor/product description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"SAS is a software suite developed by SAS Institute for advanced analytics, 
business intelligence, data management, and predictive analytics. 
It is the largest market-share holder for advanced analytics.
SAS is a software suite that can mine, alter, manage and retrieve data from 
a variety of sources and perform statistical analysis on it. It is widely 
used in insurance, public health, scientific research, finance, human resources, 
IT, utilities, and retail, and is used for operations research, project 
management, quality improvement, forecasting and decision-making. It is the 
standard statistical analysis software for submitting clinical pharmaceutical 
trials to the US Food and Drug administration. SAS provides a graphical 
point-and-click user interface for non-technical users and more advanced 
options through the SAS programming language. SAS programs have a DATA step, 
which retrieves and manipulates data, and a PROC step, which analyzes data."

Business recommendation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attackers are able to completely compromise SAS clients when a malicious
SAS program gets executed.

The scope of the test, where the vulnerabilities had been identified, was a
very short crash-test of the application. It is assumed that further
vulnerabilities exist within this product!

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult not to use this software until a
thorough security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.



Vulnerability overview/description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to exploit a buffer overflow in the SAS client application by
creating a malicious SAS program. When a user opens the SAS program the
malicious content will be hidden because the enhanced editor does not display
overlong lines. If the user executes the program a buffer overflow will be 
triggered resulting in arbitrary code execution. It was possible to exploit 
this vulnerability on a updated standard Windows 7 installation.


Proof of concept:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The detailed proof of concept exploit was removed for this vulnerability.

SEC Consult has released a proof of concept video demonstrating the issue:
