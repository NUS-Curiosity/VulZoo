Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] - Reflected XSS vulnerability
 in Boxcryptor (www.boxcryptor.com)

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2014-001
- Original release date: February 4, 2014
- Last revised: February 4, 2014
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 4.3/10 (CVSSv2 Base Scored)
- CVE-ID: -
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Reflected XSS vulnerability in Boxcryptor (www.boxcryptor.com).


II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Boxcryptor is an easy-to-use encryption software optimized for the
cloud. It allows the secure use of cloud storage services without
sacrificing comfort.

Boxcryptor supports all major cloud storage providers (such as Dropbox,
Google Drive, Microsoft SkyDrive, SugarSync) and supports all the clouds
that use the

WebDAV standard (such as Cubby, Strato HiDrive, and ownCloud).


III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Has been detected a XSS vulnerability in www.boxcryptor.com.

Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which
malicious scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web
sites.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web
application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser
side script, to a

different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite
widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user
in the output

it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted,

and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a
trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session
tokens, or other

sensitive information retained by your browser and used with that site.
These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.


IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Next, we show a typical request to save changes in "My Account" option:

POST /app/user/modify/<userID> HTTP/1.1
Host: www.boxcryptor.com
...
firstname=<firstname>&lastname=<lastname>&username=<email>&_newsletter=

where:
- <userID> is a numeric user ID generated by boxcryptor
- <firstname> is the firstname specified by the user
- <lastname> is the lastname specified by the user
- <email> is the email address specified by the user

A malicious user can inject arbitrary HTML/script code in the <email>
parameter.
For example:

POST /app/user/modify/3805739018726483071 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.boxcryptor.com
...
firstname=John&lastname=Smith&username=johnsmith@...il.com<H1><center>This+is+a+XSS+example</center></H1>&_newsletter=


V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a targeted
user's browser. This can leverage to steal sensitive information as user
credentials,

personal data, etc.
