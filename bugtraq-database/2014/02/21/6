Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
5.7


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
The Barracuda Firewall goes beyond traditional network firewalls and UTMs by providing powerful network security, 
granular layer 7 application controls, user awareness and secure VPN connectivity combined with cloud-based malware 
protection, content filtering and reporting. It alleviates the performance bottlenecks in Unified Threat Management 
(UTM) appliances through intelligent integration of on-premise and cloud-based technologies. While the powerful on-
premises appliance is optimized for tasks like packet forwarding and routing, Intrusion Prevention (IPS), DNS/DHCP 
services and site-to-site connectivity; CPU intensive tasks like virus scanning, content filtering and usage 
reporting benefit from the scalable performance and elasticity of the cloud.

Affected Product(s):
====================
Barracuda Networks
Product: Firewall Appliance Web-Application 6.1.0.016 - x100 x200 x300 x400 x500 x600 & Vx


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A input validation web vulnerability is detected in the official Barracuda Networks Firewall Appliance Web-Application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject own malicious persistent script codes (application side).

The vulnerability is located in the `VPN > Certificates` module when processing to request via POST to GET method manipulated 
`cert_error` parameters in the secure application exception-handling. The code will be directly executed in the main header 
on top inside of the error message. The issue impact a persistent and a non-persistent issue.

The attacker goes to the certificates area and uploads even in the restricted mode 2 pem certs, he tampers the request and 
exchange the upload path and drops also a invalid value to the name. The application will respond with a GET and drop a unknown 
error message in the exception-handling of the module. The attacker is changing the referer and includes his own code in the 
client-side affected parameter. Now the links in the main website will change to the error link persistent. The attacker is now 
able to easily click the link or request the url to execute the code inside of the exception-handling contents`>Error message.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a local low privileged web-application account. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent web 
attacks, persistent phishing or persistent manipulation of module context.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] VPN > Certificates

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] cert_error (contents:error)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Exception-Handling - Error Message


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The input validation vulnerability in the exception-handling can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account 
and low user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided steps and information below to continue.

1. You need to request the regular module ... 
https://firewall.localhost:8080/cgi-bin/index.cgi?&et=1380384291&locale=en_US&encrypt_password=&user=guest&primary_tab=VPN&secondary_tab=certificates&

2. Provoke an error inside of the regular protected exception-handling via upload pem:
https://firewall.localhost:8080/cgi-bin/index.cgi?&et=1380384291&locale=en_US&encrypt_password=&user=guest&primary_tab=VPN&secondary_tab=certificates&cert_error=Unknown%20operation#key0

3. After the redirect with the url to the error happened the attacker is able to change the exception input variable to execute own codes
https://firewall.localhost:8080/cgi-bin/index.cgi?&et=1380384291&locale=en_US&encrypt_password=&user=guest&primary_tab=VPN&secondary_tab=certificates&cert_error=%3E%22%3Ciframe%20src=b%3E

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The remote web vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the error message context inside of the firewall certificate error exception-handling.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium to high because of the location in the secure application exception-handling.
