Conference Background
=====================
IT security is an integral aspect in operating IT systems today. Yet,
as even high-end precautionary measures cannot prevent every attack or
security mishap, forensic capabilities in investigating such incidents
in both technical and legal aspects are paramount. Capable incident
response and forensic procedures have thus gained essential relevance in
IT infrastructure operations and in law-enforcement, and there is ample
need for research and standardization in this area.

Since 2003, the IMF conference has established itself as one of the
premier European venues for presenting research on IT security incident
response and management and IT forensics.

Conference Goals
================
IMF's intent is to gather experts from throughout the world in order to
present and discuss recent technical and methodical advances in the
fields of IT security incident response and management and IT forensics.
The conference provides a platform for collaboration and exchange of
ideas between industry, academia, law-enforcement and other government
bodies.
