addresses the following:

Available for:

Impact:  An attacker in a privileged network position may obtain
memory contents
Description:  An out-of-bounds read issue existed in the OpenSSL
library when handling TLS heartbeat extension packets. An attacker in

802.11ac are affected, and only if they have Back to My Mac or Send
Diagnostics enabled. Other AirPort base stations are not impacted by
this issue.
