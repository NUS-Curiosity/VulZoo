Subject: Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2014-04-08

Product: Open-Xchange AppSuite
Vendor: Open-Xchange GmbH

Vulnerability type: Information exposure (CWE-200)
Vulnerable version: 7.4.2 and earlier
Vulnerable component: frontend
Fixed version: 7.4.2-rev13, 7.4.1-rev11, 7.2.2-rev20
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Vendor notification: 2014-02-27
Solution date: 2014-03-24
Public disclosure: 2013-04-08
CVE reference: CVE-2014-2391
OX bug reference: 31342
CVSSv2: 3.3 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:M/C:C/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:W/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:H/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)

Vulnerability Details:
When using the password recovery service, e.g. after externally modifying a users password, the corresponding call contains passwords within a parameter of a GET request.

Risk:
If attackers could intercept the communication between client and server, sensitive information is exposed via the request URL. This is possible regardless if content encryption (e.g. SSL) is used. The other risk is, that parameters of GET requests may get logged at the providers web server or load balancer log files. Unauthorised personell could get access to these log files to gain access to the corresponding account. In this case, the previous password of the user is transmitted, which does not allow direct access. However, an attacker could use the old password to spot patterns within a users password policy - or try using the password at other services.

Solution:
Users should update to the latest patch releases. Providers should apply tight access controls to log files or temporarily avoid logging this specific request.

Vulnerability type: Cross Site Scripting (CWE-80)
Vulnerable version: 7.4.1 and 7.4.2
Vulnerable component: frontend
Fixed version: 7.4.2-rev13, 7.4.1-rev11
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Vendor notification: 2014-03-12
Solution date: 2014-03-24
Public disclosure: 2013-04-08
CVE reference: CVE-2014-2393
OX bug reference: 31547
CVSSv2: 5.7 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:POC/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:LM/TD:H/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)

Vulnerability Details:
Script code that gets entered to the name of a file in Drive, gets executed when attaching that file to an E-Mail from within the composer.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

Solution:
Users should update to the latest patch releases. Users should avoid accepting suspicious files. In this case, most operating system deny or automatically rename such file names so the user or an attacker need to actively rename the file.
