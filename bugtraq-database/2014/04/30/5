Vendor description:

used internationally to build and manage websites of all types, from small
sites for non-profits to multilingual enterprise solutions for large
corporations."

Software description:
---------------------
"'BibTex Publications' allows you to import Bibtex files from the front-end
and store them in a sysfolder. The front-end plug-in generates list and single
views of entries and provides a simple search tool. It allows also the
automatic import of BibTex files"

Source: http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/si_bibtex/0.2.3/


Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker is able to gain
full access to the Typo3 database. He can use this access to crack the stored
backend user passwords which would then lead to a complete system compromise
on success. Depending on the location where the extension is used in the web
application, this may be possible by an unauthenticated attacker.

It is highly recommended to uninstall the si_bibtex extension until the
vulnerabilities are fixed.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The vulnerable plugin (si_bibtex) is used to import, export and view
bibliography files used for scientific citation. Flaws in the input validation
of this software lead to SQL injection and persistent cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities.

1) SQL injection

The bibtex "search" and "list" allows a user to display specific bibtex items.
Due to insufficient input validation of a parameter, an attacker can inject
into the SQL query statement. By exploiting this vulnerability, an
attacker gains access to all records stored in the database with the
privileges of the Typo3 database user.

2) Persistent cross-site scripting

The bibtex "import" functionality is prone to persistent cross-site scripting
attacks. The vulnerability can be used to include HTML or JavaScript code to
the affected web page. The imported XSS code will be displayed to every user
who calls the "search" or "list" functionality of this extension.



Proof of concept:
-----------------
No proof of concept code available due to missing solution/workaround.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version of the si_bibtex extension has been tested, which was
the most recent version at the time of discovery.
si_bibtex 0.2.3
