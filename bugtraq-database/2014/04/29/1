Subject: [ANN][SECURITY] ClassLoader manipulation issue confirmed for Struts
 1 - CVE-2014-0114

The Apache Struts project team confirms that Struts 1 in all versions is
affected by a ClassLoader manipulation vulnerability similar to a
recently fixed vulnerability in Struts 2 (CVE-2014-0112, CVE-2014-0094) [1].

This is a different underlying flaw. For future reference, please use
CVE-2014-0114 in regards to this issue.

Struts 1 has had its End-Of-Life announcement one year ago. In a cross
project effort, the Struts team is looking for a correction or
mitigation path though. Please stay tuned for further information
regarding a solution.

This is a cross-list posting. If you have questions regarding this
report, please direct them to security@...uts.apache.org only.
