Package        : prosody

A denial-of-service vulnerability has been reported in Prosody, a XMPP 
server. If compression is enabled, an attacker might send highly-com-
pressed XML elements (attack known as "zip bomb") over XMPP streams and 
consume all the resources of the server.

The SAX XML parser lua-expat is also affected by this issues.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.2-4+deb7u1 of prosody.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1 of prosody.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-5+deb7u1 of lua-expat.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0-1 lua-expat.

We recommend that you upgrade your prosody and lua-expat packages.
