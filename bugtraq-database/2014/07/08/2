HP recommends the following mitigation information to protect against
potential risk for the following HP IceWall products.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw and MCRP

If possible, do not use SHOST setting which allows IceWall SSO Dfw or MCRP to
use SSL/TLS for back-end web server connection.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw Certd

If possible, set LDAPSSL to 0 to make HP SSO IceWall Certd to not use SSL/TLS
on any connection with LDAP server.

Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.
