Package        : devscripts
Vulnerability  : arbitrary code execution
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6888

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in uscan, a tool to scan
upstream sits for new releases of packages, which is part of the
devscripts package. An attacker controlling a website from which uscan
would attempt to download a source tarball could execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running uscan.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project id CVE-2013-6888 has
been assigned to identify them.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.6+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.13.9.

We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts packages.
