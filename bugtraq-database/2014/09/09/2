Vulnerable: IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Integrated Solutions Console 7.0.0.19

DISCUSSION:
IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) contains a flaw that allows a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the login page of the Integrated Solutions Console does not validate input to the 'username' parameter before returning it to users. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in the 'Welcome [username]' message at the top of the dashboard page upon logging in.

The finding exists in a version that was released after this class of vulnerability was patched by IBM, and so is newer than a recommended version by IBM to upgrade to for protection from this particular class of vulnerability. Subsequent releases may protect against this issue.
