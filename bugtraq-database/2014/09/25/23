 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:189
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nss
 Date    : September 25, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected in Mozilla NSS:
 
 Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris in
 team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS)
 libraries affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable
 to a variant of a signature forgery attack previously published
 by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is due to lenient parsing of ASN.1
 values involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA
 certificates (CVE-2014-1568).
 
 The updated NSPR packages have been upgraded to the latest 4.10.7
 version.
 
 The updated NSS packages have been upgraded to the latest 3.17.1
 version which is not vulnerable to this issue.
 
 Additionally the rootcerts package has also been updated to the latest
 version as of 2014-08-05.
