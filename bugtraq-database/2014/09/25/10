Cisco IOS Software Metadata Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140924-metadata

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 September 24 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
+======

Two vulnerabilities in the metadata flow feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to reload a vulnerable device.

The vulnerabilities are due to improper handling of transit RSVP packets that need to be processed by the metadata infrastructure. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malformed RSVP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an extended denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.
