Subject: [The ManageOwnage Series, part V]: RCE / file upload / arbitrary file
 deletion in OpManager, Social IT and IT360

Hi,

This is the fifth part of the ManageOwnage series. For previous parts, see:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Aug/55
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Aug/75
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Aug/88
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/1

This time we have a file upload with directory traversal as well as an
arbitrary file deletion vulnerability. The file upload can be abused
to deliver a WAR payload in the Tomcat webapps directory, which will
deploy a malicious Servlet allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary
code.

Details are below, and the usual Metasploit module has been submitted
and should be available soon (see pull request
https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/3903).

>> Fix:
Upgrade to OpManager 11.3, then install the patch in
https://support.zoho.com/portal/manageengine/helpcenter/articles/servlet-vulnerability-fix
This patch can be applied to all the applications but only for the
latest version of each (OpManager 11.3, Social IT 11.0, IT360 10.4).
ManageEngine have indicated that the soon to be released OpManager
version 11.4 might not have the fix as the release is almost ready.
They are planning to include the fix in OpManager version 11.5 which
should be released sometime in late November or December 2014. No
indication was given for when fixed versions of IT360 and Social IT
Plus will be released.
