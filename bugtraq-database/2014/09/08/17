Reported by
===================
This issue was reported to the vendor by Christian Schneider (@cschneider4711) 
following a responsible disclosure process.


Severity
===================
High


Description
===================
Using specially crafted requests to access the web interface of JobScheduler it is possible 
as an underprivileged user ("info" permission) to list directories and read contents of 
(sensitive) files from the installation of the JobScheduler web interface, which includes 
datasource configurations (for example hibernate.cfg.xml and sos_settings.ini) as well 
as permission config files (scheduler.xml). These can include passwords, depending on 
which auth backend was defined. This can also be misused to escalate to the higher "all" 
permission from the lower "info" permission.


Proof of concept
===================
Due to the responsible disclosure process chosen and to not harm unpatched systems, 
no concrete exploit code will be presented in this advisory.
