Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Avira
Product: License - Web Application Service 2014 Q3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A cross site request forgery web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Avira License online-service web-application.
The issue allows attackers to prepare malicious pages with client-side requests to execute internal function without token protection.

The license account system web server of avira uses unvalidted tokens without protection against cross site request forgery attacks.
The researcher discovered an exploit with a POST method request to unauthorized capture session information of an avira user account 
on interaction. The target user with the non expired session can be redirected to a malicious webpage to steal the account information. 
After the account information has been captured the attacker can silently login by usage of the compromised session information. 
The problem is located in the `ajax-update-contact` module of the avira license webpage web-application request.

The security risk of the csrf vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.4.
Exploitation of the cross site request forgery vulnerability requires no privileged application user account but medium or high 
user interaction. Successful exploitation of the cross site request forgery issue results in account theft.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Service(s):
				[+] Avira - Web Application

Vulnerable Function(s):
