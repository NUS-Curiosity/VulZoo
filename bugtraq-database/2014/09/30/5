Subject: London DEFCON - September 30th 2014

Yes, that's tonight!

Apologies for the late notice - I've been travelling. A lot.

In the meantime, The Phoenix finished their refurb and is back up and 
running, and looking pretty swanky, so I'm looking forward to seeing 
what's new... Let's hope they haven't changed the beer! :)

We don't have any specific talks scheduled for this month, but as 
always, if you've got something interesting you want to present, feel 
free to come along and we'll let you have the floor...

I will also be bringing my RFIDler and a bunch of blank & example tags 
with me, so if you've got any LF tags you want to examine and/or 
potentially clone, bring them down and we'll take a look... I'll also 
have my other RFID gear with me, so we can do a mini workshop kind of 
thing...
