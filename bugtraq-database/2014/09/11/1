Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3613 CVE-2014-3620

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. They can be use to leak cookie information:

CVE-2014-3613

    By not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP
    addresses properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can
    be fooled to both sending cookies to wrong sites and into allowing
    arbitrary sites to set cookies for others.

CVE-2014-3620

    libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains
    (TLDs), thus making them apply broader than cookies are allowed.
    This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get
    sent to a different and unrelated site or domain.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy10.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.38.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.38.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
