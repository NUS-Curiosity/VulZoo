Package        : acpi-support
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0484

During a review for EDF, Raphael Geissert discovered that the
acpi-support package did not properly handle data obtained from a
user's environment. This could lead to program malfunction or allow a
local user to escalate privileges to the root user due to a programming
error.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.140-5+deb7u3.

For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid)
this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your acpi-support packages.
