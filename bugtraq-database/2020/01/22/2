========================================================================

Description
-----------
A reflected XSS vulnerability has been discovered in the publicly
accessible afr.php delivery script of Revive Adserver by Jacopo Tediosi.
There are currently no known exploits: the session identifier cannot
be accessed as it is stored in an http-only cookie as of v3.2.2. On
older versions, however, under specific circumstances, it could be
possible to steal the session identifier and gain access to the admin
interface.

Details
-------
The query string sent to the www/delivery/afr.php script was printed
back without proper escaping in a JavaScript context, allowing an
attacker to execute arbitrary JS code on the browser of the victim.
