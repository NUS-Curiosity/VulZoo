Subject: CVE-2020-2656 - Low impact information disclosure via Solaris xlock

Dear Bugtraq,

Please find attached an advisory for the following vulnerability, fixed in Oracle's Critical Patch Update (CPU) of January 2020:

"A low impact information disclosure vulnerability in the setuid root xlock binary distributed with Solaris may allow local users to read partial contents
of sensitive files. Due to the fact that target files must be in a very specific format, exploitation of this flaw to escalate privileges in a realistic scenario is unlikely."

Regards,
