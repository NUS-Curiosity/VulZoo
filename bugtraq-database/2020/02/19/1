Package        : python-django
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-7471
Debian Bug     : 950581

Simon Charette discovered that Django, a high-level Python web
development framework, did not properly handle input in its PostgreSQL
module. A remote attacker could leverage this to perform SQL injection
attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.10.7-2+deb9u8.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.11.28-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

For the detailed security status of python-django please refer to
its security tracker page at:
