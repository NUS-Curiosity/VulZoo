I. Background
----------------------------
"For three decades we've been helping people to protect their digital 
worlds. From a small,
dynamic company we've grown into a global brand with over 110 million 
users in 202 countries
and territories. Many things have changed, but our core aspirations, 
philosophy and values
remain the same â€“ to help build a more secure digital world where 
everyone can truly Enjoy
Safer Technology."

II. Description
----------------------------
The parsing engine supports the ZIP archive format. The parsing engine 
can be bypassed
by specifically manipulating an ZIP Archive Compression Information 
Field so that it can
be accessed by an end-user but not the Anti-Virus software. The AV 
engine is unable to
scan the container and gives the file a "clean" rating.

I may release further details after all known vulnerable vendors have 
patched their products.


III. Impact
----------------------------
Impacts depends on the contextual use of the product and engine within 
the organisation
of a customer. Gateway Products (Email, HTTP Proxy etc) may allow the 
file through unscanned
and give it a clean bill of health. Server side AV software will not be 
able to discover
any code or sample contained within this ISO file and it will not raise 
suspicion even
if you know exactly what you are looking for (Which is for example great 
to hide your implants
or Exfiltration/Pivot Server).

There is a lot more to be said about this bug class, so rather than bore 
you with it in
this advisory I provide a link to my 2009 blog post
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

IV. Patch / Advisory
----------------------------
Reported submissions were fixed in new version (v. 1296) of unpacker module


Thanks to ESET for their customer focused approach to coordinating this 
vulnerability.
