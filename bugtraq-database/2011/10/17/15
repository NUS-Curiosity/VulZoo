- - -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer 8. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application verifies arguments
for a certain operation performed on an element. When parsing one of the
operands of a method, the application will pass the argument straight to
a method that will use the variant as an index. Due to bypassing the
argument check, an aggressor can set the index to point to data outside
the bounds of the array. This can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.

- - -- Vendor Response:

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
