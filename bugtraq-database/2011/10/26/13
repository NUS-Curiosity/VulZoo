ZDI-11-300 : Adobe Reader U3D PICT 10h Encoding Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-300
October 26, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-2433

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Adobe



-- Affected Products:

Adobe Reader



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Adobe handles PICT images. When
Adobe parses a PICT image containing an 0x10 opcode the following word
in the file will be interpreted as a loop counter that copies data from
the file into a heap buffer that has been created using the height and
with of the picture. The resulting heap overflow can result in remote
code execution under the rights of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:

Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
