Subject: Google App Enging SDK Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE 2011-1364)


We recently identified an interesting code execution vulnerability in the
Google App Engine SDK for Python. By combining a CSRF vulnerability in the
administration web UI, with some other unique vulnerabilities we found in
the Google python libraries, a remote hacker could gain remote code
execution privileges on victim's machine. This vulnerability affects all
operation systems running Google App Engine SDK for python (i.e. Windows,
Mac OS, etc.).
