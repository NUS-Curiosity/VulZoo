Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.11.11: Microsoft Internet Explorer
 Object Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.11.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 11, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Internet Explorer is a graphical web browser developed by Microsoft
Corp. that has been included with Microsoft Windows since 1995. For more
information about Internet Explorer, please the visit following website:
 http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Internet Explorer could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when a Javascript event handler such as
"onload" is set to a Javascript object's attributes or childNodes
collection. A event object is created and this object's memory is later
freed; however, a reference to the object remains. When the reference is
later used to access the event object, this now-invalid memory is
treated as a valid object. The corrupt object's vtable is used to make
an indirect function call. This may result in the execution of arbitrary
code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.
After the user visits the malicious Web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 is vulnerable.
