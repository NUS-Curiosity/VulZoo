APPLE-SA-2011-10-12-2 Apple TV Software Update 4.4

Apple TV Software Update 4.4 is now available and addresses
the following:

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept
user credentials or other sensitive information
Description:  Fraudulent certificates were issued by multiple
certificate authorities operated by DigiNotar. This issue is
addressed by removing DigiNotar from the list of trusted root
certificates, from the list of Extended Validation (EV) certificate
authorities, and by configuring default system trust settings so that
DigiNotar's certificates, including those issued by other
authorities, are not trusted.

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  Support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes may expose
users to spoofing and information disclosure as attacks improve
Description:  Certificates signed using the MD5 hash algorithm were
accepted by iOS. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses.
Further research or a misconfigured certificate authority could have
allowed the creation of X.509 certificates with attacker controlled
values that would have been trusted by the system. This would have
exposed X.509 based protocols to spoofing, man in the middle attacks,
and information disclosure. This update disables support for an X.509
certificate with an MD5 hash for any use other than as a trusted root
certificate.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3427

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  An attacker could decrypt part of a SSL connection
Description:  Only the SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 versions of SSL were
supported. These versions are subject to a protocol weakness when
using block ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected
invalid data, causing the connection to close but revealing some
information about the previous data. If the same connection was
attempted repeatedly the attacker may eventually have been able to
decrypt the data being sent, such as a password. This issue is
addressed by adding support for TLS 1.2.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3389

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  Viewing a maliciously crafted TIFF image may result in an
unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
Description:  A buffer overflow existed in libTIFF's handling of
CCITT Group 4 encoded TIFF images.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-0192 : Apple

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  Viewing a maliciously crafted TIFF image may lead to an
unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
Description:  A heap buffer overflow existed in ImageIO's handling of
CCITT Group 4 encoded TIFF images.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-0241 : Cyril CATTIAUX of Tessi Technologies

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  A remote attacker may cause a device reset
Description:  The kernel failed to promptly reclaim memory from
incomplete TCP connections. An attacker with the ability to connect
to a listening service on an iOS device could exhaust system
resources.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3259 : Wouter van der Veer of Topicus I&I, and Josh Enders

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may cause an
unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
Description:  A one-byte heap buffer overflow existed in libxml's
handling of XML data.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-0216 : Billy Rios of the Google Security Team

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may cause an
unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
Description:  A memory corruption issue existed in JavaScriptCore.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3232 : Aki Helin of OUSPG
