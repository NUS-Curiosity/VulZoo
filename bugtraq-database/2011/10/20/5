Details
=======

CiscoWorks Common Services is a set of management services that are
shared by network management applications in a CiscoWorks solution
set.

CiscoWorks Common Services provides the foundation for CiscoWorks
applications to share a common model for data storage, login, user
role definitions, access privileges, security protocols, and
navigation. It creates a standard user experience for all management
functions. It also provides the common framework for all basic system
level operations such as installation, data management (including
backup-restoration and importing-exporting), event and message
handling, job and process management, and software updates.

CiscoWorks Common Services for Microsoft Windows contains a
vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
execute arbitrary commands on the affected system with the privileges
of a system administrator.

The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the
CiscoWorks Home Page component. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL to the affected
system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
commands on the affected system with the privileges of a system
administrator.

This vulnerability affects CiscoWorks Common Services running only on
Microsoft Windows.

This vulnerability could be exploited over the default management
ports, TCP port 1741 or 443.

Note: The default management ports can be reconfigured on the server.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCtq48990, for
Common Services and CiscoWorks LAN Management Solution, CSCtq63992,
for Cisco Security Manager, CSCtq64011, for Cisco Unified Service
Monitor, CSCtq64019, for Cisco Unified Operations Manager, CSCtr23090,
for CiscoWorksQoS Policy Manager, and CSCtt25535, for CiscoWorks
Voice Manager.

This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3310.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.


Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html 
Or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
