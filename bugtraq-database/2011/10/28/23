ZDI-11-316 : Apple QuickTime H264 Matrix Conversion Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-316
October 27, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3251

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Apple



-- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Quicktime processes the matrix
structures in the 'tkhd' atom for mp4 files. When the matrix structure
contains large values a movs instruction can turn the value negative.
When Quicktime later uses the function to determine where it should
write its data it does check the upper boundaries, but not the lower
ones causing a heap buffer underwrite. This can result in remote code
execution under the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
