Package        : simplesamlphp
Vulnerability  : xml encryption weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no

Issues were found in the handling of XML encryption in simpleSAMLphp,
an application for federated authentication. The following two issues
have been addressed:

It may be possible to use an SP as an oracle to decrypt encrypted
messages sent to that SP.

It may be possible to use the SP as a key oracle which can be used
to forge messages from that SP by issuing 300000-2000000 queries to
the SP. 

The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain simplesamlphp.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2.

The testing distribution (wheezy) will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.
