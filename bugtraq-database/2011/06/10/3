VUPEN Security Research - Oracle Java ICC Profile "ncl2" Tag Integer 
Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.vupen.com/english/research.php


I. BACKGROUND
---------------------

"Java is a programming language and computing platform released by Sun
Microsystems (now Oracle). It is the underlying technology that powers
state-of-the-art programs including utilities, games, and business
applications.

Java runs on more than 850 million personal computers worldwide, and
on billions of devices worldwide, including mobile and TV devices."


II. DESCRIPTION
---------------------

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered a critical vulnerability
in Oracle Java.

The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow error in the Color
Management Module (CMM) when processing a malformed "ncl2" tag within
an ICC profile, which could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary
code by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted web page.

CVSS Score: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
---------------------------

Oracle Java JDK and JRE 6 Update 25 and prior


IV. Binary Analysis & Exploits/PoCs
---------------------------------------

In-depth binary analysis of the vulnerability and a proof-of-concept code
are available through the VUPEN Binary Analysis & Exploits Service :
