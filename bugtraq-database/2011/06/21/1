Package        : perl
Vulnerability  : lack of tainted flag propagation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1487
Debian Bug     : 622817

Mark Martinec discovered that Perl incorrectly clears the tainted flag
on values returned by case conversion functions such as "lc".  This
may expose preexisting vulnerabilities in applications which use these
functions while processing untrusted input.  No such applications are
known at this stage.  Such applications will cease to work when this
security update is applied because taint checks are designed to
prevent such unsafe use of untrusted input data.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.0-19lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.1-17squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version <missing>.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.10.1-20.

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.
