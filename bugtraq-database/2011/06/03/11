-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sybase OneBridge Mobile Data Suite.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the iMailGatewayService server process
(ECTrace.dll) which listens for encrypted requests by default on TCP
port 993 (IMAP) and port 587 (SMTP). The process fails to properly
sanitize malformed user string inputs before passing to the
authentication logging function. By providing a specially crafted string
with format specifiers this can be leveraged to trigger a format string
vulnerability which can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context
of the server process. 

-- Vendor Response:
Sybase has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
