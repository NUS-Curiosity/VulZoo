It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the 
Kolab Cyrus IMAP server does not properly restrict I/O buffering,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted
IMAP, LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is 
processed after TLS is in place.
