Vulnerability Description: PDFill contains a Insecure Library Loading vulnerability. The libraries identified as being vulnerable are mfc70enu.dll and mfc80loc.dll. The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Windows loads DLLs. If applications load a library from a specific path and call that path implicitly, Microsoft Windows searches several default paths to find and load the library. A malicious attacker can create a malicious DLL with the same name and place it in a directory where Microsoft Windows searches by default. The application will load the malicious DLL and may result result in arbitrary code execution.

Affected software versions: 8.0

Impact: Successful exploitation allows local or remote arbitrary code execution.

Fixed in: Not Fixed

Remediation guidelines: Windows released several tools to be used as workarounds for this vulnerability, however, these tools alter basic windows functionality which may result in malfunctioning applications. Test all tools in a test environment before deployment in production environments. https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2269637.mspx http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2010/08/21/microsoft-security-advisory-2269637-released.aspx
