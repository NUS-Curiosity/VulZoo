-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli Endpoint. Authentication is
required to exploit this vulnerability, however it is trivially
achieved. 

The specific flaw exists within the lcfd.exe process which listens by
default on TCP port 9495. To reach this page remotely authentication is
required. However, by abusing a built-in account an attacker can access
the restricted pages. While parsing requests to one of these, the
process blindly copies the contents of a POST variable to a 256 byte
stack buffer. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
