WordPress Uploadify Plugin 1.0 Remote File Upload



[+] Description

Adds a shortcode to embed the necessary elements to use
Uploadify in a page or post which will give your website
visitors the ability to upload large files. By default the
files will be uploaded to the folder set in your preferences.
The shortcode supports most of the Uploadify options, so it
can be easily customized to suit your needs.



[+] Information

Title: WordPress Uploadify Plugin 1.0 Remote File Upload
Google Dork: inurl:"/wp-content/plugins/uploadify/"
Advisory: gg-003-2011
Date: 02-18-2011
Last update: 02-21-2011
Link: http://www.gotgeek.com.br/pocs/gg-003-2011.txt
Tested on: CentOS 5.5 + WordPress 3.0.5



[+] Vulnerability

Uploadify Plugin is prone to a vulnerability that lets
attackers upload arbitrary files. Successful exploitation
of the vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a php code
for example and run it in the context of the webserver
process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege
escalation.

Affected Versions:
WordPress Uploadify Plugin 1.0
