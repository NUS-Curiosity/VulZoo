-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cisco Secure Desktop. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within CSDWebInstaller.ocx. The
CSDWebInstallerCtrl ActiveX control allows downloading and executing any
Cisco-signed executable files. By renaming a Cisco-signed executable
file to inst.exe and putting it on a webserver, an attacker can
subsequently exploit vulnerabilities in the Cisco-signed executable file
remotely.

-- Mitigations:
