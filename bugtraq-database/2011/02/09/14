ZDI-11-075: Adobe Acrobat Reader rt3d.dll Multimedia Playing Arbitrary Memory Overwite Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-075

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0606

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Reader

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the rt3d.dll component explicitly
trusting a length embedded within a particular file in order to
calculate the length of a buffer. The application will then duplicate an
arbitrarily sized string into a statically sized buffer located on the
stack. This can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
