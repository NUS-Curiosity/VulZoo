Package        : vlc
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem type   : (local)remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0531

Dan Rosenberg discovered that insufficient input validation in VLC's 
processing of Matroska/WebM containers could lead to the execution of 
arbitrary code. 

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze3.

The version of vlc in the oldstable distribution (lenny) is affected
by further issues and will be addressed in a followup DSA.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.
