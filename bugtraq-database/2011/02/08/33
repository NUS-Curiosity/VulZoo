-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the SCO OpenServer IMAP daemon.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the imapd process responsible for
handling remote IMAP requests. The process does not properly validate
IMAP commands and arguments. Supplying an overly long command followed
by an invalid argument can cause an exploitable overflow to occur. This
vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.
