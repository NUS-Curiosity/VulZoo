Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in
this advisory could result in the interruption of voice services,
privilege escalation and possible data modification. In the case of
DoS attacks, the affect Cisco Unified Communications Manager
processes will restart, but repeated attacks may result in a
sustained DoS condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution. Cisco recommends upgrading
to a release equal to or later than the release in the "Recommended
Releases" column of the table.

+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Cisco Unified Communications Manager  |    Recommended    |
|                Version                 |     Releases      |
|----------------------------------------+-------------------|
| 6.x                                    | 6.1(5)SU3         |
|----------------------------------------+-------------------|
| 7.x                                    | 7.1(5b)SU4        |
|----------------------------------------+-------------------|
| 8.0                                    | 8.0(3a)SU2        |
|----------------------------------------+-------------------|
| 8.5                                    | 8.5(1)SU1         |
+------------------------------------------------------------+

Note: The 7.1(5b)SU4 release of Cisco Unified Communications Manager
is expected to be available by the end of April 2011.

Workarounds
===========

A workaround exists only for the SIP DoS vulnerabilities. Cisco
Unified Communications Manager versions 6.1(4), 7.1(2), and 8.0(1)
introduced the ability to disable SIP processing. SIP processing is
enabled by default. Customers who do not use SIP processing can use
the following instructions to disable SIP processing:

  * Step 1: Log into the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
    Administration web interface.

  * Step 2: Navigate to "System" > "Service Parameters" and select the
    appropriate Cisco Unified Communications Manager server and the Cisco
    CallManager Service.

  * Step 3: Change the "SIP Interoperability Enabled" parameter to
    False, and click "Save".

    Note: For a SIP processing change to take effect, the Cisco
    CallManager Service must be restarted. For information on how to
    restart the service, refer to the "Restarting the Cisco
    CallManager Service" section of the document at the following
    location:

    http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/admin/7_1_2/ccmcfg/b03dpi.html#wp1075124

    It is possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities by implementing
    filtering on screening devices and permitting access to TCP ports
    5060 and 5061 and UDP ports 5060 and 5061 only from networks that
    require SIP access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager
    servers.

    Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in
    the network are available in the companion document "Cisco
    Applied Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating
    Exploitation of the Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified
    Communications Manager" which is available at the following
    location:

    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20110427-cucm.shtml
