: user-supplied input in "text" variable. Successful exploitation of this 
: vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of 
: cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of 
: sensitive data.

This is the site editor functionality, correct? This requires 
administrative access and is *designed* to allow the admin to enter any 
HTML or script code desired.

If an attacker can access this page, couldn't they do other bad things? Is 
there really a crossing of privilege boundary here?
