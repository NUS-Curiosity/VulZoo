Subject: Flag this message Windows Media player 11.0.5721.5145 Buffer overflow/DOS Exploit

Hello Team,

I have attached a file WMPExploit.pl which makes exploits the memory vulnerability in Windows Media player 11.0.5721.5145 which can be used to perform a Denial of Service attack :) and to cause a crash.

To run this file, compile the WMPExploit.pl using perl and then you may open the generated exploit .avi file using Windows Media player. If run properly, many a times, there is a crash every-time whenever the victim opens the folder in which the Exploit is placed.

Thanks and Regards,
