Subject: Does anyone know how to contact OpenSSH non-public?

Hello,
does anyone know how to contact the openssh guys without using a public
mailinglist/IRC channel/...? I tried openssh@...nssh.com, but I didn't
get an answer. It's nothing big, but I'd like to make sure that they
know about it and to hear their opinion.
