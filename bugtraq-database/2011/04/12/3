Subject: Medium severity flaw in Konqueror

I was recently taking a look at Konquerer and spotted an example of universal 
XSS.  Essentially, the error page displayed when a requested URL is not 
available includes said URL.  If said URL includes HTML fragments these will 
be rendered.  CVE-2010-2952 has been assigned to this issue.
