-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari Webkit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the library's implementation of a frame
element. When parsing a malformed document embedded inside an SVG
document, the library will create an anonymous block around a frame
element in the block's contents. When freeing this anonymous block via
an assignment to the read-only .textContent attribute, a reference to
one of the child elements will still exist. Accessing this child element
can then lead to code execution under the context of the application.
