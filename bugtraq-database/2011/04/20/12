-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari WebKit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application manages a reference
to an anonymous block located near a particular element within the
document. When cloning this element, the application will duplicate a
reference to the block and then later re-attach this element to the
rendering tree. During this process the library will free the original
rendering element. Subsequent access to the same element will then cause
the library to use the freed object. This can be utilized to achieve
code execution under the context of the application.
