Description:
    Previous versions of the apache web server, when a multithreaded MPM
    is used, do not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain
    circumstances involving a parent request that has a body, which
    might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a
    crafted request that triggers access to memory locations associated
    with an earlier request.
    
    This vulnerability was previous addressed for rPath Linux 2 and
    rPath Linux Service 2 through rPSA 2010-0056.
