Subject: WOOT '11 Call for Papers (reminder)

Hi all,

This is just a reminder that the deadline for WOOT paper submissions
is coming soon. If you are looking to present interesting
attack-related research to your peers in the industry and in the
academia, act now :-)

http://www.usenix.org/events/woot11/cfp/

Progress in the field of computer security is driven by a symbiotic
relationship between our understandings of attack and of defense. The
USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) aims to bring
together researchers and practitioners in systems security to present
research advancing the understanding of attacks on operating systems,
networks, and applications.

Submission topics include but are not limited to:

 * Vulnerability research (software auditing, reverse engineering)
 * Penetration testing
 * Exploit techniques and automation
 * Network-based attacks (routing, DNS, IDS/IPS/firewall evasion)
 * Reconnaissance (scanning, software, and hardware fingerprinting)
 * Malware design and implementation (rootkits, viruses, bots, worms)
 * Denial-of-service attacks
 * Web and database security
 * Weaknesses in deployed systems (VoIP, telephony, wireless, games)
 * Practical cryptanalysis (hardware, DRM, etc.)

WOOT '11 will be held August 8, 2011, in San Francisco, CA. WOOT '11
is co-located with the 20th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security
'11), which will take place August 10â€“12, 2011. WOOT this year will
feature a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award.

The submission deadline for papers is 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on
Monday, May 2, 2011.

We look forward to your submissions.
