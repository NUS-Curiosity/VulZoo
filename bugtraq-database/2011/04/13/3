Announcing TakeDownCon Dallas - May 14-19 - Dallas, TX

It’s right around the corner.

TakeDownCon Dallas - the inaugural event in EC-Council’s new technical
IT security conference series - will be taking place from May 14-19,
at the InterContinental Dallas, in Dallas, TX.

Pre-event training, from the EC-Council and their new Center for
Advanced Security Training (CAST), will run from May 14-17, and cover
their renowned, recently DoD Directive 8570-accepted Certified Ethical
Hacker (CEH) version 7, the Certified Security Analyst (ECSA), as well
as the Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (CHFI) program.

Following the pre-event training is a two-day conference featuring
three tracks -- "No Holds Barred," on day one (May 18), and two
parallel tracks, "Attack Zone" and "Defense Sector," on day two (May
19).

The "No Holds Barred" track will kick things off, and include:

     -   Keynote by Barnaby Jack, who most recently gained media
attention for his ATM hacking demonstration at Black Hat USA 2010
     -   Release of hardware pen-testing device, PlugBot, by security
researcher Jeremiah Talamantes
     -   Other advanced talks on everything from automated malware
analysis to hacking SCADA

The "Attack Zone" and "Defense Sector" tracks, preceded by a keynote
on the anatomy of database attacks, from Josh Shaul and Alex
Rothacker, will wrap things up, and include presentations such as:

     -   Analyzing and hacking smart phone security models
     -   Taking down government system security
     -   Attacking and defending the Smart Grid

Also launching will be "Nite Locks et al," an event that gives
attendees a hands-on opportunity to test their lock-picking skills
under the tutelage of experts.

Delegates of TakeDownCon will enjoy the special rate of $109/night, at
the InterContinental Dallas.
