Subject: Re: joomlacontenteditor (com_jce) BLIND sql injection vulnerability

This alert is bunk. There is no mention of "Itemid" in relation to database operations in the entire source code of com_jce, which there would need to be for blind sql injection.

The behaviour of the Itemid parameter in Joomla is complex and I won't go into all the details here. Suffice it to say that manipulating the Itemid to alternative valid Itemid values can change the content of the page, and changing to an invalid Itemid (such as a negative number) is equivalent to setting it to 0.

There is no SQL injection at play here, at least with core Joomla and the com_jce editor. Other 3rd-party extensions may vary.
