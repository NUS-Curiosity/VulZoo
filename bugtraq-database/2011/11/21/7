Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Chromium and V8, some of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Chromium is an open-source web browser project. V8 is Google's open
source JavaScript engine.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/chromium       < 15.0.874.121         >= 15.0.874.121

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium and V8.
Please review the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below
for details.

Impact
======

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted web site or JavaScript program using Chromium or V8, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process, or a Denial of Service condition. The attacker also could
cause a Java applet to run without user confirmation.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=www-client/chromium-15.0.874.121"

All V8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/v8-3.5.10.24"
