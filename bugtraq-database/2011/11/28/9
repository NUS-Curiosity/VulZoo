ZDI-11-333 : RealNetworks RealPlayer ATRC Code Data Parsing Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-333
November 28, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-4250

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks



- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the ATRC codec parses sample data
out of the media  file. When reading bit sizes from the sample, the
application will seek a structure that is used for consuming bits from
the sample stream outside the bounds of the correct data. When decoding
the sample, the application will use the transformed data to initialize
another structure. Due to the sizes being unbound, this can be used to
corrupt memory outside the original allocation. This type of memory
corruption can be leveraged to gain code execution under the context of
the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
