ZDI-11-332 : RealNetworks RealPlayer Malformed AAC File Parsing Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-332
November 28, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-4248

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks



- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Realplayer. AUser interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way RealPLayer handles AAC files.
When parsing an AAC file, Realplayer will create buffers based on the
type of Channel it finds in the first frame. When the AAC starts with a
Single channel in the first frame, and then changes to a channel pair in
the following frame, Realplayer fails to update the buffer size for the
channel data. The buffer overwrite that follows could result in remote
code execution under the context of the current user.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
