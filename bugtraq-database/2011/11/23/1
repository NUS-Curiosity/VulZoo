Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3872 

It was discovered that Puppet, a centralized configuration management
solution, misgenerated certificates if the "certdnsnames" option was
used. This could lead to man in the middle attacks. More details are
available at http://puppetlabs.com/security/cve/cve-2011-3872/ 

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.24.5-3+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze3.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
