Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept
user credentials or other sensitive information
Description:  Two certificate authorities in the list of trusted root

DigiCert Malaysia. DigiCert Malaysia has issued certificates with
weak keys that it is unable to revoke. An attacker with a privileged
network position could intercept user credentials or other sensitive
information intended for a site with a certificate issued by DigiCert
Malaysia. This issue is addressed by configuring default system trust
settings so that DigiCert Malaysia's certificates are not trusted. We
would like to acknowledge Bruce Morton of Entrust, Inc. for reporting
this issue.
