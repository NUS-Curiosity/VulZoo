Subject: Checkpoint VPN - Priviledge Escalation

It  appears  this  bug  has  gone  unoticed to vulnerability databases
maintainers, very likely due to the lack  of disclosure/publication.
This usually means it's also not in compliance/patching systems and
exposes  customers  to unecessary risk. To counteract I'd like to drop
this note.
