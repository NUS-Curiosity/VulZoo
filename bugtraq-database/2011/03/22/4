Subject: NGS00057 Patch Notification: Apple Mac OS X ImageIO Integer Overflow

Apple Mac OS X ImageIO Integer Overflow

22/03/2011

Dominic Chell of NGS Secure has discovered a High risk vulnerability in Mac OS X ImageIO. An integer overflow issue exists in ImageIO's handling of JPEG-encoded TIFF images. Viewing a maliciously crafted TIFF image may result in an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

Versions affected include:

Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.6, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.6. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6

Apple has released a patch that addresses the issue. The announcement of this patch can be found here:

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4581

NGS Secure is going to withhold details of this flaw for three months. This three month window will allow users the time needed to apply the patch before the details are released to the general public. This reflects the NGS Secure approach to responsible disclosure.
