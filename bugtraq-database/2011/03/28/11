Subject: [AntiSnatchOr] OpenCMS <= 7.5.3 multiple vulnerabilities

OpenCMS <= 7.5.3 multiple vulnerabilities

 Name: OpenCMS <= 7.5.3 multiple vulnerabilities
 Systems Affected: OpenCMS <= 7.5.3
 Severity: High
 Vendor: http://www.opencms.org
 Advisory: http://antisnatchor.com/opencms_7.5.3_multiple_vulnerabilities
 Author: Michele "antisnatchor" Orru (michele.orru AT antisnatchor DOT com)

I. BACKGROUND
OpenCMS from Alkacon Software is a professional, easy to use website
content management system. OpenCms helps content managers worldwide
to create and maintain beautiful websites fast and efficiently.

II. DESCRIPTION
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in OpenCMS <= 7.5.3 (latest stable version
at the time of writing) that could lead to victim browser pwnage, sensitive
information stealing and cookie stealing.

III. ANALYSIS

a.) Reflected XSS
Some authenticated resources are vulnerable to Reflected XSS.

The URI /opencms/opencms/system/workplace/commons/report-locks.jsp
is vulnerable to Reflected XSS in the following parameters:
includerelated, resourcelist.

A request like the following will display an alert with the number 666:

GET
/opencms/opencms/system/workplace/commons/report-locks.jsp?resourcelist=null&resource=/demo_de&includerelated=false"><script>alert(666)</script>
HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
[...]


The URI /opencms/opencms/system/workplace/views/explorer/contextmenu.jsp
is vulnerable too,
but we should know a valid resource name to exploit it: this is not too
difficult,
because knowing the path of an image it would be enough.

A request like the following will display an alert with the number 666:

GET
/opencms/opencms/system/workplace/views/explorer/contextmenu.jsp?resourcelist=/deco_logo.png&acttarget=514f2"><script>alert(666)</script>
HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080

b.) Cookies issued without HttpOnly flag
This issue is even more dangerous because the application don't
issue cookies with the HttpOnly flag set: even if there are ways
to bypass this security measure, it should always be added to prevent
accessing the cookies from JS.

c.) Various password field with autocomplete enabled
Last but not least, the main login form (URI /opencms/opencms/system/login/)
and the change password form (URI
/opencms/opencms/system/workplace/commons/preferences.jsp)
have autocomplete enabled: thanks to the presence of XSS, an attacker can
easily
steal the input form values if they have been saved by the victim using
the browser "remember password" mechanisms.

IV. DETECTION

7.5.3 and earlier versions are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Always escape/sanitize the input that comes from the user, because it can
be malicious. A good way would be to integrate OWASP ESAPI in OpenCMS, in
order
to use all the pre-built functions that mitigate XSS, SQLi, XSRF, and so on.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

OpenCms 7.5.4 fixes the issues.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

No CVE at this time.
