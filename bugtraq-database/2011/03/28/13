-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Zend Server. Authentication is not required
to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the Zend Java Bridge v3.1 component of
the Zend Server framework. The javamw.jar service accepts TCP requests
on port 10001 by default. With nothing more than the knowledge of the
proprietary communication protocol used by the Zend Server Java Bridge,
it is possible to send arbitrary Java code to javamw.jar service and
remotely execute these commands under the context of the user running
the web server process.
