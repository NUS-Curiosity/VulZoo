Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.01.11: Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise
 CS CGI Cookie Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.01.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 01, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

The Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise Communication Server (CS) is a
communication server platform that provides multimedia call processing
for both Alcatel-Lucent and third-party clients/phones. For more
information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://enterprise.alcatel-lucent.com/?product=OmniPCXEnterprise&page=overview

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Alcatel-Lucent's OmniPCX Enterprise Communication Server could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected
service.

The Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise Communication Server (CS) is used
to process, manage, and log traditional as well as VOIP based
telephony. Part of the maintenance functionality consists of a web
based administrative interface consisting of various CGI and PHP based
scripts. The vulnerability occurs in the handling of multiple CGI
applications that make up the web application.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing certain HTTP headers. String based
data from the HTTP request is improperly validated, which can result in
a trivial stack based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service, usually the user
'mtcl'. This user is not equivalent to root, but does have access to
most of the files used for managing the OXE system.

The OXE environment consists of a custom Linux distribution. It doesn't
employ any of the modern exploit mitigation defenses like ASLR or NX.
As such, this vulnerability is trivial to exploit reliably.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in OmniPCX
Enterprise version 8. Alcatel-Lucent has stated that the following
versions are vulnerable:

OmniPCX Enterprise: all versions prior to R9.0

OmniPCX Enterprise release R9.0: all versions prior to patch H1.301.50
(excluded).The following versions are not vulnerable:

OmniPCX Enterprise release R9.0 H1.301.50 and more recent.

OmniPCX Enterprise release R9.1 and later.

V. WORKAROUND

The embedded web server can be deactivated by using the netadmin
command. The steps to perform this are documented in the following
location of the administration guide: 11.Security > 11.9.Web server
configuration > 11.9.1.Deactivate the Web server, then apply your
change.

< br /> This will remove all functionality provided by the web server,
but has no impact on the normal system operation.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

An official fix is available for customers through Alcatel-Lucent
Business Partners since mid january on their support website. An
Alcatel-Lucent security advisory is available on
