Subject: SCADA Trojans: Attacking the Grid + Advantech vulnerabilities

Hi!

You can download the slides of the research I was presenting at
RootedCon'11 in Madrid "SCADA Trojans: Attacking the grid". A journey
into attacking the power grid.

I presented:

- 0days in Advantech/BroadWin WebAccess SCADA product
- Weak Design/Vulnerabilities in CSE-Semaphore TBOX RTUs
- General attack against EMS Software via State Estimators.


I contacted ICS-CERT to coordinate with Advantech but the vendor denied
having a security flaw. So guys, the exploit I'm releasing does not
exist. All is product of your mind.

Well, indeed WebAccess is full of bugs.

It is a RPC exploit against WebAccess Network Service, port 4592. It
leaks the security code that protects the scada node in addition to
demonstrate RCE on XP. Slighly modifications can be done to support
other systems.

Check the slides, there is more info about the vulns info there.
