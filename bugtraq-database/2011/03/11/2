Subject: Medium severity flaw in QNX Neutrino RTOS

I was recently taking a look at the state of play regarding the security of 
POSIX runtime linkers and was pointed at the QNX Neutrino RTOS to take a look.  
In doing so I noticed a problem relating to the way that it handles 
LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT which allows for the creation or overwriting of an arbitrary 
file.  Moreover the technique by which this can be achieved can be triggered 
even where the binary being executed is setUID and is running as another user.
