Reference: http://www.symantec.com/business/antivirus-corporate-edition

2. Vulnerability Summary

An arbitrary program execution vulnerability exists in Symantec Alert Management System (AMS) service shipped with multiple Symantec products. The vulnerability could be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

3. Vulnerability Analysis

The Alert Management System (AMS) component of Symantec Antivirus Corporate Edition installs an alert handler service, HNDLRSVC, that listens for commands from the AMS server. This service does not perform proper authentication checks before executing such commands. Remote unauthenticated attackers could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet via the MSGSYS.EXE service on port 38292/TCP. The Run Program command would allow executing arbitrary programs from a remote SMB share with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable system.
