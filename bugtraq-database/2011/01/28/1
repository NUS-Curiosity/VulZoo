CA20101231-01: Security Notice for CA ARCserve D2D

Issued: December 31, 2010
Last Updated: January 26, 2011

CA Technologies support is alerting customers to a security risk with 
CA ARCserve D2D. A vulnerability exists that can allow a remote 
attacker to execute arbitrary code.  CA has issued an Information 
Solution to address the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is due to default vulnerabilities inherent in the 
Tomcat and Axis2 3rd party software components. A remote attacker can 
exploit the implementation to execute arbitrary code.


Risk Rating 

High


Platform 

Windows


Affected Products 

CA ARCserve D2D r15


How to determine if the installation is affected 

Using Windows Explorer, go to the directory 
"<D2D_HOME>\TOMCAT\webapps\WebServiceImpl", and look for the existence 
of a folder called "axis2-web".


Solution

CA has issued the following patch to address the vulnerability.

CA ARCserve D2D r15:
RO26040

If you are not able to apply the patch at this time, the following 
workaround can be implemented to address the vulnerability.

1.  Stop "CA ARCserve D2D Web Service" from service control manager.

2.  Go to the directory "<D2D_HOME>\TOMCAT\webapps\WebServiceImpl", 
    and remove the folder "axis2-web".

3.  Edit "<D2D_HOME>\TOMCAT\webapps\WebServiceImpl\WEB-INF\web.xml", 
    and remove the content of AxisAdminServlet's servlet and servlet 
    mapping. 
 
    The content to remove will look like the text below:
    
    - <servlet>
        <display-name>Apache-Axis Admin Servlet Web Admin</display-\
           name>
        <servlet-name>AxisAdminServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.apache.axis2.transport.http.\
           AxisAdminServlet</servlet-class>
        <load-on-startup>100</load-on-startup>
      </servlet>
    - <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>AxisAdminServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/axis2-admin/*</url-pattern>
      </servlet-mapping>

4.  Change the username and password parameters in the axis2.xml file 
    to stronger credentials that conform to your organization's 
    password policies. 
    "<D2D_HOME>\TOMCAT\webapps\WebServiceImpl\WEB-INF\conf\axis2.xml"
       
       <parameter name="userName">admin</parameter>
       <parameter name="password">axis2</parameter>    

5.  Start "CA ARCserve D2D Web Service".
