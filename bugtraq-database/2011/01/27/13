Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Content Services Gateway Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110126-csg2

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110126-csg2.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 January 26 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A service policy bypass vulnerability exists in the Cisco Content
Services Gateway - Second Generation (CSG2), which runs on the
Cisco Service and Application Module for IP (SAMI). Under certain
configurations this vulnerability could allow:

  * Customers to access sites that would normally match a billing
    policy to be accessed without being charged to the end customer
  * Customers to access sites that would normally be denied based on
    configured restriction policies

Additionally, Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(24)MD1 on the Cisco
CSG2 contains two vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to create a denial of service condition that
prevents traffic from passing through the CSG2. These vulnerabilities
require only a single content service to be active on the Cisco CSG2 and
can be exploited via crafted TCP packets. A three-way handshake is not
required to exploit either of these vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110126-csg2.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

The service policy bypass vulnerability affects all versions of the
Cisco IOS Software for the CSG2 prior to the first fixed release, as
indicated in the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory.

The two denial of service vulnerabilities only affect Cisco IOS Software
Release 12.4(24)MD1 on the Cisco CSG2. No other Cisco IOS Software
releases are affected.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

To determine the version of Cisco IOS Software that is running on the
Cisco CSG2, issue the "show module" command from Cisco IOS Software on
the switch on which the Cisco CSG2 module is installed to identify what
modules and sub-modules are installed on the system.

Cisco CSG2 runs on the Cisco Service and Application Module for IP
(SAMI) card, and is identified in the following example in slot 2 via
the WS-SVC-SAMI-BB-K9 identification:

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The Cisco Content Services Gateway - 1st Generation (CSG) is not
affected by these vulnerabilities.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco Content Services Gateway - Second Generation (CSG2) provides
intelligent network capabilities such as flexible policy management
and billing based on deep-packet inspection, as well as subscriber and
application awareness capabilities that enable mobile operators to
quickly and easily offer value-added, differentiated services over their
mobile data networks.

The service policy bypass vulnerability affects configurations that
allow end users to first access non-accounted or billed sites. After a
user accesses a non-accounted site, it is possible to access other sites
that are defined by a billing service policy or to access sites that may
be blocked by other policies by sending specially crafted HTTP packets.
This vulnerability only affects HTTP content traffic. HTTPS and other
traffic types are not affected.

Both denial of service vulnerabilities require only a single content
service to be active on the Cisco CSG2 and can be exploited via crafted
TCP packets. A three-way handshake is not required to exploit either of
these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are triggered by TCP traffic
that transits the Cisco CSG2.

The service policy bypass vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCtk35917 and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-0348.

The denial of service bugs are documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCth17178 and
Cisco Bug ID CSCth41891 and have been assigned CVE IDs CVE-2011-0349 and
CVE-2011-0350 respectively.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS
at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the service policy bypass can allow customers
to obtain access to sites that would normally be accounted and billed
according to the billing policy without the billing policy being
engaged. Additionally, customers could gain access to URLs that are
configured in the Cisco CSG2 to be explicitly denied.

Successful exploitation of either denial of service vulnerability could
result in the Cisco CSG2 reloading or potentially hanging. Due to Cisco
Bug ID CSCtg50821, the Cisco CSG2 may not automatically recover and
may require a manual reload of the SAMI card by issuing the "hw-module
module <x> reset" CLI command from the switch.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS Software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a release train is vulnerable, then the earliest
possible releases that contain the fix (along with the anticipated date
of availability for each, if applicable) are listed in the "First Fixed
Release" column of the table. The "Recommended Release" column indicates
the releases which have fixes for all the published vulnerabilities
at the time of this Advisory. A device running a release in the given
train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less than
the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable. Cisco recommends
upgrading to a release equal to or later than the release in the
"Recommended Releases" column of the table.
