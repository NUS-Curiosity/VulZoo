CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3450 CVE-2010-3451 CVE-2010-3452 CVE-2010-3453

Several security related problems have been discovered in the
OpenOffice.org package that allows malformed documents to trick the
system into crashes or even the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3450

    During an internal security audit within Red Hat, a directory
    traversal vulnerability has been discovered in the way
    OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 through 3.2.1 processes XML filter files.  If
    a local user is tricked into opening a specially-crafted OOo XML
    filters package file, this problem could allow remote attackers to
    create or overwrite arbitrary files belonging to local user or,
    potentially, execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3451

    During his work as a consultant at Virtual Security Research
    (VSR), Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in
    OpenOffice.org's RTF parsing functionality.  Opening a maliciously
    crafted RTF document can caus an out-of-bounds memory read into
    previously allocated heap memory, which may lead to the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3452

    Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in the RTF file parser
    which can be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code
    execution by convincing a victim to open a maliciously crafted RTF
    file.

CVE-2010-3453

    As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
    discovered a vulnerability in the WW8ListManager::WW8ListManager()
    function of OpenOffice.org that allows a maliciously crafted file
    to cause the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3454

    As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
    discovered a vulnerability in the WW8DopTypography::ReadFromMem()
    function in OpenOffice.org that may be exploited by a maliciously
    crafted file which allowins an attacker to control program flow
    and potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3689

    Dmitri Gribenko discovered that the soffice script does not treat
    an empty LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable like an unset one, may lead to
    the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-4253

    A heap based buffer overflow has been discovered with unknown impact.

CVE-2010-4643

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the way OpenOffice.org
    handles TGA graphics which can be tricked by a specially crafted
    TGA file that could cause the program to crash due to a heap-based
    buffer overflow with unknown impact.


For the stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny11.

For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) these problems have
been fixed in version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.

For the experimental distribution these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.0~rc3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.
