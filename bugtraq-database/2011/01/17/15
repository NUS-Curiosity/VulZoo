Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0427

The developers of Tor, an anonymizing overlay network for TCP, found 
three security issues during a security audit. A heap overflow allowed
the execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0427), a denial of service
vulnerability was found in the zlib compression handling and some key
memory was incorrectly zeroed out before being freed. The latter two 
issues do not yet have CVE identifiers assigned. The Debian Security
Tracker will be updated once they're available:
http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/tor

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.29-1~lenny+1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.29-1.

For the experimental distribution, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.21-alpha-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
