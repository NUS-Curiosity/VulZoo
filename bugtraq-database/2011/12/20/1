- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Enterasys Netsight. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the nssyslogd.exe component which listens by
default on UDP port 514. When parsing a new syslog message the process
attempts to copy the PRIO field to an intermediate variable. The process
does not properly validate the size of the destination buffer and
blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the
stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Enterasys has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
