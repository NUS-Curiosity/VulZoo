This seems to be a false-positive in some sense. Variable instructors has stored XSS vulnerability, but section_title doesn't. One can only use this XSS-vulnerability against own account so not an issue. Author of the program will still fix this issue. Tom in my opinion you are doing great work, but please contact developers before announcements. I know this is sometimes waste of time, but you should still do that. In my opinion this doesn't deserve CVE. Please also note that this software is not heavily used as far as developer knew so might be the best not to email bugtraq before fix/patch next time.
