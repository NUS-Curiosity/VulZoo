         CVE Name       

    Description  When the "automon" feature is enabled in features.conf, it   
                 is possible to send a sequence of SIP requests that cause    
                 Asterisk to dereference a NULL pointer and crash.            

    Resolution  Applying the referenced patches that check that the pointer   
                is not NULL before accessing it will resolve the issue. The   
                "automon" feature can be disabled in features.conf as a       
                workaround.
