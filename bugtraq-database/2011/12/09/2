Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - 13 December 2011

OMG, it's Christmas again!!!!!!

But happily this year we don't have to lurk in the corner of a dingy pub 
trying to look like we're having fun amongst the estate agents, bankers 
and stock borkers annual do's, as we have our very own cosy well stocked 
*private* bar and meeting space as per normal... Yes, our new home has 
not only put up with us for the whole year but have even invited us back 
for Christmas! Sweet!

To celebrate, you are going to come and entertain us. Yes, that means YOU...

This month we are doing lightning talks, so if you've got a 5-10 minute 
presentation, with or without slides/hardware/pyrotechnics/hadron 
colliders/pixies then bring your game face and share it with us...

Also... There will be:

   Beer.
   (Small but cool) prizes for the best talks...
   More beer.
   Your last chance to buy the few remaining original DC4420 t-shirts!
   Even more beer.
   Your last chance (this year) to buy me a beer.
