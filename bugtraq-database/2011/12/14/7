Subject: Re: Re: WikkaWiki <= 1.3.2 Multiple Security Vulnerabilities

"Really is rather irresponsible to continue to report an exploit as unpatched that has, in fact, been patched."

Really is rather irresponsible not to provide a patch within seven weeks since all these bugs were reported:

[09/10/2011] - Issues reported to http://wush.net/trac/wikka/ticket/1097
[27/10/2011] - I've provided possible bug fixes to vendor
[28/11/2011] - After seven weeks still no fix released
[30/11/2011] - Public disclosure
