- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office 2007. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a

corruption of the type which can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.
