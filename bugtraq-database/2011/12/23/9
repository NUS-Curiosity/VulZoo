Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2011-019:
Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in phpMyAdmin

https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2011-019.txt

Published: 12/22/11
Version: 1.0

Vendor: phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net/)
Product: phpMyAdmin
Version affected: 3.4.8 and prior

Product description:
An open source tool developed in PHP to manage and administer MySQL
databases remotely.  The web browser interface allows creating, modifying
or deleting databases, tables, fields or rows, executing SQL statements,
and other database functions.

Finding 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Setup Interface
CVE: CVE-2011-4782

Affected versions of phpMyAdmin do not sanitize user-supplied server names
before displaying them in its Setup Overview. This allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted request.

phpMyAdmin allows users to add database servers via its Setup interface.
Since phpMyAdmin doesn't do any input validation on server hostnames when
they are entered, it is up to whatever displays these names throughout the
application to use htmlspecialchars() (or similar) to sanitize them.

phpMyAdmin uses a function called perform_config_checks() to perform a
series of compatibility, security and consistency checks on application
configuration options. If it finds settings that are contrary to best
practices, perform_config_checks() generates messages to be displayed to
users at the top of the Setup Overview page. The messages generated for
some of these configuration options ($cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl'],
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension'], $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'],
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowRoot'], and
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']) are constructed using user-supplied
hostnames without any sanitization taking place. This can lead to web
script being executed when the Setup Overview page is loaded.

The following is a Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. Request the Setup interface's index page in order to obtain the
phpMyAdmin cookie and the value of 'token', which appears in the response
body:
