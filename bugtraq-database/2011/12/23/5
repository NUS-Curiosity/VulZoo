ZDI-11-351 : WellinTech KingView HistoryServer.exe Opcode 3 Parsing
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-351
December 22, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-4536

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

WellinTech



- -- Affected Products:

WellinTech KingView



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Wellintek KingView. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the protocol parsing code inside
nettransdll.dll. The parent service is called HistoryServer.exe and
listens on port 777. When a packet with op-code 3 is received, the
service allocates memory from the heap based on the 10th and 11th bytes
of the packet (element count). Packet data is then copied into the
allocated buffer based on the first two bytes of the packet (packet
size). These values can be manipulated to create a heap overflow and and
attacker can exploit this to remotely execute arbitrary code in the
context of the service (Local System).

- -- Vendor Response:

WellinTech has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
