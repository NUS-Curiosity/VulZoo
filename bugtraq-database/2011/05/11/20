-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP 3com/H3C Intelligent Management Center.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The flaw exists within the tftpserver.exe component which listens by
default on UDP port 69. When handling the transfer mode field this value
is passed through toupper before being stored in a local buffer for
string comparison. The process does not properly verify the destination
buffer on the stack is sufficient size to handle the newly created
string. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
