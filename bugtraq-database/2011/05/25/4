Subject: Remote Password Disclosure Vulnerability in RXS-3211 IP Camera +
 others

-==Description==-
The RXS-3211 IP camera, among others, is vulnerable to remote password disclosure, which can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with a single UDP packet. The problem exists in the camera management protocol used by the devices, which sends the administrator password and other configuration settings in cleartext following an unauthenticated request.

The following UDP payload, sent to port 13364 on a vulnerable device, can exploit the issue:

\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\x06\xff\xf9

It is also possible to set configuration settings on the remote device with a single unauthenticated request.

-==Mitigation==-
Block external access to UDP port 13364. 

-==Disclosure==-
Contacted Rosewill, but received no response.
