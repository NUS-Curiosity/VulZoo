-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sybase M-Business Anywhere. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within agsync.dll, which listens for SOAP and
sync (HTTP) requests on ports 80 and 443 (HTTPS). When handling a
supplied username parameter the process fails to verify the string
length. This user-supplied data is then copied to a static sized buffer
on the heap. A remote attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary
code into the agd.exe process, which runs by default under the SYSTEM
context. 

-- Vendor Response:
Sybase has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
