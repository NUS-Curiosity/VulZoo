Cisco Security Response: Cisco IOS Software Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20110505-ios.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 May 05 1600 UTC (GMT)

Cisco Response
==============

This is the Cisco PSIRT response to two postings on bugtraq by NCNIPC
(China) regarding reported vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software.

The original reports are available at the following links:

  * Cisco IOS UDP Denial of Service Vulnerability leavingcisco.com
  * Cisco IOS SNMP Message Processing Denial Of Service Vulnerability
    leavingcisco.com

We greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with researchers on
security vulnerabilities and welcome the opportunity to review and
assist in product reports.

Additional Information
======================

Cisco PSIRT is actively working with NCNIPC (China) to further
understand the details of what is reported in the bugtraq postings.

At this stage Cisco PSIRT cannot confirm the existence of any new
vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software based on the information that
is currently available. This Cisco Security Response will be updated
as new information becomes available.

Cisco PSIRT recommends limiting access to the network with
Infrastructure Acess Control Lists (iACLs). Although it is often
difficult to block traffic that transits a network, it is possible to
identify traffic that should never be allowed to target
infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of
networks. Infrastructure Access Control Lists (iACLs) are a network
security best practice and should be considered as a long-term
addition to good network security.

The white paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure
Protection Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended
deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists and
is available at the following link:
