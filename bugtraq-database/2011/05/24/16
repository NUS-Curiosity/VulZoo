VUPEN Security Research - 7T Interactive Graphical SCADA System ODBC Remote 
Memory Corruption

http://www.vupen.com/english/research.php


I. BACKGROUND
---------------------

7T Interactive Graphical SCADA System (IGSS) is a state-of-the art
SCADA system used for monitoring and controlling industrial processes.

IGSS has been installed in more than 28.000 industrial plants worldwide.


II. DESCRIPTION
---------------------

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered a critical vulnerability
in 7T Interactive Graphical SCADA System (IGSS).

The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption error in the Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) component when processing packets sent
to port 20222/TCP, which could result in an invalid structure being
used, leading to an exploitable condition.

CVSS Score: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
---------------------------

7T Interactive Graphical SCADA System (IGSS) versions prior to 9.0.0.11143


IV. Binary Analysis & Exploits/PoCs
---------------------------------------

In-depth binary analysis of the vulnerability and a proof-of-concept code
are available through the VUPEN Binary Analysis & Exploits Service :
