Subject: NGS00054 Patch Notification: Lumension Device Control (formerly
 Sanctuary) remote memory corruption

Lumension Device Control (formerly Sanctuary) remote memory corruption

24/05/2011

Andy Davis of NGS Secure has discovered a high risk vulnerability in Lumension Device Control. Sending a specially crafted packet to a TCP service running on the Lumension Application Server results in a memory corruption vulnerability being triggered and potentially arbitrary code execution. 

Versions affected include:
Lumension Device Control v4.4 SR6 and earlier releases.

This issue is addressed in SR7, which can be downloaded by registered customers at:

NGS Secure is going to withhold details of this flaw for three months. This three month window will allow users the time needed to apply the patch before the details are released to the general public. This reflects the NGS Secure approach to responsible disclosure.
