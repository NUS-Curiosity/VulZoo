Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - May meet - Tuesday 24th May 2011

Just over a week to go until this month's London DEFCON meet, so get it 
in your diary now!

For the talks we have:

   Tech Talk: Paco Hope of Cigital is going to present on randomness...

              We've seen how to get good random numbers from hardware. 
Given that, you would think that shuffling cards, rolling dice, and 
random session identifiers would be easy. They're not. Our instincts and 
intuition are often wrong. We'll look at shuffling and algorithms gone 
wrong, and talk about doing it right. Expect a few surprises.


   Fun Talk: The Whitehat Rally, Etamo & friends...

             Showing Top Gear how it's really done. And stuff.

   Bonus: DEFCON Network 2011, Lockheed

   Not only do we have two great confirmed talks, but we also be graced 
by the presence of our favorite network goon, who has been persuaded to 
give us a heads up on what to expect in our new home in Vegas this 
year... Sweet!
