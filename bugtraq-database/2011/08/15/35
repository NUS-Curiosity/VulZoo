Vulnerability Description: A vulnerability exists in the NetSaro Enterprise Messenger Server application allowing an attacker to obtain access to plaintext usernames and passwords. The stored passwords are used to authenticate users running the NetSaro Enterprise Client connecting to the server. This is a second level attack that requires access to the password files stored within the application root directory. An attacker who has previously compromised the host operating system or gained direct access to the NetSaro.fdb database file found in the "NetSaro Enterprise ServerDb" directory can obtain the user credentials using readily available tools. More information about this class of vulnerability can be obtained by visiting http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Dataï¿½ CWE 311

Fixed in: None Available

Remediation guidelines: Limit access to this hosts running the software and apply security patches as they become available.
