Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2011-2481: Apache Tomcat information disclosure vulnerability

CVE-2011-2481: Apache Tomcat information disclosure vulnerability

Severity: low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.16
Previous versions are not affected.

Description:
The re-factoring of XML validation for Tomcat 7.0.x re-introduced the
vulnerability previously reported as CVE-2009-0783. This was initially
reported as a memory leak
(https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=51395). If a web
application is the first web
application loaded, this bug allows that web application to potentially
view and/or alter the web.xml, context.xml and tld files of other web
applications deployed on the Tomcat instance.

Mitigation:
7.0.x users should upgrade to 7.0.17 or later

Example:
See https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c12 for an
example web application that can be used to replace the XML parser used
by Tomcat.

Credit:
The security implications of bug 51395 were identified by the Tomcat
security team.
