ZDI-11-266: RealNetworks RealPlayer Advanced Audio Coding Element Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-266

August 16, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-2951

-- CVSS:
7.5, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

-- Affected Vendors:
RealNetworks

-- Affected Products:
RealNetworks RealPlayer

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists due to the application using a size defined in
a header in order to allocate some number of bytes. When processing an
AAC raw_data_frame, the application will use the product of the original
length and a field inside one of its elements. During the copy
operation, this length will be larger than the amount that was allocated
for which will cause a buffer overflow and can lead to code execution
under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
