-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the part of the application that is
responsible for reloading the markup for a root document object. During
reloading of the markup, the application will dispatch a notification
whilst retaining a reference to the object in the function's context.
This can allow an event callback to tamper with the root document
object. Usage of this malformed object can then be used to achieve code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
