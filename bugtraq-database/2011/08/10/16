Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.09.11: Adobe Flash Player Integer Overflow

iDefense Security Advisory 08.09.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 09, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Flash Player is an application for viewing animations and movies
using computer programs such as a Web browser; in common usage, Flash
lets you put animation and movies on a website. Flash Player runs SWF
files that can be created by the Adobe Flash authoring tool, by Adobe
Flex, or by a number of other Macromedia and third-party tools. For more
information, please visit following website:

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in Adobe
Systems Inc.'s Flash Player could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

During the allocation of an array within a certain internal ActionScript
function, a size calculation may cause an integer value to overflow.
This condition may lead to the bounds of an undersized array being
overflown during a memory copy operation. This can result in arbitrary
code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Flash file
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into a compromised, trusted
site.

IV. DETECTION

The following Adobe Products are vulnerable: <ul>  <li> Adobe Flash
Player 10.3.181.36 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, Linux

and earlier versions for Android </li> <li> Adobe AIR 2.7 and earlier
versions for Windows, Macintosh and Android </li> </ul>

V. WORKAROUND

which is usually under C:\WINDOWS\system32\Macromed\Flash\
