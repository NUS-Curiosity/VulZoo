TOORCON 13 CALL FOR PAPERS

It's that time of year again! ToorCon 13 is coming so get your code finished and submit a talk this time around. We're letting you decide if you want to be a part of our 50-minute talks on Saturday, 20-minute talks on Sunday, and 75-minute talks for our Deep Knowledge Seminars on Friday depending on how much time you need to present your new ideas and techniques. We evaluate our submissions in the order that they're received so submit your talk before time runs out! This year's theme will be "Luck" so preference will be given to talks which address how luck plays into security and the probabilistic nature of what we as hackers and security professionals do on a daily basis.
