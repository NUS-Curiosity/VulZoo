-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of McAfee Security-as-a-Service.  User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaws exists within myCIOScn.dll. First, the
MyCioScan.Scan.ReportFile parameter exposed via ActiveX can be set to
any arbitrary filename including sensitive system files and directories.
Secondly, the parameter to the MyCioScan.Scan.Start() method can be
carefully crafted as to inject script constructs into the log file
written at the end of the AV scan. The combination of these flaws can be
leveraged by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
McAfee   has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
