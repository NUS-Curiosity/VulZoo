Subject: IPv6 Hackers mailing-list

Folks,

We have created the "IPv6 Hackers" mailing-list for discussion of IPv6
security issues. The charter of the list is:

---- cut here ----
This list was created for the discussion of IPv6 security issues and
low/packet-level issues related to the IPv6 protocols. It is meant to
provide forum for IPv6 security researchers and IPv6 networking
professionals to discuss low-level IPv6 networking and security issues
that could eventually lead to advances and improvements in the area of
IPv6 security and IPv6 networking. Discussion of unrelated networking or
security topics are considered "off topic". Subscription to the list is
open to the community.

(ipv6hackers-es). You can subscribe to this list here:
