Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco 10000 Series Denial of Service
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110928-c10k

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 September 28 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco 10000 Series Router is affected by a denial of service
(DoS) vulnerability that can allow an attacker to cause a device
reload by sending a series of ICMP packets.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are also available.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-c10k.shtml.

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that
correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as
well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the
following link:

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco 10000 Series Routers that are running an affected version of
Cisco IOS are affected.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco
product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the "show
version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco
IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by
"Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices
do not have the "show version" command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco 10000 Series Router is affected by a denial of service
(DoS) vulnerability where an unauthenticated attacker could cause a
device reload by sending a series of ICMP packets.

Traffic destined to the device or transit traffic could trigger the
effects of this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtk62453 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3270.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an affected
device to reload. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained
DoS condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Additionally, the Cisco IOS Software Checker is available on
the Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) portal at
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x. It provides
several features for checking which Security Advisories affect specified
versions of Cisco IOS Software.

Cisco IOS Software
+-----------------

Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a
Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the
earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed
Release For This Advisory column. The First Fixed Release for All
Advisories in the September 2011 Bundled Publication column lists the
earliest possible releases that correct all the published
vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled
publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available
release, where possible.

effects of this vulnerability. Subsequently, the only workaround
available is to block ICMP packets destined to the affected device
and all ICMP transit traffic.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
