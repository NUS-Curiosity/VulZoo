APPLE-SA-2011-09-09-1 Security Update 2011-005

Security Update 2011-005 is now available and addresses the
following:

Certificate Trust Policy
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.6.8, Mac OS X Server v10.6.8,
OS X Lion v10.7.1, OS X Lion Server v10.7.1
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept
user credentials or other sensitive information
Description:  Fraudulent certificates were issued by multiple
certificate authorities operated by DigiNotar. This issue is
addressed by removing DigiNotar from the list of trusted root
certificates, from the list of Extended Validation (EV) certificate
authorities, and by configuring default system trust settings so that
DigiNotar's certificates, including those issued by other
authorities, are not trusted.
