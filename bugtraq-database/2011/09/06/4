- Ocultar texto das mensagens anteriores -
Windows Live Messenger allows attackers to bypass client-side security
mechanisms normally imposed on web content by modern browsers. An
attacker can gain elevated access privileges to sensitive
page-content, session cookies, and a variety of other information
maintained by the browser on behalf of the user.

[Impact]

- High

[Affected Version]

- Ebuddy Windows Live Messenger;
- Other products may also be vulnerable;

[Bug Description and Proof of Concept]

- Exploiting the HTML-injection issue allows an attacker to execute
HTML and Java Script code in the remote user context to steal
cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is
rendered to the user; other attacks may also be possible.

- Moreover, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are caused due
to lack of input validation. This allows malicious people to inject
arbitrary HTML and script code. More info at:
