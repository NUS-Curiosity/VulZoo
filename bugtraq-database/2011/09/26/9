CVE-2011-1184 Apache Tomcat - Multiple weaknesses in HTTP DIGEST
authentication

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- - Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.11
- - Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.32
- - Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.33
- - Earlier, unsupported versions may also be affected

Description:
The implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication was discovered to
have several weaknesses:
- - replay attacks were permitted
- - server nonces were not checked
- - client nonce counts were not checked
- - qop values were not checked
- - realm values were not checked
- - the server secret was hard-coded to a known string
The result of these weaknesses is that DIGEST authentication was only
as secure as BASIC authentication.

Mitigation:
Users of Tomcat 7.0.x should upgrade to 7.0.12 or later
Users of Tomcat 6.0.x should upgrade to 6.0.33 or later
Users of Tomcat 5.5.x should upgrade to 5.5.34 or later

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team
