Subject: Re: Vulnerabilities in trading and SCADA softwares

The so called vulnerability in ScadaPro does not apply when the Windows firewall is enabled and under normal circumstances the TCP-IP port is not used to communicate with the ScadaPro service.

In the next release of ScadaPro the TCP/IP port will not be available and instead a secure web service will be available.

Also please note these tests were performed independently of Measuresoft on a demo version and without seeking or obtaining any advice from Measuresoft on how to securely deploy ScadaPro.
