Hi, Marc,

Again, please ask PSIRT. :-)

In any case, the world doesn't (or "shouldn't", at least) care about the
"who", but rather should care about the "what".

I was referring to the RA-Guard spec (RFC6105), and not the SLAAC spec.

One could argue that good programming practice means that you enforce
limits on everything. That said, I agree that implementation advice is
strongly needed.

mmm... not really so. Bob Hinden himself seemed to be in favor of baning
all of them..

Agreed.

IIRC, both Linux and Windows 7 do.

Please see:
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-gont-v6ops-ra-guard-evasion-01.txt

It doesn't require any modifications at the client (assuming it
completely bans fragmented RAs).

As noted in my blog post, curiously enough the problem statement
(RFC6104) is about accidental RAs, while the RA-Guard "spec" itself aims
to be a "security device".
