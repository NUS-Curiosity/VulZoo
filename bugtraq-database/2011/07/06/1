Subject: Ubuntu: reseed(8), random.org, and HTTP request


Ubuntu's reseed(8) can be used to seed the PRNG state of a host. The
script is run when the package installed, and anytime su executes the
script.

reseed(8) performs a unsecured HTTP request to random.org for its
bits, despite random.org offering HTTPS services.

The Ubuntu Security Team took no interest when contacted by email (no
reply); the point of contact listed in the man pages took no interest
when contacted by email (no reply); and a launcher bug report was not
acted upon (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/reseed/+bug/804594).
