You need to worry about more than just this product. If an attacker
launches a vulnerable executable for which he has a vector (not
necessarily this product), all he/she needs to do is set the current
directory to the location of the flawed DLL. I believe it would
succeed because so few actually set SafeDllSearchMode to enabled (from
my auditing experience). See
