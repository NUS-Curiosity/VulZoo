July 11, 2011

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Trend Micro

-- Affected Products:
Trend Micro Control Manager

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Control Manager. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the Cas_LogDirectInsert.aspx http
handler, which listens by default on TCP port 443. A specially crafted
POST request allows remote attackers to supply XML and schema
information which is used within queries to the backend database. By
supplying malicious values, an attacker can inject themselves a user
account which can be used to execute code via the management console on
the service.
