Subject: [HITB-Announce] REMINDER: HITB2011 - Malaysia Call for Papers Closes on the 15th


This is a reminder that the Call for Papers for the 9th annual
HITBSecConf in Malaysia is closing this Friday, 15th of July. The event
takes place from the 10th - 13th of October at the Intercontinental
Kuala Lumpur.

As always, talks that are more technical or that discuss new and never
before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has
been covered several times before. Each non-resident speaker will
receive accommodation for 3 nights / 4 days and travel reimbursement up
to EUR1200.00 / USD1700.00
