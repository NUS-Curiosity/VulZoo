Subject: Reminder - DeepSec 2011 Call For Papers


--- DeepSec 2011 "High Five" - Call for Papers - REMINDER

For the fifth time the DeepSec In-Depth Security Conference invites
security researchers and professionals to submit suggestions for talks
and workshops for our conference which will take place in November 2011
in Vienna.
Please visit our updated website for more details about the venue, the
schedule and information about our past conferences:
https://deepsec.net/

The DeepSec offers a mix of different topics and aspects like current
threats and vulnerabilities, social engineering and psychological
aspects as well as security management and philosophy. Our speakers and
trainers traditionally come from the security community, companies,
hacker spaces and academic organisations.

You can submit content for three categories:
- Talks for the conference (45 minute slots)
- Two day workshops
- U21 (a special category for young security researchers)

https://deepsec.net/cfp

--- Talks:
To make it short, talks should be up-to-date, of a high quality that
matches our previous years and preferably exclusive (which of course is
not a hard requirement but it will be one evaluation criterion). Topics
from all security disciplines are welcome but we encourage you to submit
talks about emerging technologies and concepts like:
- Mobile computing and communications
- IPv6 (yes, again!)
- Cloud computing and virtualisation
- Security intelligence
- Security management and IT governance (a.k.a. "The Big Picture")
- Topics that have a high impact on IT security
- Design flaws ("defective by design")

Talks should not:
- Endorse products, vendors or specific solutions
- Discredit anyone or anything, let's be fair

Speaker privileges:
- Free entrance to the conference
- Hotel accommodation for three nights (single/double room)
- Travel expenses up to EUR 800,-
- Invitation to our famous Speaker's Dinner with Austrian food

--- Workshops:
We look for highest quality and most current topics. We had very good
feedback for our workshops in the past and we want to keep it that way.
Our audience has a very high level of technical understanding and is
deeply involved with security management, implementation, operation and
research.
What we like to see:
- In-depth workshops on securing the infrastructure
- Social engineering and psychological aspects
- IPv6 (yes, again!)
- Mobile communications, vulnerabilities and defences

Workshops should not:
- Teach too much basic stuff (keep the level rather high)
- Focus on specific vendors or products

Trainer privileges:
- Free entrance to the conference
- Invitation to our famous Speaker's Dinner with Austrian food
- 50% of the net profit of your class

--- U21 category:
We don't take the age so serious as it might sound but this category is
especially for young security researchers who are *not* working in a
professional sense yet, e.g. (full-time) students, or attending college,
technical school or just interested in computer security. We will also
accept submissions if you are a little bit older than 21 years.
Don't be shy if your idea is not groundbreaking or not the top
vulnerability discovered in the last 5 years. There's always room for
some extra hacking. :)
We want to encourage you to submit your *own* research.
We will ask some questions and evaluate your submission, so don't cheat.
What we like to see:
- anything that is your own idea and/or implementation
- a valuable extension to existing ideas and/or implementations
- anything you have discovered on your own and is not discussed a lot
yet or has been accepted as a CVE (common exploit and vulnerability)

Please don't:
- Reuse something existing
- Implement something which has been around for long

U21 privileges:
- A 15 minute lightning talk on the conference
- Free entrance to the conference
- Invitation to the Speaker's Dinner, but no alocohol without age
check ;)
- We help you with your travel expenses to Vienna, but cannot cover the
full speakers allowance, if in doubt talk to us we can work something
out.

All CfP submissions must go through the form on our web site:
https://deepsec.net/cfp.html

We will support anyone if you have question, need clarification
whatever, just contact us for additional questions: cfp@...psec.net
