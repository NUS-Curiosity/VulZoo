-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the way Sybase Backup and Monitor
servers handle certain data in the login packets. Malformed packets can
cause the service in question to lookup a function pointer outside a
predefined function pointer array. It is possible to set this function
pointer to an address where user controlled data exists and this will
result in code execution under the rights of the user running the
Monitor Server.

-- Vendor Response:
Sybase has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
