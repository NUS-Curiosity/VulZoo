Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco SA 500 Series Security Appliances Web Management Interface Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110720-sa500

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 July 20 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco SA 500 Series Security Appliances are affected by two
vulnerabilities on their web-based management interface. An attacker
must have valid credentials for an affected device to exploit one
vulnerability; exploitation of the other does not require
authentication. Both vulnerabilities can be exploited over the
network.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

This advisory is posted at:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110720-sa500.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

These vulnerabilities affect the following devices running a software
version prior to the first fixed release documented in the Software
Versions and Fixes section of this advisory:

  * Cisco SA520
  * Cisco SA520W
  * Cisco SA540

There are multiple methods to determine the version of system
software that is running on a device. At the device web login screen,
the system software version is displayed under the "Security
Appliance Configuration Utility" heading. Administrators can also log
in to a device through the web management interface and navigate to
Administration > Firmware & Configuration > Network. The Primary
Firmware field appears below Status Information. The number directly
beside the Primary Firmware field is the system software version.

Alternately, after logging in to the device, administrators can click
on the About link on top right side of the screen. The system
software version will be displayed below the "Security Appliance
Configuration Utility" heading. An example of the system firmware
version is 2.1.18.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+---------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco SA 500 Series Security Appliances, which are part of the Cisco
Small Business Pro Series, are comprehensive gateway security
solutions that combine firewall, VPN, optional intrusion prevention,
and web, and e-mail security capabilities.

Cisco SA 500 Series Security Appliances are affected by two web
management interface vulnerabilities:

  * SQL Injection Vulnerability

    The login form of the SA 500 Series Security Appliances is
    vulnerable to a SQL injection vulnerability that could allow an
    unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain usernames and
    passwords that are configured on an affected device.

    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtq65669 and
    has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
    ID CVE-2011-2546

  * Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

    An authenticated user who is logged in to an affected device
    could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary commands
    into the underlying operating system. By supplying malicious
    parameters through several web forms, the attacker could gain
    root privileges.

    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtq65681 and
    has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
    ID CVE-2011-2547

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* CSCtq65669 - SQL injection vulnerability

CVSS Base Score - 5.0
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Partial
    Integrity Impact -         None
    Availability Impact -      None

CVSS Temporal Score - 4.1
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


* CSCtq65681 - Privilege escalation vulnerability

CVSS Base Score - 9.0
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           Single
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         Complete
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 7.4
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could
allow the retrieval of usernames and passwords. An authenticated user
could exploit the privilege escalation vulnerability to execute
underlying operating system commands.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
And any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Small Business Support Center or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

These vulnerabilities have been corrected in software versions 2.1.19
and later.

If administrators of SA 500 Series Security Appliances have
configured the Check for New Firmware notification under
Administration > Firmware & Configuration > Network, a message
regarding new firmware that is available on Cisco.com will be
displayed at the next log in to the appliance. 

Note: the SA 500 will not perform an automatic upgrade to 
version 2.1.19. The upgrade must be performed by an administrator.

The latest software for SA 500 Series Security Appliances can be
downloaded at:
http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?mdfid=282414017

Workarounds
===========

The following mitigations help limit the exposure to these
vulnerabilities.

  * Disable Remote Management

    Caution: Do not disable remote management if administrators
    manage devices via the WAN connection. This action will result in
    a loss of management connectivity to the device. Several features
    also require remote management to be enabled, including SSL VPN
    access and the Cisco Quick Virtual Private Network (QVPN)
    Utility.

    Remote Management is disabled by default. Administrators can
    disable this feature by choosing Network Management > Remote
    Management. Change the setting for this field to Disabled.
    Disabling remote management limits exposure because the
    vulnerabilities can then be exploited from the inter-LAN network
    only.

    Disabling remote management limits the exposure as the
    vulnerabilities can then only be exploited from the inter LAN
    network.

  * Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses

    If remote management is required, secure the device so that it
    can be accessed by certain IP addresses only, rather than the
    default setting of All IP Addresses. After choosing Network
    Management > Remote Management, an administrator can change the
    Remote IP Address field to ensure that only devices with
    specified IP addresses can access the device.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html
Or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:
