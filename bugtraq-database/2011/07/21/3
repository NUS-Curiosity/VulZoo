July 20, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-2667

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
CA

-- Affected Products:
CA Total Defense Suite

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of CA Total Defense Suite r12. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the Icihttp.exe module (CA Gateway
Security for HTTP), which responds to incoming HTTP requests on port
8080. Due to a flawed copy-loop algorithm in the URL parsing routine, it
is possible for a remote unauthenticated user to cause an exploitable
heap corruption condition. This could result in the execution of
arbitrary code under the context of the Gateway Security service.

-- Vendor Response:
CA states:
CA20110720-01: Security Notice for CA Gateway Security and Total
Defense
