Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 07.20.11: Multiple Vendor WebKit MathML
 Use-After-Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.20.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 20, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

MathML is an XML-based markup language used to describe mathematical
operations. It can be embedded inside of HTML and is supported by the
WebKit engine.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit, as
included with multiple vendors' browsers, could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. <BR><BR>
The vulnerability occurs during the processing of MathML markup tags.
Specifically, it is possible to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability
when Safari fails to properly release an object. The object's memory is
freed; however, a reference to the object remains. When the reference is
later used to access the object, this now invalid memory is treated as a
valid object and the object's vtable is used to make an indirect
function call. This may result in the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.
After the user visits the malicious Web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

Safari versions prior to 5.1 and 5.0.6 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling JavaScript is an effective workaround for this vulnerability.
