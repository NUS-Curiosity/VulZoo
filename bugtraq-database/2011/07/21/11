 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.20.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 20, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Safari is Apple's web browser, and is based on the open source WebKit
browser engine. MobileSafari is Safari for Apple's mobile devices
including the iPad and iPhone. For more information, see the vendor's
site found at the following link.

http://www.apple.com/safari/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Apple Inc.'s
Safari browser could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the current user.

Safari is Apple's Web browser and is based on the open source WebKit
browser engine.

This vulnerability occurs when Safari incorrectly handles an error state
when encountering a broken XHTML tag. Specifically, the tag enclosing
the tag being processed is freed and is then referenced after it has
already been freed. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.
After the user visits the malicious Web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

Safari versions prior to 5.1 and 5.0.6 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling JavaScript is an effective workaround for this vulnerability.
