Installation note:

This update is only available through iTunes, and will not appear
in your computer's Software Update application, or in the Apple
Downloads site. Make sure you have an Internet connection and have
installed the latest version of iTunes from www.apple.com/itunes/

iTunes will automatically check Apple's update server on its weekly
schedule. When an update is detected, it will download it. When
the iPhone, iPod touch or iPad is docked, iTunes will present the
user with the option to install the update. We recommend applying
the update immediately if possible. Selecting Don't Install will
present the option the next time you connect your iPhone, iPod touch,
or iPad.

The automatic update process may take up to a week depending on the
day that iTunes checks for updates. You may manually obtain the
update via the Check for Updates button within iTunes. After doing
this, the update can be applied when your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad
is docked to your computer.

To check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:

* Navigate to Settings
* Select General
* Select About. The version after applying this update will be
"4.3.5 (8L1)".

Information will also be posted to the Apple Security Updates
web site: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222
