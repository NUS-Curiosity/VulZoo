Remote code execution through OGNL double evaluation (CVE-2017-14589)

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, according
to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The scale allows us to
rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.
This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT
environment.


Description:

It was possible for double OGNL evaluation in FreeMarker templates through
Struts FreeMarker tags to occur. An attacker who has restricted administration
rights to Bamboo or who hosts a website that a Bamboo administrator visits, is
able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on
systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo.
Versions of Bamboo before version 6.1.6 (the fixed version for 6.1.x) and from
version 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for 6.2.x) are affected by this
vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at:

Bamboo that has a non-linked Mercurial repository, create or edit a plan in
Bamboo when there is at least one linked Mercurial repository that the attacker
has permission to use, or commit to a Mercurial repository used by a Bamboo plan
which has branch detection enabled can execute code of their choice on systems
that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo Server.
Versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.1.6 (the fixed version for
6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for 6.2.x) are affected by
