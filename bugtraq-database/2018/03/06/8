Subject: CVE-2017-12544 XSS on HPE System Management Homepage v7.6.0.11 and minor

Product: HPE System Management Homepage
Versions: 7.6.0.11 and minor versions
Vulnerability: JavaScript Injection in file gsearch.php, parameter prod
OWASP TOP 10: A1 Injection
Type: Javascript Injection
Impact: Allows an attacker to perform an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack, 
execute arbitrary JavaScript client-side, steal admin credentials, etc

Access Vector: Adjacent Networks
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None

CVE-2017-12544


Intro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The HP System Management Homepage (SMH) is a web-based interface that 
consolidates and simplifies the management of ProLiant and Integrity servers 
running Microsoft Windows or Linux, or HP 9000 and HP Integrity servers 
running HP-UX 11i. By aggregating data from HP Insight Management Agents and 
other tools, SMH provides a secure and intuitive interface to review 
in-depth hardware configuration and status data, performance metrics, system 
thresholds and software version control information.


The risk is high because this software is used in HP Windows and Linux 
servers. Actually there are many banking clients affected among other 
critical industries.

The attacker can trigger this vulnerability without authentication.

There is a JavaScript injection in file gsearch.php.en that affects form 
parameter prod sent over GET method, exactly in this line:

var prodName = '<?php echo $prodName; ?>';

That allows arbitrary javascript client-side execution and XSS attacks 
because quotes are not escaped, and an attacker is able to inject directly 
JavaScript code with optional embedded HTML entities that are executed and 
rendered in victim's browser.


Proof of concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://192.168.1.103:2381/gsearch.php.en?prod=%27%3beval%28alert%28%22uppps%22%29%29%3b%27


Fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

var prodName = '<?php echo htmlentities($prodName); ?>';


Credits

Special thanks to Abelardo Suira for helping me to setup the environment and 
HPE for their support fixing the vulnerability.
