======================================================================
1) Affected Software
 
* LibRaw versions prior to 0.18.8.
 
======================================================================
2) Severity
 
Rating: Moderately critical
Impact: Denial of Service
Where:  From remote
 
======================================================================
3) Description of Vulnerabilities
 
Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in LibRaw,
which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of
Service).
 
3.1) A type confusion error within the "identify()" function
(internal/dcraw_common.cpp) can be exploited to trigger a division by
zero.
 
3.2) A boundary error within the "quicktake_100_load_raw()" function
(internal/dcraw_common.cpp) can be exploited to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow and subsequently cause a crash.
 
3.3) An error within the "leaf_hdr_load_raw()" function
(internal/dcraw_common.cpp) can be exploited to trigger a NULL pointer
dereference.
 
The vulnerabilities are confirmed in version 0.18.7 and reported in
versions prior to 0.18.8.
 
======================================================================
4) Solution
 
Update to version 0.18.8.

8) About Flexera Software

Flexera  helps application  producers and enterprises  increase
application usage and the value they derive from their software.

http://www.flexerasoftware.com/enterprise/company/about/

Flexera delivers  market-leading  Software  Vulnerability Management
solutions  enabling  enterprises  to  proactively  identify  and
remediate software vulnerabilities, effectively reducing the risk of
costly security breaches.

http://www.flexerasoftware.com/enterprise/products/

Flexera  supports  and  contributes  to  the community in several
ways.  We  have  always  believed  that  reliable  vulnerability
intelligence and tools to aid identifying and fixing vulnerabilities
should be  freely available  for  consumers  to ensure that users,
who care about their online privacy and security, can stay secure.
Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help
users get updated  and  stay secure.  End-users (whether private
individuals or businesses) are otherwise left largely alone,  and
that is why back in 2002, Secunia Research started investigating,
coordinating  disclosure  and  verifying software vulnerabilities.
In  2016,  Secunia Research  became  a  part  of  Flexera and today
our in-house software vulnerability research remains the core  of
the  Software  Vulnerability  Management  products  at Flexera.

The  public Secunia Advisory database  contains  information  for
researchers, security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual
products and vulnerabilities and assess, whether they need to take
any actions to secure their systems or whether a given vulnerability
has already been discovered
