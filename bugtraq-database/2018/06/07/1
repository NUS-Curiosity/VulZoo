Package        : memcached
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-9951 CVE-2018-1000115 CVE-2018-1000127
Debian Bug     : 868701 894404

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2017-9951

    Daniel Shapira reported a heap-based buffer over-read in memcached
    (resulting from an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8705) triggered by
    specially crafted requests to add/set a key and allowing a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000115

    It was reported that memcached listens to UDP by default. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of it to use the memcached service as a
    DDoS amplifier.

    Default installations of memcached in Debian are not affected by
    this issue as the installation defaults to listen only on localhost.
    This update disables the UDP port by default. Listening on the UDP
    can be re-enabled in the /etc/memcached.conf (cf.
    /usr/share/doc/memcached/NEWS.Debian.gz).

CVE-2018-1000127

    An integer overflow was reported in memcached, resulting in resource
    leaks, data corruption, deadlocks or crashes.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.21-1.1+deb8u2.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.33-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.
