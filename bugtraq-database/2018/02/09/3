Package        : mpv
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-6360
Debian Bug     : 889892

A regression was detected in the previously issued fix for CVE-2018-6360.
The patch released with DSA 4105-1 broke the feature of invoking mpv with
raw YouTube ids. This update fixes this functionality issue. For
reference, the relevant part of the original advisory text follows.

It was discovered that mpv, a media player, was vulnerable to remote code
execution attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious web page that,
when used as an argument in mpv, could execute arbitrary code in the host
of the mpv user.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.23.0-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mpv packages.

For the detailed security status of mpv please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mpv
