Package        : thunderbird
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5156 CVE-2018-5187 CVE-2018-12361 CVE-2018-12367 
                 CVE-2018-12371

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60
 
In addition, the new Thunderbird packages require Rust to build. A
compatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is
not available for all architectures which previously supported the
purely C++-based Thunderbird packages. Thus, the new Thunderbird packages
don't support the mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures at this point.
				 
For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:60.0-3~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

its security tracker page at:
