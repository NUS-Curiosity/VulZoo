Package        : openafs
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16947 CVE-2018-16948 CVE-2018-16949
Debian Bug     : 908616

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in openafs, an implementation of
the distributed filesystem AFS. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2018-16947

    Jeffrey Altman reported that the backup tape controller (butc)
    process does accept incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow
    for) authentication of those RPCs, allowing an unauthenticated
    attacker to perform volume operations with administrator
    credentials.

CVE-2018-16948

    Mark Vitale reported that several RPC server routines do not fully
    initialize output variables, leaking memory contents (from both
    the stack and the heap) to the remote caller for
    otherwise-successful RPCs.

CVE-2018-16949

    Mark Vitale reported that an unauthenticated attacker can consume
    large amounts of server memory and network bandwidth via
    specially crafted requests, resulting in denial of service to
    legitimate clients.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.20-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
