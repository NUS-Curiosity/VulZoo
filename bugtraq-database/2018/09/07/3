Description:
===========
Register form, login form and password recovery form need CAPTCHA
solving to perform actions. However, these CAPTCHAs seem to be valid
as long as the user session is valid. One could send as many requests
as one wished by automatisation. This allows an attacker to spam large
number of mail addresses, and brute-force credentials.
