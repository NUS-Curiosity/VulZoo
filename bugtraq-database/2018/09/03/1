CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to multiple potential 
risks with CA PPM (formerly CA Clarity PPM). Multiple vulnerabilities 
exist that can allow an attacker to conduct a variety of attacks.  

The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-13822, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns an SSL password being stored in plain text, which can allow 
an attacker to access sensitive information.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-13823, has a high risk rating and 
concerns an XML external entity vulnerability in the XOG functionality, 
which can allow a remote attacker to access sensitive information.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2018-13824, has a high risk rating and 
concerns two parameters that fail to properly sanitize input, which 
can allow a remote attacker to execute SQL injection attacks.

The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2018-13825, has a high risk rating and 
concerns improper input validation by the gridExcelExport 
functionality, which can allow a remote attacker to execute reflected 
cross-site scripting attacks.

The fifth vulnerability, CVE-2018-13826, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns an XML external entity vulnerability in the XOG functionality, 
which can allow a remote attacker to conduct server side request
