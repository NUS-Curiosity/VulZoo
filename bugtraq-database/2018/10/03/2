~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Collaboration Compliance and Quality Management Platform is a product
to record and play calls with VoIP-telephons including Skype, messages
and video. The permission management works with different roles and
groups. So member can just play their own calls and investigators can
also play calls of other users.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Verint Essential Workforce Optimization offers advanced automation to
get the most from your workforce. Our software and services can
enhance the efficiency of your employees and processes, and enable you
to share workforce intelligence in real-time across your
business. Mid-market contact centers, back-office operations, branch
operations and financial trading rooms can rely on Verint Essential
Workforce Optimization to capture and store interactions, heighten
quality, ensure compliance and help manage the availability and
performance of employees in targeted areas of their businesses."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

At the page "Group Configuration - Assign Users" a list of users are
shown which are in this group. Every user can also be a member of the
groups Member, Supervisor, Investigator, Administrator and Manager,
but Investigator is diabled. By modifing the html source code with the
developer tools (Internet Explorer 11: key F12) it is possible to
enable this checkbox, set it to true and save the new
configuration. At this moment the user gets also a new tab named
workflow to see four-eyes-requests.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

Go to "Group Configuration - Assign Users", enable the Investigator
checkbox with the developer tools, activate the checkbox and press
save.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

Install the new version, which was published by the vendor [2].
