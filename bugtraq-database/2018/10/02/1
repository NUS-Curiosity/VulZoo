Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted F2FS volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted HFS+ volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
