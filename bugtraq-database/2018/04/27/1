FINAL CALL!!

The Call for Papers for the HITB GSEC 2018 Singapore is now open!

Call for Papers: https://gsec.hitb.org/call-for-papers/
Event Website: https://gsec.hitb.org/sg2018/

HITB GSEC is a three-day security conference where attendees
get to vote on the final agenda of talks. Attendees can also opt to be
introduced to speakers and each other based on the votes they cast.

Held at the Intercontinental Singapore from August 27th till the
31st, we'll start off with 3 days of hands-on intensive training classes
followed by a 3-day conference featuring keynotes by Michael Coates, Chief 
Information Officer at Twitter and Alexander Polyakov, co-founder of ERPScan.

We are looking for 60-minute, offensive and defensive focused deep-knowledge
presentations. Research that is new, novel and most importantly material
that has not been presented elsewhere prior. We strongly encourage women in IT
to send in your research papers.

Submission Process:

1.) Register as a speaker at http://gsec.hitb.org/cfp/
2.) Send us the following:

- Presentation abstract (1000 - 1500 words)
- White paper (3500 - 5000 words)
- Supporting material (poc code, slides, video etc)
- A recent photograph

3.) When CFP closes, audience voting begins. Each registered delegate
gets 3 votes to cast against any presentations they like.

4.) When a presentation receives 8 votes it is removed from voting. You
then receive an email introduction to voters which allows you to further
fine tune your presentation to suit the audience profile.
