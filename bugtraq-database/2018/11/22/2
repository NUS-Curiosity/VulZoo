Package        : ceph
Debian Bug     : 913909

The update for ceph issued as DSA-4339-1 caused a build regression for
the i386 builds. Updated packages are now available to address this
issue. For reference, the original advisory text follows.

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Ceph, a distributed storage
and file system: The cephx authentication protocol was susceptible to
replay attacks and calculated signatures incorrectly, "ceph mon" did not
validate capabilities for pool operations (resulting in potential
corruption or deletion of snapshot images) and a format string
vulnerability in libradosstriper could result in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.2.11-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ceph packages.

For the detailed security status of ceph please refer to its security
tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ceph
