Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch and users of this product are urged to
immediately upgrade to the latest version available.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Application overview:
Miss Marple is an inventory software that consists of a client and a server
part. The client (agent) is gathering system information and uploads the
results to a remote server in an encrypted ZIP file.

1) Hardcoded AES key (CVE-2018-19233)
A username and an encrypted password were identified in the Miss Marple
Inventory Agent configuration file. By decompiling the binary, the encryption
method was identified as AES-256 with a hardcoded key and initialization vector.
The credentials are used to deploy the inventory files to a remote server.


2) Uploading arbitrary files
There are two ways an attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server.

2.1) Patching the application binary to bypass the ZIP file extension check

Using this method, it is possible to upload any file to the server, even if
the credentials are unknown to the attacker! This works because every file in
a specific directory gets uploaded, as long as the file has the correct file
extension. This can be bypassed because the file extension is only checked on
the client side and not on the server side. Patching the binary is done by
replacing the extension string with the file extension of the attackers
file eg. ".aspx" in the MMIA.exe binary itself.

2.2) Using cURL to upload arbitrary files

If the credentials are known to the attacker, it is possible to use tools like
cURL to upload arbitrary files to the remote server.

Both ways can be used by an attacker to upload a web-shell to the server and
execute arbitrary commands.


3) Missing update validation (CVE-2018-19234)
Besides the Miss Marple Inventory Agent, an Miss Marple Updater Service is
running on all clients. This service checks for new versions on the same server.
If the files are uploaded to the right directory on the server, the updater will
download and execute them with the highest privileges (NT Authority\SYSTEM) without
validating the binaries.
This can also be used for escalating privileges on the client. By uploading a
web-shell using the methods described in vulnerability 2, an attacker gets
sufficient write permissions to access the update directory and to place malicious
files on the server. This will execute arbitrary code on all clients using Miss
Marple.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded AES key (CVE-2018-19233)
No proof of concept will be provided.

2) Uploading arbitrary files
2.1) No proof of concept will be provided. E.g. the Unicode string for ".zip" just
has to be replaced with the file extension for the uploaded web-shell.

2.2) Using cURL to upload arbitrary files
It is possible to upload arbitrary files using cURL and the credentials obtained
in 1).

3) Missing update validation (CVE-2018-19234)
No proof of concept will be provided.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following versions have been tested and found to be vulnerable:

Miss Marple Inventory Agent / Miss Marple Updater Service 1.13
