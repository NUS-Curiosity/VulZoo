Vendor description:
-------------------
"Skype for Business (formerly Microsoft Office Communicator and Microsoft
Lync) is an instant messaging client used with Skype for Business Server or
with Skype for Business Online (available with Microsoft Office 365).
Skype for Business is enterprise software."

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_for_Business


Business recommendation:
------------------------
Assess the impact of this vulnerability on your business. The patch
provided by Microsoft should be installed immediately. Especially if
Skype for Business is being used for external communication.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
A large number of emojis (e.g. ~800 kittens) received in one message by the Skype
For Business client freezes the program for a few seconds. This can be
exploited to perform Denial of Service attacks against Skype for Business
users and compromises the availability of the program.

For example, an attacker can continuously send such messages to the chat
window of a meeting room in order to freeze the program for all participants
and prevent them from using the chat or seeing the video.

Note that the sound and video stream is handled by a separate thread and
therefore are not affected (e.g. killed), only the functions related to
graphical user interface become unusable.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
After sending a big amount of emojis (~800 kittens) to a Skype for Business
chat, the program freezes for a few seconds while rendering the chat window.
Continuously sending emojis will make the GUI unusable for the user.
Ongoing conference calls are not affected or interrupted.

The following SIP packet illustrates the attack.
