Subject: ezmlm warning

Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
bugtraq@...urityfocus.com mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at bugtraq-owner@...urityfocus.com.

Messages to you from the bugtraq mailing list seem to
have been bouncing. I've attached a copy of the first bounce
message I received.

If this message bounces too, I will send you a probe. If the probe bounces,
I will remove your address from the bugtraq mailing list,
without further notice.

I've kept a list of which messages from the bugtraq mailing list have 
bounced from your address.

Copies of these messages may be in the archive.

To retrieve a set of messages 123-145 (a maximum of 100 per request),
send an empty message to:
   <bugtraq-get.123_145@...urityfocus.com>

To receive a subject and author list for the last 100 or so messages,
send an empty message to:
   <bugtraq-index@...urityfocus.com>

Here are the message numbers:

   59670
   59669

Subject: failure notice

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at lists.securityfocus.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<bugtraq@...sts.openwall.net>:
100.122.155.207 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 553 sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed rcpthosts (#5.7.1)
Giving up on 100.122.155.207.
