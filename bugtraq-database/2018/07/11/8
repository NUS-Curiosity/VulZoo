Bug Bounty Program


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An input validation issue and multiple cross site vulnerabilities has
been discovered in the official AT&T Bizcircle online service
web-application.
The persistent cross site issue allows remote attackers to inject own
malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
the frontend or backend of the affected web-application.

The vulnerabilities are located in the `/members/att1759500603/profile/`
section of the content management system. Attackers are able to inject
own malicious script code to the `firstname, lastname, name & groups`
parameters of the `profile` section on update. An attacker could register
and then change the firstname and lastname or shared group to a payload
that is insecure saved into the database management system. The injected
payload provokes a persistent execution of the injected code in the
backend or frontend. Session hijacking, persistent phishing and
backend/frontend exploitation is possible.

The security risk of the persistent xss vulnerabilities are estimated as
medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.6.
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low
privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent
phishing, session hijacking, persistent external redirect
to malicious sources and client-side manipulation of affected or
connected web module context.

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] firstname
[+] lastname
[+] name
[+] groups

Affected Section(s):
[+] Frontend
[+] Backend


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low
privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
instruction and information below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce ...
1. Register to the att bizcirlce web-application by usage of the
register function
2. Login to your account and open the profile section
Note: Start a http session tamper in the browser to preview or record
3. Include the payload to the vulnerable marked input fields (firstname,
lastname, name & groups)
4. Save the profile entries by submit of the post method request
5. The execute occurs in the frontend profile section (local), the
groups (shared) and the backend (lists mods/admins the registered user data)
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent cross site vulnerability!
