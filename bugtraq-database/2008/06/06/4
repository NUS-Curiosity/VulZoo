Subject: Vulnerability in Network General/Net Scout product

Network General Enterprise Administrator (Network
General has been aquired by Net Scout):
Non-privileged users can perform privileged functions by manipulating the URL.  Can log on as user and using the following URL conduct administrative functions:
https://X.X.X.X/ResourceManager/en_US/domains/add_domain.jsp

Other functions may be possible.  It appears that the application only hides administrative functions from view instead of validating authorization of user rights for action.  Vulnerability may exist in the Network General Visualizer V2100 and Network General Infinistream i1730 Sniffer.  I do not have resources to investigate further.
