Synopsis
========

A vulnerability was found in libxslt, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project. XSLT
itself is an XML language to define transformations for XML.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libxslt      < 1.1.24                          >= 1.1.24

Description
===========

Anthony de Almeida Lopes reported a vulnerability in libxslt when
handling XSL style-sheet files, which could be exploited to trigger the
use of uninitialized memory, e.g. in a call to "free()".

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to process an
XML file using a specially crafted XSL transformation file, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libxslt users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxslt-1.1.24"
