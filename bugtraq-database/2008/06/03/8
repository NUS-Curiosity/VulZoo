Synopsis
========

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in mtr, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs
in a single network diagnostic tool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/mtr      < 0.73-r1                        >= 0.73-r1

Description
===========

Adam Zabrocki reported a boundary error within the split_redraw()
function in the file split.c, possibly leading to a stack-based buffer
overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could use a specially crafted resolved hostname to
execute arbitrary code with root privileges. However, it is required
that the attacker controls the DNS server used by the victim, and that
the "-p" (or "--split") command line option is used.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All mtr users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/mtr-0.73-r1"
