4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in TorrentTrader,
which can be exploited by malicious people and malicious users to
conduct SQL injection attacks.

1) Input passed to the "email" and "wantusername" parameters in
account-signup.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL
queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows e.g. retrieval of
administrator password hashes, but requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is
disabled and that the site is not configured as invite-only.

2) Input passed to the "receiver" parameter in account-inbox.php (when
"msg" is set) is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL
queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires valid user
credentials and that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
