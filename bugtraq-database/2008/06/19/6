Subject: RE: A more detailed description of the Jura F90 vulnerability.


I have attempted to. They are not the easiest company to contact. I am sending more details to the firm that tests their products. They seem to be a shell with a large number of outsourced arrangements.

Have you shared all of this with the manufacturer first?
