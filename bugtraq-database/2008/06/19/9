Subject: RE: A more detailed description of the Jura F90 vulnerability.

So you've published what some would call 0day information on a "remotely
exploitable" vulnerability that allows one to compromise another's
workstation using the "I tried" justification?  That seems hardly
appropriate for a man of your stature, Craig.  Even if the actual risk
of exploitation is very low due to other mitigating factors, responsible
disclosure policies should be respected.  But you did manage to get some
nice press in CNET, huh?  

By the way, I'm sure you actually executed code as POC rather than just
assuming that you could based on the calls you identified by reverse
engineering the binaries, right?  I guess I'm also curious how you are
classifying this as "remotely exploitable" when what you describe in
your "detailed description" sounds more like you would have to get a
victim to go to your evil web site first or download your coffee
"recipe" somehow and feed them to the coffee maker, right?   Or is the
maker actually listening for connections and the assumption is that
people will connect it directly to the internet and not behind some NAT
device?  Given your apparent full-disclosure policy, you won't mind
sharing POC code with us, right? (even though most people don't have
your kind of money to buy a $2000 coffee machine to test it on ;).  I
think given all the attention you've received about this that the most
complete and accurate information should be made available to the
public.
