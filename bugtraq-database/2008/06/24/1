Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities might allow for a Denial of Service of daemons
using OpenSSL.

Background
==========

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/openssl      < 0.9.8g-r2                    >= 0.9.8g-r2
                                                              < 0.9.8f

Description
===========

Ossi Herrala and Jukka Taimisto of Codenomicon discovered two
vulnerabilities:

* A double free() call in the TLS server name extension
  (CVE-2008-0891).

* The OpenSSL client code does not properly handle servers that omit
  the Server Key Exchange message in the TLS handshake (CVE-2008-1672).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could connect to a vulnerable server, or entice a
daemon to connect to a malicious server, causing a Denial of Service of
the daemon in both cases.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8g-r2"
