Subject: [Suspected Spam][CVE-2008-4042] Postfix Linux-only local denial of service - PoC

Hello,

I have released this PoC for the Linux-only local denial of service
caused by the leak of epoll file descriptors.

This Proof of concept creates a pipe and adds it in postfix's epoll file
descriptor.
When the pipe is added, an endless loop will launch lots of events to
the local and master postfix processes. 
This PoC will slowdown the system a lot.

You can find all the needed files at
http://www.wekk.net/research/CVE-2008-4042/ and
http://www.wekk.net/research/CVE-2008-3889/ and attached with this
email.

Feel free to write me for feedback, corrections, etc.
