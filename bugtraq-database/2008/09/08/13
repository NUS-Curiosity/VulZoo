I could not duplicate this with either Chrome or Safari (which also uses
WebKit). I am using WinXP SP3 and Chrome v0.2.149.27 build 1538. I
wonder if this is instead an issue with your Windows installation
rendering the tool-tip for the title (which is default with browsers
using WebKit).

I tried varying values all the way up to 2147483647. Of course, the
script running these high values would take a long time to complete the
loop -- but that is to be expected.
