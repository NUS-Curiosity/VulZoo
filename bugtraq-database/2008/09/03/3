Subject: [Tool] Distack framework for attack detection and traffic analysis

Hi,

I am pleased to announce the Open Source release of "Distack"

  ***   http://www.tm.uka.de/distack   ***

Distack is a framework for local and distributed attack detection and
traffic analysis. It can run on live interfaces or traces files, as well
as in simulation environments. Therefore it provides easy ways to
develop attack detection mechanisms and evaluate them on a large-scale
in simulated networks.

Distack has been developed at the Institute of Telematics, University of
Karlsruhe in Germany to perform large-scale attack detection (DDoS in
our case) in real environments and simulated environments.

Whether you want to perform traffic analysis, attack detection or just
look into the traffic that runs over your network, Distack gives you a
complete environment to implement and evaluate your mechanisms.

Distack and a complete documentation is available from:
http://www.tm.uka.de/distack

To get a quick overview on what Distack does, have a look at the
publications covering Distack and current presentations:

http://doc.tm.uka.de/2008/MaGaZit_Eurecom2008.pdf
https://projekte.tm.uka.de/trac/Distack/wiki/DistackPublications

We are looking forward to see the community using the Distack Framework
and would be happy to receive feedback from you! Cooperation in 
development is also highly appreciated.

Best regards,
Chris
