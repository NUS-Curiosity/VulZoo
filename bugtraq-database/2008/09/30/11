International Hacking & Security Conference "POC2008"


The 3rd international hacking and security conference "POC2008" 
by hackers will be held in Seoul, Korea on November 13 ~ 14. 
'POC' means �Power of Community�. We believe that the power of 
community can make the world safer. POC doesn�t pursue money. 
So we are free to show real hacking and security. 
POC2008 hates just theoretical discussion. 
POC2008 concentrates on technical and creative discussion and 
will show real hacking. POC2008 believes that showing talks much more 
than just speaking.


In POC2008, some speakers will open 0-days. 
And new attack techniques will be introduced.  
The speakers are from America, China, Germany, Korea, Russia, etc. 

This year, the Reverse Engineering Contest will be held 
from October 1 to October 15. 
The winner can be a speaker of POC2008. 
He can also enjoy the privilege of POC2008 speaker. C
