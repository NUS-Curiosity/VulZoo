Introduction
============
moziloWiki is an easy to handle wiki system.

More Details
============
1. Directory Traversal:
----------------------
Affected files:
print.php -> page parameter

Acquiring access to known files outside of the web root and current directory
is possible through directory traversal techniques.
This is made possible through the use of "../../" in a HTTP request.

2. Cross Site Scripting:
----------------------
Affected files:
index.php -> action parameter
index.php -> page parameter

Affected parameters are not being properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

3. session fixation:
---------------------
The "PHPSESSID" parameter can be set to a malicious and arbitrary value.

3.1 Description:
In a session fixation attack, the attacker fixes the user's session ID before the user even logs into the target server.
After a user's session ID has been fixed, the attacker will wait for them to login.
Once the user does so, the attacker uses the predefined session ID value to assume their online identity.

3.2 PoC:
============
http://localhost/mozilowiki/?PHPSESSID=15031988

4. Workaround:
================
Update to mozilowiki 1.0.2
