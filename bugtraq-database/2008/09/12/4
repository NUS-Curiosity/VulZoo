4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Trend Micro
OfficeScan, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
a vulnerable system.

A boundary error in cgiRecvFile.exe can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow via an HTTP request with a specially
crafted, overly long "ComputerName" parameter. The "TempFileName",
"NewFileSize", and "Verify" parameters must also be manipulated to
exploit the vulnerability.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
