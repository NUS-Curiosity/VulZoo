Subject: Miranda IM Client Password Disclosure Vulnerability.

Miranda IM Client Password Disclosure Vulnerability.

* Version Affected:*
0.7.10 Unicode / Previous version can be affected.

* Release Date:*
11 September 2008

* About:*
Miranda IM is a multi-protocol instant messaging client for Windows.

framework and boasting

* Description:*
The Miranda client inherits client side password disclosure 
vulnerability. The credentials used to
connect to the required service i.e. username and password is not 
encrypted properly. The credentials
can be extracted in clear text by dumping process memory of the live 
pidgin process when a connection
is set. The vulnerability allows anyone with access to the client system 
to obtain the username and
password. Additionally, this vulnerability could also be exploited by 
fooling the user to execute malicious
code which would dump the memory of the process "miranda32.exe"..
