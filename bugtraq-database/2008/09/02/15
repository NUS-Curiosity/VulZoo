Hi Everyone,

Quite many people have emailed us lately asking if there will be T2'08
Challenge - the answer is yes :)

The purpose of the Challenge is to have an opportunity to win a free
tickets to T2'08 infosec conference:
http://www.t2.fi/

The rules are simple: T2 publishes the Challenge and the first one to
solve it will win a free ticket to the T2 conference. In addition to
this, the Advisory Board and the Challenge author will select another
winner among the next ten correct answers. The criteria for the other
selection is the elegance of the answer. In short, you can win with both
speed and style :)

Year 2005 was the first time the Challenge was presented and it received
a huge response - T205-CHALLENGE.EXE was downloaded more than 10 000
times during the first 24 hours! The task in the T2'05 Challenge was to
find the hidden message and an email address inside an executable.

T2'08 Challenge will be published 2008-09-06 10:00 EEST at:
http://www.t2.fi/

Cheers,
