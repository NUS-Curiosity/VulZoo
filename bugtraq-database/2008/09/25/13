Synopsis
========

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered in Git.

Background
==========

Git is a distributed version control system.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  dev-util/git      < 1.5.6.4                            >= 1.5.6.4

Description
===========

Multiple boundary errors in the functions diff_addremove() and
diff_change() when processing overly long repository path names were
reported.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run commands like "git-diff"
or "git-grep" on a specially crafted repository, possibly resulting in
the remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Git users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/git-1.5.6.4"

References
==========
