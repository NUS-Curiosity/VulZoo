Subject: Re: php create_function commond injection vulnerability

Are you kidding ?

As the PHP manual said "if you use double quotes there will be a need to escape the variable names".

In your example you use a function with double quotes, without escaping the variable $sort_by, so
this is not a PHP vulnerability, but a development one.

For this time, don't blame PHP, blame developers.
It's like if I was using mysql_query() without escaping user's inputs...an sql injection, not a PHP vuln ;)
