Yes, yes, yes...

_BUT_, in a browser announced with such a massive hoopla about how it's 
been double-especially-extra-security-hardened from the outset, _that 
something more obviously sensible_ was not the _shipping default 
configuration_ is gob-stoppingly stupid; a fundamentally noob-ish design 
error.

In short, something that does not bode well for the product living up to 
the marketing hype.

Oh, and slapping the standard "we're Google so couldn't be arsed 
finishing it so will call it beta" label on it makes no difference. 
Fundamentally stupid is fundamentally stupid at whatever point in the 
development process that "feature" made its way into the product.
