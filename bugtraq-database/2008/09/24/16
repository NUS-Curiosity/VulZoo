Subject: Re: Advisory : Google Chrome Carriage Return Null Object Memory Exhaustion Remote Dos.

I'm also using Google Chrome.

Another concern for me - its setup downloads:
http://cache.pack.google.com/chrome/install/149.30/chrome_installer.exe
which is not signed by authenticode.

Can anyone post hashes of this file downloaded over a trusted network?
Or, is this info available at some trusted sources?

Thanks in advance,
