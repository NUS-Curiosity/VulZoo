Unless you misstated the exploit vector in your original message then
locking untrusted people into a zone will work.  I can't help it if

Not really - what I am not doing is trying to beat up a firmware
problem that whilst being quite bad can be mitigated by using native
features of Solaris.  Too bad if OpenBSD cannot do the same - I am not
really sure about the benefits of OpenBSD on that scale of hardware
anyway considering the lack of kernel threading and the parlous state
of userland threading.
