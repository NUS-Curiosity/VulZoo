To be fair, this kind of api is obviously a disaster waiting to happen.

Use an array to express an array of arguments? No, we'll just use 
concatenated strings again, that never caused any problems with sql... I 
wonder why all other languages have that strange 'prepared statements' 
format, and they never get the sql injection bugs. It's unfair!

Anyone up for a bet when PHP will add some more 'magic_quotes' to fix 
this mistake?
