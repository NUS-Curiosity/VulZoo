OpenBSD of course cannot run in a Solaris zone.

OpenBSD can run in a hardware zone, and when something it does (which
we don't know yet) locks up that hardware zone, the only way to get
the hardware zone back is to POWER THE MACHINE OFF.  That is a lack
of hardware zoning, or isolation.  That is not what people paid a lot
of money for.

Those customers really expected that the machine would not need a
powerdown to get around a bug in hardware zones.

Sun and Fujitsu will be releasing a fix eventually.

Noone is talking about Solaris zones except you.  This problem takes
a hardware zone down, and the only way to get the zone back is to power
the machine off.

Why don't we wait for Sun to release the fix, and then you can eat
your words.
