Apparently you just plain can't understand simple english.

If you put someone running OpenBSD into a zone, and that zone locks up
completely and cannot be reset because of a flaw Sun has now admitted,
then if you NEED that zone back, you have to power the machine down.

If you don't understand that, you must be really really stupid.

Trust?

You want to talk about trust?  The entire idea is that you could
TRUST the zones to do their job.
