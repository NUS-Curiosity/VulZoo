Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] Wordpress is vulnerable to an
 unauthorized upgrade and XSS

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2008-001
- Original release date: January 3rd, 2008
- Last revised:  December 22nd, 2008
- Discovered by: Jesus Olmos Gonzalez
- Severity: 2/5
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Wordpress is vulnerable to an unauthorized upgrade and XSS

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
WordPress started in 2003 with a single bit of code to enhance the
typography of everyday writing and with fewer users than you can count
on your fingers and toes. Since then it has grown to be the largest
self-hosted blogging tool in the world, used on hundreds of thousands
of sites and seen by tens of millions of people every day. With a very
active development and evolution.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
If the WordPress is not the last version, anybody can upgrades the
aplication using wp-admin/upgrade.php

The snippet of vulnerable code:

if (isset($_GET['step']))
        $step = (int) $_GET['step'];
...
switch($step) :
    case 0:
        $goback = clean_url(stripslashes(wp_get_referer()));
...
    case 1:
        wp_upgrade();
        if ( empty( $_GET['backto'] ) )
           $backto = __get_option('home') . '/';
...

If step is set to one, the link "Have fun" is set to the backto
parameter value, then is possible to make a Cross Site Attack to steal
user sessions.

affected. If the cross site attack succeeds, the confidentiality and
