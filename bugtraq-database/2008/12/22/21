Subject: Re: [IVIZ-08-016] F-Secure f-prot Antivirus for Linux corrupted
 ELF header Security Bypass

This posting contains incorrect information. 

F-Secure Corporation has verified that the claimed vulnerability doesnï¿½t affect any F-Secure products. Our assumption is that iViZ have mixed up products from F-Secure Corporation and Frisk Software International. iViZ have already corrected their own advisory at the time of writing this and removed all references to F-Secure.
