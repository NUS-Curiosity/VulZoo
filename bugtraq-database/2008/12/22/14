Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpCollab allowing for
remote injection of shell commands, PHP code and SQL statements.

Background
==========

phpCollab is a web-enabled groupware and project management software
written in PHP. It uses SQL-based database backends.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  www-apps/phpcollab     <= 2.5_rc3                     Vulnerable!
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
             to another package if one is available or wait for the
             existing packages to be marked stable by their
             architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in phpCollab:

* rgod reported that data sent to general/sendpassword.php via the
    loginForm parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an
    SQL statement (CVE-2006-1495).

* Christian Hoffmann of Gentoo Security discovered multiple
    vulnerabilites where input is insufficiently sanitized before being
    used in an SQL statement, for instance in general/login.php via the
    loginForm parameter. (CVE-2008-4303).

* Christian Hoffmann also found out that the variable
    $SSL_CLIENT_CERT in general/login.php is not properly sanitized
    before being used in a shell command. (CVE-2008-4304).

* User-supplied data to installation/setup.php is not checked before
    being written to include/settings.php which is executed later. This
    issue was reported by Christian Hoffmann as well (CVE-2008-4305).

Impact
======

These vulnerabilities enable remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
statements and PHP code. NOTE: Some of the SQL injection
vulnerabilities require the php.ini option "magic_quotes_gpc" to be
disabled. Furthermore, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary
shell commands if "register_globals" is enabled, "magic_quotes_gpc" is
disabled, the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or loaded and the
file "installation/setup.php" has not been deleted after installation.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

phpCollab has been removed from the Portage tree. We recommend that
users unmerge phpCollab:

      # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/phpcollab"
