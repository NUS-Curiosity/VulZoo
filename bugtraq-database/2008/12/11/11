Subject: Re[2]: Multiple XSRF in DD-WRT (Remote Root Command Execution)

Dear s.gottschall@...wrt.com,

 According   to   current  practices,  it's  considered  as  a  security
 vulnerability. The fact you must be logged in to device in browser is a
 mitigation factor.

 To  protect routers against attacks like this either generate some kind
 of  non-predictable  session  id as a hidden field in any HTML form and
 check this id or check Referer:.

sgdwc> this is no security flaw since you must be already logged in
within the webinterface of dd-wrt. otherwise this here will not work. we
already fixed this issue in our sourcetree
