ZDI-08-077: Trillian AIM IMG Tag Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-08-077
December 4, 2008

-- Affected Vendors:
Cerulean Studios

-- Affected Products:
Cerulean Studios Trillian

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cerulean Studios Trillian. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the tooltip processing code for
Trillian. When creating a tooltip for an image, the application
generates an XML tag including a property containing the filename. This
data is then copied directly into a stack-based buffer without any
length verifications which can eventually lead to code execution with
the privileges of the client.

-- Vendor Response:
Cerulean Studios has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
