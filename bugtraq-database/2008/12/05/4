-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun Microsystems Java. User interaction is
required in that a user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious
web page.

The specific flaw occurs within the Java AWT library. If a custom image
model is used for the source 'Raster' during a conversion through a
'ConvolveOp' operation, the imaging library will calculate the size of
the destination raster for the conversion incorrectly leading to a
heap-based overflow. This can result in arbitrary code execution under
the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
