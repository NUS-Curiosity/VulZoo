Synopsis
========

Two buffer overflows in enscript might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

enscript is a powerful ASCII to PostScript file converter.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/enscript     < 1.6.4-r4                      >= 1.6.4-r4

Description
===========

Two stack-based buffer overflows in the read_special_escape() function
in src/psgen.c have been reported. Ulf Harnhammar of Secunia Research
discovered a vulnerability related to the "setfilename" command
(CVE-2008-3863), and Kees Cook of Ubuntu discovered a vulnerability
related to the "font" escape sequence (CVE-2008-4306).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user or automated system to process
specially crafted input with the special escapes processing enabled
using the "-e" option, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All enscript users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/enscript-1.6.4-r4"
