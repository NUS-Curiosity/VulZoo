Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in libxml2 might lead to execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

Background
==========

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libxml2     < 2.7.2-r1                       >= 2.7.2-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were reported in libxml2:

* Andreas Solberg reported that libxml2 does not properly detect
  recursion during entity expansion in an attribute value
  (CVE-2008-3281).

* A heap-based buffer overflow has been reported in the
  xmlParseAttValueComplex() function in parser.c (CVE-2008-3529).

* Christian Weiske reported that predefined entity definitions in
  entities are not properly handled (CVE-2008-4409).

* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in
  the xmlBufferResize() function that can lead to an infinite loop
  (CVE-2008-4225).

* Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported an integer overflow in
  the xmlSAX2Characters() function leading to a memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-4226).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted XML document with an application using libxml2,
possibly resulting in the exeution of arbitrary code or a high CPU and
memory consumption.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.7.2-r1"
