Similary, a few years ago (Nov/Dec 2005, I believe) I notified Microsoft 
about some CSRF flaws in OWA 2003. Sending a message, deleting a message, 
and logging out were all vulnerable. An attacker could trick a victim 
into sending an insult to her bosses (that would show up as an "internal"
message) and removing the message from her Sent Items folder. Clearing the 
deleted items folder, or removing a single message from the deleted items 
folder, did not appear to be vulnerable(!). Microsoft said the flaws were 
fixed in Exchange 2007 but I have no way of verifying that.
