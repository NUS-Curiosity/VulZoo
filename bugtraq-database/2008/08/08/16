Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV may result in a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.93.3                      >= 0.93.3

Description
===========

Damian Put has discovered an out-of-bounds memory access while
processing Petite files (CVE-2008-2713, CVE-2008-3215). Also, please
note that the 0.93 ClamAV branch fixes the first of the two attack
vectors of CVE-2007-6595 concerning an insecure creation of temporary
files vulnerability. The sigtool attack vector seems still unfixed.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a
specially crafted Petite file, possibly resulting in a Denial of
Service (daemon crash). Also, the insecure creation of temporary files
vulnerability can be triggered by a local user to perform a symlink
attack.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.93.3"
