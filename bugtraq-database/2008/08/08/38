Regarding blacklist file size, we (Openwall and ALT Linux, with support
from CivicActions) have done some work on SSH key blacklisting, and our
encoding scheme should be reusable for SSL as well.  Our default
blacklist file contains 48-bit partial fingerprints for 1024-bit and
2048-bit RSA and 1024-bit DSA keys for PID range 1 to 32767 (a total of
almost 300k keys).  The installed file size is just 1.3 MB, which
corresponds to less than 4.5 bytes per fingerprint, and the .bz2 (and
.rpm) is just 1.2 MB.  (Naturally, with non-compressing binary encoding
the 48-bit fingerprints would be 6 bytes each.)

Lookups are very quick, and only three small portions of the file are
read per lookup, for a total of under 100 bytes of data to read (as far
as sshd is concerned).

Neither the code nor the file format is specific to 48-bit partial
fingerprints; it is possible to use larger ones by supplying something
other than "6" (the size in bytes) on blacklist-encode's command-line.

This code is currently in use in Openwall GNU/*/Linux (Owl) and ALT Linux
distributions, and it has successfully caught some weak SSH keys in the
wild.  Other systems/projects/whatever are more than welcome to reuse
the code or the encoding scheme.
