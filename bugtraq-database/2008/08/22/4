   The city is the largest in Brazil and first in South America by population. Quite often Sao Paulo

a convenion, stay for at least one more day. Let yourself be seduced by the cultural diversity of this
many-faceted city which vibrates, dictates fashion, is always anticipating trends, and welcomes Brazilians
