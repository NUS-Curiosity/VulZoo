Subject: Pligg Auto-Voter Using XSS to Bypass CSRF Protection

Explanation:
Pligg Suffers from a Reflective Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in index.php. For the $_GET['category'] variable.   Exploit code was written that uses this flaw to bypass the CSRF protection to then vote on any pligg article of the attackers choosing. I took inspiration from the Myspace Sammy worm utilizing XMLHttpRequest()  to read the randomly generated token protection requests from forgery.   This is a more serious attack when combined with my Captcha Implementation Bypass (http://www.rooksecurity.com/blog/?p=17)  which allows an attacker to create new user accounts.
