Setting the HTTP response header:
 Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

or adding the tag:
 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">

or even both - still does not deter IE from scanning the contents and interpreting them as UTF-7 when Encoding=Auto-Select.
(observed on w2k with IE 6.0.2800.1106 SP1 + Q867801 + Q823353 + Q833989 + Q903235)

It appears there is little that web servers can do to thwart this, short of changing all '+' characters to %2B.  That seems excessive.
