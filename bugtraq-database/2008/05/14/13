Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Content Switching Module Memory Leak
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20080514-csm

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080514-csm.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2008 May 14 1600 UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

The Cisco Content Switching Module (CSM) and Cisco Content Switching
Module with SSL (CSM-S) contain a memory leak vulnerability that can
result in a denial of service condition. The vulnerability exists when
the CSM or CSM-S is configured for layer 7 load balancing. An attacker
can trigger this vulnerability when the CSM or CSM-S processes TCP
segments with a specific combination of TCP flags while servers behind
the CSM/CSM-S are overloaded and/or fail to accept a TCP connection.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080514-csm.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The Cisco CSM and Cisco CSM-S are affected by the vulnerability
described in this document if they are running an affected software
version and are configured for layer 7 load balancing.

The following versions of the Cisco CSM software are affected by this
vulnerability: 4.2(3), 4.2(3a), 4.2(4), 4.2(5), 4.2(6), 4.2(7), and
4.2(8).

The following versions of the Cisco CSM-S software are also affected by
this vulnerability: 2.1(2), 2.1(3), 2.1(4), 2.1(5), 2.1(6), and 2.1(7).

To determine the software version in use by the CSM or CSM-S, log into
the supervisor of the chassis that hosts the CSM or CSM-S modules and
issue the command "show module version" (Cisco IOS) or "show version"
(Cisco CatOS). CSM modules will display as model "WS-X6066-SLB-APC",
CSM-S modules will display as model "WS-X6066-SLB-S-K9", and the
software version will be indicated next to the "Sw:" label.

Note that the output from "show module version" (for Cisco IOS) is
slightly different from the output from "show version" (for Cisco
CatOS). However, in both cases the model names will read as previously
described, and the software version will be easily identified by looking
for the "Sw:" label.

The following example shows a CSM in slot number 4 running software
version 4.2(3):

switch>show module version

A Cisco CSM or CSM-S is configured for layer 7 load balancing if one or
more layer 7 Server Load Balancing (SLB) policies are referenced in the
configuration of a virtual server. There are six possible types of SLB
policies: "client-group", "cookie-map", "header-map", "reverse-sticky",
"sticky-group", and "url-map". Of these, the "client-group" policy
type is always a layer 4 policy. The remaining policy types are
layer 7 policies and, if used, would render a device affected by the
vulnerability described in this document. The following example shows a
CSM module that is configured for layer 7 load balancing. Note the SLB
policy "TEST-SPORTS-50", which uses "url-map" and "header-map" layer 7
policies, and that is applied to the virtual server named "WEB":

    module ContentSwitchingModule 5
     [...]
    !
     policy TEST-SPORTS-50
      url-map SPORTS
      header-map TEST
      client-group 50

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Only Cisco CSM modules running indicated 4.2 versions are affected by
this vulnerability. CSM software versions 4.1, 3.2 and 3.1 are not
affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco CSM-S modules running indicated 2.1 versions are the only
vulnerable versions of software for that product.

Cisco CSM and CSM-S modules that are not configured for layer 7 load
balancing are not affected by this vulnerability.

The Cisco IOS SLB feature is not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability. The Cisco Secure Content Accelerator is not affected by
this vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco CSM is an integrated SLB line card for the Catalyst 6500 and
7600 Series that is designed to enhance the response time for client
traffic to end points including servers, caches, firewalls, Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) devices, and VPN termination devices.

The Cisco CSM-S combines high-performance SLB with SSL offload. The
CSM-S is similar to the CSM; however, unlike the CSM, the CSM-S can
terminate and initiate SSL-encrypted traffic. This ability allows the
CSM-S to perform intelligent load balancing while ensuring secure
end-to-end encryption.

A memory leak vulnerability exists in some versions of the software
for the Cisco CSM and Cisco CSM-S when the CSM or CSM-S is configured
for layer 7 load balancing (see the "Vulnerable Products" section for
configuration details). The memory leak is triggered when the CSM or
CSM-S processes TCP segments with a specific combination of TCP flags
and fails to make a load balancing decision because servers behind the
CSM/CSM-S are overloaded and/or fail to accept a TCP connection.

The memory leak can be detected by issuing the command "show module
ContentSwitchingModule <slot #> tech-support all | include Outstanding"
on the supervisor and checking the command output for a high number of
outstanding buffers as seen in the following example:

switch#show module ContentSwitchingModule 10 tech-support all | include Outstanding
Outstanding slowpath(low  pri) buffers     0           0
Outstanding slowpath(high pri) buffers     0           0
Outstanding blocks                         0           0
Outstanding small buffers                  0           0
Outstanding medium buffers                 823         0
Outstanding large buffers                  0           0
Outstanding sessions                       0           0
Outstanding Closes                         0           0
Close Relinquish Outstanding               0

Because small, medium, and large buffers can be affected by the memory
leak, administrators are advised to check the number of these buffers in
the output from the preceding command to accurately detect a memory leak
condition.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsl40722 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2008-1749.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability against a system running
a vulnerable version of the Cisco CSM or the Cisco CSM-S software may
cause the CSM or CSM-S to stop passing traffic. Repeated attacks may
result in a prolonged DoS condition, which could affect the services
that are offered by the end point devices behind the CSM or CSM-S.

Note that the supervisor or any other non-CSM or non-CSM-S service
module in the same chassis of the Catalyst 6500 switch or 7600 Series
router that hosts the CSM or CSM-S will not be affected by this
vulnerability.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

This vulnerability is fixed in version 4.2.9 of the Cisco CSM software,
and in version 2.1.8 of the Cisco CSM-S software.
