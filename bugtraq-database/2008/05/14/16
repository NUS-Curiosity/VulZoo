Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Unified Presence Denial of Service
                         Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20080514-cup

Revision 1.0

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Presence contains three denial of service (DoS)
vulnerabilities that may cause an interruption in presence services.
These vulnerabilities were discovered internally by Cisco, and there
are no workarounds.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080514-cup.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco Unified Presence versions prior to 6.0(3) are affected by the
vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

Administrators of systems running all Cisco Unified Presence versions
can determine the software version by viewing the main page of the
Cisco Unified Presence Administration interface. The software version
can be determined by running the command show version active via the
Command Line Interface (CLI).

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Presence collects information about a user's
availability status and communications capabilities. Using
information captured by Cisco Unified Presence, applications such as
Cisco Unified Personal Communicator and Cisco Unified Communications
Manager can improve productivity by helping users connect with
colleagues more efficiently by determining the most effective means
for collaborative communication.

The Presence Engine service of Cisco Unified Presence version 1.0
contains two vulnerabilities that occur when a series of malformed IP
packets are received by a vulnerable Cisco Unified Presence system
and may result in a DoS condition. There are no workarounds for these
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are fixed in Cisco Unified
Presence version 6.0(1). Cisco Unified Presence version 6.0(1) is the
upgrade path for Cisco Unified Presence version 1.0. The first
vulnerability is documented in CVE-2008-1158 and Cisco Bug ID
CSCsh50164. The second vulnerability is documented in CVE-2008-1740
and Cisco Bug ID CSCsh20972.

The SIP Proxy service of Cisco Unified Presence versions 6.0(1) and
6.0(2) contain a vulnerability that occurs when a TCP port scan is
received by a vulnerable Cisco Unified Presence system and may result
in a DoS condition. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.
This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Presence version 6.0(3).
This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2008-1741 and Cisco Bug ID 
CSCsj64533.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of any of the vulnerabilities may result in
the interruption of presence services.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Fixes for all the vulnerabilities listed in this advisory are
included in Cisco Unified Presence version 6.0(3) that is available
at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/cup-60?psrtdcat20e2

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http:/ www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a008088e31f.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml
for additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone
numbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
