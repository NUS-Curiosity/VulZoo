Subject: Re: Re: Exploiting Google MX servers as Open SMTP Relays

Hi,

We are not talking about backscattering. Our attack uses Google's MX servers like open SMTP relays. Messages are delivered as sent, and not as a delivery failure notification.

We are still expecting to hear from Google, but we will be releasing more details about the issue together with the PoC exploit shortly.

Regards,
