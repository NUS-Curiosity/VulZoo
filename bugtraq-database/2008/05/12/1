Subject: Re: Re: Apache Server HTML Injection and UTF-7 XSS Vulnerability

Content type is set in Response header
but not in the HTML meta tag - for example
there is no definition like <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">!!!

That is the reason why it is still a vulnerability and was tested hundred times and still works. 
The solution is to set encoding for the response in when rendering the page, for example in asp you  write Response.charset = "iso-8859-1"
