Yes this is very frustrating.

The details are not so hard to guess.  Unless this post is different,
anyone can send an email to a nonexistent user at a google service and
they accept it and bounce back to the envelope recipient. *sigh*.

We are going back to the stone age by copying qmails default stupidity.

This is doing very much harm.

I would even go as far as to say that Google is making a business case for
its latest purchase, postini, in a very evil way, every second this proble
goes unsolved.

*sigh*
