Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities might allow for the execution of arbitrary
code in daemons using GnuTLS.

Background
==========

GnuTLS is an implementation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0 and
Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/gnutls       < 2.2.5                            >= 2.2.5

Description
===========

Ossi Herrala and Jukka Taimisto of Codenomicon reported three
vulnerabilities in libgnutls of GnuTLS:

* "Client Hello" messages containing an invalid server name can lead
  to a buffer overflow when evaluating "Security Parameters"
  (CVE-2008-1948).

* Multiple "Client Hello" messages can lead to a NULL pointer
  dereference (CVE-2008-1949).

* A TLS handshake including an encrypted "Client Hello" message and
  an invalid record length could lead to a buffer overread
  (CVE-2008-1950).

Impact
======

Unauthenticated remote attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to
cause Denial of Service conditions in daemons using GnuTLS. The first
vulnerability (CVE-2008-1948) might allow for the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the daemon handling incoming TLS
connections.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuTLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-2.2.5"
