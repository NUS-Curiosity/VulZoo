Introduction
============
ActualAnalyzer is a powerful statistics-gathering and analysis tool for monitoring web site traffic.
It is equally effective for sites with low and high volumes of traffic
and provides a wealth of comparative and analytical information. 

More Details
============
Cross Site Scripting:
Input passed directly to the "language" parameter in "view.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

PoC:
=============
/view.php?&language=>"><script>alert(15031988)</script>

Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure that html tags
and javascript code are not going to be executed. 

Example:
<?php
$pass = htmlentities($_POST['pass']);
$test = htmlspecialchars($_GET('test'));
?>
