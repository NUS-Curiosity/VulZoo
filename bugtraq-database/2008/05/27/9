Subject: Re: function sleep() in all versions of PHP

Yeap.

�Using PHP as an in-process script interpreter grants script authors control over the httpd children.�

It is possible to make DoS (block all sockets/memory exe.). (more in Xploit magazin)
Reason: Use PHP via a CGI interpreter with RLimit* directives.
Anyone how use PHP as an in-process script interpreter, can be dangerous.
