OWASP Dinner (May 21)
At every conference we have an evening social event the first night. They
are always fun and allow participants to have some unstructured time to
mingle with the other attendees. This year's event will be a Flemish buffet
with special Belgian beers at the Monasterium (near the conference
location).

Cocktail Party (May 20)
In what is also becoming a tradition, there will be a cocktail party the
night before the conference begins, sponsored by Breach Security. The free
and open for all conference attendees event will be held at the Vintage Wine
Bar at 6:30pm (near the conference location). We would appreciate it if you
let us know if you are coming so we can be ready, please mail
ofers@...ach.com to confirm.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and
open community focused on improving the security of application software.
Our mission is to make application security "visible," so that people and
organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks.
