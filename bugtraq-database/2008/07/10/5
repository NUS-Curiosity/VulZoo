Subject: Nessus plugins for recent MS Bulletins

We have released Nessus plugins for the recently published Microsoft
bulletins. The same can be downloaded at,
http://www.secpod.org/nessus-plugins/. These have
been tested with Nessus 2.2.4 and released under GPL. We'll continue to
release these plugins under GPL for the upcoming threats.

Thanks,
Chandra.
