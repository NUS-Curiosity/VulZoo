-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun Java Web Start. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the writeManifest() method of the CacheEntry
class. A directory traversal flaw in this method allows the creation of
arbitrary files on the target system. After the file has been created, a
call to Runtime.getRuntime.exec() can be used to execute the file.
