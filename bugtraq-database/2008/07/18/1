Subject: Security Vacation Guide

Hi,

We're feeling summer pretty hard here at ISECOM and thought
summer/hacking/vacation - so we put it all together.  So we made a security
vacation guide!  Based on all that stuff we hackers loop about when we
worry about our stuff! So ISECOM presents: the Home Security Methodology
Vacation Guide!

We've been applying the research from the OSSTMM 3.0 methodology into other
things like Home Security.  So this was just a fun exercise.  Basically,
it's a mostly thorough checklist of what you can do to make sure the stuff
you leave behind is the stuff you come back to after a vacation.  And since
it's based on the latest security research we've got, you'll find we don't
exactly offer the same advice you may get from many security companies or
even local law enforcement.

Enjoy and happy vacationing!

Sincerely,
-pete.
