My completely non-scientific, unsupported-by-empirical-evidence answer is 
no.  It's because people who use Firefox tend to be more aware of security 
threats and the need to keep software up to date.  It could also be (at 
least in part) because Firefox has a built-in, enabled-by-default, update 
available warning system.
