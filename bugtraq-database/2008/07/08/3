Subject: Re: Local vulnerability in WeFi Client  v3.2.1.4.1(Update)

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The security issue only occurs when the WeFi diagnostic mode is manually selected by the user. This is not the normal operation mode and is only used for debugging purposes. In any case, the mentioned info was mistakenly added to the collected logs. Please be assured that the software has been modified not to further collect such debugging data. A fixed version is already available on our site.
