Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 07.30.08: SAP MaxDB dbmsrv Untrusted Execution
 Path Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.30.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 30, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

SAP's MaxDB is a database software product. MaxDB was released as open
source from version 7.5 up to version 7.6.00. Later versions are no
longer open source but are available for download from the SAP SDN
website (sdn.sap.com) as a community edition with free community
support for public use beyond the scope of SAP applications. The
"dbmsrv" program is set-uid "sdb", set-gid "sdba", and installed by
default. For more information, visit the product's website at the
following URL.

https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/maxdb

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an untrusted path vulnerability in the "dbmsrv"
program, as distributed with SAP AG's MaxDB, allow attackers to elevate
privileges to that of the "sdb" user.

When a local user runs the "dbmcli" program, the MaxDB executes a
"dbmsrv" process on the user's behalf. The "dbmsrv" process, which is
responsible for executing user commands, runs as the user "sdb" with
group "sdba".

This vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization of the "PATH"
environment variable. By prefixing the "PATH" environment variable with
a path under the attacker control, one is able to execute arbitrary code
with "sdb:sdba" privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
privileges of the database owner, usually "sdb". To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to create executables
on the system.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in SAP MaxDB
version 7.6.03.15 on Linux. Other versions may also be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
