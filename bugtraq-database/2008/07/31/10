Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability in Pan may allow remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Pan is a newsreader for the GNOME desktop.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  net-nntp/pan     < 0.132-r3                           >= 0.132-r3
                                                        *>= 0.14.2.91-r2
                                                               == 0.14.2

Description
===========

Pavel Polischouk reported a boundary error in the PartsBatch class when
processing .nzb files.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted .nzb
file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pan users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nntp/pan-0.132-r3"
