Subject: IETF Internet-Draft on TCP Port randomization

Folks,

We are currently working on a revision of our port randomization IETF 
Internet-Draft.

The current version is available at: 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization-01.txt 
. Additionally, it is available in other fancy formats (PDF and HTML) 
at: http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/port-randomization/index.html

Any feedback on the proposed/described algorithms will be more than welcome.

P.S.: We still have some pending comments to address, that we had 
received on bugtraq or full-disclosure. We'll address those pending 
comments, together with whatever comments we receive in the next few weeks.

Thanks,

--
