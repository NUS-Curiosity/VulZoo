Subject: [Full-disclosure] [tool] SDT Cleaner 1.0


Hello!

You can find it here:
http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/sdtcleaner.html

Package:
http://oss.coresecurity.com/repo/SDTCleaner-v1.0.zip

 What is the SDT Cleaner?

SDT Cleaner is a tool that intends to clean the SSDT (system service
descriptor table) from hooks.

    * The SDT Cleaner allows you to clean hooks installed by Anti-Virus
and Firewalls.
    * This little tool (in this first release) tries to collect info
from your current kernel and then switches to kernel land and if there
are any hooks in SSDT, this tool will replace them with the original
entries.

Requirements

    * In this first release, you'll just need Windows XP.
    * I'm planning to add support for Windows 2000 / 2003.

Thanks!
Nahuel.
