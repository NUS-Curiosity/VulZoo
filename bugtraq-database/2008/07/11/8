My theory - there are gazillion corporate and business apps that don't run on IE7 thus users do not update even their personal PCs (for VPN access to those apps.). I work for a hospital and we have apps that only recently with IE6. When we ask about plans for IE8 support, we get the blank stare. Who doesn't love ActiveX?
