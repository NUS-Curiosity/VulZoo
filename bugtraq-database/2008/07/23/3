Subject: RE: Windows Vista Power Management & Local Security Policy

Correct. Power management in Windows Vista is apparently given a pass to
bypass local security policy, which is a bad thing, and sets a bad
precedence. I will leave it to others to exploit this security issue, given
that I know little about the programmatic aspect of power management in
Windows. There are people out there much more capable than me who, if they
feel it warranted, can research the issue further. I don't consider it, as
Jim Harrison would say, "wasting your time chasing things that 'might lead
to cats & dogs living together in sin'", but rather "security research" and
"sharing information". I don't consider Jim's reaction surprising at all,
though, as he works for Microsoft.
