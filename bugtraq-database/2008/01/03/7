This exploit is a non-issue. It assumes that you have access to the admin panel. At some point we have to trust that you are a real admin and not a malicious user.

HTML is allowed in some parts of the ACP due to the fact that BBCode is not parsed in these areas.

I would encourage anyone finding a possible vulnerability in phpBB to report it properly at our security tracker ( http://www.phpbb.com/security/ ), or e-mail it to security at phpbb.com
