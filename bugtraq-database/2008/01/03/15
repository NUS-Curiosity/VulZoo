I think this is the original report
http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2007/11/16/google-as-a-password-cracker/
which Bruce Schneier highlighted
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/using_google_to.html

The basic idea: somebody had a hash, 20f1aeb7819d7858684c898d1e98c1bb, and
searched for that hash on Google, and discovered it was a hash for the 
string "Anthony".

It's a cute trick, but not very meaningful for databases of salted hashes,
and probably not very important for passwords that cracklib, the standard
Windows "strong password" rules, etc. would accept.
