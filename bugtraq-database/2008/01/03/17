First of all, I have NOT verified this. But...

An attacker hasn't got access to the ACP, but that's perhaps not required at all. Imagine if an attacker persuades the admin to visit a page while he is logged in the ACP.  The real admin would maybe follow that link and in the background the XSS page will be contacted. (ajax?) 
This could be enough.

But again, I have NOT verified this issue.
