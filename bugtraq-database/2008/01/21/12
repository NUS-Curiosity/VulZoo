Subject: Pass-The-Hash Toolkit v1.2 released.

Pass-The-Hash Toolkit v1.2 is available.

What is Pass-The-Hash Toolkit?

The Pass-The-Hash Toolkit contains utilities to manipulate the Windows
Logon Sessions mantained by the LSA (Local Security Authority)
component. These tools allow you to list the current logon sessions
with its corresponding NTLM credentials (e.g.: users remotely logged
in thru Remote Desktop/Terminal Services), and also change in runtime
the current username, domain name, and NTLM hashes (YES, PASS-THE-HASH
on Windows!).
