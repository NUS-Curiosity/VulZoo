Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified, the worst of which allow
arbitrary code execution on a user's system via a malicious Flash file.

Background
==========

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF file format,
which is commonly used to provide interactive websites, digital
experiences and mobile content.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /   Vulnerable   /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/netscape-flash      < 9.0.115.0              >= 9.0.115.0

Description
===========

* Flash contains a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to a heap-based
  buffer overflow (GLSA 200711-30, CVE-2007-4768).

* Aaron Portnoy reported an unspecified vulnerability related to
  input validation (CVE-2007-6242).

* Jesse Michael and Thomas Biege reported that Flash does not
  correctly set memory permissions (CVE-2007-6246).

* Dan Boneh, Adam Barth, Andrew Bortz, Collin Jackson, and Weidong
  Shao reported that Flash does not pin DNS hostnames to a single IP
  addresses, allowing for DNS rebinding attacks (CVE-2007-5275).

* David Neu reported an error withing the implementation of the
  Socket and XMLSocket ActionScript 3 classes (CVE-2007-4324).

* Toshiharu Sugiyama reported that Flash does not sufficiently
  restrict the interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files,
  allowing for easier cross-site scripting attacks (CVE-2007-6243).

* Rich Cannings reported a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the
  way the "asfunction:" protocol was handled (CVE-2007-6244).

* Toshiharu Sugiyama discovered that Flash allows remote attackers to
  modify HTTP headers for client requests and conduct HTTP Request
  Splitting attacks (CVE-2007-6245).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
(usually in a web browser), possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Adobe Flash
Player. The attacker could also cause a user's machine to establish TCP
sessions with arbitrary hosts, bypass the Security Sandbox Model,
obtain sensitive information, port scan arbitrary hosts, or conduct
cross-site-scripting attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/netscape-flash-9.0.115.0"

Please be advised that unaffected packages of the Adobe Flash Player
have known problems when used from within the Konqueror and Opera
browsers.
