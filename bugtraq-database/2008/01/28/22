Nothing new here, move along please...

This is an old, and once commonly-used in the wild, implementation of 
the so-called "MDAC vulnerability" patched in MS06-014.

Some trivial Googling turns up instances of this precise code being 
discussed in online fora in July 2006.

Repeating oneself:

Hasadya:

In what meaningful sense did you "discovr" this?

Why do you think we might care?

And do you have you any idea of whether and/or how it actually works?
