Interesting research, Tavis!

Have you looked at what a proxy-server would do with this type of
request? Most fail with "requested URL could not be retrieved" error but
some report the URL back to the browser. Squid in particular does but it
filters HTML characters.

Also if the proxy server is on a regular server (vs a content engine)
you can reach the local web server of the host. A possible way to reconfigure
home routers with proxy servers or enumerate if a transparent proxy is
in place.
