Why don't you just fix it?
The fact, that this field ist not properly sanitised means that u don't check all fields by default.

so it may not be an exploitable software bug, but it is a development error...

This is why browsers block cross-domain AJAX by default. Added to the fact that any action in the ACP requires the SID means that your attack via AJAX would fail.
