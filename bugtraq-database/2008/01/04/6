rPath fixed the nss_ldap issue a month ago with rPSA-2007-0255-1. Our 
mailing list archived it at 
http://lists.rpath.com/pipermail/security-announce/2007-November/000284.html, 
but it should have been sent to bugtraq as well.

The fix did not require any modifications to dovecot, so that is why 
dovecot wasn't mentioned in the advisory.
