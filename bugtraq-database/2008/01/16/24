 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2008:014
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Package : apache
 Date    : January 16, 2008
 Affected: Corporate 3.0
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Problem Description:
 
 A number of vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Apache 1.3.x
 packages:
 
 A flaw found in the mod_autoindex module could lead to a cross-site
 scripting attack on sites where mod_autoindex was enabled and the
 AddDefaultCharset directive was removed from the configuration,
 against web browsers that did not correctly derive the response
 character set following the rules in RFC 2616 (CVE-2007-4465).
 
 A flaw found in the mod_imagemap module could lead to a cross-site
 scripting attack on sites where mod_imagemap was enabled and an
 imagemap file was publically available (CVE-2007-5000).
 
 A flaw found in the mod_status module could lead to a cross-site
 scripting attack on sites where mod_status was enabled and the status
 pages were publically available (CVE-2007-6388).
 
 A flaw found in the mod_proxy_ftp module could lead to a cross-site
 scripting attack against web browsers which do not correctly derive
 the response character set following the rules in RFC 2616, on sites
 where the mod_proxy_ftp module was enabled (CVE-2008-0005).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
