Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

CUCM Versions 3.3, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.1 and Cisco CallManager Express
are not affected by this vulnerability. No other Cisco products are
currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is the call processing
component of the Cisco IP telephony solution that extends enterprise
telephony features and functions to packet telephony network devices,
such as IP phones, media processing devices, voice-over-IP (VoIP)
gateways, and multimedia applications.

When a CUCM server is deployed in secure mode, a Certificate Trust
List (CTL) is used by Cisco Unified IP Phone devices to verify the
identity of CUCM servers. The CTL contains public keys and other
information to allow the Cisco IP Phone devices to establish a
trusted relationship with a CUCM server. The CTL is provisioned using
the CTL Provider service on a CUCM server and with the CTL Provider
client on an administrator workstation. The CTL Provider service
needs to be enabled during the initial configuration of a CUCM server
/cluster or when changes are required to the CTL. Please consult the
Workarounds section of this advisory for information on how to
determine if the CTL Provider service is enabled on a CUCM server.

The CTL Provider service of the CUCM contains a heap overflow
vulnerability that could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to
cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code. The CTL Provider
service listens on TCP port 2444 by default, but the port can be
modified by the user. This issue is documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCsj22605.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a DoS
condition or the execution of arbitrary code.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

It is possible to workaround the vulnerability by disabling the CTL
Provider service when not in use. Access to the CTL Provider service
is required for the initial configuration of the CUCM authentication
and encryption features, or during configuration updates. For the
CUCM 4.x systems, please consult the following documentation for
details on how to disable the CUCM services:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps556/products_administration_guide_chapter09186a008070ec49.html

Filtering traffic to the affected CUCM systems on screening devices
can be used as a mitigation technique for this vulnerability. To
mitigate the CTL Producer service overflow, access to TCP port 2444
should be permitted only between the CUCM servers and administrator
workstations running the CTL Provider client. There is currently no
supported method to configure filtering directly on a CUCM system.

It is possible to change the default ports of the CTL Provider (TCP
port 2444) service. If changed, filtering should be based on the port
value used. The value of the port can be viewed in CUCM
Administration interface by following the System > Service Parameters
menu and selecting the CTL Provider service.

Filters blocking access to TCP port 2444 should be deployed at the
network edge as part of a transit access control list (tACL). Further
information about transit access control lists is available in the
white paper "Transit Access Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge,"
which is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin
companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20080116-cucmctl.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================
