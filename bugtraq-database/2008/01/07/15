We would love to see the same breadth and depth of submissions as we
have in previous years, so if you have an idea you're on the fence
about - please send it in! For a complete list of past presentations,

Please be sure to include the following information in your submission:

you plan on covering

talk has been accepted.

As we have a single presentation track, please bear in mind that
speaking slots are limited to one hour. While presenters typically
divide the hour into separate presentation and Q&A sessions, you may
structure your time however you see fit. If you think your
presentation will run longer, or have any special requirements, please
include this information in your submission and we will do our best to
accommodate you.

Note: If the presentation is based upon code or a particular
technique, the presenter must be one of the developers of the code or
technique and be prepared to perform a demonstration.

We look forward to reviewing your submissions, and anticipate another
great line-up for this year's conference. Once again, if you have any
