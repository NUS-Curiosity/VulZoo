Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.15.08: TIBCO SmartSockets RTServer
 Multiple Untrusted Loop Bounds Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 01.15.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 15, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

TIBCO SmartSockets is a message passing framework used to transport
messages over disparate channels. The RTserver is the server component
of the framework. More information can be found on the vendor's web
site at the following URL.

http://www.tibco.com/software/messaging/smartsockets/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple untrusted loop bounds vulnerabilities in
TIBCO Software Inc.'s SmartSockets RTserver may allow an attacker to
crash the service or execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

When processing requests, SmartSockets uses values from the requests to
control the number of iterations of several loops. Inside these loops,
various memory operations are performed. Since attackers can control
these values, potentially exploitable conditions arise.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
privileges. Unsuccessful attempts will likely crash the RTserver. The
service does not restart, which makes repeated exploitation attempts
more difficult.

The RTserver is the core component of the SmartSockets framework.
Without it, applications will be unable to pass messages. The severity
of these issues will likely vary depending on the the application using
the SmartSockets framework.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in TIBCO
SmartSockets version 6.8.0. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for these issues.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
