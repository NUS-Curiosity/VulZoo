Good point, it could be an unknown kernel hole.  

However it could and be a privilege escalation scenario through the
application layer .. maybe PHP, knowing its history and the fact it's
present on all the infected machines.

Anyway, nobody really knows how the initial root compromise is achieved
but it's definately one (root compromise that is).
