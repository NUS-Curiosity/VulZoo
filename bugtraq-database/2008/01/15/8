Subject: Re: what is this?

This is a very serious new threat affecting Linux servers and thousands
of boxes have been compromised since December 2007.

Each box serving the nasty javascript has been rooted. One person has
found a way to CLEAN the infection (ie. stop your server from serving
the bad javascript), however not the root hole ie. the servers in
question are still rooted as nobody so far has found what hole is being
exploited to gain root access in the first place.

See the following urls for a lot more info on this exploit:

starts on page 3 or so)

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/11/mysterious_web_infection/

Time for some honey pot action to find out how they're gaining root
access to begin with. From all reports so far it does not appear to be a
kernel vulnerability (as some of the affected servers were using latest
kernels)

Cheers,
Denis
