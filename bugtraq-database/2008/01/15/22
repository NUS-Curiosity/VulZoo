You don't need root to deface web servers in general. Even if the
attackers want to run bots, they often stay as the unprivileged user
they get in as. Sometimes a few privilege escalation exploits are
tried, but even then people seem willing to make use of normal users
if they can't get root.

(Unless you meant 'root' as in 'root cause', or the Aussie sense of
rooted, as in 'f**ed' :)

cheers,
