That's Montana State University. There are a number of universities in
the US with the initials "MSU". The msu.edu domain, for example, is
Michigan State University.

The story this item is based on came from a Montana source. In that
context "MSU" was relatively unambiguous, but for a report intended for
a global audience, it'd be better to spell out the victim's name.
