At least since Windows 3.0, whenever an application starts, it gets a 
reference to the previous (if any) instance of the app running on the 
system.  There are many applications that will simply exit with a message 
saying "Fropboz.exe is already running".

It doesn't answer your question as to WHY the functionality is there, or 
why the Outlook programmers thought about using it that way, but it's 
hardly something new.
