Well, was this embedded at your page source code? Or the link was just posted to it ? Its using some apple quicktime exploit to drop probably some botnet program to victims harddisk, into c://win<4 character random string here>.exe. If im right the original file was located at techicorner.com/bcuoixqf, although i cant find it now. Hope this helps
