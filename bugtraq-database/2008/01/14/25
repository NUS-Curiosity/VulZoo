Rationally my mail didn't want to be a personal attack, unfortunately
yesterday when I wrote it I was a bit stressed due to various things
included the tests I did for solving the doubts raised in the previous
mails.

So please don't consider the first line and the last paragraphs of my
yesterday's mail because non-technical and moreover non-rational.
Right or not, light or weight, nothing on a security mailing list should
be outside the technical matters, moreover if there is no real reason to
reply in a certain way to who simply did a personal test.
