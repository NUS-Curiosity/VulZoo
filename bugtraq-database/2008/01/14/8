Example:

https://(target_page)?SearchString=%22%20type=%22hidden%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22list-xss%22)%3C/script%3E%3Cinput%20type=%22hidden%22%20value=%22


The vulnerability has been identified in version 9.4.3. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
Administrators should not browse untrusted sites while logged into the BIG-IP web management interface. It is not possible to log out of the interface so it is important to shut down the browser after the interface is no longer needed. Closing the interface browser window or removing the BIG-IP cookie is not sufficient.
