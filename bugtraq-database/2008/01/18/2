                    4th International Conference on
                 IT Incident Management & IT Forensics

                          Mannheim,  Germany

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Information technology has become crucial to almost every part of
society. IT infrastructures have become critical in the world-wide
economy, the financial sector the health sector, the government's
administration, the military, and the educational sector.

Although security usually gets involved in the design process of IT
systems nowadays, the process of maintaining security in the operation
of IT infrastructures, in most cases, still lacks the appropriate
attention.  The capability to manage and respond to IT security
incidents and their forensic analysis are not well established. The
quickly rising number of security incidents worldwide makes the
implementation of incident management capabilities essential.

In order to advance the fields of IT Security Incident Management and IT
Forensics the special interest-group "Security Intrusion Detection and
Response" (SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI) organizes an
annual conference, providing a platform for experts from throughout the
world, to discuss the state of the art in the areas of IT Security
Incident Management and IT Forensics (IMF). IMF promotes collaboration
and exchange of ideas between industry, academia, law-enforcement and
other government bodies.

The IMF conference will be held for the fourth time in 2008. The concept
matured from a pure academic event to an academic track section
complemented by practical workshops. In addition, IMF has become an
important community event.  This year IMF starts to travel.  The
Mannheim University of Cooperative Education (Berufsakademie Mannheim)
will host the fourth IMF.

It is planned to continue to find hosts for IMF at different locations
in order to widen the community and to learn from different
perspectives.

The scope of IMF 2008 is broad and includes, but is not limited to the
following areas:
