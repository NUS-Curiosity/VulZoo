Subject: Re: PIX Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

I tried this on my 515E with 'Cisco PIX Security Appliance Software 
Version 7.1(1)'  I also uses radius for auth, and I couldn't reproduce 
this exploit.  This may just be a 7.1 issue.

I will not be in my lab until Tuesday of next week, but I will reproduce this again and copy the exact configuration. I can not really argue any points until then. I really appreciate you'll looking into the matter. Again this was reproduced on a PIX 515E running v7.2 of Finesse.
