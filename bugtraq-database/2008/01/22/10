PacerCMS Multiple Vulnerabilities (XSS/SQL).
--------------------------------------------------------

Product: PacerCMS
Version: 0.6
Vendor:  http://pacercms.sourceforge.net/
Date:    01/22/08

- Introduction

PacerCMS is a content management solution for student and non-daily
community newspapers.

- Details

PacerCMS is susceptible to both persistent cross-site scripting and
SQL injection attacks.  An attacker could use the public
'Write a Letter'(submit.php) form to send a message to the System
Administrator or staff member containing Javascript.  The name,
headline, or text POST variables are not sufficiently sanitized.

The system administrator of the CMS sees a list of submitted
messages on siteadmin/index.php right after logging in.  If an
attacker sends a message containing Javascript in the name or
headline then the code will be run as soon as the admin logs in.
This could lead to a staff member's session being hijacked.

Multiple siteadmin pages are vulnerable to SQL injection. Access to
these pages are restricted to staff members.

  - siteadmin/article-edit.php
  - siteadmin/submitted-edit.php
  - siteadmin/page-edit.php
  - siteadmin/section-edit.php
  - siteadmin/staff-edit.php
  - siteadmin/staff-access.php

Example vulnerable code (article-edit.php)
$id = $_GET["id"];
...
$query = "SELECT * FROM cm_articles ";
$query .= " WHERE id = $id";
