 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2008:004
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/

 Package : postgresql
 Date    : January 9, 2008
 Affected: .

 Problem Description:
 
 Index Functions Privilege Escalation (CVE-2007-6600): as a unique
 feature, PostgreSQL allows users to create indexes on the results of
 user-defined functions, known as expression indexes. This provided
 two vulnerabilities to privilege escalation: (1) index functions were
 executed as the superuser and not the table owner during VACUUM and
 ANALYZE, and (2) that SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION were
 permitted within index functions.
 
 Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (CVE-2007-4772, CVE-2007-6067,
 CVE-2007-4769): three separate issues in the regular expression
 libraries used by PostgreSQL allowed malicious users to initiate
 a denial-of-service by passing certain regular expressions in SQL
 queries. First, users could create infinite loops using some specific
 regular expressions. Second, certain complex regular expressions
 could consume excessive amounts of memory. Third, out-of-range backref
 numbers could be used to crash the backend.
 
 DBLink Privilege Escalation (CVE-2007-6601): DBLink functions
 combined with local trust or ident authentication could be used by
 a malicious user to gain superuser privileges. This issue has been
 fixed, and does not affect users who have not installed DBLink (an
 optional module), or who are using password authentication for local
 access. This same problem was addressed in the previous release cycle
 (see CVE-2007-3278), but that patch failed to close all forms of
 the loophole.
 
 Updated packages fix these issues by upgrading to the latest
 maintenance versions of PostgreSQL.
