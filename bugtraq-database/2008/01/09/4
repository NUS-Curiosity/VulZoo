Advisory ID: INFIGO-2008-01-06
Date: 2008-01-09
Advisory URL: http://www.infigo.hr/en/in_focus/advisories/INFIGO-2008-01-06

Vulnerability Type: Remote




==[ Overview

McAfee E-Business Server guards sensitive corporate data with
industry-standard
PGP 128-bit encryption and authentication. McAfee E-Business Server supports
a
variety of platforms and security certificates.



==[ Vulnerability

During an audit of McAfee E-Business Server, we have discovered a
vulnerability
in the administration interface (TCP port 1718).
It is possible to crash McAfee E-Business Server during the authentication
process.
When a malformed (oversized) initial authentication packet is sent to
E-Business Server,
the server will crash, and will have to be manually restarted.

A malformed authentication packet is shown below:
"\x01\x3f\x2f\x05\x25\x2a" + "A" * 69953

McAfee further researched the vulnerability and confirmed that it allows an
attacker
to also remotely execute code.


==[ Affected Version

The vulnerability has been identified in the latest available McAfee
E-Business Server 8.5.2, and it was successfully tested on Windows and Linux
platforms.
Previous versions are believed to be vulnerable as well.



==[ Fix

The vendor has addressed this vulnerability with E-Business server patch
update
on January 8th, 2008.
