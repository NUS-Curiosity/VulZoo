Well, as James pointed out already, this reply is a little silly.

But, just to be clear, if Mitsubishi had explicitly documented that this 
  device should only be used on a private network and had no access 
controls, I don't think I'd have a problem.

However, they show a username/password box (which I'm betting is fairly 
easilly circumvented if you know the right urls and can forge a cookie 
on the client...) so I think it's fair game to expect them to implement 
some kind of real security.

cheers,

Chris
