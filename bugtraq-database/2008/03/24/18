For starters this is a VoIP device (Product Name:   SPA-2102), but even 
if it weren't it makes no difference to me and in the security realm it 
shouldn't make a difference to anyone else either.

1) I don't have an open network and if you do and are on this list its 
either going to be a honeypot or for theft of information (bad guys roam 
this list too)

2) Think about how insanely stupid it would be to "go on a live network" 
then ping a VoIP device offline. What does this accomplish other then 
pure stupidity.

3) Where is the vendor contact information. Was this meant to be posted 
to Bugtrag or Fool Disclosure?
