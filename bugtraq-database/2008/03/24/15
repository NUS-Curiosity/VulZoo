--- [ Password Disclosure Vulnerability ] ---
===============================================


Hamachi is a Client for Trusted VPN Tunneling.
It presents a Password Disclosure Vulnerability, because User and Passwords
are not correctly protected for Memory Sniffing Attacks, so a local attacker,
with a basical Process Memory Dumper, could obtain the Connection Password.


--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

If a user has saved him/her own Password, a malicious user can launch a 
Process Memory Dumper and look through the dumped memory and with a simple 
string searching he can retrieve user /password 

Useful keywords:

USERNAME 
XCHAT_WARNING_IGNORE=

--- [ Patch ] ---
===============

- No patch available from the vendor.
