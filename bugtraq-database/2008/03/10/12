No. As another poster already wrote: there's no(t yet a) disk involved.

The attacker just reads the memory and can then try to find cached
credentials or cryptographic keys (as described in the paper by Ed Felten
et al).

But let's take it further: Windows uses TCP/IP over IEEE 1394 in
standard setup, so after getting the cached credentials of an
Administrator from memory an attacker can successfully (I assume a
standard setup where the Windows firewall allows accesses from the own
subnet) mount \\target\C$ or \\target\ADMIN$ and thus read the files
on the disk. If only drive encryption is used, the files are decrypted
by the target.

Right. The point is that group policies can/might help, but are not
"fool proof".
