WRT the DMA access over FireWire it's but a bad response since it doesn't
get the point!

1. Drive encryption won't help against reading the memory.

2. The typical user authentication won't help, we're at hardware level
   here, and no OS needs to be involved.

3. The computer is up (and running; see above), no hibernate or sleep
   is involved here.

4. Group policies can be circumvented, even by a limited user.
