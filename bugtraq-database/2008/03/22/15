Subject: Safari browser 3.1 (525.13) spoofing

Hello everybody, this time writing to inform them of a vulnerability in the Safari browser for Windows 3.1 which allows falsify the web address and enter another page or content that we want. 

Below I attach a proof of concept so they can see what it is doing so simple and so dangerous because it can leverage for many techniques such as phishing. 

What makes the proof of concept is simply open a window with the site and we want to forge another function overwrites the content of the page so that we can insertarle from a frame to a fake login what is happening to us. 

Without them command more to say greetings from Argentina !!!!!!!
