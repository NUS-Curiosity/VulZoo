Subject: Fedora, Ubuntu publish wrong advisories for CVE-2007-6318

I have just found some false changelogs and advisories published
about a WordPress vuln I published a while ago.

Fedora:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-package-announce/2008-January/msg00079.html

Ubuntu:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/wordpress/+bug/181416

What they have fixed is another vuln published by Michael Brooks,
about an access control failure in WordPress, instead of SQL injection.
The detail of concerned vuln is available at

http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/39409

CVE-2007-6318 is NOT fixed as of version 2.3.3.
