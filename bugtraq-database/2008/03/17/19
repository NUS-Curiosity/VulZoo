Subject: VLC highlander bug


The old buffer-overflow in the subtitles handled by VLC has not been
fully patched in version 0.8.6e, in fact buffer_text2 in ParseSSA is
still unchecked:

    if( sscanf( s,
      "Dialogue: %[^,],%d:%d:%d.%d,%d:%d:%d.%d,%81920[^\r\n]",
      buffer_text2,

The funny thing is that my old proof-of-concept was built just to test
this specific buffer-overflow and in fact it works on the new VLC version
too without modifications 8-)

Instead the SVN version was and is patched from 10 months as I wrote in
my old advisory:
