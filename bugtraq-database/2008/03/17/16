This bug documented in:

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26920/

It is a bug that exists in the function that open the track lists and It's functional for all types of archives:m3u,rml,txt,etc(everything). But Juan Pablo specified the format m3u and not the function.

I know this because I "tasted" the exploit without extension.
