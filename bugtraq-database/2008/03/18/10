Subject: Internet Explorer 7.0 crash

The test was conducted in an updated Internet Explorer 7.0 a day. Creating a document can be malformed probocar a mistake. 

The flaw in this method createtextrange already known by everyone. On this occasion fails to create an item with an argument followed by a long and while infinity. 

By opening with a debbuger the result is as follows 

Access violation when reading [00000014] 

There is not much more to say about the failure .. Only a reflection which is that I am surprised that microsoft not found revised depth this method already on another occasion had a flaw. 

Without more to say greetings! 

Atte.
