Subject: cPanel 11.x => List Directories and Folders

Hello,, 

I Discovered a new bug in cPanel to show the directions (Folders Only) on the server

in Disk Usage part

for example, I tried to see the folders in /etc

and it worked !

that would show you a list of directions of folders

and that including programes on the server, this could be dangerous !

the attacker may use the exploit to see programes on the server and find bugs for them 

also you may see the directions of backups in the server

also you have the permission to see the folders in other websites on the server which is been protected by firewall


tested on / cPanel version 11.18.3
