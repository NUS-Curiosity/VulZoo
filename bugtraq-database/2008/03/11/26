Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in the International
Components for Unicode, possibly resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

International Components for Unicode is a set of C/C++ and Java
libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software
applications.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/icu     < 3.8.1-r1                           >= 3.8.1-r1

Description
===========

Will Drewry (Google Security) reported a vulnerability in the regular
expression engine when using back references to capture \0 characters
(CVE-2007-4770). He also found that the backtracking stack size is not
limited, possibly allowing for a heap-based buffer overflow
(CVE-2007-4771).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could submit specially crafted regular expressions to
an application using the library, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All International Components for Unicode users should upgrade to the
latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/icu-3.8.1-r1"
