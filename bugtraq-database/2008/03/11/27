-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. Exploitation
requires that the attacker coerce the target into opening a malicious
.XLS file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the BIFF file format used
by Microsoft Excel. During the processing of a malformed tag a heap
allocation can be adversely controlled. When user supplied data is
copied to a heap buffer the resulting data results in a arbitrary memory
overwrite. If successfully exploited this could lead to system
compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
