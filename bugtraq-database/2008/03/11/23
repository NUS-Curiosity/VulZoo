-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office. Exploitation requires that
the attacker coerce the target into opening a malicious .XLS file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of malformed cell comments.
When Excel encounters a malformed record it attempts to rebuild the
broken meta-data. A flaw in this rebuilding process allows the user to
specify critical data offsets eventually leading to code execution under
the logged in users credentials.

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
