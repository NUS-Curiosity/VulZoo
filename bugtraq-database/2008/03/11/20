you don't need a firewire port on your laptop, a pcmcia slot is enough
where an attacker inserts a firewire card. but still.. it's a physical
access attack..

yes, if the system is off and you can turn it on (e.g. no bios or hdd
encryption passwords) you can bypass the logon screen. this is because
the tool searches for the function "MsvpPasswordValidate" in memory and
patches it to allow any password.
