Subject: RE: Firewire Attack on Windows Vista

As somewhat indicated in the paper itself, these types of physical DMA attacks are possible against any PC-based OS, not just Windows. If that's true, why is the paper titled around Windows Vista?

I guess it makes headlines faster.  But isn't as important, if not more important, to say all PC-based systems have the same underlying problem?  That it's a broader problem needing a broader solution, instead of picking on one OS vendor to get headlines?

Subject: Firewire Attack on Windows Vista

Hello,

In the light of recent discussions about firewire / DMA hacks, we would like to throw in some of the results of our past research on this topic (done mainly by Peter Panholzer) in the form of a short whitepaper. In this paper, we demonstrate that the firewire unlock attack (as implemented in Adam Boileau´s winlockpwn) can be used against Windows Vista.

The paper is available at:

Best regards, 

Bernhard
