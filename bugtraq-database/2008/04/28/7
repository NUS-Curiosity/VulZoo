Subject: London DEFCON meet - Thursday 1st May - DC4420  

hey all,

following the roaring success of last month's meeting, we've had to 
switch venues yet again just to fit you all in! the new venue (and 
hopefully our new "home") in the centre of london will be:

    The Glassblower, 42 Glasshouse Street, London, W1B 5DL

details here:

we have our own upstairs room with bar and private entrance from the 
street (you can get to it from inside as well). they do good food and 
have decent beer with twigs in for those of you (like me) that are not 
happy with pints of wife beater... they also have a big screen so 
everyone can see wtf is going on, which was a bit of a problem with the 
last place...

please mail me or alien if you have something to talk about, otherwise 
just come along and meet the crew and we'll play it by ear...

see you thursday!

cheers,
MM
