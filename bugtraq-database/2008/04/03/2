Synopsis
========

A buffer overread vulnerability has been discovered in Bzip2.

Background
==========

bzip2 is a free and open source lossless data compression program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/bzip2       < 1.0.5                             >= 1.0.5

Description
===========

The Oulu University discovered that bzip2 does not properly check
offsets provided by the bzip2 file, leading to a buffer overread.

Impact
======

Remote attackers can entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted file that triggers a buffer overread, causing a
Denial of Service. libbz2 and programs linking against it are also
affected.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All bzip2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/bzip2-1.0.5"
