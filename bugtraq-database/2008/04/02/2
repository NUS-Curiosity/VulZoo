Dear w0lfd33m: 

Not fail in firefox, these poorly understood failure. 
The fault is not that they are both directions numeral (#) if it is that when you create a popup with this small sample size the end of the address complete numeral only makes what is behind it is irrelevant to the The first address, then create the popup which is only the end of the address is the address false and there is failure. This only works in Internet Explorer.
