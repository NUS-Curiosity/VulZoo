Team SHATTER Security Advisory

Multiple DoS in JAR files manipulation procedures

April 17th 2008

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
All versions of IBM DB2 Database Server on Windows platform.

Remote exploitable:
Yes (Authentication to Database Server is needed)

Credits:
These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Ariel Sanchez of
Application Security Inc.

Details:
DB2 has multiple vulnerabilities which can lead to Denial of Service
(DoS) attacks against the instance. When RECOVERJAR and REMOVE_JAR
procedures are called with a specially crafted parameter the DB2
instance crashes. Any DB2 database user can exploit these
vulnerabilities since PUBLIC permissions are granted to both procedures
by default. The RECOVERJAR and REMOVE_JAR procedures are installed by
default.

Impact:
Any remote authenticated attacker can crash the DB2 instance.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
To fix the problem apply the FP16(v8), FP4a(v9.1) and FP1(v9.5):
