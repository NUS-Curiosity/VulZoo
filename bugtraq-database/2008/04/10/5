Subject: Re: openMosix userspace library stack-based buffer overflow

This vulnerability does not seem to be valid. The example given in the API can not be abused by any (correctly) working application using this libary. The 'const char *item' argument only has limited valid values. If an invalid value is used, the application won't be able to gather the requested information. None of the possible valid values can be used to create a buffer overflow.

As stated in the openMosix-API: 'item' can be e.g. load, speed, cpus, util, status, mem, rmem, tmem)
This refers to the files available in the /proc/hpc-directorystructure. None of these files have a filename longer than the allocated buffer.
