Yes, someone else told me already in private that the "I'm not dead site"
was a hoax. I did not know rgod and I don't know if he's dead or not - I
just wanted bugtraq to know, that there's something else going on here -
without taking sides.

The decision which website to trust (or, more generally, (how) to trust
online information at all) is left to the bugtraq readers.
