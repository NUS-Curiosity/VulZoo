Subject: heanet.dl.sourceforge.net hacked?


or have wrong file?

in attempting to upgrade png (due to security problem), we tried to pull 
from sourceforge mirrors.
(note below, libpng says file size for libpng-1.2.27.tar.bz2 with 
scripts should be 641193)  heanet has a bigger file.
other sourceforge.net mirrors have it right.

Was heanet.dl hacked?  are some people downloading a trojanized version 
of png?
all attempts (in the past) to contact sourceforge had been useless.

Attempting to fetch from 
http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/libpng/.
fetch: 
http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/libpng/libpng-1.2.27.tar.bz2: 
size mismatch: expected 641193, actual 804821
