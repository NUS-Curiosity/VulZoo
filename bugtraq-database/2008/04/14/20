====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Autonomy
Keyview, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
vulnerable system.

1) An unsafe call to "sscanf()" when parsing the "ENCODING" attribute
of the "*BEGIN" tag in an Applix document can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow.

2) A boundary error when parsing overly long tokens from the input
file can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 
3) A boundary error when parsing the initial "*BEGIN" tag can be
exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflow.
  
Successful exploitation of the above vulnerabilities allows execution
of arbitrary code.
 
4) A logic error when parsing long tokens can result in an infinite
loop.  Exploitation will result in maximum CPU usage until an
application-configured timeout expires. In some cases memory usage
will increase until the OS terminates the process.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Upgrade to Keyview 10.4.0.0 or later.

======================================================================
