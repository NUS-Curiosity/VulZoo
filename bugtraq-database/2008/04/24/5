Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
BadBlue is a web server used for peer-to-peer file sharing. By default, several executable files are stored in the web root: badblue.exe, uninst.exe, and dyndns.exe. Executable files stored in the web root of BadBlue can be launched remotely by any user. This can be leveraged to create a DoS condition by repeatedly invoking the uninst.exe executable. Due to the fact that BadBlue has not released a patch for the previously documented directory traversal vulnerability (CVE 2007-6378), an attacker may utilize these two flaws in conjunction to place a malicious executable in the web root and compromise a vulnerable server. 

Solution Description
--------------------
Restrict access to the executables already in the web root (badblue.exe, uninst.exe, and dyndns.exe) and take steps to ensure that users cannot write files to the web root.

Tested Systems / Software (with versions)
------------------------------------------
BadBlue Personal Edition version 2.72 has been tested on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.  Other versions and systems are assumed to be vulnerable.
