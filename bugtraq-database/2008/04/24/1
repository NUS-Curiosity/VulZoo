Subject: Re: xine-lib NES Sound Format Demuxer Buffer Overflow

that buffer can't be overflowed,  "header" is 128 byte long:

#define NSF_HEADER_SIZE 0x80
[..]
if (this->input->read(this->input, header, NSF_HEADER_SIZE) !=
  NSF_HEADER_SIZE)
  return 0;

and copyright can't be more than 50byte:

this->copyright = strdup(&header[0x4E]);
