Subject: Trillian 3.1 basic nick crash

I found a flaw in the trillian 3.1 for Windows.
It is that on receipt of a nickname too long with some characters, this leads to break the program, the failure of the curious is that when the abri with ollydbg tries to read the argument of the message such as whether to wear the nickname long special characters and message write many letters "A" is the result

Access violation when reading [41414141]

The test is made using an account of MSN Messenger and I got a nick there till the limit of characters to the next character "&#8255;" (without the quotes) and send a message to another account that had msn in trillian.

Anyway, is wrong with many more characters that is only one example ...
