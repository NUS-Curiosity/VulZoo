PR07-43: Cross-domain redirect on RSA Authentication Agent

Vulnerability found: 5th December 2007

Vendor informed: 13th December 2007

Severity: Medium-low

Successfully tested on: RSA Authentication Agent 5.3.0.258 for Web for
Internet Information Services in conjunction with Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.11


Description:

A remote URI redirection vulnerability affects the RSA Authentication
Agent. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly
sanitize URI-supplied data assigned to the 'url' parameter.

An attacker may leverage this issue to carry out convincing phishing
attacks against unsuspecting users by causing an arbitrary page to be
loaded once a RSA Authentication Agent specially-crafted URL is visited.

Although the 'url' parameter is filtered for protocol URLs such as
'http://' and 'https://', is NOT filtered for other protocols such as
FTP or Gopher. An attacker could upload a spoof login page to a FTP
server that allows anonymous connections where the victim would be
redirected.

Vulnerable server-side script: '/WebID/IISWebAgentIF.dll'

Unfiltered parameter: 'url'

Note: the redirect will only take place in browsers which consider URLs
with only one slash after the colon symbol ':' as valid when performing
redirects - i.e.: "Location: ftp:/evil-domain.foo/"


Proof of concept:

Example of specially-crafted URL:

https://target-domain.foo/WebID/IISWebAgentIF.dll?Redirect?url=ftp://bo.mirror.garr.it/pub/mirrors/Mandrake/devel/cooker/i586/index.htm

Consequences:

Victim users can be redirected to third-party sites for the purpose of
exploiting browser vulnerabilities or performing phishing attacks.
