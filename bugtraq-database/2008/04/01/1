Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.31.08: Macrovision InstallShield InstallScript
 One-Click Install Untrusted Library Loading Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.31.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 31, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Macrovision InstallShield InstallScript One-Click Install (OCI) is a web
based installer technology that allows software publishers to distribute
minimal installer packages which allow end users to select components to
install. Upon first visiting such a website, the user is prompted to
install the ActiveX control. More information can be found on the
vendor's site at the following URL.

http://www.macrovision.com/products/installation/installshield.htm

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an untrusted library loading vulnerability in
Macrovision's InstallShield InstallScript One-Click Install ActiveX
control allows remote attackers to execute code with the privileges of
the currently logged in user.

InstallShield InstallScript "One-Click Install" is implemented in an
ActiveX control with the following properties:

  File: %WINDIR%\Downloaded Program Files\setup.exe
  CLSID: 53D40FAA-4E21-459f-AA87-E4D97FC3245A

This control is marked "safe for scripting".

When a user visits a website from which a web install can be performed,
the ActiveX control downloads and loads several DLL files from the
remote website. Since no sanity checks are performed on the DLL files,
an attacker can substitute specially crafted libraries that will
execute arbitrary code when loaded.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the currently logged-in user. In order for exploitation
to occur, users would be required to have a vulnerable version of the
ActiveX control installed and be lured to a malicious site.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed this vulnerability exists in version 12.0 of the
Macrovision InstallShield InstallScript One-Click Install ActiveX
Control. Previous versions of the control are reported to be vulnerable
to variations of this attack. Previous versions are known to use
different CLSIDs.

V. WORKAROUND

Administrators can set the kill-bit for the vulnerable ActiveX control
with the following .reg file. This will prevent the control from
loading within Internet Explorer.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
 
  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX
Compatibility\{53D40FAA-4E21-459f-AA87-E4D97FC3245A}]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
