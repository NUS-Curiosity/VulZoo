Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk allowing for SQL
injection, session hijacking and unauthorized usage.

Background
==========

Asterisk is an open source telephony engine and tool kit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/asterisk      < 1.2.27                         >= 1.2.27

Description
===========

Asterisk upstream developers reported multiple vulnerabilities:

* The Call Detail Record Postgres logging engine (cdr_pgsql) does not
  correctly escape the ANI and DNIS arguments before using them in SQL
  statements (CVE-2007-6170).

* When using database-based registrations ("realtime") and host-based
  authentication, Asterisk does not check the IP address when the
  username is correct and there is no password provided
  (CVE-2007-6430).

* The SIP channel driver does not correctly determine if
  authentication is required (CVE-2008-1332).

Impact
======

Remote authenticated attackers could send specially crafted data to
Asterisk to execute arbitrary SQL commands and compromise the
administrative database. Remote unauthenticated attackers could bypass
authentication using a valid username to hijack other user's sessions,
and establish sessions on the SIP channel without authentication.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.27"
