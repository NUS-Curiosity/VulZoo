Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.03.08: Computer Associates Alert Notification
 Service Multiple RPC Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 04.03.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 03, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Computer Associates Alert Notification Server is used by several CA
products, including eTrust Integrated Threat Management, to provide
notifications to console users.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in
Computer Associates International Inc.'s Alert Notification Service may
allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
privileges.

The Alert Service is a component of multiple Computer Associates'
products. It is used to provide status updates and notifications
regarding various system events. It implements an RPC interface with
GUID 3d742890-397c-11cf-9bf1-00805f88cb72.

Multiple buffer overflows exist in the handlers for various opcodes. In
each case, unsafe library functions are used to copy attacker supplied
data into fixed size stack buffers. By making specially crafted
requests, attackers are able to cause an exploitable buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. In order to exploit these
vulnerabilities, it is necessary for an attacker to have valid domain
credentials.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities with Computer
Associates' Threat Manager for the Enterprise version 8.1. Other
products that contain the Alert Notification Service are suspected to
be vulnerable as well.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for these
issues.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Computer Associates has addressed these issues by providing updates.
