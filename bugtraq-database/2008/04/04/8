Title: CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops Server and CA 
Desktop Management Suite Multiple Vulnerabilities

CA Advisory Date: 2008-04-03

Reported By: Dyon Balding of Secunia Research

Impact: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a 
denial of service condition.

Summary: CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops Server 
contains multiple vulnerabilities that can allow a remote attacker 
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition. 
CA has issued updates to address the vulnerabilities. The first 
issue, CVE-2008-1328, occurs due to insufficient bounds checking 
on command arguments by the LGServer service. The second issue, 
CVE-2008-1329, occurs due to insufficient verification of file 
uploads by the NetBackup service. In most cases, an attacker can 
potentially gain complete control of an affected installation. 
Additionally, only a server installation of BrightStor ARCserve 
Backup for Laptops and Desktops is affected. The client 
installation is not affected.

Note: the previously published patches for CVE-2007-3216 and 
CVE-2007-5005 did not fully address some issues.

Mitigating Factors: Client installations are not affected.

Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a maximum risk rating 
of High.
