Synopsis
========

Poppler does not handle fonts inside PDF files safely, allowing for
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Poppler is a cross-platform PDF rendering library originally based on
Xpdf.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/poppler       < 0.6.3                           >= 0.6.3

Description
===========

Kees Cook from the Ubuntu Security Team reported that the
CairoFont::create() function in the file CairoFontEngine.cc does not
verify the type of an embedded font object inside a PDF file before
dereferencing a function pointer from it.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF
file with a Poppler-based PDF viewer such as Gentoo's Xpdf, Epdfview,
or Evince, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.6.3"

==========
