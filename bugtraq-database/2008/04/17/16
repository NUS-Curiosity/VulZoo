Subject: Re: BigAnt Server 2.2 PreAuth Remote SEH Overflow Exploit (0day)

Hello guys,
just wanted to let you know that the BigAnt exploit posted on securityfocus at  http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/28795 on Apr 15th 2008 and at http://www.milw0rm.org/exploits/5451 was reposted the same day on bugtraq by some really stupid guy who changed my references with some porn site!!
I'm not going to repost those links because I don't want to give to him free advertising. Just wanted to let you know that I'm not involved in that stuff.
Thx for your attention,

Matteo Memelli (ryujin)
