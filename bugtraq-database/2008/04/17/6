Synopsis
========

Improper input validation in Speex might lead to array indexing
vulnerabilities in multiple player applications.

Background
==========

Speex is an audio compression format designed for speech that is free
of patent restrictions.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /    Vulnerable    /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/speex     < 1.2_beta3_p2               >= 1.2_beta3_p2

Description
===========

oCERT reported that the Speex library does not properly validate the
"mode" value it derives from Speex streams, allowing for array indexing
vulnerabilities inside multiple player applications. Within Gentoo,
xine-lib, VLC, gst-plugins-speex from the GStreamer Good Plug-ins,
vorbis-tools, libfishsound, Sweep, SDL_sound, and speexdec were found
to be vulnerable.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Speex
file or network stream with an application listed above. This might
lead to the execution of arbitrary code with privileges of the user
playing the file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Speex users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/speex-1.2_beta3_p2"
