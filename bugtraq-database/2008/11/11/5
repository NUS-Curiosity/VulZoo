Subject: Re [WEB SECURITY] countermeasure against attacks through HTML 
    shared files

Hello,

I have revised the paper based on the comments, and put the revised version on the Pomcor site, at

http://www.pomcor.com/whitepapers/file_sharing_security.pdf

(Watch for a revision date of November 10, there was an earlier version.)

The changes include an improvement based on the last post by Bil Corry (see Section 5.1).

Thanks for the all the comments!

Francisco
