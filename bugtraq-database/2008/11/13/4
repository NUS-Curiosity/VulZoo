Team SHATTER Security Advisory

Oracle Database multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Workspace
Manager

November 12, 2008

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
Oracle Database Server versions 9iR2, 10gR1, 10gR2 and 11gR1

Remote exploitable:
Yes (Authentication required)

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martínez
Fayó of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Oracle Database provides the "LT" PL/SQL package that is part of the
Oracle Workspace Manager component. This package has multiple
instances of SQL Injection in COMPRESSWORKSPACETREE, MERGEWORKSPACE
and REMOVEWORKSPACE procedures. Dependening on what Oracle Workspace
Manager release is installed, this PL/SQL package is owned by SYS (on
older releses) or by WMSYS (on newer releases). A malicious user can
call the vulnerable procedures of this package with specially crafted
parameters and execute SQL statements with the elevated privileges of
the package owner, depending on the system configuration it can be SYS
or WMSYS.

Impact:
By default [WM]SYS.LT has EXECUTE permission to PUBLIC so any Oracle
Database user can exploit this vulnerability. Exploitation of this
vulnerability allows an attacker to execute SQL commands with SYS or
WMSYS privileges.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
Restrict access to the [WM]SYS.LT package.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update October 2008 available at Oracle
Metalink.

CVE:
CVE-2008-3982, CVE-2008-3983, CVE-2008-3984
