Subject: Re: [WEB SECURITY] countermeasure against attacks through HTML shared
 files

Hi Francisco,

It would have been cool to mention Microsoft SharePoint as an example of
a popular file sharing system that allows persistent XSS through shared
HTML files. i.e.:

https://moss.company.foo/_catalogs/users/Attachments/<userID>/evil.html
https://moss.company.foo/<siteName>/<SectionName>/evil.html

Where 'evil.html' would be a page containing JavaScript. i.e.:

<html>
<body>
<script>
alert(document.domain)
</script>

</body>
</html>


Thanks for your paper btw.
