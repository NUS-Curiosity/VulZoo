Advisory ID: SYMSA-2008-001
Advisory Title: Lyris ListManager - Multiple Vulnerabilities
Author: Tyler Shields tyler_shields@...antec.com
Release Date: Wednesday, January 21, 2008
Application: Lyris List Manager
Platform: Web Interface
Severity: Remotely Exploitable
Vendor status: Vendor has corrected products and is ok with public release 
CVE Number: CVE-2007-6319
Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26792
�
Overview: 
�
"Lyris ListManager is the world's most popular software for creating,
sending, and tracking highly effective email campaigns, newsletters,
and discussion groups. From our new Template and Content Builder to
our Image Library and new HTML editor, ListManager is the smarter,
faster, easier way to manage all the aspects of your email marketing
program."
�
Details: 
�
1. A user who is subscribed to any list on the ListManager system may
modify client side information sent to the server related to their 
account, effectively elevating their privileges to list administrator. 
�
2. A user who is subscribed to any list may gain access to arbitrary 
mailing lists by modifying client side information sent to the server. 
Accessing a preexisting mailing list on the ListManager system causes 
the active user to be added as a member or administrator to that list.
�
3. Once administrative access is granted, a vulnerability in the
ListManager administrative interface allows an attacker
to create new accounts that collide with existing accounts. This
collision will result in overwriting data in the original account 
with the data from the new account.
�
Vendor Response:
�
Vendor has acknowledged and corrected the issue in several versions 
of the product.  
�
Recommendation:

New versions of each major revision (8.95d, 9.2c and 9.3b), are available 
at http://www.lyris.com/support/listmanager/archives.html. Affected 
clients can download a new version and install it over the previous 
installation.
