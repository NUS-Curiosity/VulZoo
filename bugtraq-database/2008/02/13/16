Subject: [Reversemode Advisory] February Advisories : Microsoft Word 2003
 +  Fortinet Forticlient

Hi

----------------------------

1.Microsoft Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability

Microsoft Word 2003 is prone to a memory corruption vulnerability while 
parsing a specially crafted Word file. The vulnerability is caused by 
calculation errors while parsing certain fields within the barely 
documented, File Information Block (FIB).

This could lead to remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the 
user who started the application.

Microsoft has addressed this issue (among others) in its february 
bulletin: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-009.mspx

Disclosure Timeline:
07/02/2007 - Vendor Contacted
07/02/2007 - Vendor Acknowledged
01/10/2008 - Vendor confirms vulnerability and plans to fix it.
02/12/2008 - Coordinated disclosure

2. Fortinet FortiClient Local Privilege Escalation.

Fortinet Endpoint Solution For Enterprise, FortiClient is prone to a 
local privilege escalation due to the improper device filtering carried 
out by its filter driver, fortimon.sys .

The driver affected filters certain devices, enabling pass-through 
filtering. However, its own Device's DeviceExtension is not correclty 
initialized so any logged user could force the kernel to operate with 
user-mode controlled memory just by direclty issuing a special request 
to the driver's device.

This leads to local arbitrary code execution in the context of the 
kernel. Even Guest users can elevate privileges to SYSTEM.

This issue has been addressed in the following releases:

+ FortiClient 3.0 MR5 Patch 4
+ FortiClient 3.0 MR6

Affected versions:
+ FortiClient 3.0 MR5 Patch 3 and lower

Users can consult the patches via http://docs.forticare.com/firmware.xml
