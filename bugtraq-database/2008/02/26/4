Subject: Bypassing OfficeScan Trend Micro AV

Hi,

As usual, i dont know if its new but i would like to share it with you....

its possible to bypass TREND MICRO OFFICE SCAN Client AV ver. 8.0.

If you edit a PE EXE File and increase its virtual and raw size, (in
my example 1000 bytes added) from its last section (in my case .idata
section), then office scan is unable to detect the malware inside the
file.


This took place after reproducing the excellent video from Mati
Aharoni (piss on your AV!!! - Shmoo 2008). But i didnt even need to
encode the malware inside the backdoor.

Cheers!!!
