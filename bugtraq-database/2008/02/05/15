Subject: Apple iPhone 1.1.3 remote DoS exploit

Vendor: Apple

Version affected: 1.1.2 and 1.1.3

Overview:The Apple iPhone remote DoS for 1.1.2 was discovered by c0ntex, but it actually works on 1.1.3 as well. After further research it also appears that this was a known issue with Firefox version 1.5.04 and was effected cross-platform.
Called Mozilla Firefox JavaScript navigator Object Vulnerability.I recommend you disable Java until Apple releases a fix or patch.
