Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.31.08: IBM Informix Dynamic Server
 SQLIDEBUG File Creation Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.31.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 31, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Corp.'s Informix Dynamic Server is an online transaction processing
data server. For more information, visit the product's homepage at the
following URL.

http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/informix/ids/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a file creation vulnerability in IBM Corp.'s
Informix Dynamic Server allows attackers to elevate privileges to root.

When the SQLIDEBUG environment variable is set, several set-uid binaries
will log debugging information to the specified file.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows local attackers to gain root privileges.

After creating the file, the file's ownership is changed to match the
user and group of the executing user. As such, an attacker could create
files that they own anywhere on the system.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in IBM Corp.'s
Informix Dynamic Server version 10.00 UC6TL installed on a Linux
system. Other versions are also suspected as vulnerable. Versions for
other supported Unix systems should also be considered vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Removing the set-uid bit from all programs included with Informix will
prevent exploitation. However, this could disable some functionality
for non-root users.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM Corp. has addressed this vulnerability with the release of version
10.00.xC8 of Informix Dynamic Server. For more information, visit the
