Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in pulseaudio may allow a local user to execute actions
with escalated privileges.

Background
==========

Pulseaudio is a networked sound server with an advanced plugin system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/pulseaudio       < 0.9.9                     >= 0.9.9

Description
===========

Marcus Meissner from SUSE reported that the pa_drop_root() function
does not properly check the return value of the system calls setuid(),
seteuid(), setresuid() and setreuid() when dropping its privileges.

Impact
======

A local attacker could cause a resource exhaustion to make the system
calls fail, which would cause Pulseaudio to run as root. The attacker
could then perform actions with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pulseaudio users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/pulseaudio-0.9.9"
