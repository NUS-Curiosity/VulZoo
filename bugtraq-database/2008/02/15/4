Subject: Re: Philips VOIP841 Multiple Vulnerabilities

Also with the service account, you don't appear to be able to change the default password, with firmware 1.0.4.50. I logged into the web interface with the service:service account, went to the Adminstration tab and changed the password there (no account name specified), and logged out. But, the service account password had NOT been changed! So, it must have changed the philips account password. 

My phone works fine with .50, and I can't find any list of what's changed in firmware 1.0.4.80... so it ain't broke now, why "fix" it? Anyone know what's new in firmware 1.0.4.80?
