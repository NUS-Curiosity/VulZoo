Naturally, in fact before the patch I was able to exploit the directory
traversal with both slash and backslash while after having applied the
fix only when I use the backslash.

I have also uninstalled, redownloaded and reinstalled both the program
and the patch just in this moment and I can confirm the exact behaviour
described above.
