After researching this threat it appears that this is not a direct issue with Etomite itself but, rather, an exploit which server security lets through... I have tested several different scripts on several servers and have found this to be the case...

The variable is actually $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] and not $_SERVER['PHP_INFO'] which doesn't exist... While running $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] through htmlentities() is a round-about solution, this fix would need to be present in virtually every PHP script opening accessible on the internet unless the exploit possibility is handled at the server level...

Final disposition... This is not an Etomite specific exploit and I would like the report rescinded...
