Thanks for the heads up. It's very possible that this is the same bug
but obviously we found it in a different context. It surely seems like
it may be the original that Apple would not discuss with us.

The bug number it was duped against was over 2 million bugs prior. Does
that sound like Apple knew about this for nearly _4_ years (!) and
didn't do anything about it?

That's seriously pathetic if it's actually that case!
