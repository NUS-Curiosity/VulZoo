    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2371

Description:
    Previous versions of the pcre package are vulnerable to a possible
    Arbitrary Code Execution attack in which an attacker may use a
    maliciously crafted regular expression to trigger a buffer overflow.
    
    The pcre library and utilities are not known to be exposed via any
    privileged or remote interfaces within rPath Linux by default, but many
    applications linked to the pcre library are routinely exposed to remote
    or untrusted data; examples include httpd and some PHP applications.
