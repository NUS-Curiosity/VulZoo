Subject: [Paper] Reflective Dll Injection

Hello, Just released a short paper on Reflective Dll Injection.

Abstract: Reflective DLL injection is a library injection technique in which the concept of reflective programming is employed to perform the loading of a library from memory into a host process. As such the library is responsible for loading itself by implementing a minimal Portable Executable (PE) loader.

You can download the paper here:

And the PoC code here:

Support for Reflective DLL Injection has been added to Metasploit in the form of a payload stage and a modified VNC DLL (both are currently in the development tree).

Cheers

Stephen Fewer
