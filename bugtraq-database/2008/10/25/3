Subject: Re: HTTPBruteForcer released

Mon amie,
why someone have to choose your HttpBruteForcer and not fscan[1] of 
Andrea Tarasco?
fscan is with with source code, with multi thread support, customizable 
user forms and support proxies and you can compile on linux too.
The unique problem it's the command line execution, but if you are not a 
script kiddie or sunday lamer you can use without difficulties.
So, why someone have to choose your software if he can use a software 
with public source available?

Francesco.
