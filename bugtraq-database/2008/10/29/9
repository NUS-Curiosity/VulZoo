Subject: Advanced application-level OS fingerprinting

My research paper is done!

There have been a few corrections, updates, additions, and the paper is overall much better now. For those of you who missed the pre-release announcement made on this list, here's an excerpt that summarizes the paper fairly well:

"...I present an alternate approach to application-level OS fingerprinting. The general idea is that there are certain requests that can be made to cross-platform applications which result in OS-dependant responses."

And here's the goods...
