Subject: Re: Re: MS OWA 2003 Redirection Vulnerability

Actually I have no more chance to test that since I found that vulnerability during a check for a customer.

Thanks for the input however. I will check that the next time. An XSS vulnerability would indeed be nicer than a simple redirection...
