Subject: London DEFCON meet - DC4420 - Thursday October 23rd

folks,

thanks to alien quietly beavering away behind the scenes, we've managed 
to pull a great October meet together...

The Talks!

- Introduction to GNU Radio - Dominic
- OpenVAS  - TimB
- the autom8ton guide to locks
- R2Z+CBI/O=BBUK - Rich Smith

GNU Radio + the locks will break down into workshops and social drinky
things so you can touch/play with the stuff talked about.
bring your picks and your brain.

Where?

42 Glasshouse St, Piccadilly, W 1B 5JY

doors open from 7, speaking starts from 7.30 - please try and be prompt
as some people need to go early to get trains back out of London.

we have private use of the whole of the upstairs till close.

real ale on draught : Adnams Broadside + Spitfire, 'Buccomb' and
'Doombar' ^ ^
other stuff on draught : Guinness, Staropramen, Hoegaarden, Leffe.
even more stuff on draught : Becks, Fosters, 1664

food menu is extensive and most importantly : they do Pie, but heed the 
warning!!! eat by nine or eat somewhere else as the kitchens close 
relatively early!!!

see you there...

cheers,
MM
