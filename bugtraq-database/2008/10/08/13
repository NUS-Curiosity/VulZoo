-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory Server. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within dhost.exe, the service responsible for
directory replication which is bound by default to TCP port 524.
Improper parsing within opcode 0x0F via the Netware Core Protocol can
result in an arithmetic calculation based on supplied user-input
resulting in an integer overflow that will be used to copy into a heap
buffer. This fault can be leveraged to result in arbitrary code
execution.

Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
