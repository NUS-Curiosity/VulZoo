Subject: CREATE ANY DIRECTORY to SYSDBA

I have found a serious privilege escalation in the Oracle DB that raises a lower privileged user with CREATE ANY DIRECTORY to that of SYSDBA by directly overwriting the hidden binary password file with a known binary password file via UTL_DIR. Full discussion of how to defend and respond to this are included and YES Oracle have been forewarned.
All Oracle DB folks should read this ASAP.
