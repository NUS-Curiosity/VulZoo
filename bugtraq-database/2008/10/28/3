Subject: A video can crash ANY iphone/ipod and a few libraries.

A specially crafted mp4 video can totally crash any Apple iPhone and iPod device.
Crashes have been reported from a few windows/unix applications too.
Further investigation proves it's a flaw in the libraries used by Apple and many opensource apps.
VLC (videolan) crashes too.

Contact me for further infos.
Full disclosure will follow on http://www.ziphone.org
