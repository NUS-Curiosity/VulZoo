-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass specific script
execution enforcements on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists when moving DOM nodes in between documents with
a specific timing while triggering garbage collection. If timed
correctly Firefox will incorrectly reference a previously freed object
which can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code under
the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
