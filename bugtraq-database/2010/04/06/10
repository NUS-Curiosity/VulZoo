CA20100406-01: Security Notice for CA XOsoft

Issued: April 6, 2010

CA's support is alerting customers to multiple security risks with CA
XOsoft products. Multiple vulnerabilities exist that can allow a
remote attacker to gain sensitive information, cause a denial of
service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. CA has issued patches
to address the vulnerabilities.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2010-1221, occurs due to a lack of
authentication. An attacker can make a SOAP request to enumerate user
names. This vulnerability has a low risk rating and affects r12.0 and
r12.5 XOsoft products.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2010-1222, occurs due to a lack of
authentication. An attacker can make a SOAP request to gain
potentially sensitive information. This vulnerability has a low risk
rating and affects only r12.5 XOsoft products.

The third set of vulnerabilities, CVE-2010-1223, occurs due to
insufficient bounds checking. An attacker can make a request that can
cause a buffer overflow which may result in a crash or possibly code
execution. These vulnerabilities have a high risk rating and affect
r12.0 and r12.5 XOsoft products.
