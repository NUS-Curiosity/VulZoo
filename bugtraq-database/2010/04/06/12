SUMMARY
=======

In previous MIT krb5 releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.6.3, the
Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) can crash due to referencing
freed memory.  A legitimate user can trigger this crash by using a
newer version of the kadmin protocol than the server supports.

This is an implementation vulnerability in MIT krb5, and not a
vulnerability in the Kerberos protocol.  This vulnerability is not
present in modern releases of MIT krb5.

IMPACT
======

An authenticated remote attacker could crash the Kerberos
administration daemon (kadmind), causing a denial of service.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

* kadmind in MIT releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.6.3.

FIXES
=====

* The krb5-1.7 release already contains a fix for this vulnerability.

* Apply the patch below.  The corresponding SVN revision (r22427) in
  our source tree contains additional use-after-free bugfixes; we
  believe that it is impractical for an attacker to induce execution
  of these sections of code.

DETAILS
=======

MIT krb5 bug #5998 contains the earliest description of this bug.
Debian bug #567052 (referenced above) contains the first public
indication of the security consequence of this bug.  Under error
conditions, such as receiving an invalid kadmin API version number,
the kadmin RPC stub init_2_svc() attempts to call
krb5_get_error_message() on a krb5_context handle that is in a
previously-freed kadm5_server_handle_t object.  This typically results
in a read operation on an invalid pointer, causing a crash and denial
of service.  Releases prior to krb5-1.5 did not use extended error
information in this way, and therefore do not include the vulnerable
code.

The most likely cause of a crash is a legitimate user running a kadmin
client from the krb5-1.8 or newer release, which sends an API version
number not recognized by earlier releases.
