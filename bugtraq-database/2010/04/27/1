So what? Also a SQL Injection vulnerability may be used to write a
file on the system to execute commands, but it isn't a remote commands
execution vulnerability. The your is not a command execution
vulnerability because there aren't injection on a command execution's
function, such as system(). If you can upload a file not allowed by
the vulnerable script, you can than upload a malicious file that can
be used to execute commands or other operations on the target server,
but it isn't a direct command execution vulnerability, understand? The
my is only a clarification.
