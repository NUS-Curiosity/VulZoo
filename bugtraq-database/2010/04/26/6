Subject: SmodCMS 'config.php' Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability

SmodCMS is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation; other attacks are also possible.

SmodCMS v.4.07 is affected; other or lowers versions may also be vulnerable as well.

The following exploit code is available here:
