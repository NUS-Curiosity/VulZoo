Subject: Re: Vulnerability in CB Captcha for Joomla and Mambo

Define vulnerability here.  I don't think this is one.

Granted I have to apologize that my post was a very tongue in cheek 
snarky comment regarding the fact that Mr. MustLive appears to be 
posting up one by one of every web site that he finds with bad captcha 
implementation.  I was outting myself in advance because the captcha on 
my blog site lets spammers wiggle in.  But the spam clean up routine 
clears it out in a week so at most it's an annoyance to me not a 
vulnerability.  So I know I have this issue, but on my stack of risks to 
worry about, this not one that keeps me awake at night.

Is it of value to this list to be notified of every single web site out 
there that has such a captcha deployment?  How about we ask Mr. MustLive 
to post a recap once a month of these types of issues rather than each 
time he finds a site?

Is this of such a degree of impact to a system's information assurance 
that this audience has to be informed of each instance?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)

I have this "vulnerability" on my site.  I ignore it for now.  I have 
higher priority risks to deal with, this gets handled by the spam engine 
on the box.

My implied point is that I think we've already been informed that 
captcha has weakness and in general isn't an 100% effective gatekeeper.
