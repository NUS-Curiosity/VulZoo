Subject: London DEFCON April meet - DC4420 - Wed 28th April 2010

Aaaaaargh! It's INFOSEC next week!!!!

If you are:

   a. Attending INFOSEC

   b. In London anyway

   c. Able to fly through volcanic ash

   d. From another DEFCON group

   e. Bored

   f. Interested

   g. Interesting

   h. Any of the above

Then come and join us for April's 'Social' DC4420, which is timed 
especially to coincide with INFOSEC so we can get all you out-of-towners 
away from Olympia and get you very, very drunk, British stylee...

Having said that, thanks to our friends over in (or under) Iceland, it 
may be that this normally rammed event is slightly less well turned out 
than usual, so we've pencilled in a short but *very* exciting talk...

We're going to lay the room out for 'standing room only', so get there 
early to guarantee your squatting rights...

   "Exposing Interesting, 'Hidden' & Dark Social Network Relationships 
with Maltego " by @l0sthighway & @TheSuggmeister

This talk highlights how you can extend the powerful data visualisation 
tool, Maltego, to data mine virtually anything with an API or that you 
can 'screen scrape'. We will focus specifically on Facebook and Twitter, 
demonstrating how you can access users data and map social relationships 
using both Facebook API and Twitter API's and the Facebook Query 
Language (FQL).
