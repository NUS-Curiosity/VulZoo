Subject: Re: STP mitm attack idea

Portfast modifies STP, it does not disable it. 

This does make a good argument for pvst and similar technologies running at the vlan level for enterprise networking. 

But it is probably best to assume someone with access to a segment can see everything on that segment, pretend to be anyone else on that subnet, and inject anything onto that subnet. In other words, it is nearly impossible to protect reliability and somewhat privacy on a shared link.
