 OXID eShop Enterprise Edition
 - Session Fixation Vulnerability
 - Stored Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability
 Date: 30.03.2010

---------------------------------------------

- Description

OXID eShop EE is a widespread and popular CMS for online shops.
The current release (4.2.0) has been found vulnerable to a session fixation and a XSS attack.

- Session Fixation

Passing the parameter sid via URL allows an attacker fixate the session ID to a given value.
By fooling legitimate users to follow the attacker provided URL with the fixated session ID, the attacker would be able to overtake the users session.
