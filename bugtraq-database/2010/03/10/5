Microsoft Office Excel DbOrParamQry Record Parsing Vulnerability



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Microsoft Office Excel DbOrParamQry Record Parsing Vulnerability
Advisory Id: CORE-2009-1103
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/CORE-2009-1103
Date published: 2010-03-09
Date of last update: 2010-03-09
Vendors contacted: Microsoft
Release mode: Coordinated release



2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes (client-side)
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: N/A
CVE Name: CVE-2010-0264



3. *Vulnerability Description*

A memory corruption occurs on Microsoft Office Excel 2002 when parsing a
.XLS file with a malformed DbOrParamQry record. This vulnerability could
be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of
the currently logged on user, by enticing the user to open a specially
crafted file.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Microsoft Excel 2002 (Office XP SP3)


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Microsoft Office 2003
   . Microsoft Office 2007


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability by issuing an update located
at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS10-017.mspx


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Damian Frizza from
Core Security Technologies.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

A memory corruption occurs on Microsoft Office Excel 2002 when parsing a
.XLS file with a malformed DbOrParamQry record. The precise affected
executable versions that we tested are:

   . EXCEL.exe version 10.0.6501
   . EXCEL.exe version 10.0.6854
   . EXCEL.exe version 10.0.6856

 The vulnerable version is Microsoft Office Excel XP SP3.

According to the MSDN documentation [2] the DbOrParamQry record
specifies a DbQuery or ParamQry record depending on the preceding
record. The Record Query Parameters (ParamQry) offset DCh, contains
information about ODBC parameterized queries. This record has the
following format:


/-----
Offset  Name    Size  Contents
4      wTypeSql  2    Used for ODBC queries; the parameter SQL type
6      flags     2    Option flags

- -----/

By modifying this record an exploitable condition can be triggered. An
excerpt of the vulnerable code follows:


/-----
EXCEL!Ordinal41+2c20ce:
302c20ce 8b461c           mov     eax,[esi+0x1c]
ds:0023:0180aa98=0197013c
302c20d1 85c0             test    eax,eax
302c20d3 0f84e1000000     je      EXCEL!Ordinal41+0x2c21ba (302c21ba)

302c20d9 8b08             mov     ecx,[eax]

302c20db 50               push    eax
302c20dc ff5108           call  dword ptr [ecx+0x8]
