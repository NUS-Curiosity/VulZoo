On Windows Vista and later the standard user is admin too but the UAC forces the user to have "user level" rights. but demonstration code has been published to bypass this protection, then again that kind of modification (the modification did by the sc command reflects in the registry in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in which only admins can write data) will be possible.

I think that no software is really able to make it impossible for an
administrator to get rid of a firewall - for example, it should be
possible to patch system files or modify the MBR so that the firewall
gets deleted during startup. You simply shouldn't work as root or
administrator.
