CVE-2010-0009: Apache CouchDB Timing Attack Vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache CouchDB 0.8.0 to 0.10.1

Description:
Apache CouchDB versions prior to version 0.11.0 are vulnerable to
timing attacks, also known as side-channel information leakage,
due to using simple break-on-inequality string comparisons when
verifying hashes and passwords.

Mitigation:
All users should upgrade to CouchDB 0.11.0. Upgrades from the 0.10.x
series should be seamless. Users on earlier versions should consult
