Subject: IETF effort: Security Assesment of the Internet Protocol

Folks,

We're close to ship the IETF Internet-Draft "Security Assessment of
the Internet Protocol" for publication as an IETF RFC. The draft is
available at: http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-opsec-ip-security-02.txt

FYI, this document is heavily based on the document "Security
Assessment of the Internet Protocol" that I wrote for CPNI a couple of
years ago, and that is available at:
http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/InternetProtocol.pdf

Any comments will be more than welcome! -- feel free to post them
here, or send them unicast to me at: fernando@...t.com.ar

Thanks!

Kind regards,
Fernando Gont
