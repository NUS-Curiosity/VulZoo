Subject: Vulnerabilities in CaptchaSecurityImages

Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in CaptchaSecurityImages.
It's captcha script which is using at many web sites and engines.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerabilities in CaptchaSecurityImages
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/
-----------------------------
Timeline:
06.10.2007 - found Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerability, during
conducting of my project Month of Bugs in Captchas
(http://websecurity.com.ua/category/mobic/).
17.09.2009 - found Denial of Service vulnerability.
17.03.2010 - disclosed at my site.
18.03.2010 - informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Insufficient Anti-automation and Denial of Service
vulnerabilities.

Insufficient Anti-automation:

Parameters characters, width and height fall under manipulation in the
captcha. They can be set in such way, that will allow easy bypass of the
captcha via half-automated or automated (with using of OCR) methods. And in
some systems (http://websecurity.com.ua/4046/) it's also possible to use
session reusing with constant captcha bypass method.

http://site/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=150&height=100&characters=2

In that way it's possible to set two characters and increase the size of the
captcha.

DoS:

http://site/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=1000&height=9000

With setting of large values of width and height it's possible to create
large load at the server.
