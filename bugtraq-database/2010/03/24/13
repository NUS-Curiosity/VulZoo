Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This security advisory applies to all Cisco products that run Cisco
IOS Software configured for Network Address Translation (NAT) and
that support the NAT SCCP Fragmentation Support feature. This feature
was first introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(6)T.

To verify if NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS device, log into the
device and issue the command "show ip nat statistics". The following
example shows a device configured with NAT:

    Router# show ip nat statistics
    Total translations: 2 (0 static, 2 dynamic; 0 extended)
    Outside interfaces: Serial0
    Inside interfaces: Ethernet1
    Hits: 135  Misses: 5
    Expired translations: 2
    Dynamic mappings:
    -- Inside Source
    access-list 1 pool mypool refcount 2
     pool mypool: netmask 255.255.255.0
            start 192.168.10.1 end 192.168.10.254
            type generic, total addresses 14, allocated 2 (14%), misses 0

You can also use the "show running-config | include ip nat" command to
verify if NAT has been enabled on the device.

In NAT traditional configurations, the term "inside" refers to those
networks that will be translated. Inside this domain, hosts will have
addresses in one address space, while on the "outside", they will
appear to have addresses in another address space when NAT is
configured. The first address space is referred to as the local
address space and the second is referred to as the global address
space. The "ip nat inside" and "ip nat outside" interface commands must
be present on the corresponding router interfaces in order for NAT to
be enabled.

The NAT Virtual Interface (NVI) feature removes the requirement to
configure an interface as either NAT inside or NAT outside. If the
device is configured for NVI, you can use the show ip nat nvi
statistics command in user EXEC or privileged EXEC mode, as shown in
the following example.

    Router# show ip nat nvi statistics
    
    Total active translations: 0 (0 static, 0 dynamic; 0 extended) NAT Enabled interfaces:
    Hits: 0  Misses: 0
    CEF Translated packets: 0, CEF Punted packets: 0 Expired translations: 0 Dynamic mappings:
    -- Inside Source
    [Id: 1] access-list 1 pool pool1 refcount 1213 pool pool1: netmask 255.255.255.0
             start 192.168.1.10 end 192.168.1.253
             start 192.168.2.10 end 192.168.2.253
             start 192.168.3.10 end 192.168.3.253
             start 192.168.4.10 end 192.168.4.253
             type generic, total addresses 976, allocated 222 (22%), misses 0

In order to determine the software that is running on a Cisco IOS
product, log in to the device and issue the "show version" command to
display the system banner. Cisco IOS software identifies itself as
"Internetwork Operating System Software" or simply "IOS." On the next
line of output, the image name displays between parentheses, followed
by "Version" and the Cisco IOS release name. Other Cisco devices do
not have the show version command or give different output.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software and IOS XE Software are not affected by this
vulnerability.

Cisco IOS devices not explicitly configured for NAT are not
vulnerable.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) enables voice communication
between an SCCP client and a Call Manager (CM). Typically, the CM
provides service to the SCCP clients on TCP Port 2000 by default.
Initially, an SCCP client connects to the CM by establishing a TCP
connection; the client will also establish a TCP connection with a
secondary CM, if available.

The NAT SCCP Fragmentation Support feature enables the Skinny
Application Layer Gateway (ALG) to reassemble skinny control
messages. Since this feature was introduced in Cisco IOS version 12.4
(6)T, SCCP payloads requiring reassembly and NAT are no longer
dropped.

A series of crafted SCCP packets may cause a Cisco IOS router that is
running the NAT SCCP Fragmentation Support feature to reload.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsy09250 and has
been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2010-0584.

Workarounds
===========

As workaround, an administrator can disable SCCP NAT support using
the "no ip nat service skinny tcp port 2000" command, as shown in the
following example:

    Router(config)# no ip nat service skinny tcp port 2000

Note: If your Cisco CallManager is using a TCP port for skinny
signaling different from the default port (2000), you need to adjust
this command accordingly.

Caution: This workaround is only feasible on networks where
SCCP traffic does not need to be processed by NAT. Please confirm
before implementing this workaround.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
