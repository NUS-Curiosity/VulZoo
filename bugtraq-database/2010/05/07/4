I confirm this affects GoDaddy hosting too. Found a file called
ferdy_simonette.php in my web hosting root directory.

This file injects malicious code in all the .php and .html files in
your hosting directory and subdirectories (and maybe other file
extensions).

I'm going to analyze the "injector" code, as well as the one it
injects, in the next few hours.

So far, if you find any new file in your hosting directory, I just
recommend not to execute it. Or, if you dare,  make sure to
redirect your visitors somewhere else, or bring down your website
before you do.

Regards,
