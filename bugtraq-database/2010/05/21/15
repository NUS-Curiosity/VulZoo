Subject: OSSTMM 3 based Home Security Vacation Guide v.2!

Summer vacation's coming so don't forget to check out the Home 
Security Methodology Vacation Guide at

http://www.isecom.org/hsm/

Version 1.2 is available! It's based on OSSTMM 3. I'm sure a more 
thorough or accurate checklist exists!

Enjoy!

Sincerely,
