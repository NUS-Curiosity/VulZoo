4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Orbit Downloader,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to the application not properly
sanitising the "name" attribute of the "file" element of metalink
files before using it to download files. If a user is tricked into
downloading from a specially crafted metalink file, this can be
exploited to download files to directories outside of the intended
download directory via directory traversal attacks.

The vulnerability is confirmed in version 3.0.0.4 and 3.0.0.5. Other
versions may also be affected.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Do not open untrusted metalink files.

====================================================================== 
6) Time Table 

30/04/2010 - Vendor notified.
