Subject: Re: Ghostscript 8.64 executes random code at startup

The ghostscript people in
  http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691339
told me to use the -P- switch, and marked it "RESOLVED WONTFIX".
I guess -P- should be the default, as well as -dSAFER should be.

The way gv invokes gs is "wrong". For example, using command
  gv /tmp/any.ps
will do:
  chdir("/tmp/")
  execve(..., "gs", ... "-dSAFER", ... "any.ps", ...) 
So gv is careful to use -dSAFER but does not know about -P-.
I notified
  bug-gv@....org
about this, see
  http://bugs.debian.org/583316
also.

Cheers, Paul
