Subject: London DEFCON May meet - DC4420 - Wed 26th May 2010

wow, doesn't time fly when planes don't? :P

if, like me, you've been stuck in the UK, admiring the ash cloud and 
listening to the chants of the soon to be unemployed trolley dollies, 
you'll be glad of the distraction of a couple of pints, a decent pie and 
some evil hax0r learning hammered into your withering brain...

yes, it's that time of the month again, and we shall be gathering in the 
usual haunt to hear:

   Justin Clarke - @Connectjunkie

   'SQL injection: how far does the rabbit hole go?'

   Justin is the author of 'SQL Injection Attacks and Defense' and may 
even have some copies with him for purchase/signing... nuff said.
