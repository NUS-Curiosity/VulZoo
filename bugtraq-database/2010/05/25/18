Subject: Ghostscript 8.64 executes random code at startup

Ghostscript_8.64 on openSuSE_11.2 executes all files matching ./Encoding/* on startup.  This search is relative to the current directory so it is easy to poison Ghostscript and cause it to execute arbitrary PostScript code without user action or knowledge.
