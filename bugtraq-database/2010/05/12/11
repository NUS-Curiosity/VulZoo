CVE-2010-1554

-- Affected Vendors:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Network Node Manager. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the getnnmdata.exe CGI. If this CGI is
requested with an invalid iCount POST parameter a sprintf() call is made
to log the error. However, no length check is performed on the variable
contents before copying in to a fixed-length stack buffer. This can be
leveraged by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the webserver process.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
