4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered three vulnerabilities in TomatoCMS, 
which can be exploited by  malicious users to conduct script insertion
attacks.

Input passed via the "title", "subTitle", and "author" parameters to
index.php/admin/news/article/add is not properly sanitised before 
being displayed to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary
HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser 
session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is 
being viewed.

Successful exploitation requires "Add new article" permissions.
