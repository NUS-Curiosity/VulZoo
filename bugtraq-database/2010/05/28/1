Hello Susan!

As I already wrote you and Adam earlier, every type of disclosure (including
full disclosure and responsible full disclosure) can be good in appropriate
situation. And I use that type of disclosure which is suitable for every
particular case.

Taking into account that 3 from 4 vendors answered me (except Microsoft) and
Google had already non affected Chrome 4, and Mozilla and Opera promised to
fix it (we'll see when and how they do it), then you can see that my
approach works. And responsible full disclosure can force browser vendors to
attend more at security of their software.

Soon I'll write to security mailing lists about new vulnerabilities in
different browsers. And you can not worry about that - in those advisories
I'll use a littler different approach of informing browser vendors. You will
like it ;-).

Yes, I did. I emailed Microsoft, like other browser vendors. I knew their
emails, because I wrote to all of these four vendors a lot of times during
2007-2010, and all of them answered many times (who more, who less). But as
I already wrote, in 99% cases they ignored to fix DoS holes (even if they
answered and told, that they agreed that it was DoS and they'd think about
fixing it).

For example Microsoft one time even answered me twice (with thanks), when I
informed them about XSS in IE6. But they didn't fix this vulnerability. It
was Saved XSS (this type of XSS I created after I found this hole in IE),
which was already posted at Bugtraq in 2007. And in 2008 I informed
Microsoft (and posted to Bugtraq) about this vulnerability in IE7 - but MS
ignored. And in 2009 MS released IE8 where this hole was fixed (as I checked
it), without mentioning about this fact and without thanking me (just
silently). Similarly to Mozilla's approach with one XSS in Firefox (which I
informed them), which I already mentioned to Bugtraq in beginning of 2009.

But about DoS holes they didn't answer in 99% of time. And Microsoft never
fixed DoS holes in IE, which I informed them, but fix DoS hole in Outlook.
And answered me twice: one time with thanks and latter when they fixed (MS
was only one vendor who informed me that it fixed DoS hole in their
software, from all of those few cases when browser vendors fixed DoS holes).

So as it clear, browser vendors only answer when they want.

As I mentioned, 3 from 4 developers answered me (but it's not common for
cases with DoS holes). But MS didn't answer me for more than 1,5 week. From
which you can see their attitude to such issues. And on example of Google,
which Chrome 4 was invulnerable to this hole (only Chrome 1.x), shows their
attitude to such issues - that they are working to fix holes (including
those which was in older versions of their browser) even before they will be
found and disclosed by researchers.

Thanks, I don't need help with informing browser vendors. They with no
doubts received all my letters in 2007-2010 and would receive all future
letters. But as said, I'll not be more informing them about DoS holes. This
decision I made in August 2009 and it's final decision.
