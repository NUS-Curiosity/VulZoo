Except that www.example.com, while reserved according to RFC 2606, 
actually resolves to a host with a web server (running, interestingly, 
Apache 2.2.3 from circa 2006), which gives you a page telling you about 
RFC 2606.  It appears to be run by the IANA.  So it might be polite not to 
use this, so as not to attack the IANA by mistake.

Better would be the reserved TLDs from RFC 2606, which AFAIK should never 
resolve at all: *.test, *.example, and *.invalid.  Unfortunately, 
"www.foo.example" is less obviously a host name compared to "www.example.com".

That works too.
