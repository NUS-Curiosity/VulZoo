Hello Susan!

DoS of the browser is already bad thing. And there are many risks for users
from DoS holes in browsers, which I wrote about in 2008 in my articles
Dangers of DoS attacks on browsers and Dangers of resources consumption DoS
attacks. But mostly browser developers ignore to fix these issues.

But in this case it's not only attack on browsers, but on the whole user's
computer - because it's blocking of whole computer and full resource
consumption. Which is working in many browsers, including their last
versions. So browser developers with their neglect to this problem make
possible attacks on the whole users' systems. It was one of leitmotifs of my
advisory.

This informing of vendors was an exclusion. During 2007-2009 I informed many
browser developers about many vulnerabilities (as DoS, as others) and gave
them a lot of time for fixing in many of that cases. But they almost always
ignore to fix the holes (especially DoS holes, which were only fixed few
times by Google and one time by Microsoft, and not in IE, but in Outlook,
and 99% of cases were completely ignored). Taking that into account last
year I decided from 2010 never inform browser vendors about DoS holes in
their browsers. And this time it was an exclusion (just one). In any case
due to full disclosure the Internet community will be knowing about the
vulnerabilities in browsers which I found and will be knowing the real state
of security of browsers. It was another leitmotif of my advisory.

So this time I informed browser developers and users about these issues. And
did I receive any thanks from Susan (especially taking into account that I
did inform vendors) or any other user of browsers for this info? No :-). Did
browser vendors answered me? No :-) (at first day) - which is normal for
such cases, based on my experience. Only on second day Opera and Mozilla
answered me and begun investigation of these cases (which is rare case when
they responded on DoS hole, based on my experience), but not other vendors.

> These vendors do not ignore security issues and do respond

As I already said, in 99% they do ignore and don't respond (and sometimes
were such cases as responded but not fixed, and such case as not responded
and not thanked me, but fixed). So taking into account my personal
experience with finding vulnerabilities in browsers and informing vendors,
I'm not informing them about DoS vulnerabilities in their browsers from this
year (except this one case).

>From more then 5 years of my work here is TOP of different group of people,
based on answering and fixing of vulnerabilities which I informed them about
(the higher, the better):

1. Developers of Internet related software (such as web servers, ad
blockers, etc.).
2. Developers of web applications.
3. Admins of web sites.
4. Developers of the browsers.

Which must give you a ground for thoughts.
