4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in aria2, which can be
exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to the application not properly
sanitising the "name" attribute of the "file" element of metalink
files before using it to download files. If a user is tricked into
downloading from a specially crafted metalink file, this can be
exploited to download files to directories outside of the intended
download directory via directory traversal attacks.

5) Solution 

Update to version 1.9.3.
