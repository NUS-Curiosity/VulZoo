Vulnerability Details:
When exploited, this vulnerability allows an anonymous attacker to write files to specified locations on a user's system.

The FTP client does not properly sanitise filenames containing directory traversal sequences that are received from an FTP server, for example
file named as "..\..\..\..\..\..\..\somefile.exe".

By tricking a user to download a directory from a malicious FTP server that contains files with backslash directory traversal sequences in their filenames, 
an attacker can potentially write files into a user's Startup folder to execute malicious code when the user logs on.
