TPTI-10-10: Adobe Shockwave tSAC Chunk Invalid Seek Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2878

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within DIRAPIX.dll which is responsible for
parsing the Director movies, a RIFF-based file format. The code directly
uses a value from the file while seeking into a heap buffer. The process
then attempts to write a NULL byte to the seeked address. By specifying
a large enough value for this field, an attacker can force the process
to seek beyond the allocated bounds of the buffer. This can be leveraged
by an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running the web browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
