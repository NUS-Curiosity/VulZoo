TPTI-10-11: Adobe Shockwave tSAC Chunk Pointer Offset Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2874 

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within DIRAPIX.dll which is responsible for
parsing the Director movies, a RIFF-based file format. The code
sign-extends a value from the input file and uses it as an offset to
seek into a heap buffer before performing a write operation. By crafting
particular values for this field, an attacker can force the process to
seek beyond the allocated bounds of the buffer. This can be leveraged by
an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running the web browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
