That's the conclusion we came to in the NHIN Direct project 
(http://nhindirect.org/, secure messaging for the health IT industry) 
though server-server TLS with agreed-upon CAs (establishing "trust 
circles") are helpful.  What TLS didn't appear to allow is negotiation of 
CAs - which ones do I trust, which ones do you have signatures from, 
what's the intersection.  That would allow it to grow more intelligently 
than the "trust this long list of root CAs" model that web browsers use. 
In our case it's useful to also encrypt the server-server link, even if 
you are S/MIME encrypting the message content, because From/To/Subject 
data can be pretty sensitive.  Seeing encrypted SSL traffic between 
suttermentalhealth.com and healthvault.com is a lot less revealing than
