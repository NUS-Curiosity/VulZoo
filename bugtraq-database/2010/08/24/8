Good to hear, but hard to see how this will really fix anything. Unlike
most modern application and devices, these routers do not update
firmware automatically or allow for the user to update them in any real
world scenario. Hell, most ISPs who use these are probably not even on
this list or pay attention to advisories primarily because they
lease/rent the modems/routers out to customers -- placing the
responsibility of updating on the user. Who -- in most cases -- even
touches the router/modem without support could be violating the ToS.

This should show the firmware/router manufactures the need for more real
world testing before deployment as well as allowing for patching via the
ISP or at least allow the user to update the firmware easily.

Thanks for all the hard work, YGN Ethical Hacker Group. Good job and
keep it up.
