How is this significantly different than the issues described in:
  http://www.vsecurity.com/download/papers/WeaningTheWebOffOfSessionCookies.pdf
?

See the section on page 11 entitled "Weak User Interfaces for HTTP
Authentication"

In your video, I didn't see precisely what realm string was sent or
what the overall auth header was, so it's hard to tell.  Also, it may
be that variants of these attacks still work in Firefox.

Note that the above paper was sent to all major browser vendors around
the time that Google was notified about (and fixed) this bug:
  http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=32718
