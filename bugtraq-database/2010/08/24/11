ZDI-10-155: Cisco WebEx Player ARF String Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-155
August 23, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Cisco

-- Affected Products:
Cisco WebEx

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 9936. 
For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS, visit:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cisco WebEx Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of strings defined within
the ARF file format. Strings are typically prefixed by their valid
length. By supplying a string much longer than the defined length a heap
overflow will occur which can be further leveraged to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
Cisco states:
This issue has been resolved in T27FR14, deployed to WebEx customers in
April.
