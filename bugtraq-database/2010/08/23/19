4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered three vulnerabilities in libgdiplus 
for Mono, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an
application using the library.

1) An integer overflow error within the "gdip_load_tiff_image()" 
function in src/tiffcodec.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based 
buffer overflow by e.g. processing specially crafted TIFF images in 
an application using the library.

2) An integer overflow error within the 
"gdip_load_jpeg_image_internal()" function in src/jpegcodec.c can be 
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. processing 
specially crafted JPEG images in an application using the library.

3) An integer overflow error within the "gdip_read_bmp_image()"
function in src/bmpcodec.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based 
buffer overflow by e.g. processing specially crafted BMP images in an 
application using the library.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Do not process untrusted images in an application using the library.
