Subject: Re: XSS vulnerability in Eden Platform


: Product: Eden Platform
: Vendor: Preation ( http://www.preation.com/ ) 
: Vulnerable Version: Current at 27.07.2010 and Probably Prior Versions
: Risk level: Medium 

The vendor web page has a free trial feature, with no obvious version. 
Your version of 01.07.2010 appears to be something you designated, perhaps 
based on the date you notified the vendor.

It appears this is a site specific issue in Preation / Eden.

Can you confirm this is a downloadable product and the version affected?
