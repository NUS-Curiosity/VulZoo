Subject: Re: XSS vulnerability in WebPress


: Product: WebPress
: Vendor: YWP ( http://www.goywp.com/ ) 
: Vulnerable Version: Current at 01.07.2010 and Probably Prior Versions

The vendor web page has a demo feature, that is powered by "YWP 13.00.04". 
Creating a demo via their site, the changelog shows "05.05.2010 - Released 
version 13.00.04". Your version of 01.07.2010 appears to be something you 
designated, based on the date you notified the vendor.

It appears this is a site specific issue in YWP (http://www.goywp.com/).

Can you confirm this is a downloadable product and the version affected?
