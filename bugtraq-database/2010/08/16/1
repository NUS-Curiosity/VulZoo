Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.10.10: Microsoft Office RTF Parsing
 Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.10.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 10, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Word is a word processing application from Microsoft Office.
For more information about Microsoft Word, see the following website:
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/default.aspx

Rich-Text Format (RTF) is a document file format developed by Microsoft
for cross-platform document interchange.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft's
Office RTF Parsing Engine could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

During the processing of a RTF document containing certain control
words, the RTF parsing engine may incorrectly read a value from the RTF
file. This value may directly affect the control of execution flow
within the RTF parsing engine.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user who opened a malicious RTF document
with Microsoft Office.

To exploit this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious RTF
file created by an attacker, or simply receive an email containing
malicious RTF content. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into a compromised, trusted
site.

IV. DETECTION
