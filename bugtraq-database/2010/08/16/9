Subject: Insecure secure cookie in Tornado

BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2010-01
===================================


:Title: Insecure secure cookie in Tornado
:Severity: Low
:Reporter: Blue Moon Consulting
:Products: Tornado v1.0
:Fixed in: Tornado v1.0.1


Description
-----------

Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web server and tools that power FriendFeed.

A secure cookie in Tornado is stored in three parts, separated by a pipe sign (``|``)

::
	
  <value>|<timestamp>|<hmac>

where:

<value>
  is the cookie's value encoded in Base64, which does use the digits 0 to 9.

<timestamp>
  is ``str(int(time.time()))``.

<hmac>
  is the keyed hash value of <value> and <timestamp> concatenated.

The problem is ``get_secure_cookie`` only checks for expired timestamp and the <hmac> does not take into account the separator character. An attacker, therefore, can move the pipe sign to the left by 4-character blocks to create another valid cookie, whose timestamp is in the far future, and value truncated by 3 characters.

This vulnerability is rated at low severity due to situational exploiting conditions.

Workaround
----------

There is no workaround.

Fix
---

Customers are advised to upgrade to at least version 1.0.1.
