I'm pleased to announce that the Zed Attack Proxy has been accepted as
an OWASP project.

The next release of OWASP ZAP, planned for later this year, is
expected to include:
    * OWASP rebranding
    * Improvements to the passive and active automated scanners
    * Improvements the Spider
    * The addition a basic port scanner
    * The ability to brute force files and directories (using
components from DirBuster)
    * Further internationalization

Many thanks,

Psiinon
