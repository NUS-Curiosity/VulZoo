Subject: Accounting Pro 2003 Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability

A vulnerability has been discovered in Accounting Pro 2003, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
The vulnerability is caused due to the application loading libraries in an insecure manner.
Libraries list loaded is as follows:
�	idapi32.dll
�	idr20009.dll
�	idsql32.dll
�	odbc32.dll
This can be exploited to load arbitrary libraries by tricking a user into e.g. opening a HTML file located on a remote WebDAV or SMB share.
Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
The vulnerability is confirmed in Accounting Pro 2003 version 2.0.1.57 for Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3.
Other versions may also be affected.
