4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise 
a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by missing input validation in a 
conversion routine when parsing a certain record type. This can be 
exploited to corrupt memory outside the bounds of an allocated heap 
buffer via an overly large range specified by two record fields.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
