 java.net.URLConnection class - Same-of-Origin (SOP) Policy Bypass

Hey,
Michal thanks for the reply to defend credits :).

I had some moderation issues when I tried to send some word about this.
Just for sake of clarification:
I sent the advisory to Oracle on 20th April 2010. Oracle acknowledged
the issue on june.

If Roberto sent the advisory to Oracle then Oracle just didn't tell
him they already knew about it.
If Roberto just sent the issue to Apache then no one's faulty. :)
Anyway I hope credits will be at least shared between me and Roberto.

Cheers,
Stefano
