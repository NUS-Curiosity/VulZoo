Subject: XSS in Oracle default fcgi-bin/echo

Many Oracle web server installations have a  fcgi-bin/echo  script
left over from default demo (google for inurl:fcgi-bin/echo). That
script seems vulnerable to XSS. (PoC exploit and explanation of
impact withheld now.)

I asked security@...cle.com and they said that "... this issue has
been resolved in an earlier Critical Patch Update." I looked at some
recent CPU summaries, but did not notice anything relevant: maybe
their reply refers to the old http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/717827 ?

Website owners please remove demo software from production servers,
e.g. as per Oracle recommendation
