-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to deny services on vulnerable
installations of Novell eDirectory. Authentication is not required in
order to trigger this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within Novell's eDirectory Server's NCP implementation
which binds, by default, to TCP port 524. While handling a malformed
request, the application explicitly trusts a field when translating it
to an index into a table of counters. If this index is too large, the
application will set a value outside the array and the ndsd process will
become unresponsive resulting in an inability to authenticate to that
server.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
