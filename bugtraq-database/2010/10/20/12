My understanding is that Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security reported
this back in April; and further, the feature was a part of reasonably
well-documented functionality of Java pretty much ever since:

"Two hosts are considered equivalent if both host names can be
resolved into the same IP addresses"

This was a pretty horrible design, so it's good to see it gone, though.
