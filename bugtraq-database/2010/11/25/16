Subject: NoScript (2.0.5.1 < less ) - Bypass "Reflective XSS" through Union
 SQL Poisoning Trick (SQLXSSI)

Hi List

NoScript fails to detect the reflective XSS from trusted domains when an
attack is conducted through SQLXSSI. The bypass in NoScript has been
successfully conducted by using "Reflective XSS" through Union SQL
poisoning attacks by exploiting the reverted errors in the browser. The
attack string used to bypass is stated below

http://www.example.com/news.php?news=12%27union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,0x3c7363726970743e616c657274282f73636861702f293c2f7363726970743e,9,10,11,12,version%28%29%20from%20tbl_news--+

The attacker can create a potential attack patterns using the above stated
vector.

The exploitation video has been released at SecNiche Security channel -

Disclosure: The bug was disclosed to the author on 24th November 2010. A
new version of NoScript 2.0.6 is released today (25th November 2010).
Further, NoScript 2.0.6 version fails to combat against this attack vector
and can be bypassed with the same.
