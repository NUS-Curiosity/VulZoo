Subject: Joomla 1.5.21 | Potential SQL Injection Flaws

1. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION


Potential SQL Injection Flaws were detected Joomla! CMS version
1.5.20. These flaws were reported along with our Cross Scripting Flaw
which was fixed in 1.5.21. Developers believed that our reported SQL
Injection flaws are not fully exploitable because of Joomla! built-in
string filters and were not fixed in 1.5.21 which is currently the
latest version.

As a result, we disclosed these flawsÂ  in order for someone who can
exploit these flaws to the next maximum level.
