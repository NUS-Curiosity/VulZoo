4. Affected Components Description
================================ ==

"Oracle VM is server virtualization software which fully supports both Oracle and non-Oracle applications. Oracle VM offers scalable, low-cost server
virtualization that is three times more efficient than existing server virtualization products from other vendors. Oracle has also announced
certification of key Oracle products including Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Applications, and Oracle Real Application Clusters
with Oracle VM."

"Oracle VM Manager communicates with Oracle VM Agent to create and manage guests on an Oracle VM Server. Oracle VM Agent is installed and configured
during the installation of Oracle VM Server."
