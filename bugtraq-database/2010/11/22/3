Subject: Apple Safari for Windows (4.0.2-4.0.5, 5.0-5.0.2) Math.random()
 predictability

Hi list

Earlier this year, Trusteer discovered a vulnerability in Apple Safari for Windows (versions 4.0.2-4.0.5 and 5.0-5.0.2). The issue is in the Javascript Math.random function, which is implemented in Safari via its WebKit core. Trusteer reported this vulnerability to Apple and to WebKit.org. Today Apple released a fix to this vulnerability - as Safari 5.0.3 (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4455).
