4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by an error in the TIFF Import/Export 
Graphic Filter (TIFFIM32.FLT) when converting the endianess of certain
data. This can be exploited to corrupt memory via e.g. a specially 
crafted TIFF image.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code when 
processing a TIFF image in an application using the graphics filter 
(e.g. opening the image in Microsoft Photo Editor or importing it into
an Office document).

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply patches provided by MS10-105.
