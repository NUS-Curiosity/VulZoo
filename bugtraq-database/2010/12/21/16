4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Microsoft 
Office, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

1) A boundary error in the FlashPix graphics filter when parsing 
certain tile data can be exploited to cause a data section buffer 
overflow via a specially crafted image.

2) A boundary error in the FlashPix graphics filter when parsing 
certain tile data can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer 
overflow via a specially crafted image.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of
