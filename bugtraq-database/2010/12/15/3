No. You just made a complete fool of yourself.-P
Read the initial post again.
CAREFULLY.
Especially that part about unplugging from the network.

Correct so far.

What are "temporary domain admin privs"?
If you meant to say "cached credentials", just use "cached credentials".

A local admin (or better: a local user account) CAN'T log into the AD.
Only domain user accounts can.

Cached credentials are stored for domain accounts only, and are only
used when the AD is NOT available during login. They are NEVER used to
login to another computer!
