Type of vulnerability: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Exploit vectors: Local and Remote

Vulnerability description:  The web application management interface of ManageEngine contains multiple injection points, which allow for execution of Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Arbitrary client side code such as JavaScript can be included into certain parameters throughout the web application. The following parameters and web pages have been tested and verified; however, it is likely more views and parameters within the application are vulnerable:

INDEX.do (HOST_ID, OS, GROUP, exportFile, load, type, tab) parameters
INDEX2.do (reported) parameter
hostlist.do (gId) parameter
globalSettings.do (newWindow) parameter
enableHost.do (STATUS) parameter

Tested on: Windows XP, SP1, with EventLog Analyzer version 6.1 default installation.
Affected software versions: ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer version 6.1 (previous versions may also be vulnerable)

Impact: Successful attacks could disclose sensitive information about the user, session, and syslog clients to the attacker, resulting in a loss of confidentiality. Using XSS, an attacker could insert malicious code into a web page and entice naï¿½ve users to execute the malicious code.

Fixed in: No fix currently available.

Remediation guidelines: The vendor has not provided any remediation guidelines to address this issue. Solutionary recommends upgrading the application if patches are provided to address the issue identified.
