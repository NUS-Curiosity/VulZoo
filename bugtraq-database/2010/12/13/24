Subject: hidden admin user on every HP MSA2000 G3

Hi,

i just found out that there is a hidden user on every HP MSA2000 G3 
SAN out there:

username: admin
password: !admin

this user doesnt show up in the user manager, and the password 
cannot be changed - looks like the perfect backdoor for everybody.
