Call For Papers -- BADGERS 2011

=============================================

The Program Committee for the first EuroSys Workshop on Building
Analysis Datasets and Gathering Experience Returns for Security (BADGERS)
invites you to submit your work. 
Paper submissions are due January 31, 2011, 11:59 p.m. PST.

More information about the workshop can be found at:
                http://iseclab.org/badgers2011/

The BADGERS workshop is intended to encourage the development of large
scale security-related data collection and analysis initiatives. It
will provide an environment to describe already existing real-world,
large-scale datasets, and to share with the systems community the
return on experiences acquired by analyzing such collected
data. Furthermore, novel approaches to collect and study such data
sets are welcome.

In contrast to the systems community, security researchers have only
recently started collecting and looking at large-scale, real-world
data (e.g., the EU WOMBAT and the US PREDICT initiatives). It is well
known that experimental work is often hampered by concerns such as
confidentiality, privacy, and liability. However, the threat landscape
is rapidly changing and this represents a growing concern for
individuals and organisations. To address these issues appropriately,
there is a dire need to better understand the modus operandi and the
motivations of the attackers. This can only be achieved by getting
access to large-scale, real-world data, and by designing techniques to
mine relevant knowledge out of it.

This workshop aims at bringing together people (e.g., researchers,
practitioners, system administrators, system programmers) active in
the emerging domain of security-related data collection and
analysis. By giving visibility to existing solutions, we expect that
the workshop will promote and encourage the better sharing of data and
knowledge.

By co-locating the BADGERS workshop with EuroSys, we wish to create a
bridge between the well-established systems community and the members
of the security community who are in q terested in experimental systems
work.

The BADGER workshop solicits two kinds of submissions: Regular papers
and work in progress papers. Regular papers should not exceed 8 pages,
excluding well-marked appendixes. Work in progress papers should not
exceed two pages.
