Subject: Firefox Observation Plugin Attack

Hi,

What is the level of trust we have to give into valuable firefox
plugins? (potentially without checking the provided signatures or
hashes, if available). Altering the plugin functionality into an
observation plugin is just an easy task and I strongly recommend to work
with empty firefox profiles. 

"./firefox -P --no-remote"

Watch the movie on Hacking-Lab to understand the firefox observation
hack.
