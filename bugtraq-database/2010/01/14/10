Synopsis
========

An untrusted search path vulnerability in Blender might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Blender is a 3D Creation/Animation/Publishing System.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/blender     < 2.48a-r3                      >= 2.48a-r3

Description
===========

Steffen Joeris reported that Blender's BPY_interface calls
PySys_SetArgv() in such a way that Python prepends sys.path with an
empty string.

Impact
======

A local attacker could entice a user to run "blender" from a directory
containing a specially crafted Python module, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Blender users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/blender-2.48a-r3"

References
==========
