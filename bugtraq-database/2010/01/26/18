On the website youcan see : 
"We were recently informed of a very nasty exploit that, as far as we can see, affects almost all e107 0.7 releases. Everyone running e107 needs to get their sites updated as soon as possible. If you are a site owner and you are unable to upgrade for some reason (too much hacked core code), please contact me directly and I can help you with a quick-fix. ..." 
and you can also see that the website was modified ... ( script and a lot of links before the <html> ... ) 
and some other stuff on the main page doesn't seem very good .. so if you know how to contact them ... please do it :)
