4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in HP Power Manager, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable 
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an input sanitation error when 
handling "fileName" parameters passed to /goform/formExportDataLogs.
