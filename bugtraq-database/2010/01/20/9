Subject: Re: Kingsoft DuBa Browser Shield ActiveX Remote Exec 0day POC

This is not a hole of Kingsoft WebShield, because the CLSID value is not its.
It is Kingsoft Internet Security's web shield module. 
The Kingsoft Browser Shield is currently used in Kingsoft Internet Security 2009, and that module was not used. 
Therefore, that hole would not be found in Kingsoft.
