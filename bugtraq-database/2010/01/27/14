Package        : lintian
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4013 CVE-2009-4014 CVE-2009-4015

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in lintian,
a Debian package checker. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids have been assigned to identify them:

CVE-2009-4013: missing control files sanitation

    Control field names and values were not sanitised before using them
    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.

    Patch systems' control files were not sanitised before using them
    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.

    An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to overwrite
    arbitrary files or disclose system information.

CVE-2009-4014: format string vulnerabilities

    Multiple check scripts and the Lintian::Schedule module were using
    user-provided input as part of the sprintf/printf format string.

CVE-2009-4015: arbitrary command execution

    File names were not properly escaped when passing them as arguments
    to certain commands, allowing the execution of other commands as
    pipes or as a set of shell commands.


For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.23.28+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24.2.1+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.2


We recommend that you upgrade your lintian packages.
