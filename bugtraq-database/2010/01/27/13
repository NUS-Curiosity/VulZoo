assigned to the victim's browser by the vulnerable website

- Hijack user accounts by injecting a "fake" html form on the html
rendered by the victim's web browser

perform a phishing attack to steal the user credentials or exploit a
vulnerability (i.e.: buffer overflow) on the victim's web browser in
order to compromise the victim's workstation
