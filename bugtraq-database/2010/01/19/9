Subject: Re: facebook 'routing flaw'?

I logged out of the mobile interface on my AT&T cell phone. "Just in case"

What is also frightening / interesting is that facebook seems to link 
the two sessions so that when I logged out of the phone based session to 
m.facebook.com, I was also logged out of my web based session as well.

Even more interesting is that trying to login to facebook on two 
separate browser sessions won't work. I.e. if I login to facebook on one 
computer, and then login again on another computer, or on the same 
computer in a different browser (i.e. firefox for one session and i.e. 
for another), then the first session is dropped, which is good.

However, having a web browser based session, and a phone browser based 
session, doesn't seem to matter to facebook and I can have both open at 
the same time. There seems to be some potential to exploit there.
