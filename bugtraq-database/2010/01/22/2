Risk:
=====
Critical

Affected Software:
==================
For a list of Internet Explorer versions affected, please see the Microsoft Security Advisory reference below.

Additional Information:
=======================
In order to compromise a system / remotely execute code, an attacker would lure a user to a maliciously crafted website. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

Solutions:
==========
Since an attack scenario would require a user to visit a malicious website, it is recommended to have a layered security solution through webfiltering and intrusion prevention for mitigation.

    * Use the solution provided by Microsoft (MS10-002).
    * FortiGuard Labs released the signature "MS.IE.MergeAttributes.Remote.Code.Execution".
          o Advanced zero-day protection has been available since September 3, 2009.
