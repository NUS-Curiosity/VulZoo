Subject: Kayako SupportSuite Multiple Persistent Cross Site Scripting

##########################################################

We've discovered multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the latest version of Kayako SupportSuite (3.60.04).  Because of improper input validation an attacker (authenticated staff member) can inject javascript code into the body or even subject of a knowledge base article which will execute in to context of the victim's browser when they view the pages in question.  THis makes it possible to steal cookies, hijack sessions and more.  The severity of this is augmented by the fact that the subjects of newly published articles appear on the home page of the portal making it easy to compromise a large number of users.

The vendor has been notified, but until they issue a patch administrators can modify the relevant php themselves to do better input validation.
