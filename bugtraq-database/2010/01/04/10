Subject: Y2K10 spamassassin bug, 2010 year mails discared as spam

Hi,

Please review your spamassassin rules, the FH_DATE_PAST_20XX rule marks the
2010 mails as spam with 3.6 points app, the workaround possible are:

.- file /usr/share/spamassassin/72_active.cf

replace :

header   FH_DATE_PAST_20XX      Date =~ /20[1-9][0-9]/ [if-unset: 2006]

by:

header   FH_DATE_PAST_20XX      Date =~ /20[2-9][0-9]/ [if-unset: 2006]


.- add score 0 to this rule at /usr/share/spamassassin/50_scores.cf

replace:
score FH_DATE_PAST_20XX 2.075 3.384 3.554 3.188 # n=2by:

by:
score FH_DATE_PAST_20XX 0



The 'sa-update' options not always works for me.

Regards
Edo.
