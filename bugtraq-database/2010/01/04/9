Subject: [Tool] DeepToad 1.1.0

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce the very first public release of the open source
project DeepToad, a tool for computing fuzzy hashes from files.

DeepToad can generate signatures, clusterize files and/or directories
and compare them. It's inspired in the very good tool ssdeep [1] and, in
fact, both projects are very similar.

The complete project is written in pure python and is distributed under
the LGPL license [2].
