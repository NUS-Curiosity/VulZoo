Cisco Security Advisory: Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Contact Center
Express

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100609-uccx

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 June 09 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX or Unified CCX) contains a denial of
service (DoS) vulnerability and a directory traversal vulnerability. These
vulnerabilities are independent of each other.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a DoS condition or an
information disclosure.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities in
the latest versions of Cisco Unified Contact Center products.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100609-uccx.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Cisco UCCX is an integrated "contact center in a box" solution for use in
deployments of up to 300 agents.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The vulnerabilities described in this document affect the following products:

  * Cisco UCCX versions 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x
  * Cisco Customer Response Solution (CRS) versions 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x
  * Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response (Cisco Unified IP IVR) versions
    5.x, 6.x, and 7.x

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
+--------------------------------

A DoS vulnerability exists in the computer telephony integration (CTI) server
component of the Cisco UCCX product. The CTI server is only started when the
Integrated Call Distribution (ICD) license is enabled, Cisco Unified IP
Interactive Voice Response (Cisco Unified IP IVR) deployments are not affected
by the CTI server DoS vulnerability. The CTI server listens by default on TCP
port 42027, although the port number can be changed in the System Port
Parameters screen. This vulnerability is triggered by malformed CTI messages
addressed to the vulnerable systems that could cause the CTI server and the
Cisco Unified CCX Node Manager to fail, and all active agents will be logged
out. The DoS condition will be temporal and the Cisco UCCX system will become
operational again once the node manager and the CTI server complete their
automatic restart.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCso89629 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-1570.

Directory Traversal Vulnerability
+--------------------------------

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the bootstrap service of the
Cisco UCCX product that allows read access to any file on the system. This
vulnerability is triggered by bootstrap messages addressed to TCP port 6295.
The bootstrap service is used to keep the UCCX configuration synchronized
across servers in a high-availability deployment model. All deployment modes
can be affected, such as ICD, ICM and IP-IVR, but only if a second node has
been added to the configuration. (Nodes can be listed using the Cisco UCCX
Administration Web interface with the Server option in the System pull-down
taskbar). A high-availability license is not required for a system to be
vulnerable.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsx76165 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-1571.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this Security
Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability severity
and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then compute
environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the vulnerability
in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the environmental
impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

CSCso89629 - CTI Service DoS Vulnerability (UCCX)

CVSS Base Score - 7.8

Access Vector           - Network
Access Complexity       - Low
Authentication          - None
Confidentiality Impact  - None
Integrity Impact        - None
Availability Impact     - Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.4

Exploitability          - Functional
Remediation Level       - Official-Fix
Report Confidence       - Confirmed

CSCsx76165 - Bootstrap Service Directory Traversal Vulnerability (UCCX)

CVSS Base Score - 7.8

Access Vector           - Network
Access Complexity       - Low
Authentication          - None
Confidentiality Impact  - None
Integrity Impact        - None
Availability Impact     - Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.4

Exploitability          - Functional
Remediation Level       - Official-Fix
Report Confidence       - Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the Cisco UCCX CTI server DoS vulnerability will
cause the agents to logout, and the Cisco UCCX server will be temporarily
unavailable to agents until the node manager service and CTI server complete
their automatic restart. Repeated attempts to exploit this vulnerability could
result in a sustained DoS condition.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco UCCX bootstrap service directory traversal
vulnerability enables an unauthenticated attacker to read any file on the
system.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade
solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be
upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software
configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If
the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center
(TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.

The following tables indicate the versions of Cisco UCCX affected by the
vulnerabilities described in this document. All the vulnerabilities are fixed
in the latest versions of the products.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
Prior to deploying software, customers should consult their maintenance
provider or check the software for feature set compatibility and known issues
specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they have
purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise using such
software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by the terms of Cisco's software
license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for software
upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their regular
update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades should be
obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide website at:

http://www.cisco.com

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior or
existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such as Cisco
Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
support organization for guidance and assistance with the appropriate course of
action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific customer
situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and
organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,
customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to
ensure any applied workaround or fix is the most appropriate for use in the
intended network before it is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service
contract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should
acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC
contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
