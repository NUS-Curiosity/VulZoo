Affected Products:
----------------------------
Plume CMS 1.2.4
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

Introduction
============
"Plume CMS is web based content management system." 

More Details
============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered a vulnerability in Plume CMS, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks.
The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to change the administrator's password by tricking a logged in administrator into visiting a malicious web site.

Solution
================
The web application should implement some validity checks to verify the requests before performing certain actions via HTTP requests.

Workaround
================
Do not browse untrusted sites or follow untrusted links while being logged-in to the application.
