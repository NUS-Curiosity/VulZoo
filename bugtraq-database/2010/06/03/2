Synopsis
========

A heap-based buffer overflow in the Newt library might allow remote,
user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Newt is a library for displaying text mode user interfaces.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/newt     < 0.52.10-r1                      >= 0.52.10-r1

Description
===========

Miroslav Lichvar reported that Newt is prone to a heap-based buffer
overflow in textbox.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to enter a specially crafted
string into a text dialog box rendered by Newt, possibly resulting in
the remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application, or a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Newt users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/newt-0.52.10-r1"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since October 26, 2009. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
