Susan, I wish I had the time to hold your hand through getting up to
speed on the disclosure debate. Instead, I would suggest starting with
the links in my advisory which were intended to give you enough
background to understand the issues involved (skip to the Notes section,
if you like).

As I cannot hope to speak as eloquently on the topic as Bruce, I will
not attempt to repeat them for you here.

If after researching the topic you still have questions, please let me
know.

Thanks, Tavis.
