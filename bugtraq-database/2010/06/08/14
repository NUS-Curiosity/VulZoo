-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's Webkit. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application duplicates event
listeners in .svg documents. Upon creating an AnimateTransform object,
the library will create a timer to handle the transformation and
duplicate the object's event listener into Webkit's "shadow tree" of the
image. Upon destruction of the shadow tree and the original tree, the
application will destroy the Element containing the event listener
twice. This can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
