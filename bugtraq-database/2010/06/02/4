5.- VULNERABILITY EXPLAINATION / EXPLOIT

###############################################################
I encourage you to take a look to the ilustrated advisory that you would 
find at
http://www.brainoverflow.org/advisories/TrendMicro_DLP_data_leakage.pdf
###############################################################

5.1.- Files to protect
The information contained in these files are for demonstration purposes 
only,
hence, the shown data is not real.

- MS Word document (.doc) containing a valid Credit Card Number
- MS Word document (.doc) containing the keywords (Boards of Directors)

5.2.- Constraint
For a successfully exploitation, the "Clipboard" channel must not be 
selected
in order to allow the copy from the original file to the attack vector 
of your
preference. (Gmail chat, facebook chat, etc.).

5.3.- Configuration of the environment to be tested

5.4.- Test to validate if the DLP works properly

5.5.- Exploitation (Data Leakage Proof-of-Concept)
The flaw as such is in the lack of analysis of certain HTTP/HTTPS 
channels such
as Web chats. Two attack vectors were used, Gmail Chat and Facebook 
Chat, and the
successful exploitation was achieved in both of them.
It's important to mention that there could be others attack vectors than 
those listed
above, but for demonstration purposes, I'll only include in this 
advisory the
popular ones, Gmail and Facebook webchats.

5.6.- Reports after the tests


6.- GREETS
I’d like to thank Yess G., F. Vilchis and Raaka_elgaupo for testing...
