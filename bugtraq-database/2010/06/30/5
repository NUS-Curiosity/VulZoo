4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Adobe Reader, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by an array-indexing error in AcroForm.api
when parsing GIF image data. This can be exploited to bypass a size 
check to cause a heap-based buffer overflow when a specially crafted 
PDF file is opened.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
