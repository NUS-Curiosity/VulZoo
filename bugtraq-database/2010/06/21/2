Affected Products:
=============
CMS RedAks v.2.0
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

"CMS RedAks is a web based content management system." 

More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in CMS RedAks v.2.0, which can be exploited to conduct sql injection attacks.
Input passed directly to the "search_area" POST parameter in "/search/" Controller is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and therefore sanatize all input.
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
