CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

GameSec 2010 - Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security
22-23 November 2010, Berlin, Germany

GameSec conference aims to bring together researchers who aim to
establish a theoretical foundation for making resource
allocation decisions that balance available capabilities and
perceived security risks in a principled manner. The conference
focuses analytical models based on game, information,
communication, optimization, decision, and control theories that
are applied to diverse security topics. At the same time, the
connection between theoretical models and real world security
problems are emphasized to establish the important feedback
loop between theory and practice. Observing the scarcity of
venues for researchers who try to develop a deeper theoretical
understanding of the underlying incentive and resource allocation
issues in security, we believe that GameSec will fill an
important void and serve as a distinguished forum of highest
standards for years to come.
