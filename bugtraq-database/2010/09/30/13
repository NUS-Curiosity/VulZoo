September 29, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
IBM

-- Affected Products:
IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by
default on tcp port 11406. The issue is due to a memcpy within the
_AGI_S_ActivateLTScriptReply function. The process trusts a
user-supplied length and copies user-supplied data to a fixed length
buffer located on the stack. Successful exploitation leads to remote
code execution under the context of the fastback server.
