Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation
Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100922-sip

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-sip.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 September 22 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS^  Software that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected
device when SIP operation is enabled.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds for devices that must run
SIP; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure to the
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-sip.shtml

Note:  The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of
the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table
at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS
Software vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22,
2010, or earlier:

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is affected by the
vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Two separate Cisco
Security Advisories have been published to disclose the
vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
at the following locations:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090826-cucm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

These vulnerabilities only affect devices running Cisco IOS Software
with SIP voice services enabled.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices are affected when they are running affected Cisco IOS
Software versions that are configured to process SIP messages.

Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software do not process SIP messages by
default. Creating a dial peer by issuing the dial-peer voice command
will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco IOS device to process
SIP messages. In addition, several features within Cisco Unified
Communications Manager Express, such as ePhones, will also
automatically start the SIP process when they are configured, causing
the device to start processing SIP messages. An example of an
affected configuration follows:

    dial-peer voice <Voice dial-peer tag> voip
     ...
    !

In addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a
dial-peer command that causes the device to process SIP messages,
administrators can also use the show processes | include SIP command
to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that
handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the
processes CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET or CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET indicates that the
Cisco IOS device will process SIP messages:

    Router# show processes | include SIP
     149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET
     150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET

Note: Because there are several ways a device running Cisco IOS
Software can start processing SIP messages, it is recommended that
the show processes | include SIP command be used to determine whether
the device is processing SIP messages instead of relying on the
presence of specific configuration commands.

Cisco Unified Border Element images are also affected by two of these
vulnerabilities.

Note: The Cisco Unified Border Element feature (previously known as
the Cisco Multiservice IP-to-IP Gateway) is a special Cisco IOS
Software image that runs on Cisco multiservice gateway platforms. It
provides a network-to-network interface point for billing, security,
call admission control, quality of service, and signaling
interworking.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
show version command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router# show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router# show version

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG), which is used by the Cisco
IOS NAT and firewall features of Cisco IOS Software, is not affected
by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and
video calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is
responsible for handling all aspects of call setup and termination.
Voice and video are the most popular types of sessions that SIP
handles, but the protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other
applications that require call setup and termination. SIP call
signaling can use UDP (port 5060), TCP (port 5060), or Transport
Layer Security (TLS; TCP port 5061) as the underlying transport
protocol.

Three vulnerabilities exist in the SIP implementation in Cisco IOS
Software that may allow a remote attacker to cause an affected device
to reload. These vulnerabilities are triggered when the device
running Cisco IOS Software processes crafted SIP messages.

Note: In cases where SIP is running over TCP transport, a TCP
three-way handshake is necessary to exploit these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities are addressed by Cisco bug IDs CSCta20040, 
CSCsz43987 and CSCtf72678, and have been assigned Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2010-2835, CVE-2009-2051
and CVE-2010-2834, respectively.

Cisco IOS XR System Software
+---------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by the vulnerabilities
disclosed in the September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security
Advisory bundled publication.

Workarounds
===========

If the affected Cisco IOS device requires SIP for VoIP services, SIP
cannot be disabled, and no workarounds are available. Users are
advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit exposure to the
vulnerabilities. Mitigation consists of allowing only legitimate
devices to connect to affected devices. To increase effectiveness,
the mitigation must be coupled with anti-spoofing measures on the
network edge. This action is required because SIP can use UDP as the
transport protocol.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin:Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Voice Products", which is available
at the following location:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100922-voice.shtml

Disabling SIP Listening Ports
+----------------------------

For devices that do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and
most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device.
Some versions of Cisco IOS Software allow administrators to disable
SIP with the following commands:

    sip-ua
     no transport udp
     no transport tcp
     no transport tcp tls

warning Warning: When applying this workaround to devices that are
processing Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or H.323 calls, the
device will not stop SIP processing while active calls are being
processed. Under these circumstances, this workaround should be
implemented during a maintenance window when active calls can be
briefly stopped.

The show udp connections, show tcp brief all, and show processes |
include SIP commands can be used to confirm that the SIP UDP and TCP
ports are closed after applying this workaround.

Depending on the Cisco IOS Software version in use, the output from
the show ip sockets command may still show the SIP ports open, but
sending traffic to them will cause the SIP process to emit the
following message:

    *Jun 2 11:36:47.691: sip_udp_sock_process_read: SIP UDP Listener is DISABLED

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

For devices that need to offer SIP services, it is possible to use
Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic to the device from
untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T,
12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a
device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the
risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly
permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in
accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The
following example can be adapted to specific network configurations:


    !-- The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.
    !-- Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used
    !-- to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane
    !-- policy (the CoPP feature.) If the access list matches (permit)
    !-- then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not
    !-- match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.

    access-list 100 deny udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 deny udp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5061

    !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4
    !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and
    !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
    !-- to infrastructure devices.

Note: Because SIP can use UDP as a transport protocol, it is possible
to easily spoof the IP address of the sender, which may defeat access
control lists that permit communication to these ports from trusted
IP addresses.

In the above CoPP example, the access control entries (ACEs) that
match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action result
in these packets being discarded by the policy-map "drop" function,
while packets that match the "deny" action (not shown) are not
affected by the policy-map drop function. Additional information on
the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at 
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html
and http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.
