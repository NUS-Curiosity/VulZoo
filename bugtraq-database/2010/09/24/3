Subject: Re: Opera Web Browser v10.62 (CSS) Cross Domain Vulnerability

Opera's variation of this vulnerability was fixed back in Opera 10.10. The information on this thread is incorrect. The issue shown here does not affect Opera, and this code would not have produced an exploit in Opera, even in pre-10.10 versions. All it will do is display a message showing that the desired property is undefined, meaning that the exploit did not work.
