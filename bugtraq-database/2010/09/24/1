Not to rain on your parade, but...

> Netscape v9.0.0.6

"AOL formally stopped development of Netscape Navigator on December
28, 2007, but continued supporting the web browser with security
updates until March 1, 2008, when AOL canceled technical support."

If you are using a browser abandoned by the vendor more than 2 years
ago (with hundreds of security bugs identified in a competing product
forked off from the same codebase in the meantime), you have a
problem.
