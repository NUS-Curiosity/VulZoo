Subject: Re: XSS vulnerability in CompuCMS


: Vulnerability ID: HTB22584
: Reference: http://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/xss_vulnerability_in_compucms.html
: Product: CompuCMS  
: Vendor: CompuSoft A/S ( http://www.compusoft.dk/ ) 
: Vulnerable Version: Current at 06.08.2010 and Probably Prior Versions

Once again, you assign a "version" based on a date, not an actual product 
version. Your language of "probably prior versions" indicates that you 
don't even realize what you are testing, and can't figure out the basics 
of the software.

According to the vendor:
http://www.compusoft.dk/index.asp?mode=produkt!compucms

This is a service, not a product. In the future, please indicate this in 
your advisories.
