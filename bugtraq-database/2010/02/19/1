Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Security
Agent

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100217-csa

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 February 17 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Management Center for Cisco Security Agents is affected by a
directory traversal vulnerability and a SQL injection vulnerability.
Successful exploitation of the directory traversal vulnerability may
allow an authenticated attacker to view and download arbitrary files
from the server hosting the Management Center. Successful
exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability may allow an
authenticated attacker to execute SQL statements that can cause
instability of the product or changes in the configuration.

Additionally, the Cisco Security Agent is affected by a denial of
service (DoS) vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the Cisco
Security Agent agent DoS vulnerability may cause the affected system
to crash. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS
condition.

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

+--------------------------------

The Sun Solaris version of Cisco Security Agent is not affected by
these vulnerabilities.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco Security Agent is a security software agent that provides
threat protection for server and desktop computing systems. Cisco
Security Agents can be standalone agents or can be managed by the
Cisco Security Agent Management Center.

The Management Center for Cisco Security Agents is affected by a
directory traversal vulnerability and a SQL injection vulnerability.

Management Center for Cisco Security Agents Directory Traversal Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Management Center for Cisco Security Agents is affected by a
directory traversal vulnerability that may allow an authenticated
attacker to view and download arbitrary files from the server that is
hosting the Management Center for Cisco Security Agents.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtd73275 and has
been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2010-0146.

Management Center for Cisco Security Agents SQL Injection Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Management Center for Cisco Security Agents is also affected by a
SQL injection vulnerability that may allow an authenticated attacker
to execute SQL statements that can cause the Management Center for
Cisco Security Agents to become unstable or modify its configuration.
These configuration changes may result in modifications to the
security policies of the endpoints. Additionally, an attacker may
create, delete, or modify management user accounts that are found in
the Management Center for Cisco Security Agents.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtd73290 and has been
assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2010-0147.

Cisco Security Agent Denial of Service Vulnerability
+---------------------------------------------------

Cisco Security Agent is affected by a DoS vulnerability that could
allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a system to crash by
sending a series of TCP packets.

Note: Only Cisco Security Agent release 5.2 is affected by the DoS
vulnerability. The Sun Solaris version of the Cisco Security Agent is
not affected by these vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtb89870 and has
been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2010-0148.

Vulnerability Scoring Details 
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the directory traversal vulnerability may
allow an authenticated attacker to view and download arbitrary files
from the server that is hosting the Management Center for Cisco
Security Agents.

Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability may allow
an authenticated attacker to execute SQL statements that can cause
the Management Center for Cisco Security Agents to become unstable or
modify its configuration.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco Security Agent DoS vulnerability
may cause the affected system to crash. Repeated exploitation could
result in a sustained DoS condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

 * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
 * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
 * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
