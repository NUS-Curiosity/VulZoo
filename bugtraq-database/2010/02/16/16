krb5-1.7 KDC denial of service

CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:O/RC:C

Exploitability:         Functional
Remediation Level:      Official Fix
Report Confidence:      Confirmed

SUMMARY
=======

Improper input validation in the KDC can cause an assertion failure
and process termination.  A functional exploit exists, but is not
known to be publicly circulated.  Releases prior to krb5-1.7 did not
contain the vulnerable code.

This is an implementation vulnerability in MIT krb5, and is not a
vulnerability in the Kerberos protocol.

IMPACT
======

An unauthenticated remote attacker can send an invalid request to a
KDC process that will cause it to crash due to an assertion failure,
creating a denial of service.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

* KDC in MIT krb5-1.7 and later

* Prerelease (alpha test) code for krb5-1.8 is also vulnerable.

FIXES
=====

* The upcoming krb5-1.7.2 release will contain a fix for this
  vulnerability.

* The final krb5-1.8 release will contain a fix for this
  vulnerability.

* For the krb5-1.7 and krb5-1.7.1 releases, apply the following patch:

DETAILS
=======

In new code introduced in the KDC for the krb5-1.7 release, code that
handles authorization data (handle_tgt_authdata()) contains a call to
assert() that ensures that the function arguments are consistent with
value of the msg_type field of the request that it is processing.
This assertion can fail because the msg_type can be inconsistent with
the ASN.1 tag that previously-executed code used to choose whether to
process the request as a request for initial tickets (AS-REQ) or as a
request for additional tickets (TGS-REQ).
