Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in XAMPP (advisory #7)

Hello Sebastien!

You can confirm it by yourself. Just find a site on XAMPP (Google can help
you with it) and check the holes using PoCs which I provided.

> and what target of xampp is it ? win32 ? linux ?

As far as I remember last year when I found all these vulnerabilities in
XAMPP, it was XAMPP on Windows servers on all those sites where I found
these holes.

In 99% of cases I'm researching vulnerabilities in the Web at real sites,
not at localhost (at localhost I can check for holes only in software which
I use). And I had never used XAMPP (or WAMPP or LAMPP) and I checked all
these holes at real web sites. So in all my advisories I wrote "Vulnerable
are XAMPP 1.6.8 and previous versions", because maximum version which I
found was 1.6.8. And it was quite possible that version 1.7.1 (last version
at that time) was also vulnerable, so I mentioned about it in my advisories.
And XAMPP developers didn't refute existence of vulnerabilities in 1.7.0 and
1.7.1, when I informed them, and didn't answer if they fixed the holes (so
it's possible that these holes are still not fixed).

Hello MaXe!


Have you checked the newest aka (also known as) latest version which is
actually: 1.7.3 ?


No, I didn't and there was a reason for it. All these 7 advisories were made
in 2009 (as it clear from Timeline which I made for all advisories). Only
now I sent them to Bugtraq. And that time XAMPP 1.7.1 was the latest
version.

Besides, in 2009 developer of XAMPP answered me (with thanks) only at one of
seven letters and he didn't mention about fixing any of holes which I found.
So there is possibility that all or some of these holes are still not fixed.

I'm rarely sending advisories about vulnerabilities to Bugtraq. During
2007-2010 I sent only small amount of my advisories to Bugtraq. From the end
of 2006 I was sending all holes (http://securityvulns.ru/source15611.html)
which I found to securityvulns.ru (securityvulns.com) and 3APA3A, admin of
these sites, sometimes sent some of them to Bugtraq. Last month I drew
attention that he didn't write to Bugtraq about all these holes in XAMPP, so
I decided to write about them by myself :-).
