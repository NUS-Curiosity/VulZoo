8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*


8.1. *Excel / Word - OfficeArtSpgr container - invalid recType value
leads to attacker controlled pointer usage [MSRC 9368]*

A vulnerability exists in MSO.DLL affecting Excel 9 (Office 2000) and
Excel 10 (Office XP) in the code responsible for parsing OfficeArtSpgr
(recType 0xF003) containers that allows an attacker to cause a class
pointer to be interpreted incorrectly, leading to code execution in the
context of the currently logged on user.

The precise affected executable version we tested is 'Excel.exe
v10.0.6854' and the DLL is 'mso.dll v10.0.6845'

Likely attack vectors include:

   . Targeted attacks involving e-mailed malicious files combined with
social engineering to entice the user to open the malicious attachment.
   . Targeted attacks involving malicious files hosted on a remote web
site combined with social engineering to entice the user to open the
malicious attachment.

The root cause description of the vulnerability is that there is no
check to make sure that there is a valid group before loading the SPGR
from the file.

A disassembly of the vulnerable code follows:

8.2. *Memory Corruption related to Graphic Description [MSRC case 9562]*

Core Security Technologies reported a second bug in Excel which resulted
non exploitable. In its investigation, MSRC has analyzed BIFF5++, BIFF4,
and BIFF2 file formats for exploitability of this vulnerability. MSRC
has been unable to reproduce it in such a way that an exploitable
condition occurs.

and that they are working on defining a ship date. Microsoft also states
that the bug reported as MSRC case 9154 / CORE-2009-0504 is not
exploitable and no security bulletin will be issued for that case.

. 2009-09-16:
Core notifies the Microsoft team that there has been a misunderstanding,
and that the bug MSRC case 9154 / CORE-2009-0504 was dismissed as not
