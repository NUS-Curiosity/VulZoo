July 13, 2010

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Secure Backup

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
on vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup. Authentication is
required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

The specific flaws exist due to how the application passes CGI
parameters to the internal obtool binary running on port 443. Due to
improper filtering of user data a specially crafted request could lead
to arbitrary commands being executed under the credentials of the
service.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
