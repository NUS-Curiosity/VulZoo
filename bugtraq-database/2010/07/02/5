This field is validated through JavaScript but now I blocked the field so you it only accepts numeric values throu OnKeyDown event, aditionally I added a CDbl() function on the requests of this field in case you have a way to go over the javascript functionality, this should be available in the next patch version 1.91.31, all the older versions should update to this version.
Thanks anyway and let me know if you find anything else....
