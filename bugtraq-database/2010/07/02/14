and management system. In other words, a photo album. It is built with
PHP, MySQL and Perl."


II. VULNERABILITIES
---------------------

VUPEN Web Vulnerability Research Team discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
Zoph.

These issues are caused by input validation errors in various scripts when
processing the "user_name", "title", "called", "email", "dob", 
"middle_name",
"last_name", "first_name", "subject", "message", "photographer_id",
"person_id", "_random", "_rating-op", "rating", "timestamp" and
"_timestamp-op" parameters, which could be exploited to cause arbitrary
scripting code to be executed by the user's browser in the security
context of an affected Web site.
