Subject: IIS5.1 Directory Authentication Bypass by using �:$I30:$Index_Allocation�

Description:
Although IIS5 is very old, finding one is not impossible! Therefore, I want to introduce a technique to bypass the IIS authentication methods on a directory.
This vulnerability is because of using Alternate Data Stream to open a protected folder.
All of IIS authentication methods can be circumvented. In this technique, we can add a �:$i30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION� to a directory name to bypass the authentication.
In a protected folder such as �AuthNeeded� which includes �secretfile.asp�:
It is possible to run �secretfile.asp� by using:
�/AuthNeeded:$i30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION/secretfile.asp�
Instead of:
�/AuthNeeded/secretfile.asp�

More description:
Why IIS6 and 7 are not vulnerable:
- In these versions, IIS does not accept colon (�:�) character from the URL before the querystring.

Why we cannot use �::$Data� in IIS 5.1 anymore:
- IIS rejects the request if its URL contains �::$� (before querystring).

Why IIS5 is vulnerable to �Directory Authentication Bypass� by using �:$I30:$Index_Allocation�:
- IIS only verifies the directory name to check for authentication. Therefore, we can use �http://victim.com/SecretFolder:$I30:$Index_Allocation/� instead of �http://victim.com/SecretFolder� to bypass the authentication.

Is it possible to bypass something else by using �:$I30:$Index_Allocation� on a NTFS partition:
- If a checking is only based on the directory name, it can be bypassed by using this method.
