Summary
=======

The Cisco Internet Streamer application, part of the Cisco Content
Delivery System, contains a directory traversal vulnerability on its web
server component that allows for arbitrary file access. By exploiting
this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to read arbitrary files on
the device, outside of the web server document directory, by using a
specially crafted URL.

An unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this issue to access
sensitive information, including the password files and system logs,
which could be leveraged to launch subsequent attacks.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100721-spcdn.shtml.


Affected Products
=================

All versions of system software on the Cisco Internet Streamer
application are vulnerable prior to the first fixed release.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

To determine the software version running on a Cisco Content Delivery
Engine, log in to the device and issue the "show version" command line
interface (CLI) command to display the system banner. Cisco CDS Internet
Streamer software will identify itself as "Content Delivery System
Software Release". On the same line of output, the version number will
be provided. This example identifies a Cisco Content Delivery Engine
that is running Cisco Content Delivery System software release 2.5.3:

    cdn-cde#show version
    Content Delivery System Software (CDS)
    Copyright  ) 1999-2010 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
    Content Delivery System Software Release 2.5.3 (build b8 Jan 21 2010)
    Version: cde200-2.5.3.8

    Compiled 16:07:11 Jan 21 2010 by ipvbuild
    Compile Time Options: KQ SS

    System was restarted on Thu Jun  3 04:09:25 2010.
    The system has been up for 2 hours, 11 minutes, 27 seconds.

    cdn-cde#

Alternatively the Content Delivery System Manager home page gives a
brief summary of the software versions in use on all the devices in the
content delivery system network.

To view the software version running on a particular device, choose
"Devices > Devices". The Devices Table page displays the software
version for each device listed. For further information on finding the
software version, refer to the "Maintaining the Internet Streamer CDS"
at the following link:

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco Content Delivery Engines running TV streaming content delivery
applications and the Video Navigator Application are not affected.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco Internet Streamer application provides edge caching, content
streaming, and downloads to subscriber IP devices such as PCs.

The Cisco Internet Streamer application, part of the Cisco Content
Delivery System, contains a directory traversal vulnerability on its web
server component that allows for arbitrary file access. It is possible
to read arbitrary files on the Cisco Content Delivery Engine running
the internet streamer application outside the web server's document
directory using a specially-crafted URL. This includes the password
files used to hold admin account details and system logs.

An unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this issue to access
sensitive information that could be leveraged to launch subsequent
attacks.

This vulnerability can be exploited over all open HTTP ports; TCP ports
80 (Default HTTP port), 443 (Default HTTPS port) and 8090 (Alternate
HTTP and HTTPS port), as well as those that are configured as part of
the HTTP proxy.

In Cisco content delivery system software 2.5.3 and earlier, it is
possible to configure "Enable Incoming Proxy", which when enabled,
accepts incoming requests on configured ports, in addition to TCP
port 80. The additional ports that the device will listen on for
HTTP requests is defined in the "List of Incoming HTTP Ports" field,
within "Devices > Devices > Application Control > Web > HTTP > HTTP
Connections" of the content delivery system manager menu. For further
information on HTTP settings, refer to the "Cisco Internet Streamer CDS
2.5 Software Configuration Guide - Configuring Devices" at the following
link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/video/cds/cda/is/2_5/configuration_guide/configdevice.html.

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug ID CSCtd68063 and
has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2010-1577.

Workarounds
===========

Service Rules
+------------

As an interim step prior to upgrading the Cisco content delivery system
software, it is possible to deny access to sensitive directories via
service rules. The following example shows denying access to move up a
directory level. This also caters for other directory moves, such as
"\.\./", ".\./" or "\../":

    rule enable
    rule action block pattern-list 1
    rule pattern-list 1 url-regex ^http://.*/../.*
    rule pattern-list 1 url-regex ^https://.*/../.*

For more information on configuring service rules and for instructions
on how to perform this via the content delivery system manager, consult
