Subject: Re: ZDI-10-121: Command Injection Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability

Is the affected product Secure Backup accidentally missing from the subject line and the advisory title,
i.e. the correct title is Oracle Secure Backup Administration selector Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability?
