The Metasploit Project is proud to announce the release of the
Metasploit Framework version 3.4.1.  As always, you can get it from
our downloads page, for Windows, Linux or as an OS-independent
tarball.  This release sees the first official non-Windows Meterpreter
payload, in PHP as discussed last month
(http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/06/meterpreter-for-pwned-home-pages.html).
 Rest assured that more is in store for Meterpreter on other
platforms.  A new extension called Railgun is now integrated into
Meterpreter courtesy of Patrick HVE, giving you scriptable access to
Windows APIs and an unprecedented amount of control over
post-exploitation.  For those of you wishing to contribute to the
framework, a new file called HACKING has been introduced that lays out
a few guidelines for making it easier.

This release has 16 new exploits, 22 new auxiliary modules and 11 new
Meterpreter scripts for your pwning enjoyment.  For more in-depth
information about this release, see the 3.4.1 release notes at
