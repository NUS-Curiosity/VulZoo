Subject: New Varient Of Irc Worm Spreading


Hi All,
	A new varient of the recent worm that exploits the recent IE exploit has 
surfaced. This time instead of a link to supposed Britney Spears picture, it 
links to a supposed Jessica Alba picture. The url has hit "bandwidth 
exceeded", and this will hopefully stop the spreading. It appears to have hit 
the gaming [irc] networks also, which is attracting alot of clicks.
