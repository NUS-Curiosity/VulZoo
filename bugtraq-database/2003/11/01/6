http://webpages.charter.net/divx/win.exe

seems to be the trojan going around, one of my honeypots was milked for
honey for 3 hours on the ircd irc.buz.net channel #kyjelly key "key is the
key"
seems someone by the nick "netwolf" has created his own ircd for his drones
to ddos. please use the URL with EXTREAM caution as it loads
a ddos trojan and spybot to log all keystrokes. anyone who can reverse
engineer the .exe give it a go.

Sincerly,
