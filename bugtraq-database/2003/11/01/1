In-Reply-To: <20031031151823.26363.qmail@...www1-symnsj.securityfocus.com>

it seems that this worm attempts to launch a Denial of Service Attack by sending a large amount of data to known servers (port 80 / ICMP). The worm verifies that a connection is active by contacting google.com, then the DoS is launched against "darkprofits" domains (marketing operation ?)

Due to an increased rate of submissions Symantec Security Response has upgraded W32.Mimail.C@mm to a Category 3 threat from a Category 2 threat.
