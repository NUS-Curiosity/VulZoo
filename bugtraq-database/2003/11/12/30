It is extremely important to point out that DeCSS, or any other decryption
software, does not "permit" the copying of a protected DVD any more than the
gas pedal on your car "permits" you to speed.  DeCSS has nothing to do with
the ability to copy a DVD, but affects the ability to view the DVD on an
operating system other than what was originally intended.

In fact, I can copy DVDs to my hard drive all day long, without any special
hardware or software - all I have to do is open Windows Explorer, select the
DVD-ROM drive, and drag-and-drop all those nice big .vob files to my hard
drive.  If I want to burn those files to another DVD, nothing prevents me
from doing so, and certainly not CSS.  I could burn 100 copies of my brand
new Terminator 3 DVD, and CSS has nothing to do with it.

I would think this point would be obvious, but you'd be surprised how often
I've had to point this out to talk show hosts.
