I don't consider the web/mail/ftp servers, windows managers, browsers, mail 
clients etc. to be part of the operating system, per se.

Certainly a vulnerability in Apache should not be a strike against Linux, 
should it?

I like how the article quoted Steve Ballmer comparing Windows 2000 Server and 
W2K3 Server with Red Hat 6. Why doesn't Ballmer compare the state of the art 
Windows OS' available at the time RH6 came out? Did Windows NT 4 not stack up 
as well against RH6 as W2K/3?
