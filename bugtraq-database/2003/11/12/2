Subject: MS03-048: Thor and unpatched?


Where are Thor and his web page

  http://www.PivX.com/larholm/unpatched/

when we need them? The cumulative IE patch MS03-048 is out, and we would
like to know what is fixed and what remains.

(Is it known what http://www.pivx.com/qwikfix/ does? Will it remain free?
Is "Mocrosoft" a mis-spelling or some joke?)

Cheers,
