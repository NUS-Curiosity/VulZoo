Subject: Six Step IE Remote Compromise Cache Attack




Six Step IE Remote Compromise Cache Attack
 

[tested]
OS:WinXp
Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.Sp1; up-to-date on 2003/10/30

[Overview]

A six step cache attack has been found which allows for remote 
compromise of systems running Internet Explorer merely by viewing 
a webpage.

This attack is possible partly because of the bugs in Internet 
Explorer which remain unfixed. The oldest of these bugs is 
almost two years old. 

A little something old. A little something new. 

Some Kung Fu.


[demo]

The below demo runs a harmless, demonstration executable on your system.
http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/execdror5/execdror5-MyPage.htm

Note: This demo has not been found to work on all systems. This seems 
to be primarily because of the wide divergence in the placement of temp 
folders. A more universal exploit is possible, but too time consuming.

[technical details]
a simple game - It goes a little something like this... 
 

Liu Die Yu's file-protocol proxy bug to reach MYCOMPUTER zone
("file-protocol proxy" *http://safecenter.net/liudieyu/WsOpenFileJPU/WsOpenFileJPU-Content.HTM) 

then, in MYCOMPUTER zone:
A. use IFRAME to load MHT file which contains payload EXE, then the MHT 
file is stored in IE cache.

B.1. use file:///::{450D8FBA-AD25-11D0-98A8-0800361B1103} to get %USERPROFILE%;
(the Pull's: http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/securityfocus/bugtraq/2002-01/0013.html )

B.2. use "Redirection and Refresh in Iframe parses local file" to parse 
cache index file:
%USERPROFILE%/Local Settings/Temporay Internet Files/CONTENT.IE5/INDEX.DAT
( Mindwarper of mlsecurity's: http://www.mlsecurity.com/ie/ie.htm) 
double slash trick is also needed to make the parsed document accessible. 
( Liu Die Yu's: http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/DblSlashForCache/DblSlashForCache-Content.htm) 

C.1. and we get random directory names(like 9OKV91KH), and we get all possible URLs of our payload EXE.
C.2. and we check these URLs with "script src":
(Tom Micklovitch's: http://jscript.dk/Jumper/xploit/scriptsrc.html) 

D. when we get a valid local URL pointing to the payload, launch it with 
CODEBASE plus "double slash"
( Liu Die Yu's: http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/DblSlashForCache/DblSlashForCache-Content.htm) 

 

A little complex. A little simple. 

Kung Fu.

[Workaround]

Move your Temporary Internet Files from its' default location:
Tools -> Internet Options -> Temporary Internet Files -> Settings -> Move Folder
