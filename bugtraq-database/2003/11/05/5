Subject: IE: double slash moves cache from INTERNET zone to MYCOMPUTER zone




double slash moves cache from INTERNET zone to MYCOMPUTER zone
("that's all" is the end of file if you are in a hurry)

[tested]
OS:WinXp
Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.Sp1; up-to-date on 2003/10/30

[technical detail]
copy an EXE file to your cache directory:
[SysDrive]:\Documents and Settings\[user_name]\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\EXE.EXE
then try to use CODEBASE trick to execute that file (refer to http://continue.to/trie --> "codebase local path"), you'll get an error message.
however set CODEBASE to:
[SysDrive]:\\Documents and Settings\[user_name]\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\EXE.EXE
(double slash after [SysDrive])
EXE.EXE in cache directory will be executed.

conclusion:
[SysDrive]:\Documents and Settings\[user_name]\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\
is treated in INTERNET zone.
but
[SysDrive]:\\Documents and Settings\[user_name]\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\
is treated in MYCOMPUTER zone.

that's all.

of course, it's added to "Unpatched IE Bugs" list maintained by me. here: http://continue.to/trie
