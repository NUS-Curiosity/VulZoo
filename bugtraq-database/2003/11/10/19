Tap, Type, or Scan-Maximum Versatility in a Portable Data Terminal 
The PDT 8100 Series from Symbol Technologies bridges the gap between pure pen-based and key-based mobile data collection solutions. The first Pocket PC device available with multiple keyboard options, the PDT 8100 is a versatile, large-screen handheld that delivers the functionality of Pocket PC with the convenience of tactile, key-based data entry.

Problem: 
During installation, if the default WiFI keys and shared secret are not changed:
A) they can be retrieved by end user
B) used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to wireless network

Symbol Access PDT 8100 hides existing WEP keys so that users cannot view them IF AND ONLY IF YOU CHANGE THE DEFAULTS.  This is not a design flaw but rather a feature in the PDT 8100 that is used ONLY during initial setup to facilitate connection to client's Wireless gateways.  Where the vulnerability exists is if during installation, these keys are not changed.  If not changed, the PDT 8100 will reveal them to any user in plain text by taping on the wireless icon on lower right hand of 8100 and scrolling to the 'encryption tab'.  A stolen PDT 8100 or copied keys can allow an insider the ability to totally compromise the WiFi network.  Unchanged factory default keys are published and should not be used past initial testing or on a live network.  Tested on model 8146-T2B940US

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CAN-2003-0934 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for security problems.

Vendor Response: 
November 10, 2003:
Vendor was extremely helpful and confirmed what the default keys were, and that changing the default keys would hide them from user. Symbol Technologies continues to work with Wifi standards and security groups to improve both the user experience and the security of their products and has upgraded and updated both their software and firmware to keep up with the latest security requirements.  Symbol Technologies recommends (in their installation manuals and guides) that all default passwords and keys be changed during installation.

Exploit: 
A user just needs to clone the Wifi keys, shared secret, MAX address and SSID to be able to have unauthorized access to the client's network.

Solution: 
The installer or client needs to change both the shared secret and the Wifi Keys.
