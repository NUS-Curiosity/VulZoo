You can via GPO in AD 2k or 2003. To set an IE GPO in 2k:

Start>Programs>Administrative Tools>Active Directory Users and Computers
>[OU Name]>Rt-click>Properties>|Group Policy|New|Edit:

>User Configuration>Windows Settings>Internet Explorer
Maintenance>Security
>dbl-click 'Security Zones and Content Ratings' and select 'Import
Current
Security Zones' and then click |Modify Settings|.

note: you can't set a GPO on a CN; has to be an OU.

If you are looking for a programmatic solution, you could use ADSI and
script
your own enterprise-wide settings/changes. You can do about anything
with
Windows you want through ADSI using VB Script, Perl, or anything else it
supports. Of course if you're using AD I think using a GPO is simplest.
