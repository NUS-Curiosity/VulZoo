The InvisiLAN technique is an instance of what I called "interface 
permutation" in this paper:

    Techniques".  Crispin Cowan, Heather Hinton, Calton Pu, and Jonathan

The specific approach of IP address hopping was described in this DARPA 
experiment:

In the DARPA experiment anyway, it turned out to be hackable :) More 
precisely, it imposed a delay on the attacker, but did not stop them. A 
notable difference is that the DARPA experiment only changed the IP 
address, and not the MAC address. I'm not convinced that this will make 
a difference, but it could.
