Who these people are? ;-)

The term "open source" has been understood to mean "comes with source code"
long before people try to humpty-dumpty-tise it. Just like "free software"
does not necessarily mean "GPL software".

I happen to give away some open source (comes with source code) free
software (comes with few restrictions). Personally I couldn't care less if
it is "Open Source" or "Free Software".
