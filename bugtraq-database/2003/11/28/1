That's an incorrect usage of the open source term. I quote the Open Source
Definition ( http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php ):

"1. Free Redistribution

The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the
software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing
programs from several different sources.

[...]

6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a
specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from
being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research."

The tools sound interesting, but I just wanted to point out that the license
to InlineEgg is not an open source license. You can read more about this at
http://www.opensource.org/ .
