I don't think anybody said a linux box can't be owned with an apache
flaw. My arugemnt for count of bugs is the should be counted against the
people who actually WROTE the code. In Microsofts case it is becasue
they wrote IIS, 2000/XP/2003, and Exchange. In contrast the Linux kernel
projecn that just wrote the kernel. It sounds like you want a list of
opensource bugs vs. Microsoft Bugs.

No one is saying this. To be truely useful a list of bugs should be done
by developer, not by instance of software. This will help establish
trends in my software development practices.

I think blaming OS developers for code they didn't write nor have any
control over isn't unbiased. It would be a diffrent story if it was a
flaw in something like redhat-update. That is clearly a Redhat bug, but
that is still not a Linux bug.
