Of course it should.  You don't just "run an OS". Obviously, you
want your machine to actually do something useful.

Granted, you shouldn't count bugs in every single piece of 
linux/bsd software, the same way you shouldn't count bugs in
every piece of windows software out there, but counting bugs in 
the most commonly used ones is most certainly reasonable.

Well, that is, unless you restrict the bug count to only bugs 
in core OS functionality in _both_ cases, but, as I said, that's
not a very meaningful study.

(Note this is does _not_ mean that I think that Linux + popular
 software has more bugs than Windows + popular software.)

Agree fully.
