If it's a common enough app to count, its vulnerability count
should of course be included in both totals.  That was my point.

I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the script kiddies don't care
about zealotry. I have yet to hear one say "Oh, this is a Linux
box, so I can't use this Apache bug to own it. That'd be rong."

If I expose N attack vectors, I want the vulnerability counts for 
all those vectors nicely summed up for platform options A, B and 
C before I choose which platform to use.

Saying "the linux kernel has only foo bugs while every microsoft
app combined has foo^3 bugs" makes no sense in a security 
discussion. You don't read mail or serve web pages with a kernel.


Again, I suspect we're in violent agreement of the platform of
choice for all relevant areas of use, but I prefer to make my 
choices on _relevant_ facts, and so, I suspect, does the 
majority of security-conscious people.  

Publishing an _unbiased_ report of total vulnerability counts 
for two or more OSes, with common apps installed, is a service
to admins everywhere.  (And no, I _really_ don't think comparing 
RH6 with W2K3 is "unbiased". I think it stinks.)
