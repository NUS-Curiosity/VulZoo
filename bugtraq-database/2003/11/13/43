Hello Jason,

I'll start by saying that you're not in any way obligated to reply and I
really don't care one way or the other as it's clear that you believe
that your opinion is the only correct one and that I must have been
"assimilated" by the "Evil Empire" that is Microsoft.

The fact that you're a published writer in no way validates your
statements about Microsoft, my employment or any inter-relationship
therein and you would do well to leave that garbage out of any continued
discussion.

Your statement about "until you've published ..blah" is irrelevant to
the discussion at hand.  The document you linked is more opinion than
fact and very nearly invalidates any technical value the remainder of
the book might have had otherwise.

As I said before; it's a shame that you had to present your research
this way; any technical value is lost in the screams of
"EEEEEEeeeeeeevil!"

Aloha, Jim.

What in particular makes it "immediately clear" to you why it was never
published? Not publishing the book saves Microsoft from sending out 
conflicting messages when they launch new deceptive advertising 
campaigns like this one that will assert that Windows poses less of a 
security risk than does Linux:

http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/11/11/HNmsassault_1.html

I can assure you the introduction to my book was written when preparing
the book for self-publication as a free electronic work and nothing that
even closely resembles such direct and harsh criticism of Microsoft was
to be found in the manuscript sans-Introduction as submitted to
Microsoft for publication. Read a little more of the book if you'd like
to get some idea of the prevailing tone and mood, which is nothing short
of practical and optimistic.

I realized that I had been seriously mistaken in my belief that it was
reasonable and respectable to give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt
and engage in commercial activities that support their abusive
behaviors. Thus I consciously and intentionally changed the tone of my
Introduction so that there could be no mistake as to my conclusions; the
helpful and technically-accurate Microsoft technical material that I've
authored notwithstanding. Just because I know about and have written
about Microsoft products that does not mean that I support what they do
and how they do it. You might reconsider the way that you portray your
support for them, yourself, as part of your professional work.

If you would like to debate my assertions, feel free to write back.

Microsoft must be stopped. They are harmful and malicious. If you had a
little more awareness of what they are and have been doing, and why,
then I am certain you would be ashamed to have Microsoft decorations
after your name. You realize, don't you, that you can be competent and
have skills that are in-demand in the marketplace and still not be a
Microsoft crony? You are aligning yourself with the wrong side when you
lend PR/marketing/emotional support to Microsoft and its victims. Don't
forget that the people you choose to support says a lot about who you
are and why you do the things that you do... Reconsider supporting
Microsoft; you can make a nice living and hold your certifications
without aiding and abetting or lending solace to evildoers.

After you write a book about Microsoft security and work for a while in
computer forensics, talk to me again about whether or not your silent
and tacit support for the company and its bad people sits well in your
stomach.

Sincerely,

Jason
