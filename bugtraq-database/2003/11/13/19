Subject: Corsaire Security Advisory: PeopleSoft PeopleBooks Search CGI multiple argument issues



-- Corsaire Security Advisory --

Title: PeopleSoft PeopleBooks Search CGI multiple argument issues
Date: 04.07.03
Application: PeopleTools 8.20/8.43 and prior
Environment: Various
Author: Martin O'Neal [martin.oneal@...saire.com]
Audience: General distribution
Reference: c030704-010


-- Scope --

The aim of this document is to clearly define several issues in the 
argument handling functionality of the PeopleSoft PeopleBooks Search CGI 
application, as supplied by PeopleSoft Ltd. [1]. 


-- History --

Discovered: 01.07.03 (Martin O'Neal)
Vendor notified: 04.07.03 
Document released: 12.11.03


-- Overview --

The PeopleSoft PeopleBooks component provides a CGI based search 
application as part of the default installation. Several of the 
attributes that are passed into the CGI application allow the 
specification of a server-side path. By entering various path values 
into this argument it is possible to:

- Access arbitrary files outside of the web servers document root.
- Cause a Denial of Services (DoS) on the web server host.


-- Analysis --

The Search CGI application (psdoccgi.exe) is used within the PeopleBooks 
online documentation. This application accepts two arguments, headername 
and footername, that allow the selection of header and footer content to 
be returned as part of the search results HTML page.

These arguments appear to be checked for basic formatting issues, 
however it is still possible to access files outside of the web server 
root, such as configuration files, that may contain passwords or other 
confidential information.


-- Recommendations --

PeopleSoft have released details of this and other issues under security 
rollup vulnerability ID 20031112, which is available to registered users 
from the PeopleSoft support site [2].

PeopleSoft recommends that customers address the vulnerability by 
applying the following fixes available on PeopleSoft Customer 
Connection. 

   Release   Patch
   8.18      8.18.15
   8.19      8.19.12
   8.20      8.20.03 
   8.42      8.42.14 
   8.43      8.43.11

For those who can not implement the patches promptly, as a mitigating 
strategy a firewall or other HTTP filtering device can be used to block 
queries containing sensitive strings, or as a last resort all access to 
the PeopleSoft application can be disabled in entirety.
