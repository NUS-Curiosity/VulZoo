Subject: Re: Microsoft prepares security assault on Linux


Aloha, Russ!

Honey attracts ants, and they're much harder to get rid of than are
flies. Ants also set into motion that whole food web thing, bringing in
larger and larger pests over time.

You should allocate a few more CPU cycles to understanding the real
reason that Microsoft has been nice to you over the years. They want
something in return. They allow you your little tantrums now and then
because they really don't have any effect on their bottom line, and
remember the old adage "there's no such thing as negative publicity."

Microsoft needs you to keep churning out Microsoft-brand information.
The more times Microsoft's products are mentioned, the better. You're
part of the media and from what I can tell that's how they've always
perceived you -- have they ever perceived you as a developer/book
author/technical writer/purchasing agent/distributor/business
partner/other for-profit commercial entity?

I'm amazed at the degree and scope of thought control that Microsoft has
succeeded in creating. Certain tried, tested, and proven thought
processes from the information security field are killed as soon as they
appear, even outside Microsoft, because they pose real threats to the
viability of a company in denial. It is no different from any substance
abusing/alcoholic family with the pink elephant in the living room.

Sincerely,

Jason

Its their audience, write it for yourself, publish it yourself (as you've done.) That they thought it wasn't going to be profitable (from a publishing perspective) doesn't necessarily mean Microsoft is trying to "suppress awareness of vulnerabilities", it could just mean they didn't think it would sell.
