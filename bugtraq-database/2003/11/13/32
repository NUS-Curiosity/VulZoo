I think it is unfair to categorize linux or windows as having a vulnerability just because an application like apache has a vulnerability. I mean as someone stated earlier, the linux and windows developers have no control over third-party apps. If IIS has bug, that should look bad on microsoft, but not on windows.

Ballmer is banking that the people he is talking to do not understand the difference between linux, its distro and windows, this truly comparing apples and oranges. You know what, he is going to get away with it, because most people don't understand.
If you were to compare a full redhat 9 install against a full win2k server install, redhat9 would most likely lose, because Redhat9 has  many more apps, therefore it is more likely to have bugs. Even if you compared linux, which would be just the kernel and maybe some of the the gnu tools to interact with the kernel vs windows, it is still not fair. Windows has a kernel, gui, everyone's favorite user space app that can not be uninstalled, IE. In this case windows has greater chance of having bugs.

Then you have cases with distro specific bugs, which often are categorized as a linux bug. An example of this was the apache config file bug on redhat from last week. That is a redhat bug, not a linux bug, nor is it an apache bug. Slackware did not put that configuration in their apache server configuration.

Another comparison that I abhor, is the stability issue. "Linux is more stable than windows". Are you talking about linux with the gui, or without. Running linux without the gui is incredibly stable. Linux with a gui, well stability defintely decreases (but in reality it is not linux's stability in question rather that of the gui). 

What about openbsd (dont get me wrong I love openbsd), they claim "Only one remote hole in the default install, in more than 7 years!". Well of course, have you ever installed openbsd using the default? The only remotely accessible service is openssh, vs multiple services in a redhat default vs multiple services in a windows default install. I could make my own linux distro with no remote services enabled by default and it would never have a remote hole in the default install.

My point being is that it is very hard to compare the bsds, the distros and windows. Bsds and linux are easier to compare, but then you have the distro aspect.

As far as patches getting out, I am very happy with the response from the open source community, I think they do an excellent job. I very rarely have a problem with an opensource patch, if the author does not come out with a patch, more than likely someone who has reviewed the code will.
