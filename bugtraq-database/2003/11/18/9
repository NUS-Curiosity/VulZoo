once again i am honored to present you a generic and robust way to own
OpenBSD 2.x-3.x, enjoy ;)

     005: RELIABILITY FIX: November 4, 2003

     a specially crafted binary with an invalid header.
     A source code patch exists which remedies the problem.


reliability ??? ehh ;-P yeah yeah right!
