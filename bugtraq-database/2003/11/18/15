Subject: Re: Security researchers organization



Thor and Russ,

Adam Shostack and I have been thinking about a researchers'
organization for a while, too.  We thought that an important first
step would be to host a vulnerability research workshop that would
discuss many of the key issues facing researchers, including the needs
for a researcher-focused organization.  It does seem like its time has
come.  We wanted the organization (and the workshop) to be open to all
vulnerability researchers - individuals and groups, commercial and
otherwise.

We got as far as setting up a program committee of 10 well-known
members, and we discussed an agenda and a Call For Papers, and
approximate dates and locations.  However, due to other commitments,
we missed an opportunity to co-locate with the upcoming Disclosure
conference at Stanford, and we have not made any subsequent plans.

Adam and I, and I'm sure others in the program committee, would be
happy to follow up with you on this.  I would provide specific names,
but since the committee has not been active since April, the status of
some of the participants may have changed since then.

- Steve
