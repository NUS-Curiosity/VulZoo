You are correct neither bluesniff or btscanner attempt to tranfer files
over OBEX at the moment, but they do identify bluetooth devices running
OBEX services. Once you have identified the device you can use tools such
as "obexftp-0.10.4" for Linux or "obexapp" on FreeBSD to GET or PUT files
over Bluetooth to a vulnerable device.

Get them to have a look at http://www.oook.cz/bsd/bluetooth.html
