	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	bind
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		VU#734644 CAN-2003-0914
Date:			Mon Oct 27 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-024-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  A vulnerability has been found in BIND that ".. allows an attacker to
  conduct cache poisoning attacks on vulnerable name servers by
  convincing the servers to retain invalid negative responses."

  Our bind-8.2.3-3.3_imnx_5 packages fix this problem using a patch
  derived from the BIND 8.3.7 release. This vulnerability has been named
  CAN-2003-0914 by the CVE project.

  We'd like to apologize to our US subscribers for the incredibly poor
  timing, to release this notice a day before the Thanksgiving holiday.
  Our options were limited by ISC, the package maintainer.
