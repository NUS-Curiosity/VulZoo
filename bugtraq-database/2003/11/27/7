Dear Atsushi,

Thank you for your interest in InvisiLan technology. Regarding the hackchallenge; 
due to practical reasons (we are in the process of creating a proper demo-space in 
Amsterdam) we have decided to postpone the event.

We would like to make very clear that in the meantime anyone who wants to do a 
live on-site test is more than welcome. Further enquiries can be made through <
hackchallenge@...rkey.org>

Furthermore we would like to point out that InvisiLAN technology  has no relation 
whatsoever with DHCP, for example InvisiLAN changes randomly not just the IP 
address but also the MAC address and the port numbers.

We understand that the claim of unhackability is a steep one but I can assure you 
that anyone who has tested the system in the past has been swept away by the 
effectiveness and the implications of this new technology. 

Best regards,

Julian Wynnne
