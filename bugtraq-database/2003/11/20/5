GLSA:        200311-02
package:     net-www/opera
summary:     Buffer overflows in Opera 7.11 and 7.20
severity:    high
Gentoo bug:  31775
date:        2003-11-19
CVE:         CAN-2003-0870
exploit:     local / remote
affected:    =7.11
affected:    =7.20
fixed:       >=7.21

DESCRIPTION:

The Opera browser can cause a buffer allocated on the heap to overflow under
certain HREFs when rendering HTML. The mail system is also deemed vulnerable
and an attacker can send an email containing a malformed HREF, or plant the
malicious HREF on a web site.

Please see http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/a102003-1.txt for
further details.

SOLUTION:

Users are encouraged to perform an 'emerge --sync' and upgrade the package to
the latest available version. Opera 7.22 is recommended as Opera 7.21 is
vulnerable to other security flaws. Specific steps to upgrade:

emerge --sync
emerge '>=net-www/opera-7.22'
emerge clean
