its welchia/nachi. when it can't connect via 135/tcp, it will attempt an
exploit against a webdav server (see MS03-007).

i've seen an uptick in this in the past couple of days, too, visible on a
few httpd servers i track. and i, too, was caught off guard until someone
pointed out it was nachi to me. digging into the tech details showed that
i (and many of us) had been overlooking a secondary attack.
