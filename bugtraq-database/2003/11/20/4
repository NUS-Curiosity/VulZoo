             DATE : Tue Oct 28 16:43:46 UTC 2003
          EXPLOIT : local
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <apache-1.3.29

              CVE : CAN-2003-0542 (under review at time of GLSA)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quote from <http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/Announcement>:

   This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release.
   A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.  Of
   particular note is that 1.3.29 addresses and fixes 1 potential
   security issue:

     o CAN-2003-0542 (cve.mitre.org)
       Fix buffer overflows in mod_alias and mod_rewrite which occurred if
       one configured a regular expression with more than 9 captures.

   We consider Apache 1.3.29 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.


SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-misc/apache 1.x upgrade:

emerge sync
emerge -pv apache
emerge '>=net-www/apache-1.3.29'
emerge clean
/etc/init.d/apache restart


// end
