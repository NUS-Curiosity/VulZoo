I am now seeing these as well, I believe this is something new as I have

Conversation: Router Worm?
Subject: RE: Router Worm?

  I've never seen it do that, in the about 50 or so instances
I've encountered.  Does it only do it occasionally?  Does it
attack the same host against which 135/tcp failed, or some
random third party?
  (Does it, perhaps, distinguish between 135/tcp "failed to 
connect" and 135/tcp "connected, but target was patched and
so could not be infected"?)
