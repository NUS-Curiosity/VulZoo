	You might have considered looking at the following document,
	as it properly describes the true threat model to the DNS
	as it currently stands.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the DNS Extensions Working Group of the IETF.

        Title           : Threat Analysis Of The Domain Name System
        Author(s)       : D. Atkins, R. Austein
        Filename        : draft-ietf-dnsext-dns-threats-04.txt
        Pages           : 15
        Date            : 2003-10-27

Although the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) have been under
development for most of the last decade, the IETF has never written
down the specific set of threats against which DNSSEC is designed to
protect.  Among other drawbacks, this cart-before-the-horse situation
has made it difficult to determine whether DNSSEC meets its design
goals, since its design goals are not well specified.  This note
attempts to document some of the known threats to the DNS, and, in
doing so, attempts to measure to what extent (if any) DNSSEC is a
useful tool in defending against these threats.
