Hello Lists,

We have recently concluded a comprehensive audit of the Applied Watch
Command Center, which resulted with the discovering of hundreds of
vulnerabilities.

This is the first of many future advisories on the IDS suite, which
discusses two remote issues in the authentication mechanisms used.

Working proof-of-concept code is included.

There is currently no patch available from the vendor, so consider the
Threatcon[1] to be higher than normal.

Please see the attached advisory for more information.
