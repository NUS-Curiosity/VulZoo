Subject: Pieterpost - access to "vitual" account


Hello bugtraq readers and writers !

name: PieterPost 0.10.6
homepage: http://todsah.nihilist.nl/index.php?p=Development/Projects/Pieterpost
about: "PieterPost is a webbased interface to a pop3 mailbox. It is designed to be
           both small and easy to use"

what: entering url http://server.com/pp.php?action=login anyone can get access
         to "virtual" account.

 I don't think that can be a big vuln, but at this moment anyone can send spam
from such server and fake e-mail's. This work only with default configuration
(localhost as pop3 server) and weak MTA agent - posible to change From header
sending from localhost.
