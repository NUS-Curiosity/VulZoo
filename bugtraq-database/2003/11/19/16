Subject: Re: IA WebMail 3.x PoC Code




Hello again,

I'm afraid that I have had a couple of reports which state that the
Proof of Concept code which I have written for IA WebMail does not work.

This is often due to the fact that I close the socket immediately as the 
malicious data is sent, and so the server does not follow the sequence
of events needed to execute the code.

Please would you either insert a:

  sleep(5);

Before the line:

  close($victim);

This should solve the problem.

The new code can be downloaded intact from:

Thank you for reading this,
-Peter Winter-Smith
