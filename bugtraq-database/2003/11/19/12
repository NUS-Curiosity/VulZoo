=======================================================
  HPUX dtmailpr buffer overflow vulnerability
======================================================= 

Davide Del Vecchio Adv#8

Discovered in: 14/07/2003
Date: 19/11/2003
Tested on HP-UX B.11.00 


Description:

  The dtmailpr program reads a filename (which contains one or more mail
  messages from mailx or dtmail ), and sends the message to standard out
  with headers abbreviated and attachments removed.  If no filename argument   
  is provided dtmailpr reads from standard in.

dante@...ficino :/usr/dt/bin >ls -al /usr/dt/bin/dtmailpr
 -r-xr-sr-x   1 bin        mail        339968 Sep 11  2001 dtmailpr


Exporting the DISPLAY variable with a long argument...

dante@...ficino :/usr/dt/bin >export DISPLAY="`perl -e 'printf "A" x 9777'`"
dante@...ficino :/usr/dt/bin >/usr/dt/bin/dtmailpr
Memory fault

From gdb output we could see the program received signal SIGSEGV,
and then it segfaults.

Solution: 

I'm in contact with HP's Security staff, especially with John Morris,
and I would like to thanks him and all his staff for the interest
demonstrated during this period of research on HP-UX.
He assured me a patch has been written and an Official Security Bullettin
will follow my advisory.

Davide Del Vecchio would like to thank all the people supporting him
and his research, Diego Fuggetta, Filippo Sismondo, Carlo Martini,
Giorgio Vitelli, Davide Zanella, his love that never leaves him alone,
and obvious, the HP-UX security staff, impersonified in this case by
John Morris. 

My sadness for the victims of the war in Iraq is as big as my desire to
understand why this war started. Repose in peace.
