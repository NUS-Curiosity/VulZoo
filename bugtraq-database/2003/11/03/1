Subject: [BUGZILLA] Security Advisory - SQL injection, information leak


Bugzilla Security Advisory

November 2, 2003

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, currently used by a large
number of software projects.

This advisory covers security bugs that have recently been discovered
and fixed in the Bugzilla code: two instances of arbitrary SQL injection
exploitable only by a privileged user, one instance where a privileged
user may retain privileges that should have been removed, and two
instances of unprivileged access to summaries of restricted data.

These bugs are not considered critical, since their impact is quite
limited. Nevertheless, all Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade
to the latest stable version of Bugzilla, 2.16.4, which was released
today.

Development snapshots prior to version 2.17.5 are also affected, so if
you are using a development snapshot, you should obtain a newer one
(2.17.5) or use CVS to update.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
-------
Class:       SQL injection (by privileged user only)
Versions:    2.16.3 and earlier (2.17.1 and up are not affected)
Description: A user with 'editproducts' privileges (i.e. usually an
             administrator) can select arbitrary SQL to be run by the
             nightly statistics cron job (collectstats.pl), by giving a
             product a special name.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214290

Issue 2
-------
Class:       SQL injection (by privileged user only)
Versions:    2.16.3 and earlier, 2.17.1 through 2.17.4
Description: A user with 'editkeywords' privileges (i.e. usually an
             administrator) can inject arbitrary SQL via the URL used to
             edit an existing keyword.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219044

Issue 3
-------
Class:       Privilege mishandling
Versions:    2.16.3 and earlier (2.17.1 and up are not affected)
Description: When deleting products and the 'usebuggroups' parameter is
             on, the privilege which allows someone to add people to the
             group which is being deleted does not get removed, allowing
             people with that privilege to get that privilege for the
             next group that is created which reuses that group ID.
             Note that this only allows someone who had been granted
             privileges in the past to retain them.

Issue 4
-------
Class:       Information leak
Versions:    2.16.3 and earlier, 2.17.1 through 2.17.4
Description: If you know the email address of someone who has voted on a
             secure bug, you can access the summary of that bug even if
             you do not have sufficient permissions to view the bug
             itself.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209376

Issue 5
-------
Class:       Information leak
Versions:    2.17.3 and 2.17.4 only
Description: Under some circumstances, a user can obtain component
             descriptions for a product to which he does not normally
             have access.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209742
