Synopsis:          Updated CUPS packages fix denial of service
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:275-01
Issue date:        2003-11-03
Updated on:        2003-11-03
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:

Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0788
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated CUPS packages that fix a problem where CUPS can hang are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

CUPS is a print spooler.

Paul Mitcheson reported a situation where the CUPS Internet Printing
Protocol (IPP) implementation in CUPS versions prior to 1.1.19 would get
into a busy loop.  This could result in a denial of service.  In order to
exploit this bug an attacker would need to have the ability to make a TCP
connection to the IPP port (by default 631). 

Users of CUPS are advised to install these updated packages, which contain
a backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.

These packages also fix a problem with the LPD backend that could cause
jobs to be repeated.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

97958 - IPP at 100% processor doing nothing useful.
107256 - duplicated printing
