Subject: New version of ike-scan (IPsec IKE scanner) available - v1.5.1


ike-scan v1.5.1 has been released.  There are many changes from the last
official release which was v1.2.  In summary, the changes are:

a) More IKE backoff patterns which allows more systems to be fingerprinted;
b) More flexible backoff pattern specification which allows systems with 
more complex backoff patterns to be fingerprinted;
c) Ability to specify arbitrary Vendor ID payloads.  Multiple Vendor ID 
payloads may be specified;
d) ike-scan will display any Vendor ID payload that it receives from the 
VPN servers;
e) Ability to specify multiple custom transforms;
f) Ability to specify key-length for variable length ciphers (e.g. AES);
g) Support for Aggressive Mode in addition to Main Mode;
h) UDP packet-sending engine improvements which allow more accurate packet 
timing; and
i) Created ike-scan man page.

For details of the changes, please read the ChangeLog and NEWS files in the
