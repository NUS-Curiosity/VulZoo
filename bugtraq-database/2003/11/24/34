your process most likely gets killed because of a resource limit.  check 
ulimit.  gedit grows to over 300mb rss with that file as input and seems 
to stay occupied with running whatever suboptimal algorithms it has for 
that special case.  clearly it's not the proper tool to operate on such 
files.  it doesn't crash, however, at least not the current version 2.4.0.
