Synopsis:          Updated Pan packages fix denial of service vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:311-01
Issue date:        2003-11-24
Updated on:        2003-11-24
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          DoS
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0855
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated Pan packages that close a denial of service vulnerability are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Pan is a Gnome/GTK+ newsreader.

A bug in Pan versions prior to 0.13.4 can cause Pan to crash when parsing
an article header containing a very long author email address.  This bug
causes a crash (denial of service) but is not further exploitable.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0855 to this issue.

Users of Pan are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a backported patch correcting this issue.

Red Hat would like to thank Kasper Dupont for alerting us to this issue and
to Charles Kerr for providing the patch.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt
