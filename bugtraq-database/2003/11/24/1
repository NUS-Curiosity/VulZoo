Synopsis:          Updated EPIC packages fix security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:342-01
Issue date:        2003-11-17
Updated on:        2003-11-17
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          irc epic4 ircii
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0328
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated EPIC packages which fix an exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability
are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

EPIC (Enhanced Programmable ircII Client) is an advanced ircII chat
client designed to connect to Internet Relay Chat (IRC) servers.

A bug in various versions of EPIC allows remote malicious IRC servers to
cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via a CTCP
request from a large nickname, which causes an incorrect length
calculation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0328 to this issue.

Users of EPIC who may connect to untrusted servers are advised to upgrade
to the packages in this erratum which contain a backported security fix to
correct this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt
