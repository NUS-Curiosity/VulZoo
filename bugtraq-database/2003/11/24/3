                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated stunnel packages available
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:296-01
Issue date:        2003-11-24
Updated on:        2003-11-24
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          stunnel signal
Cross references:  RHSA-2003:297
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2003:221
CVE Names:         CAN-2002-1563 CAN-2003-0740
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated stunnel packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3,
and 8.0 systems.  These updates address problems stemming from improper use
of non-reentrant functions in signal handlers.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Stunnel is a wrapper for network connections. It can be used to tunnel an
unencrypted network connection over an encrypted connection (encrypted
using SSL or TLS) or to provide an encrypted means of connecting to
services that do not natively support encryption.

A previous advisory provided updated packages to address re-entrancy
problems in stunnel's signal-handling routines.  These updates did not
address other bugs that were found by Steve Grubb, and introduced an
additional bug, which was fixed in stunnel 3.26.

All users should upgrade to these errata packages, which address these
issues by updating stunnel to version 3.26.

NOTE: After upgrading, any instances of stunnel configured to run in daemon
mode should be restarted, and any active network connections that are
currently being serviced by stunnel should be terminated and reestablished.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
