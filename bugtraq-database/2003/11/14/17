	Quick question: would it make sense to have somewhere:

-	A common (computer/human readable) format for vulnerability 
	disclosures
-	A common format for bugfix publications

	?

	I was thinking something like:

Software name: foo-package
Software version: 2.4-2.6,3.1
Vulnerability type: ...
.
.
.

	And also some documentation on how to fill in each (eg. 
vulnerability type)?  And specify that these be text attachments to 
e-mails, or something, so that computers can read them, and people can 
read them, and it'll make everything easy.  

	Is there something like this already, or another forum where I 
should be asking this instead?  

	:)
