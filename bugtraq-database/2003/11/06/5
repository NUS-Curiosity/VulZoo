The former is part of our goal, the latter is certainly not.

We actively look for vulnerabilities: to help users and vendors, and simply
because it is fun. We then try to advise users with workarounds, and try to
get vendors to develop fixes. Sadly, to convince vendors that there is a
problem worth fixing, sometimes we are forced to produce proof-of-concept
exploits.

This demo may have been necessary to convince MS to fix those old
vulnerabilities.

[In another message you wrote:

Any concrete evidence to that?]

We are judged by our actions. The vocal ones usually have something to hide.
