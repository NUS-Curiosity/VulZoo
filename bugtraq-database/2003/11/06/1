I have mixed emotions about this. On one side - why put millions of
systems at risk to script kiddies? On the other side, as noted by the
poster, one of these vulnerabilities has been known for more than _TWO
YEARS_. Surely far more than enough time for MS to have actually _fixed_
the problem if they intended to. MS seems (at least in some cases)  to
ignore security problems until someone publically 'holds their feet to the
fire' over them. I suspect this happens when the problem 'runs deep' in
their code and will require more than fixing a boundary limit check and
recompiling.
