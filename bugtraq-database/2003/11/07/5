Subject: SRT2003-11-06-0710 - IBM DB2 Multiple local security issues

Full details on this issue are available on our website. There will be 
no forced pdf files, and we have removed the java applet that so many of 
you complained about. Registration is still necessary for indepth detail 
on this issue. I have also attempted to stop the cross posting to the 
mailing lists.
