Subject:		OpenServer 5.0.7 : OpenSSH: multiple buffer handling problems
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.24.1
Issue date: 		2003 November 04
Cross reference: 	sr884749 fz528324 erg712436 CERT VU#33362 CERT VU#602204 CAN-2003-0693  CAN-2003-0786 CAN-2003-0695 CAN-2003-0682
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	 Version CSSA-2003-SCO.24.0 had a bug which caused it to 
	 work only for a root login.

	 Several buffer management errors and memory bugs are
	 corrected by this patch. 
	 
	 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project 
	 (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the following
	 names to these issues. CAN-2003-0693, CAN-2003-0695,
	 CAN-2003-0682, CAN-2003-0786. 
	 
	 The CERT Coordination Center has assigned the following 
	 names VU#333628, and VU#602204.

	 CERT VU#333628 / CAN-2003-0693: A "buffer management error"
	 in buffer_append_space of buffer.c for OpenSSH before 3.7
	 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
	 causing an incorrect amount of memory to be freed and
	 corrupting the heap, a different vulnerability than
	 CAN-2003-0695 
	 
	 CAN-2003-0695: Multiple "buffer management errors" in 
	 OpenSSH before 3.7.1 may allow attackers to cause a denial 
	 of service or execute arbitrary code using (1) buffer_init 
	 in buffer.c, (2) buffer_free in buffer.c, or (3) a separate 
	 function in channels.c, a different vulnerability than 
	 CAN-2003-0693. 
	 
	 CAN-2003-0682: "Memory bugs" in OpenSSH 3.7.1 and earlier, 
	 with unknown impact, a different set of vulnerabilities 
	 than CAN-2003-0693 and CAN-2003-0695. 
	 
	 CERT VU#602204 / CAN-2003-0786: Portable OpenSSH versions 
	 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple vulnerabilities in the 
	 new PAM code. At least one of these bugs is remotely 
	 exploitable (under a non-standard configuration, with 
	 privsep disabled). OpenServer is not configured to use PAM, 
	 so is not vulnerable.
