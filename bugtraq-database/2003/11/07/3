Subject: Re: multiple payload handling flaws in isakmpd


About 23h ago Hakan Olsson commited a patch by Hans-Jörg Höxer to CVS,
which fixes the issues mentioned in section 2.1¹ and 2.3. For detailed
information see http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sbin/isakmpd/
{exchange.c.diff?r1=1.86&r2=1.87,exchange.c.diff?r1=1.86&r2=1.87}.

The issue described in section 2.4 still remains unfixed. As this is
crucial for the feasibility of the attack mentioned in section 4.2, the
whole thing is still quite bad.

1 - So far 2.1 was fixed for phase 2 exchanges only.
