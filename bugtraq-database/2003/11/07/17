Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.3 Open UNIX 8.0.0 UnixWare 7.1.1 : CDE libDtHelp buffer overflow
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.31
Issue date: 		2003 October 31
Cross reference:	sr885326 fz528372 erg712445 CAN-2003-083 CERT VU#575804

1. Problem Description

	The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) is a standard desktop
	environment for UNIX based systems. CDE libDTHelp contains
	a buffer overflow that can be exploited by a local user
	using specially crafted environment variables.
	
	An authenticated local user may be able to execute arbitrary
	code with root privileges. There is a possibility that a
	user can set the crafted environment variable to gain
	elevated privileges during initialization of the dtHelp
	application, or applications which link to libtDtHelp.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
	has assigned the name CAN-2003-0834 to this issue. CERT has
	assigned the name VU#575804 to this issue
