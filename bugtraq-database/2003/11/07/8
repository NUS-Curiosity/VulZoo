Subject: OpenAutoClassifieds XSS attack




 Critical: Less critical  
 Impact: Cross Site Scripting  
 Where: From remote  
 Software: OpenAutoClassifieds 1.x  
Vendor: http://jonroig.com/freecode/openautoclassifieds/ 
  
 Description:  
 A vulnerability has been identified in 
OpenAutoClassifieds, which can be exploited by malicious 
people to conduct Cross-Site Scripting attacks.  
  
 The vulnerabily is caused due to missing validation of 
input supplied to the "listing" parameter in "friendmail.php". 
This can be exploited by including arbitrary HTML or script 
code in the parameter, which will cause it to be executed in 
a user's browser session when viewed.  
  
 Example:  
 
http://[victim]/openautoclassifieds/friendmail.php?listing=&lt;script&gt;alert(document.domain);&lt;/script&gt;  
  
 The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 1.0.  
  
 Solution:  
 Filter malicious input in a HTTP proxy or firewall with URL 
filtering capabilities.  
  
 Edit the source code to ensure that user input is properly 
validated.
