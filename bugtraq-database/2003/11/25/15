HijackClickV2 - a successor of HijackClick attack

[tested]
OS:Win2k3,CN version
IE: with MS03-048 installed.

OS:WinXp, CN version
Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.Sp1; up-to-date on 2003/11/16

[overview]
After applying MS03-048, the original HijackClick exploit doesn't work any more.
With method caching(a.k.a "SaveRef"), HijackClick works again.

[demo]
There is a harmless demo:

[technical details]
After applying MS03-048, the original HijackClick exploit doesn't work any more.
(Liu Die Yu's http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/HijackClick/HijackClick-MyPage.HTM

Because window.moveBy is inaccessible. Method caching attack can make window.moveBy accessible again.

[Workaround]
Disable Active Scripting in INTERNET zone.

A wise man learns from other's mistakes; a fool learns from his own.

[Employment]
I would like to work professionally as a security researcher/bug finder. 

See my resume at my site. I am very eager to work, flexible, and 
extremely productive. I have a top notch resume, with credentials 
from leading bug finders. I am willing to work per contract, relocate, 
or telecommute. 
 
[Give a Hand]
I haven't got a job as a security researcher yet and my family don't support my security work - so, I don't have a computer of my own. Please consider about donating at:
