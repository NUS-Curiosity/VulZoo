GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200311-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Package : net-dialup/freeradius
            Summary : FreeRADIUS heap exploit and NULL pointer derefence
                      exploits
               Date : 2003-11-23
            Exploit : remote
  Versions Affected : <= 0.9.2
      Fixed Version : >= 0.9.3
      Gentoo Bug ID : #33989
                CVE : - None -
           Priority : Normal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY:
========

FreeRADIUS versions below 0.9.3 are vulnerable to a heap exploit,
however, the attack code must be in the form of a valid RADIUS packet
which limits the possible exploits.

Also corrected in the 0.9.3 release is another vulnerability which
causes the RADIUS server to de-reference a NULL pointer and crash when
an Access-Request packet with a Tunnel-Password is received.

Please see the announcement at:
http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2003/Nov/
1008263.html for more details regarding the issue.

SOLUTION:
=========

Users are encouraged to perform an 'emerge --sync' and upgrade the
package to the latest available version - 0.9.3 is available in portage
and is marked as stable.
