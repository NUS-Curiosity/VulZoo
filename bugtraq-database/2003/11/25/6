  When did bugtraq become Unix 101? My mount command on what I'm
typing this on outputs:

$ mount
/dev/wd0a on / type ffs (local)
/dev/wd0d on /tmp type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)
/dev/wd0g on /usr type ffs (local, nodev)
/dev/wd0e on /var type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)
/dev/wd0f on /home type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)

  If you don't understand why, please run to your local bookstore for
a basic sysadmin book, or install Windows on your machine so microsoft 
can keep you safe, and let this thread die. Yeesh. 	  

	-Bob
