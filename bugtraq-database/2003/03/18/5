Package:             mysql
Vulnerability:       remote root exploit
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= mysql-3.23.55-20030211   >= mysql-3.23.56-20030318
OpenPKG 1.2          <= mysql-3.23.54a-1.2.1     >= mysql-3.23.54a-1.2.2
OpenPKG 1.1          <= mysql-3.23.52-1.1.2      >= mysql-3.23.52-1.1.3

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a report on BugTraq [0], a remote root exploit
  vulnerability exists in version 3.23.55 and earlier versions of the
  MySQL server [1]. If the MySQL server is launched by root, as it is
  often done by system startup scripts, any database users with the
  "FILE" privilege can write a configuration file (usually my.cnf) that
  causes the MySQL server to run under an arbitrary user id including
  the user id of the super-user on the next restart.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  mysql". If you have the "mysql" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [2][3]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [4][5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6][7] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [8], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [2] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [3]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get mysql-3.23.54a-1.2.2.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig mysql-3.23.54a-1.2.2.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild mysql-3.23.54a-1.2.2.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/mysql-3.23.54a-1.2.2.*.rpm
