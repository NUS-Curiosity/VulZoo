THUNDERSTONE RESPONSE TO SECURITY ALERT 

Thunderstone Software is aware of a report about a "vulnerability" in one of our products, published on Bugtraq. Thunderstone takes such concerns seriously. We offer the following details for concerned customers and users of our software. 

Texis issues a message that reveals a web server's "path to document root" and other information, when given one of the special query strings "-dump" or "-version". The message is intended to aide in solving set-up or configuration problems. 

A risk is present only if there is some additional vulnerability on that same server. The reported issue does not provide access to the server, although it may be used by an attacker to narrow the attack against other vulnerabilities. 

Although we consider the vulnerability minor, we have initiated a modification to resolve the issue. Customers who wish to take advantage of the change should contact Thunderstone tech support. 

Some customers may prefer the current functionality, which is not inadvertent or a "bug." Rather, Thunderstone designed its software to include this information for resolving web server path problems, which are common. 

Customers that have applied a patch to fix an earlier similar vulnerability related to invalid script paths are not vulnerable. 

Customers using vhttpd can use an EntryScript to check for the suspect query strings, and take an appropriate action if they are detected.
