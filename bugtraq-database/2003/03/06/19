Subject: [New Research Paper] Bound by Tradition: A sampling of the security posture of the Internet's DNS servers


Hello. I just put the finishing touches on a whitepaper detailing the
security posture of the Internet's DNS infrastructure. To wit:

"DNS servers across the Internet running BIND are not up to date with
security patches and software updates. As a result, a significant
fraction of the Internet's DNS servers is vulnerable to compromise,
subversion, denial of service, and general misuse. Considering that DNS
is the lynchpin of the corporate enterprise, the impact of these
vulnerabilities is significant and a successful attack could bring down
any online business."

Comments are welcomed; off-list is preferable and I will post a summary.

Thanks.
