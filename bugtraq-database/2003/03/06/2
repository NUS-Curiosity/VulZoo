                   Red Hat, Inc. Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated im packages fix insecure handling of temporary files
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:039-06
Issue date:        2003-02-07
Updated on:        2003-03-06
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          im tmp
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2002-1395
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

New im packages are available that fix the insecure handling of temporary
files.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.0 - noarch
Red Hat Linux 7.1 - noarch
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - noarch
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Internet Message (IM) is a series of user interface commands and backend
Perl5 libraries that integrate email and the NetNews user interface. They
are designed to be used from both the Mew mail reader for Emacs and the
command line.

A vulnerability has been discovered by Tatsuya Kinoshita in the way two IM
utilities create temporary files.  By anticipating the names used to
create files and directories stored in /tmp, it may be possible for a
local attacker to corrupt or modify data as another user. 

Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, and 7.2 included IM packages that are vulnerable to
this issue.  This erratum includes IM version 143 which is not vulnerable
to this issue.

Red Hat Linux 7.3, and 8.0 included Mew (Messaging in the Emacs World) 
packages which included vulnerable versions of IM.  This erratum provide
updated Mew packages including IM version 143 which is not vulnerable to
this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
