C55 is vulnerable as well, however it doesn't DoS - the phone hangs while 
reading SMS in ordinary way but at any time you may exit from "Please 
wait" screen by pressing "disconnect" key for a while.
Only method to read the sms is to Edit it insted of View.

SMS sent via www sms gateway _does_ "DoS".
