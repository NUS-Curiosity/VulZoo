______________________________________________________________________________

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    The Post-Office-Protocol- (POP-) Server qpopper (version 4) was
    vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The buffer overflow occurs after
    authentication has taken place. Therefore pop-users with a valid
    account can execute arbitrary code on the system running qpopper.
    Depending on the setup, the malicious code is run with higher privileges.

    There is no temporary fix known, please update your system.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update.
    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

    Please note, missing packages will be published as soon as possible.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - mutt
      A buffer overflow in mutt's IMAP code may result in remote system
      compromise.
      New packages are currently being build and will be available soon.

    - kernel
      A bug in the Linux kernel was found that allows local users to
      become root. The bug can just be exploited if ptrace(2) is allowed,
      LKM and kmod support is enabled.
      We already build new kernels and are currently testing them.
      As a workaround kernel module loading can be disabled after every
      boot by executing the following action as root:
        # echo /just/a/temporary/workaround > /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe
      Please note, that this will disable some services.

    - ethereal
      A format string bug in ethereal's SOCKS handling code and a buffer
      overflow in the NTLMSSP was found in ethereal. Both bugs may lead
      to remote system compromise.
      New packages are currently being build and will be available soon.

    - apcupsd
      The control and management daemon for APC UPS systems is vulnerable
      to remote code execution due to buffer overflow and format string bugs.
      A dedicated advisory for this issue will be released as soon as all
      packages are being build.

    - vnc
      VNC (Virtual Network Computing) uses a weak cookie generation process
      which can be exploited by an attacker to bypass authentication.
      New packages are currently being tested and will be available on our
      FTP servers soon.

    - openssl
      A paper regarding remote timing attacks against OpenSSL has been
      published by researchers of the Stanford University. It is possible
      to extract the private RSA key used by services using OpenSSL by
      observing their timing behavior.
      Additionally czech researchers found another bug in OpenSSL which
      is an extension of the "Bleichenbacher Attack".
      Fixed packages will be available on our FTP servers soon.

    - mod_php4 4.3.0
      A serious security vulnerability was found in mod_php 4.3.0 which
      allows a remote attacker to read files or even execute PHP-code.
      This was possible due to direct access to the CGI module.
      SuSE does not ship this vulnerable version.

    - pgp4pine
      A buffer overflow in pine's filter add-on pgp4pine can be abused
      to execute arbitrary commands remotely. The pgp4pine version
      SuSE ships is not vulnerable to this bug.

    - nethack
      A buffer overflow in nethack can be exploited local users to gain
      higher privileges if the nethack binary is installed setuid/setgid.
      This bug is fixed for upcoming SuSE Linux versions. As a temporary
      workaround you should disable all s-bits on the nethack binary
      (/etc/permissions.local).

    - netpbm
      The netpbm package contains various integer overflows which can
      lead to arbitrary code execution. New packages are published on our
      FTP servers.

    - man
      A vulnerability in man was published that allows local privilege
      escalation. SuSE Linux does not ship this vulnerable version of man.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@...e.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@...e.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .
