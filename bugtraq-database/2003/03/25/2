APPLE-SA-2003-03-24 Samba, OpenSSL

Security Update 2003-03-24 is now available.  It contains fixes for
recent vulnerabilities in:

   * OpenSSL:  Fixes CAN-2003-0147, a timing attack on RSA keys.

   * Samba:  Fixes CAN-2003-0085 and CAN-2003-0086 which could allow
unauthorized remote access to the host system.  The built-in Windows
file sharing in Mac OS X is based on Samba.  Windows file sharing is
off by default in Mac OS X, but it is recommended that all users
install this Security Update.

Note:  This update only applies the security fixes to the
currently-shipping 2.2.3 version of Samba on Mac OS X 10.2.4, and the
Samba version is otherwise unchanged.  The presence of the following
file indicates that the update has been applied:
/Library/Receipts/SecurityUpd2003-03-24.pkg


Affected systems:  Mac OS X 10.2.4 and earlier
                   Mac OS X Server 10.2.4 and earlier

System requirements:  Mac OS X 10.2.4 or Mac OS X Server 10.2.4

Customers with earlier Mac OS X versions are encouraged to either
upgrade to Mac OS X 10.2.4, or visit the Samba and OpenSSL web sites
for information on the available fixes.
