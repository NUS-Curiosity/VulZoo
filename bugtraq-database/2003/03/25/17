"great" advisory..

about what version you are talking? latest 'stable' release 6.0 doesn't
contain this file, older 4.3 and 4.4 version are negative too..

after some googling i got it, you are talking about phpnuke 6.5..

this problem can be workarrounded with using safe_mode, or open_basedir
directives in php configuration, after this your assertion is false,
because attacker can't view any files on system.

thanks again for detailed advisory..

unfortunately, there is another too strange problems, which is publicated
today at site http://www.phpsecure.info/ dedicated to sql injection in
phpnuke. one of this is used by brazilian h4x0r which called himself as
'freeck' tonight to change one article at our phpnuke site.
