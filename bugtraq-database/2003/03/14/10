Package:             qpopper
Vulnerability:       remote code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= qpopper-4.0.4-20030226   >= qpopper-4.0.5-20030313
OpenPKG 1.2          <= qpopper-4.0.4-1.2.0      >= qpopper-4.0.4-1.2.1
OpenPKG 1.1          <= qpopper-4.0.4-1.1.1      >= qpopper-4.0.4-1.1.2

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to Florian Heinz [0] a remote code execution vulnerability
  exists in the QPopper POP3 server [1]. Attackers may remotely exploit
  this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the user id of a
  mailbox owner and the "mail" group id.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  qpopper". If you have the "qpopper" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [2][3]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [4][5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6][7] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [8], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [2] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [3]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get qpopper-4.0.4-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig qpopper-4.0.4-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild qpopper-4.0.4-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/qpopper-4.0.4-1.2.1.*.rpm
