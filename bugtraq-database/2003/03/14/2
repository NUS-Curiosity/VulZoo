Last tiem I checked, PGP tried to implement MUA support without any
actual support from the MUA.  So it's probably a PGP problem.  (Of
course it's questionable to hack security-critical features into other
programs in ways like this -- we've seen countless instances of
surprising features of such combinations.)

BTW: Maybe Symantec can reconsider the "Strip Cc" BUGTRAQ policy.  It
is a bit annoying when you post follow-ups, and I don't see the point
in restricting (reasonable) cross-posting.
