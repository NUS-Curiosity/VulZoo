Package:             ircii
Vulnerability:       buffer overflow vulnerability
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= ircii-20030314-20030315  >= ircii-20030315-20030316

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Timo Sirainen audited ircII based clients [1] and found some buffer
  overflow vulnerabilities in ircii-20020912 [2]. According to his
  report these problems were fixed in ircii-20030313. We have backported
  the security relevant pieces of the more recent ircii-20030315 vendor
  changes into releases used by OpenPKG.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  ircii". If you have the "ircii" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get ircii-20021103-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig ircii-20021103-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild ircii-20021103-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/ircii-20021103-1.2.1.*.rpm
