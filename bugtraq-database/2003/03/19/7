Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0009

Package name:      mysql
Summary:           Serveral security fixes
Date:              2003-03-18
Affected versions: TSL 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  MySQL is a true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL (Structured Query
  Language) database server. MySQL is a client/server implementation
  that consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many different client
  programs/libraries.

  The main goals of MySQL are speed, robustness and ease of use.

  The base upon which MySQL is built is a set of routines that have been
  used in a highly demanding production environment for many
  years. While MySQL is still in development, it already offers a rich
  and highly useful function set.


Problem description:
  From the changes file for 3.26.56:
  * Security enhancement: `mysqld' no longer reads options from
    world-writeable config files.
  * Security enhancement: `mysqld' and `safe_mysqld' now only use the
    first --user option specified on the command line. (Normally this
      comes from `/etc/my.cnf')
  * Security enhancement: Don't allow BACKUP TABLE to overwrite existing
    files.

  In additon, a number bugs has been fixed.
