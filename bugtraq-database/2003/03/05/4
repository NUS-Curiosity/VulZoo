Subject: Sendmail exploit released???




Folks:

Refer to this article in ComputerWorld 
http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/holes/story/0,10801,79
021,00.html about some Russian Hacker site releasing Sendmail exploit 
code. Is it any different than the LSD exploit code or is is a "security-
guru-security-know-all" reporters mistake?!

The reason this caught my attention is that they say that the exploit has 
been tested only on Slackware Linux 8.0 dist just like LSD advisory says 

This article claims that the Russian hackers wrote it and released it on 
the web first... which kinda irks me off :(

<quote from the article>
... "self-proclaimed security experts located in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, 
actually produced the exploit and posted it on the Web"
<unquote>

Can anybody confirm/deny this?
