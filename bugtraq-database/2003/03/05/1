CVE Names:         CAN-2002-1276 CAN-2002-1341
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated squirrelmail packages are now available for Red Hat Linux.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - noarch

3. Problem description:

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP.  Two vulnerabilities
have been found that affect versions of SquirrelMail shipped with Red Hat
Linux 8.0.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Squirrelmail version 1.2.10
and earlier allows remote attackers to execute script as other web users
via read_body.php. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1341 to this issue.

An incomplete fix for a cross-site scripting vulnerability in SquirrelMail
1.2.8 calls the strip_tags function on the PHP_SELF value but does not save
the result back to that variable, leaving it open to cross-site scripting
attacks. (CAN-2002-1276)

All users of Squirrelmail are advised to upgrade to these packages
based on SquirrelMail version 1.2.10 which contain a backported patch to
fix these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

78982 - SquirrelMail 1.2.8 vulnerable to XSS attacks
79147 - SquirrelMail 1.2.8 vulnerable to XSS attacks

6. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 8.0:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/8.0/en/os/SRPMS/squirrelmail-1.2.10-1.src.rpm

noarch:

tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
