Seen on 
http://www.sendmail.org/patchcr.html

To check whether the new sendmail binary contains the patch, run this command 
(in the directory where the binary is located): 

strings sendmail | grep 'Dropped invalid comments from header address'

 The command must print the string 
Dropped invalid comments from header address
