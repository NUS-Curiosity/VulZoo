Subject: Re: [LSD] Technical analysis of the remote sendmail
 vulnerability


I want to emphasize one of the last sentences in this posting:
``However, we cannot exclude that there does not exist another
execution path in the sendmail code, that could lead to the program
counter overwrite.''  Please don't breath a sigh of relief because
you are running on one of the "does not crash" systems.

Besides direct execution path exploits, there are other variables
that are not pointers that have security implications; finding one of
them within range will be more difficult, but probably not impossible.

Everyone should patch as soon as possible, regardless of platform.
