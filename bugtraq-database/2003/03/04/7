 A. Background
    A potential security vulnerability with sendmail has been
    reported in HP-UX.  This potential vulnerability may result in
    unauthorized Privileged Access or a Denial of Service (DoS).
    This potential vulnerability may be exploited remotely.

    This problem also affects HP Tru64 UNIX/Trucluster Server.
    NOTE: This problem does not impact HP NonStop Servers nor
          HP OpenVMS.
    The  HP Tru64 bulletin will be posted to the customer
    support website within 24 hours of release to -
    http://thenew.hp.com/country/us/eng/support.html
    or www.hp.com
    Use the SEARCH IN feature box, enter SSRT in the
    search window or use a specific SSRT #
    example: SSRT3469

 B. Recommended solution

    Determine if you are running a vulnerable version of sendmail:

        Login in as root:
          cd /usr/sbin
          sendmail -d0.1 < /dev/null | grep -i version

        The display will show Version #.#.#
        HP Versions affected:  8.8.6, 8.9.3, 8.11.1

       For HP-UX 11.22: sendmail.811.11.22.gz

       The files are available from the following site:

        System:    hprc.external.hp.com  (192.170.19.51)
        Login:     sendmail
        Password:  sendmail

        FTP Access: ftp://sendmail:sendmail@...c.external.hp.com/
                or: ftp://sendmail:sendmail@....170.19.51/
                or: ftp hprc.external.hp.com

        Note: There is an ftp defect in IE5 that may result in
               a browser hang.  To work around this:
        - Select Tools -> Internet Options -> Advanced
        - Un-check the option: [ ] Enable folder view for FTP sites

     Unpack the file with gunzip(1).

     Verify the cksum or the md5 sum:

     cksum:
     2052507672 401408 sendmail.886.10.01
     3975773765 806912 sendmail.893.10.20
     2575934578 970752 sendmail.811.11.00

     MD5 (sendmail.811.11.22) = 9871b8fd59f9aa39e66da2185681710e

     Copy the file to a protected directory such as /usr/sbin.

     Login as root and run killsm:

        killsm

     Verify the sendmail daemon is not running:

        ps -ef | grep sendmail

     Make a backup copy of the existing sendmail:

        cd /usr/sbin
        cp sendmail sendmail.original

     Note the permissions for reference:

        ls -lia /usr/sbin/sendmail

     Install the new sendmail:

        cp sendmail.xxx.yy.zz sendmail

     For example, on 11.22:

        cp sendmail.811.11.22 sendmail

     Restart sendmail:

        /sbin/init.d/sendmail start

 SSRT2336 Security Vulnerability in XDR library
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be
acted upon as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will
not be liable for any consequences to any customer resulting
from customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this
Security Bulletin as soon as possible.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: Potential buffer overflow in XDR library.

IMPACT: Potential unauthorized access, denial of service.

    PLATFORM: HP 9000 Series 700 and 800 10.20, 10.24, 11.00,
              11.04, 11.11, and 11.22

 **REVISED 04**
SOLUTION: Until patches are available manually install the
          appropriate fixed libraries.
          Install PHCO_27882 for 10.24.
 -->>     Install PHNE_28102 for 11.00.
 -->>     Install PHNE_28103 for 11.11.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
                Install the appropriate fixed libraries.
                Install PHCO_27882 for 10.24.
 -->>           Install PHNE_28102 for 11.00.
 -->>           Install PHNE_28103 for 11.11.
                Relink any archived programs that call
                xdr_array().

AVAILABILITY:  This bulletin will be updated when patches are
               available.

CHANGE SUMMARY: Rev.01 - corrected "strings" to "strings -a"
                Rev.02 - added 10.24 and 11.04, also added libc.1
                         for 11.00, 11.11, and 11.22.
                Rev.03 - corrected scripts
                Rev.04 - patches are available for 11.00 and 11.11.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background
    CERT Advisory CA-2002-25 reports an integer overflow in
    certain implementations of XDR libraries.  Libraries supplied
    with HP-UX 10.20, 10.24, 11,00, 11.04, 11.11, and 11.22 are
    potentially vulnerable.

    In addition, cross-reference:
    HP Tru64 UNIX: Case id: SSRT2309 rpc XDR_ARRAY
       A solution is available as noted in the recent
       security bulletin SSSRT2275 at
       http://thenew.hp.com/country/us/eng/support.html
       Use the SEARCH IN feature box, enter SSRT2275 in the
       search window.


 B. Recommended solution
    Until patches are released, download and manually install
    the appropriate libraries.

    Note:  It will be necessary to relink any programs that
    call xdr_array() and are linked with archived libraries.
    There are no known programs supplied by HP which need to
    be relinked.  To test an archived program:

       strings -a suspect_program | grep xdr_array:

    If the command above returns "xdr_array: out of memory"
    the suspect_program will need to the relinked with a
    fixed library.

    Download the appropriate files from:

     System:    hprc.external.hp.com  (192.170.19.51)
     Login:     xdr
     Password:  xdr1

     FTP Access: ftp://xdr:xdr1@...c.external.hp.com/
             or: ftp://xdr:xdr1@....170.19.51/


      Note: There is an ftp defect in IE5 that may result in
            a browser hang.  To work around this:
      - Select Tools -> Internet Options -> Advanced
      - Un-check the option: [ ] Enable folder view for FTP sites.


     The files are:

        PHCO_26152.depot.gz

        libc.1.gz
        libc.1.PHCO_27882.gz

        libnsl.1.32_11.00.gz
        libnsl.a.32_11.00.gz
        libnsl.1.64_11.00.gz
        libnsl.a.64_11.00.gz

        libnsl.so.1.32_11.22.IA.gz
        libnsl.so.1.64_11.22.IA.gz


    The cksum output:


        2238979170 9676800 PHCO_26152.depot
        3415580416 1867776 libc.1
        1011129778 1814528 libc.1.PHCO_27882

        3064646304 679936 libnsl.1.32_11.00
        498505157 817544 libnsl.a.32_11.00
        2630827583 648296 libnsl.1.64_11.00
        2205456871 1454504 libnsl.a.64_11.00

        2227616066 1490048 libnsl.so.1.32_11.22.IA
        3162410426 1564768 libnsl.so.1.64_11.22.IA


      Note:  The patches which supply the libc and libnsl
             libraries require that the system be rebooted.
             It would be best to carry out the manual
             installation below in init state 2 followed
             by a reboot.  Otherwise programs which were
             running when the libraries were changed would
             continue to use the old version of the libraries.

      Copy the appropriate files to a secure directory,
      for example /.  Then,

      For 10.20
      ====================================
      Install PHCO_26152.depot:
      swinstall -x autoreboot=true -x match_target=true \
                        -s /PHCO_26152.depot


      Any applications that use the RPC/XDR APIs in libc.a
      must be relinked and restarted.

      For 10.24
      ====================================
      Install PHCO_27882.  This patch is available from
      the itrc.

**REVISED 04**
      For 11.00
      ====================================
 -->> Install PHCO_28102.  This patch is available from
 -->> the itrc.

**REVISED 04**
      For 11.11
      ====================================
 -->> Install PHCO_28103.  This patch is available from
 -->> the itrc.

**REVISED 03**
      For 11.04
      ====================================
      #cd /usr/lib

      #cp /libnsl.1.32_11.00 libnsl.1.new
      #cp /libnsl.a.32_11.00 libnsl.a.new
      #cp /libc.1.PHCO_27882 libc.1.new

      #chmod 555 libc.1.new

      #chown bin:bin libnsl.1.new
      #chown bin:bin libnsl.a.new
      #chown bin:bin libc.1.new

      #mv libnsl.1 libnsl.1.orig
      #mv libnsl.a libnsl.a.orig
      #mv libc.1 libc.1.orig

      #mv libnsl.1.new libnsl.1
      #mv libnsl.a.new libnsl.a
      #mv libc.1.new libc.1

      #cd /usr/lib/pa20_64

      #cp /libnsl.1.64_11.00 libnsl.1.new
      #cp /libnsl.a.64_11.00 libnsl.a.new

      #chmod 555 libnsl.1.new
      #chmod 444 libnsl.a.new

      #chown bin:bin libnsl.1.new
      #chown bin:bin libnsl.a.new

      #mv libnsl.1 libnsl.1.orig
      #mv libnsl.a libnsl.a.orig

      #mv libnsl.1.new libnsl.1
      #mv libnsl.a.new libnsl.a

      After this, any applications that use libnsl.1 must be
      restarted.  Any applications that use libnsl.a must
      be relinked and restarted.

      Any applications that use libc.1 must be restarted.

      Rebooting is the recommended way to restart the applications
      using libnsl.1 or libc.1.


**REVISED 03**
      For 11.22 IA
      ====================================
      #cd /usr/lib/hpux32
      #cp /libnsl.so.1.32_11.22.IA libnsl.so.1.new
      #chmod 555 libnsl.so.1.new
      #chown bin:bin libnsl.so.1.new
      #mv libnsl.so.1 libnsl.so.1.orig
      #mv libnsl.so.1.new libnsl.so.1

      #cd /usr/lib
      #cp /libc.1 libc.1.new
      #chmod 555 libc.1.new
      #chown bin:bin libc.1.new
      #mv libc.1 libc.1.orig
      #mv libc.1.new libc.1

      #cd   /usr/lib/hpux64
      #cp /libnsl.so.1.64_11.22.IA libnsl.so.1.new
      #chmod 555 libnsl.so.1.new
      #chown bin:bin libnsl.so.1.new
      #mv libnsl.so.1 libnsl.so.1.orig
      #mv libnsl.so.1.new libnsl.so.1

      After this, any applications that use libnsl.so.1 must be
      restarted.

      Rebooting is the recommended way to restart the applications
      using libnsl.1 or libc.1.
