Subject: Sendmail testing tool.



Hi,

Sorry for my ignorance as I have just patched sendmail for the currently
new vunerability in 8.12.7 and below. Is there a test tool yet so that I
could verify that the patch took and that the exploit has been taken care
of? I am just a little paranoid is all. I didn't see a version change or
anything else that might indicate that it was successfully patched other
than patch itself. I did fully recompile and the version after make
install is the same even after removal of the binary. I just want to be
sure that it has been taken care of.

						Thanks,
