Ahhhh, I gotcha now...
Yeah that makes sense about what your were saying before.
Thanks for clearing that up!

I don't think you understand...a .cnt file won't do anything if you
click on
it.  It's the same as if I were to create a file named
"testfile.ooongaboonga".  Windows will essentially ask, "what the hell
do
you want me to do with this?" and of course the user won't have any idea
either, so nothing will happen.  YOU CANNOT RUN A .CNT FILE.  It gets
called
from a help file; it's the index of the help file.
