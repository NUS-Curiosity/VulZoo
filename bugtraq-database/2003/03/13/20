Subject: response to tax software not encrypting tax info

PivX:

I am wondering, is it really the responsibility of every piece of software that handles potentially sensitive info to provide (strong)encryption capabilities?

I think the onus of protecting sensitive info should fall on the user in many cases. This obviously includes not sharing your tax info on KaZaA or on network shares and using reliable third-party encryption software to protect anything that you really don't want other people to know about. NTFS permissions and EFS can also be used to this effect. In the end, these measures will also be way way way more effective than relying on some hacked together info encoding algorithm that merely obsfucates your tax info and introduces the additional
security "vulnerability" of weakly encoding the information.
