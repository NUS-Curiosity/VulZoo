Calling these "security advisories" is really misleading.  I keep some of my
financial calculations in Excel spreadsheets and even in text documents.
Does that mean you'll be issuing a security advisory on Excel or emacs next?
And heaven knows, these files are stored in files on disk drives... will you
be issuing a security advisory that disks present a risk?

I'm having a hard time seeing any value to these "disclosures" other than if
the goal is to get press attention.  Running P2P sharing is the risk; these
are examples of why people who choose to use P2P need to be cautious of what
they share.
