Oddly enough, this does NOT work on my RedHat 7.3 installation. I have the
default xscreensaver RPM installed (xscreensaver-3.33-4).

When I run this, xscreensaver DOES dump core, however, xscreensaver is not
suid root and so will not itself give a root exploit. Perhaps there is an
expected interaction with the X server (which is running as root) but this
is not clear from Angelo's message.
