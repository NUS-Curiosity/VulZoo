.:Introduction

"The DBManager Professional is the most powerful application

.: Impact

Any local user can retrieve MySQL and PostgreSQL connection information
like DB hosts, usernames and passwords without any restriction.

.: Description

DBTools DBManager Pro stores its link information in the 
sys_servers table located in catalog.mdb (MS JET database) file usually
within the "DATA" directory in the program folder. 
(C:\Program Files\DBTools Software\DBManager Professional\DATA)

This table contains server_id, server_name, server_type, host, and port,
user and password fields, from where a local attacker can gain useful
information regarding the db engines.

The fields in this database are NOT encrypted, letting any user with
read access retrieve this data. catalog.mdb is readable to all users by
default so virtually any user within the system can open this file.

.: Official Fix Information

The vendor has been contacted but no fix has been released yet.
