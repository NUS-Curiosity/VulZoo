One possibility is at:

	http://www.impsec.org/email-tools/local-rules.procmail

It is intended to be used with the procmail email sanitizer:

	http://www.impsec.org/email-tools/procmail-security.html

However, the regex should be adaptable to any MTA that incorporates
regex-based header processing.

 ...voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding
 of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they
 are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism
 and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any
 country.
