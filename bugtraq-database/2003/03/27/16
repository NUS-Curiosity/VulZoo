Subject: Re: Security Advisory - MyTaxexpress 2003


Did this guy miss the discussion about this very issue like, two weeks
ago?

I think the ultimate resolution of that discussion was that users are
lazy and stupid ("uninformed"), not likely to change defaults or be
savvy enough to use third-party encryption software, much less be
inclined to have to engage in that extra step.

There comes a point when we must wash our hands of the matter and leave
the user's security up to the user.  Inform them, yes, but leave them to
their own informed peril.

It sounds like most tax software does not encrypt personal data and
stores it in predictable locations.  I think a better tack on this
matter is to take steps to prevent the data from being accessible to
outside attackers.  Inform users how to disable the insecure default
shares that some OSes create and how to protect their computers from
many data-compromising vulnerabilities.  For example, "My Documents"
shouldn't be allowed to be accessible from outside anyway.

Or we could all do our taxes on paper, hand-deliver them to their
respective agents, keep our record copies in 6-inch hardened-steel
glass-packed (remember The Score?) fireproof safes, and crosscut-shred,
bleach, and burn any other paperwork with sensitive information.
