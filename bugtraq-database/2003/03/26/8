Subject: Re: WebDAV exploit: using wide character decoder scheme


Unfortunately, on my US Windows 2K SP3 build (and I assume all others),
those %u directives get translated into question marks. (0x003F in hex)
:<

This exploit must be much easier to get reliable on other language
versions. A shame, really.

Did you use my encoder or did you write your shellcode manually, just
out of curiosity?
