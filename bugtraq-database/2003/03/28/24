Subject: Re: D-Link DI-614 wiresless router crash/reboots


Using the Nestea.c attack source code from
http://www.insecure.org/sploits/linux.PalmOS.nestea.html, I launched the
attack against my router with the following syntax - './nestea 192.168.0.101
192.168.0.1 -n 20', making it go through 20 iterations of sending the
attack. My DI-614+ wasn't affected at all by the attack. I ran the attack
again, this time specifying '-n 99999', and again, no result. As far as I
can tell, nothing is even in the logs informing of this attack.

As far as the other vulnerability, I haven't yet had a chance to test it. If
I do get that chance, however, I will post a followup with the results.
