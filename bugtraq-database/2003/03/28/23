Subject: Re: Fate Research Labs Presents: Analysis of the NTDLL.DLL Exploit


  "The NTDLL.DLL exploit was first discovered due to the compromise of a
  military web server on March 17. This was the first publicly
documented
  use of an unpublished exploit: Bugtraq only accounts for a small
  percentage of the actual exploits and vulnerabilities that exist. This
  was the first known case where an unreleased or "zero-day" exploit was
  utilized to compromise machines before it was publicly announced."

Both contradicts itself and is not true.

  "A web site containing a continuously growing list of applications
that
  use ntdll.dll is provided in the appendix."

That would be, uh, ALL NT applications?
