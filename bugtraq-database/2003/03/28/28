Subject: RE: FUD-ALARM: @(#)Mordred Labs advisory - Integer overflow in PHP memory allocator



-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi

Stefan nicely asked me to provide real examples in the PHP source code
in which was used something like - emalloc(userinput).
In the advisory has been 2 examples, first used emalloc(userinput +1),

second - emalloc(userinput + 2). Guess that was enough for understanding
and fixing the issue. Really sorry if someone did not get the point,
we don't provide tech support on the subject of our advisories...someday
maybe...As for the note that this is a experimental extension and not
enabled by default - looks like there are some problems with installing
sockets extension, just add --with-sockets option to configure script.

Another example of insecure emalloc() call - mhash_keygen_s2k() function
in the mhash extension which uses emalloc(userinput + 1).

Best regards.
// Sir Mordred
