A more important argument against the application picking a random key at
installation time is that if it gets lost (e.g. due to disk or registry
corruption), the user's data is gone (which could have serious results in
cases such as tax programs).

Any secret required to decrypt the data should be supplied by the user so
that they can take whatever steps are appropriate to make sure it doesn't
get lost.

Obfuscation should never be encouraged over encryption, but obfuscation is
certainly better than nothing (cleartext).  Your comparison ignores the fact
that the vast majority of people stumbling across someone's tax return on a
file sharing network would have neither the inclination nor the ability to
write or find software capable of de-obfuscation.

Naturally true encryption is greatly desired just in case a true attacker
_is_ out there, but obfuscation will certainly protect against that 99.x% of
the population that _could_ download your tax return if they wanted to, but
won't (or won't figure out how to get the obfuscated info out of it if they
do).
