Subject: Re: [EC-SA-01.2003] Windows XP "welcome screen" exposes the names of all the members of the local administrators group


Hello Andrew,

1. Thanks a lot for your note about the way to remove users from the
"welcome screen".

I am sorry I was not aware of this workaround when the advisory was
published.
It is a shame MS don't add this procedure to its KB (as far as I
searched there).

I have tested this and, as promised... - it works fine on both normal
boot and "safe mode" boot.

So, this is a very good workaround until MS will fix this permanently.

Applying this to all local users with administrative privileges will be
a good practice, although it will force them to do a CTRL+ALT+DEL with
each logon. A bit annoying, but we do it all for security...


2. Regarding the "flaw" in my report: my report concentrated on Windows
XP and the "welcome screen" only (thus referring to local access only) -
so I didn't see any reason to mention any non-directly-related issues.


Again, I wish to thank you for bringing this workaround to my (and to
the other subscribers of this list) attention.

Wellknown and supported way to remove/hide users from Welcome screen.

Also I would like to note that there is a flaw in your report.
Any user can retrive lists or users and shares in default configuration 
for NT4 and W2K using "null sessions". XP has some changes.

Just wanna everything will be clear,
