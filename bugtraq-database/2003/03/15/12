Please note that simply blocking URL's ending in "?-dump" and "?-version"
won't work. You can append a space and additional text, such as:

http://www.example.org/cgi-bin/texis.exe?-dump%20kjshkjhskjsh.html

I didn't bother to test any other special characters or encoding (i.e.
UNICODE), I suspect there may be other ones that can be used.
