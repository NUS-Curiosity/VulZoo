Subject: Re: [ADVISORY] Timing Attack on OpenSSL


This is a different vulnerability.  The one you patched two weeks ago 
was caused by a failure to decrypt messages when the MAC comparison 
failed.  This vulnerability is a timing attack against the RSA algorithms.

The Slashdot discussion is here:

  http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/14/0012214&mode=thread&tid=172

The paper is here:
