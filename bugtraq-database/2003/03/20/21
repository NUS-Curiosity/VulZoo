Description:
  According to an OpenSSL [0] security advisory [1], Czech cryptologists
  Vlastimil Klima, Ondrej Pokorny, and Tomas Rosa have come up with an
  extension of the "Bleichenbacher attack" on RSA with PKCS #1 v1.5
  padding as used in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. The attack was documented
  in their report "Attacking RSA-based Sessions in SSL/TLS" [2]. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0147 [3] to the problem.

  Their attack requires the attacker to open millions of SSL/TLS
  connections to the server under attack. The server's behaviour when
  faced with specially made-up RSA ciphertexts can reveal information
  that in effect allows the attacker to perform a single RSA private key
  operation on a ciphertext of its choice using the server's RSA key.
  Note that the server's RSA key is not compromised in this attack.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  openssl". If you have the "openssl" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) and it's dependent packages (see above), if any, too.
  [4][5]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][7], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][9] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [10], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [4] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [5]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get openssl-0.9.7-1.2.3.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig openssl-0.9.7-1.2.3.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild openssl-0.9.7-1.2.3.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/openssl-0.9.7-1.2.3.*.rpm

  Additionally, you have to rebuild and reinstall all dependent
  packages (see above), too. [4][5]
