That's the funny thing, IE6 SP1 still allows opening MHT files directly from
the web in the Internet Zone, so this is remotely exploitable on websites.

Since MHT files are opened automatically, just like certain other media
files, you can also open an MHT file automatically through an email message
in the Restricted Zone.
