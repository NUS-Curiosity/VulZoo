... and here it comes ;-)

I tested http://nstx.dereference.de/snippets/qex.c
against 3 selfcompiled qpopper4.0.4 on 3 different machines.

I can confirm, that on one machine "it worked", i got
a shell.

More interesting for me is of course, if you can provide
a patch against 4.0.4 to close this vulnerability.
