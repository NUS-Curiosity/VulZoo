The cause for this bug is already identified and the fix is really
simple, I didn't see a reason to delay the post. It wasn't my intention
to cause you trouble, if I did so, I'm sorry. I had bad experience
informing vendors in the past, so I skipped that in this case.
For example, some time ago I reported the (non-exploitable) bug in
pop_msg.c, line 254f.:
free(local_element.mdef_macro); /* From strdup */
return pop_msg(p, POP_SUCCESS, HERE, "Macro \"%s\" accepted",
               local_element.mdef_macro);
and I didn't get a reply. Perhaps you want to fix this flaw too, in fc2.

Florian Heinz
