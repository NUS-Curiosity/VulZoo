- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It has been reported that OpenSSH/OpenSSL that ships with IRIX has several
security vulnerabilities that may lead to root access on vulnerable systems.

1) buffer.c vulnerability fixed in OpenSSH 3.7 (CAN-2003-0693)
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=106373247528528&w=2
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0693

2) More buffer management vulnerabilities fixed in OpenSSH 3.7.1 (CAN-2003-0695)
    http://www.openssh.com/txt/buffer.adv
    http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-24.html
    http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/333628
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0695

3) Openwall's "memory" security fixes to OpenSSH 3.7.1 (CAN-2003-0682)
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0682

4) ssh-keysign cores dump on IRIX (SGI BUG 899663)

5) Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities in ASN.1 parsing
    http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt
    http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2003/006489/openssl.htm
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0543
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0544
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0545

Please note that the OpenSSH which ships with IRIX is NOT vulnerable
to the two recent PAM vulnerabilities found in portable OpenSSH 3.7/3.7.1:
    http://www.openssh.com/txt/sshpam.adv
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0786
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0787

    * However, the Freeware OpenSSH from http://freeware.sgi.com/
    is PAM enabled and possibly vulnerable to these issues.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These vulnerabilities have been corrected in future releases of OpenSSH
and OpenSSL for IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

OpenSSH client is installed by default on IRIX 6.5.19 and above.  OpenSSH
server is provided on IRIX 6.5.19 and above, but not installed by default.
OpenSSL libraries are installed by default on IRIX 6.5.19 and above

To determine the version of OpenSSH you are running, execute the
following command:

  % versions -b openssh openssl

This will return a result similar to the following output:

 I = Installed, R = Removed

  Name     Date        Description
I openssh  09/16/2003  OpenSSH server and client tools, 3.6.1p2
I openssl  09/16/2003  openssl libraries, 0.9.7b

If the output is similar to the above, then OpenSSH/OpenSSL are installed
and the system may be vulnerable unless patched.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these vulnerabilities.
SGI recommends upgrading OpenSSH and OpenSSL


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided new OpenSSH/OpenSSL packages for these vulnerabilities.

This OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 package has the fixes backported from OpenSSH 3.7.1p2:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/patches/6.5.22/openssh.tardist

This OpenSSL 0.9.7b package has the fixes backported from OpenSSL 0.9.7c:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/patches/6.5.22/openssl.tardist

The MD5 checksum for these packages are:
ae84674cd118671feba4ae4dfe2c8718  openssh.tardist
3dd6dcdc543d179137c1d5d69b1696e8  openssl.tardist
An MD5 checksum tool called md5sum can be found on http://freeware.sgi.com/

Our recommendation is to update both OpenSSH and OpenSSL packages, as they
are a matched set.  Both packages are from IRIX 6.5.22 Applications CD and
can be installed on IRIX 6.5.19 and above.

SGI Freeware team has also provided an updated OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 package
available from http://freeware.sgi.com/Dist/fw_openssh-3.7.1p2.tardist
Freeware is not supported by SGI.
