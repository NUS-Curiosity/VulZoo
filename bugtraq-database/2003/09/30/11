Packages updated:	openssl
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0543 CAN-2003-0544
Date:			Mon Sep 29 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-022-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>

Description:
  The UK National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC)
  has commissioned an audit of OpenSSL, similar to the audit performed
  on SNMP by Oulu Security Programming Group. Stephen Henson, of the
  OpenSSL core team, has analysed the results and produced a patch to
  address the problems found.

  NISCC's description of the problem: "An unusual ASN.1 tag value can
  cause an out of bounds read under certain circumstances resulting in a
  Denial of Service condition. [...] For example, if one of the parties
  involved in a TLS/SSL connection sends an ASN.1 element that cannot
  be handled properly, the behaviour of the receiving application may be
  unpredictable. It has been found that a vulnerability can arise where
  one of the parties generates an exceptional ASN.1 element as part of
  a client certificate. A Denial of Service may arise in the receiving
  application, or there may be an opportunity for further exploitation."

  Immunix, Inc., would like to thank Stephen Henson for the patches and
  NISCC for preparing the SSL test suite.
