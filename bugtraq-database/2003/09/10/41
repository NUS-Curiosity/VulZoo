A court order might be able to tell you that they want to tap some
individual, and you have to co-operate in such a way that the target
will not notice this. However, *nothing* can order you to stay in
business. The obvious move would have been to tear down the anonymiser
and stop doing business. I am sure under Dutch law, I could stop the service.
I strongly suspect this is true for at least most of Europe.
