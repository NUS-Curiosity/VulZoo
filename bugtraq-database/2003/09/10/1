Just so we are clear, the firewall wouldn't tbe he right place to catch 
this because that string could be split by packet fragmentation, so you'd 
need to look for it at an application level, after the data stream 
has been reassembled.  

Of course, if anyone thinks it is easier to protect their browser with a 
proxy than fix the browser they've got other issues.
