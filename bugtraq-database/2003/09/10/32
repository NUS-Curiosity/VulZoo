HijackClick: 1+1=2.

[tested]
Browser Ver
{ 
MS Internet Explorer: 6.0.2600.0000.xpclnt_qfe.021108-2107;
Encryption: 128-bit;
Patch:; Q810847; 
}
(So, it's far from fully patched.) 
OS Ver: "Windows XP Cn ver"

[demo]
(POF VER) 
http://www.safecenter.net/liudieyu/HijackClick/HijackClick-MyPage.HTM
or
http://umbrella.mx.tc 
---> HijackClick section
---> HijackClick-MyPage file

(ATTACK VER)
http://www.safecenter.net/liudieyu/HijackClick/HijackClick2-MyPage.HTM
or
http://umbrella.mx.tc 
---> HijackClick section
---> HijackClick2-MyPage file

[exp]
dragNdrop!
for image, it copies file.
for link, it creates shortcut.

but, some guy is lazy. 
he moves the window instead of the mouse. 
then a click event(mousedown&mouseup) becomes
mousedown&mousemove&mouseup == dragNdrop.


then "POF VER" in the "[demo]" section shows a click
indeed can be transformed into a dragNdrop. 
then "ATTACK VER" in the "[demo]" section drags my
homepage to your favorite list.

[how]
special thanks to:
the lazy guy mentioned in the "[exp]" section:
his handle is "jelmer";
and his great invention "internet explorer local file
reading";
and myself :-)
for some trivial work.

[greetings]
the Pull, dror, guninski, http-equiv, jelmer and
"Friedrich L.Bauer".
of course, mom and dad.

best wishes
