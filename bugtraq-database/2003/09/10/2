Subject: RE: Winrar doesn't determine the actual size of compressed files


This looks very bad to me.

I've tested it on a Linux machine with unrar 2.71, which comes with most distributions. Same unrar binary is used by anti-virus scanner.

Result is the following:

$ unrar x -v test123.rar

UNRAR 2.71 freeware      Copyright (c) 1993-2000 Eugene Roshal


Extracting from test123.rar

Extracting  MAIL.DWN
MAIL.DWN             - CRC failed
Total errors: 1

As CRC failed, unrar will delete this file immediately but during the extraction it'll create nice 1GB file.

As I wrote above, same unrar binary is used by anti-virus scanner (amavisd-new in this case), so this is creates a very nasty possibility of DoS attack on servers.

Solution is to download and install the latest version from WinRAR's Website:

http://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm

Particulary, for Unix/Linux get it's source:
