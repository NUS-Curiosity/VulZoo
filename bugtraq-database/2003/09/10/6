Subject: We have implemented an instant windows password cracker




Hello,
We have implemented an instant windows password cracker named RainbowCrack.
It is based on Philippe Oechslin's faster time-memory trade-off technique.
(http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/php_code/publications/search.php?ref=Oech03)

This tool is an specialized LanManager hash cracker. On an 666MHz 
workstation, we can:
1. Crack 10 alpha passwords in 74 seconds
2. Crack 10 alpha-numeric passwords in 184 seconds

It is absolutely cryptanalysis!
