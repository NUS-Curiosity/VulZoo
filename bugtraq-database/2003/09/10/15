These discrepancies might be due to differences in how web browsers
render "bad" HTML, rather than a quirk in phpBB.

Since the first example URL doesn't have a closing double-quote
character in the onclick value, some browsers may ignore it
altogether.

It seems likely that some types of XSS-style attacks would only work
in certain web browsers.

Which browsers (and versions) were used when testing this bug?
