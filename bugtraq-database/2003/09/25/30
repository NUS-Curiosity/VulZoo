Subject: RE: Privacy leak in VeriSign's SiteFinder service #2


What's more, the old MTA was just a dupe - it would return set responses
regardless of what was passed to it.  As can be seen from the following
example posted to the IETF list:

----------snip---------
220 snubby2-wceast Snubby Mail Rejector Daemon v1.3 ready
blah
250 OK
blah
250 OK
blah
550 User domain does not exist.
blh
250 OK
blah
221 snubby2-wceast Snubby Mail Rejector Daemon v1.3 closing transmission 
channel
----------snip---------

As of Tuesday 16th September the MTA was replaced for a more RFC-compliant
one.

There's been an interesting discussion on this subject on the IETF list for
the last couple of weeks, based around Verisign initiating a wildcard A
record for the .com and .net zones.  I don't want to repeat the discussion
here, but it makes interesting reading for some background on this issue.

Moreover, they're still working on this SMTP server. Just one week ago,
they were running another Postfix-like MTA, with completely different
behaviour:

8< snip >8

What if Verisign is planning to open more similar TCP/IP services on that
host? What if they're going to further modify the existing ones, to better
invade individuals' privacy?
