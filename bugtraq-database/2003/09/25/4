this runs counter to the maxim of Postel
<http://www.postel.org/postel.html>:

"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send." 
-- jon 
RFC-1122 (originates in RFC760)

`"What would Jon have done?", we will think, as we wrestle in the
days ahead with the problems Jon kept so well tamed for so many years.'
--Vint Cerf
RFC 2468
