They did setup a mail server for the wild card tld. You send that mail you 
suggested and they get your to and from out of it then disconnect you.

--tim

nslookup -type=MX sdfsgggdfasfasdf.com
Server:  ns1.bluegravity.com
Address:  64.57.64.2

com
         origin = a.gtld-servers.net
         mail addr = nstld.verisign-grs.com
         serial = 2003092500
         refresh = 1800 (30M)
         retry   = 900 (15M)
         expire  = 604800 (1W)
         minimum ttl = 86400 (1D)
