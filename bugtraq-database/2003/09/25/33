Your premise is unacceptable. By this reasoning, would you consider
 it okay for the major backbone carriers to intercept any cleartext
 sent across their lines and pass the data to marketers/Ashcroft/etc?

HTTP may not be encrypted, but it is point-to-point, not broadcast.

IANAL either, but I would consider it much closer to wiretapping.
 Verisign is NOT the intended recipient of typo traffic, but it is
 intentionally gathering that data.
