     It depends how you interpret it.  I'd interpret the rejection as being
conservative on the sending side--leaving the data as is would violate
_that_.  I could see an argument for correcting malformed data where
possible (e.g. cutting off all data after the first = sign), but that
raises the question of how to know that you're transmitting the same
content that the sender intended.  Particularly in cases like this, where
the standard is ambiguous, the only "safe" options with respect to
preserving the content are to send the data on as is or reject it entirely,
and in that case I think Postel's maxim would lean toward rejection; the
"liberal" part is only for data you can accurately interpret.
