And if someone try to ddos/attack some host that is not really, for example
wlfkqspfqwekalsdkfsdfal.com .
They will not can send a judicial process, will?
After all, would not be sent to their just to some idiot host that they
got..
And, its legally, they match all the hostnames?
For example, if cocacola.com, have there cokacola.com, the same sounds
equal.. they could to process verysign, no?
Any lawyer on the list?
On my point of view its not right.
