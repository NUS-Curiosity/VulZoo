Up to now, e-mails addressed to misspelled mail domains will not be sent
to Verisign's Fake-SMTP-service as MX records are used for mail-domain
resolving. Verisign did not set up wildcard MX records.

However, if you configure your E-Mail-Program or local
Mail-Transfer-Agent and misspell the hostname of the SMTP-Server for
outgoing mail, all outgoing mail will be sent to their Fake-SMTP service.

What if Versign is planning to add wildcard MX records as well, so that
any mail addressed to mistyped/non-existant mail domains like
"foobar@...sgggdfasfasdf.com" will be sent to their fake SMTP service?

Expect the worst!
