I see Microsoft references COM Internet Services and RPC over HTTP in the 
FAQ section of this bulletin, but nowhere else (like the technical 
description). Everywhere else, they reference only RPCSS. I am assuming 
that this vulnerability exists regardless of the installation status of 
CIS or RPC over HTTP? 

Thanks
