Subject: Computer Sabotage by Microsoft


Hi,

well it finally happened. I came back home after work, connected my
XBOX to the internet and went into the XBOX-Live menu configuration.
Well what happened. The XBOX started automaticly downloading the new
crappy XBOX-Live dashboard, which is of course fixed. 

This is IMHO an act of computer sabotage. I have never allowed MS
to modify my dashboard or to auto update my dashboard.

Is any lawyer on the list who can point me to the right paragraphs?
I do not believe this computer sabotage is legal in any european
country.

Yours,
Stefan Esser
