---------------------------------------------------

yesterday, i posted many documents to bugtraq.
all related files were stored at SAFECENTER.NET.
then my friends told me SAFECENTER.NET is out of the order.
but SAFECENTER.NET is still accessible here: CN/HN/XT/(ZIP:411105).
and of course, i always verify Urls of files for twice before posting.

from now on, all related files will be attached in the posts.

sorry for the inconvenience.

BTW, if you happen to have some web space and would like to host my web 
site, give me a shout.



best wishes,

die
