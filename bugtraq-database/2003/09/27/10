Doesn't this just constitute special pleading to use Microsoft's products?
For example, this theory is totally unfalsifiable - only Microsoft products
are in such a position.

Oh, wait.  Apache has about 2 times the market share of IIS, and I'm
still getting Code Red and Nimda hits TWO YEARS after they were released.

By contrast, I only got about 2 days worth of hits from Slapper.

Yeah, I guess you're right: Apache's 60% market share is just not "juicy"
enough.  Despite it being so much easier to write Linux shell code than
Win32 shell code.
