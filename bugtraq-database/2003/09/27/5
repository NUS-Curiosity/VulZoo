Depending on what you're referring to...

Having quickly (and I emphasise, quickly) looked at icmp_error_track()
in ip_conntrack_core.c, it does not impose any kind of limit on the
number of ICMP messages allowed back in, meaning for one UDP packet
sent out, you could send back 100,000 ICMP messages saying "time exceeded"
or however many will go through until the entry expires (which may be
never if an ICMP error message updates the time.)  Anyway, I've only
spent 5 minutes finding what looks like a likely suspect of a function
and not what calls it, etc, where other checking may exist.

I'm not completely convinced that the original poster knew very much
about what they were writing nor understood what is meant to happen
very well either, leaving us with a somewhat confused and scattered
analysis.  The threat here is extremely low unless a vendor happens
to do a very bad implementation of allowing ICMP errors back in.
