Only if a sending host is misbehaving will you ever get more than 1
redirect per packet flow as routers beyond the first hop should not
be sending redirects that make it back to the origin.

So what if a source quench gets dropped ? In situations where it's
likely to be sent, it getting dropped is more likely than normal.

And since you're quoting RFC's...

I have to wonder whether or not you read the OpenBSD source code before
saying this or maybe the OpenBSD source code is missing this comment
that I can see in NetBSD's IP code:

                 * a router should not generate ICMP_SOURCEQUENCH as
                 * required in RFC1812 Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers.
                 * source quench could be a big problem under DoS attacks,
                 * or if the underlying interface is rate-limited.

RFC 1812, section 4.3.3.3 (page 57) discusses this.

It won't break any version of traceroute that I'm aware of.

> So, what do we gain by rate limiting the ICMP errors?

If I send 1 UDP packet out, how many ICMP errors should I ever
receive that match it ?  1 ?  10 ?  100 ?  Up to the ttl value
of the packet as it passed through ?  What does your experience
tell you?  What do you consider "normal" vs what should be
considered "acceptable" ?

On the other end of this, have *you* had any experience with rate
limited ICMP error message generation ?  If you did, did traceroute
not work because it was present ?
