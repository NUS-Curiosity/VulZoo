Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.3 Open UNIX 8.0.0 : Sendmail: buffer overflow in versions 8.12.8 and prior.
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.23
Issue date: 		2003 September 22

1. Problem Description

	There is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in sendmail
	that could allow an attacker to gain control of a vulnerable
	sendmail server. 
	
	Due to a variable type conversion problem (char to signed int), 
	sendmail may not adequately check the length of address tokens. 
	A specially crafted email message could trigger a stack overflow. 

	This vulnerability was discovered by Michal Zalewski. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2003-0161 to this issue.
