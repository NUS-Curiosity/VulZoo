Issue date: 19 Sept. 2003
Update    : Powerslave 4.4.3pl3
Affected  : Powerslave 4.3
=========================================================

Summary:
========

The Powerslave rapid prototyping server unites all
functions of a high end content management system and
offers in addition a development platform for a whole
abundance of applications.

Powerslave features a powerfull Url-rewrite function
who can be used to obtain Informations about the Database-
Structur and under certain conditions execute arbitary
SQL-Code (not tested).


Informations:
=============

Powerslave 4.3 allows URL-rewriting: instead of the PHP
standard "?" in the URL, variables are seperated by colons.
This helps e.g. Google to spider and index the site.

If you enter arbitary sql-commands after the sql-id field
in the Document-URL you can obtain informations about
the Database-Structure.


Example:

http://example.com/powerslave,id,10;,nodeid,,_language,uk.html
                                   |
                                   |- ; or modified querys
                                        and table-numbers.
