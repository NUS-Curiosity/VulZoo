I'm rellay not an expert in building a firewall with a Linux box, but I've 
tried twice and now I have two customers happy of their unexpensive Linux 
based firewall. These firewalls offer also NAT functionality to the 
respective LANs they protect and use iptables rules with stateful inspection 
to filter the packets. Both customers have a DNS in between the linux 
firewall and the ISP's router. Are they vulnerable to any of those attacks?
