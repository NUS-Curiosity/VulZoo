IANAL, but my recollection is that U.S. case law distinguishes between
unintentionally intercepting something, and intentionally intercepting
it.  There was, for instance, a case of someone intercepting microwave
long distance telephone conversations, and their argument was that since
AT&T was transmitting the microwaves across their property, they
were delivering it to them and they could do what they wanted with it.
The courts did not agree with that argument, and basically said (IIRC)
that if it is intended to be point to point, and you have to make an
effort to intercept it (in this case, erecting a microwave antenna and
receiver), then you are not entitled to do it.  Thus, it may be (depending
on the exact wording of current law) possible to make a strong argument
that by deliberately intercepting point-to-point transmissions not
intended for them, Verisign is conducting an illegal wiretap (or perhaps
millions of counts of individual wiretaps).

Again, I don't know what the current law actually says, so I don't
know whether there is anything behind that conjecture.  It seems worth
looking in to, though.
