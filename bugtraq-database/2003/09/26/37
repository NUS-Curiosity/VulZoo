______________________________________________________________________________
                           SGI Security Advisory

  Title     : DCE 1.2.2c Denial of Service Vulnerability
  Number    : 20030902-01-P
  Date      : September, 26 2003
  Reference : CVE CAN-2003-0746
  Reference : SGI BUG 897593
  Fixed in  : Patches 5313/5314 for DCE 1.2.2c

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It has been reported that certain Microsoft RPC scanning can cause the
DCE daemon dced to abort, causing a denial of service vulnerability.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0746 to this issue:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0746

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

This vulnerability has been corrected with patches to DCE 1.2.2c and in
potential future releases of DCE.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

DCE is an optional product, not installed by default.

To determine the version of DCE you are running, execute the following
command:

  % versions -b  dce dce_domestic

This will return a result similar to the following output:

 I = Installed, R = Removed

 Name             Date    Description

 I dce          08/01/2003 Distributed Computing Environment, 1.2.2c
 I dce_domestic 08/01/2003 Distributed Computing Environment(domestic), 1.2.2c

If the output is similar to the above, then DCE is installed and the
system may be vulnerable unless patched.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for this vulnerability.
SGI recommends either upgrading DCE (when available), or installing
the appropriate patch from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for this vulnerability.
Our recommendation is to upgrade DCE (when available), or
install the appropriate patch.

For international version of DCE 1.2.2c, install patch 5313.
For domestic version of DCE 1.2.2c, install both patch 5313 and 5314.

Note that, for export control reasons, the domestic patch 5314
will not be made available on the patches.sgi.com FTP site,
and must be obtained from your SGI support representative.

Older versions of DCE are potentially vulnerable, but are
no longer supported. No patches are available for older unsupported
DCE releases.
