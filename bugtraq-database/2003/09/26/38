There's one box out there still trying to send me 80-90 per day with no
signs of letting up anytime soon, as it still thinks it's around October 15, 2002.

I could see an hour off. A day off. A month off.  I remember once case where
the box was 365 days and 4 minutes off.  But 11 months and change???
