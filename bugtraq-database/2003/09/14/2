Subject: IIS6 Security Issues


I've been watching the lists for while looking for postingsof IIS6 flaws. I
have only seen one to date. It was regarding IIS6 sessions and how poorly
implemented they were. It also disclosed a possible attack vector on local
accounts using the Admin pages. I haven't verified these yet. 

Has anyone heard of any other issues, problems, wierdities, etc with IIS6?
Give as many details as possible.
