The sale *is* legal and the EULA is *not* part of it. An EULA could be
part of the sales contract, if the contract was closed directly with
Microsoft *and* the customer had the chance to read the EULA *before*
closing the contract. Neither of these conditions is true.
Microsoft sells their Product to wholesellers, they sell it to retailers
and those sell it to customers. So Microsoft has a contract with the
wholeseller, the wholeseller with the retailer and the retailer with the
customer. There is _no_contract_ between Microsoft and the customer.
Plus, german law states, that a manufacturer cannot stipulate how their
product should be used, once they have sold it. This is called
"Erschoepfungsgrundsatz".

You are wrong.

Right now I am not wasting my time argueing over this.

Please correct me, if I'm wrong, but isn't that exactly what Microsoft
(as well as almost any other software vendor) try to rule out by their
EULAs?
