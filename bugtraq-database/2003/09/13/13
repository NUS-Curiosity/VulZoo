So was your COO egregiously misquoted?  What did he actually say that Wired
interpreted as:

  "   firm Symantec, who called for legislation to criminalize 
   the sharing of information and tools online that can be 
   used by malicious hackers and virus writers." 

I'm having a hard time reconciling your posting with what Schwarz was
attributed with saying.  Now, it's quite possible that he was misquoted, or
that he actually said that but the context is missing, or that he said it as a
straw-man or extreme position for the sake of argument - hey, I've personally
often suggested the cheapest solution to the spam problem is to have every ISP
chip in $500 and hire some <insert ethnic> muscle to "explain our position" to
the spammers.  That doesn't mean I actually think it should be done...

In fact, I'm almost convinced that something like that happened - but I think
we'd all feel a lot better if we heard the story behind the quote so we know HOW
it happened.....
