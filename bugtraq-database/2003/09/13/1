Subject: DCOM Paper Part I




A paper I wrote last night on the new DCOM bug, containing lots of Ollydbg hints and tricks. Most likely useful to people who already are trying to exploit it, and probably not a paper for management to read. Read it now before Symantec, Microsoft, and the rest of oisaftey get this kind of information "criminalized".
