Subject: OpenSSH Buffer Management Bug Advisory



The following advisory is listed on the OpenSSH security page.  It was up
some time ago before disappearing for a while and then reappearing in the
last few minutes.

---

Subject: OpenSSH Security Advisory: buffer.adv

This is the 1st revision of the Advisory.

This document can be found at:  http://www.openssh.com/txt/buffer.adv

1. Versions affected:

        All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7 contain a buffer
        management error.  It is uncertain whether this error is
        potentially exploitable, however, we prefer to see bugs
        fixed proactively.

2. Solution:

	Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.7 or apply the following patch.
