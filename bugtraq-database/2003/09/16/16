Great. 

So RedHat says the SSH issue is exploitable. FreeBSD says it is not
believed to be exploitable. And I believe Theo said the same for
OpenBSD. Is RedHat just scare mongering? Is there any proof of
exploitation (other than a Dos)? Does someone have a proof of all those
alleged exploitations going on all around world? Is the sky falling
again?
