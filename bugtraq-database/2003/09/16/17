	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	openssh
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0693
Date:			Tue Sep 16 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-020-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  A vulnerability has been reported in OpenSSH that is rumoured to be
  remotely exploitable for root privileges, even in the face of privsep.
  The bug is in the buffer_append_space() function, which operates on
  Buffer structs; these structs have a buffer initialized through
  malloc(), so StackGuard is unlikely to have any impact on any
  potential exploits.

  The vulnerability comes when the fatal() function calls cleanup
  handlers that rely on potentially corrupted data. This patch corrects
  buffer_append_space() to maintain consistent state.
