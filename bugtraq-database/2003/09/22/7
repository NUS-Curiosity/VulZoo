You know whats ironic about this? Maybe snort.org wasnt owned (ha! for
the sake of argument now) but we know that some affiliated machines where
indeed 0wn3d. Wait a minute I said the plural of 'machine' now didnt
I BMC? Chough cough. Oh, that wasn't your machine, it was your upstream.
Or hrmmm did you know about this already? (I'm sure youve known for YEARS
right?)

Hey as long as the dumb asses buying your book and drinking your juice
dont know any different about what a 1337 h4x0r/antihaxor you are. Glad
someone can make a quick buck off feeding them bullshit they dont know
any better to question. Also glad theyre the ones were supposed to worry
about!!

While were talking about BMC's email)

Why half the original Sourcefire developers left within the past few
weeks? Why do others continue to pepper the world with their lame resumes?


I thought someone was going to fork the Snort source tree into a publicly
driven project the rest of us could care about. What happened about that?

why does SANS drive Snort so dam hard when Northcutt is one of the original
investors in Sourcefire? f'ed-up...
