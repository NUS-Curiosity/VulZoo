Now for a somewhat different perspective on the whole thing....

Hmmm. So, "guess"+"validated"+"positively true"(vs "mostly true") ==
"credible" ???

Given the fact that you heard the rumors of massive injections of
strcpy() into the main Snort CVS repository on an IRC channel and not
published to the community at large, what other sources do you cite in
order to arrive at your decision that this is a "credible" incident??

Code audit after a system compromise; a prudent and effective way of
maintaining code integrity.

Exposed?? You still haven't demonstrated that the "rumors" you heard
were, in fact, more than just rumors.

Again, what did we supposedly learn from some bh's releasing a fake
phrack? I believe they've succeded in demonstrating how quickly some
people claiming to be "in the IDS discipline" can be made to jump to
conclusions at the drop of a few "catch phrases" or half-truths.

Yes, you do. 

That's why you download it in source code format, and not in
pre-compiled binaries such as those released by other companies "in the
industry". IDS is only the leading-edge (topologically speaking)
technical representation of a company's policy/process structure. As has
been said repeatedly, where you go from there is up to you.

Gee, it must suck to be the target of a Social engineering hack, eh ???
