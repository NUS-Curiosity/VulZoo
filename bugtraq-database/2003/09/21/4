Package        : ipmasq
Vulnerability  : insecure packet filtering rules
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CAN-2003-0785

ipmasq is a package which simplifies configuration of Linux IP
masquerading, a form of network address translation which allows a
number of hosts to share a single public IP address.  Due to use of
certain improper filtering rules, traffic arriving on the external
interface addressed for an internal host would be forwarded,
regardless of whether it was associated with an established
connection.  This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker
capable of forwarding IP traffic with an arbitrary destination address
to the external interface of a system with ipmasq installed.

For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 3.5.10c.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.12.

We recommend that you update your ipmasq package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
