Hey, has anyone else seen this:

http://www.phrack.nl/phrack62/p62-0x0d.txt

It looks like the PHC folks are at it again, the above is an article
on "sneeze", a new script that will generate traffic to trigger on every
snort rule. 

Also, appended to the end of the article is the home dirs of everyone
at Sourcefire/Snort. You can see what is in Marty's directory, etc. Go
check it out.
