Tom:

3.7.p1 is 3.7, portable -- it is NOT 3.7.1.

"The portable OpenSSH follows development of the official version, but 
releases are not synchronized. Portable releases are marked with a 'p' 
(e.g. 3.7.1p1). The official OpenBSD source will never use the 'p' 
suffix, but will instead increment the version number when they hit 
'stable spots' in their development."
