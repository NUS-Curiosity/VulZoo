Subject: Re: Verisign abusing .COM/.NET monopoly, BIND releases new


FYI ... looks like Verisign has pulled the wildcard A record as we have 
not patched but invalid domain searches no longer go to verisign ... 
sitefinder-idn.verisign.com is no longer responding to queries ... maybe 
someone got the message ... wonder how they will explain this one ...
