Subject: RE: BAD NEWS: Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-032


Updated antivirus will only catch specific instances of POC code, not
any actual reallife exploitation which easily differ significantly in
footprint and signature.

It's been a constant nuisance the last few years that whenever you
release any kind of POC the AV vendors will label it as a virus and have
their customers feel safe whenever they try to demonstrate publicly
available POC code, while still doing nothing to hinder exploitation of
the actual vulnerability.

AV vendors should realize that their approach to security often will
lead to greater insecurity, I have no count of the number of people
writing me and telling me they would not install a potentially
systemdamaging patch since my public POC didn't work anyway on their
system because of their superior AV product.

Out of sight, out of mind..

Updated antivirus software should catch this exploit and prevent any
application from being launched. We have McAfee VirusScan 7 Ent. which
caught both exploit examples at http://greymagic.com/adv/gm001-ie/
