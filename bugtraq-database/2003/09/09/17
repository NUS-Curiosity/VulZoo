Windows 98 no longer receive any security updates, so the behavior of
using WindowsUpdate under Windows 98 is undefined at best.

Subject: Microsoft security update broken?


The microsoft security update for MS03-023 downloaded via the windows
update web site appears to be broken.  Either the patch does not
properly install or is not able to be detected by the web based update
scan after install.

Symptoms:  running the update-scan at www.windowsupdate.com after having
already installed the MS03-023 update will continue to indicate the
MS03-023 patch has not yet been installed on the target system, under
windows 98.  I've rebooted and rescanned a win98 system 4 times and
every time it comes up saying the patch has not been installed.  I
haven't tested this on other windowws platforms yet.

Has anyone else noticed this?  Is it just my systems with the problem?
Could the microsoft update not really be installing or maybe the update
scan isn't looking for the correct files?
