All 2.0.x are vulnerable - that string is missing
a quote before the javascript code, as phpBB will
quote the beginning of the string and the end of it
on it's own (so your quote at the end should not be
there either).

Although browsers will ignore onclick for A, they won't
ignore onblur and so on. So yes, it's vulnerable.
The fix is somewhat simple though, I don't see why
the phpBB folks are taking so long, this is a critical
bug.
