Subject: RE: Microsoft security update broken?

I've run into the same problem on other machines... I think it has something
to do with the order of patches installed on windows update... if you just
grab them all, it breaks... the only way I've gotten around it is to
download the patch manually and install it that way.  On some other
instances, it didn't detect that IE6 was installed when doing it manually,
so I had to re-install IE6 before I could manually install the patch, then
after that it was fine.

Hope that helps...

Adrian

The microsoft security update for MS03-023 downloaded via the windows update
web site appears to be broken.  Either the patch does not properly install
or is not able to be detected by the web based update scan after install.
Symptoms:  running the update-scan at www.windowsupdate.com after having
already installed the MS03-023 update will continue to indicate the MS03-023
patch has not yet been installed on the target system, under windows 98.
I've rebooted and rescanned a win98 system 4 times and every time it comes
up saying the patch has not been installed.  I haven't tested this on other
windowws platforms yet.  Has anyone else noticed this?  Is it just my
systems with the problem?  Could the microsoft update not really be
installing or maybe the update scan isn't looking for the correct files?
