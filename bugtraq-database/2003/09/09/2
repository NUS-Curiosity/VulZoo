the MS03-023 patch has not yet been installed on the target system,

and every time it comes up saying the patch has not been installed.  I
haven't tested this on other windowws platforms yet.

 Could the microsoft update not really be installing or maybe the update
scan isn't looking for the correct files?

I've seen the same thing. I was trying to install SP3 on a new machine,
and both the express install, as well as the download of the entire
install threw errors. The express install went down 3/4 of the way
through, while the full download said it was a corrupt file.

Other updates behaved the same way.

Later,
