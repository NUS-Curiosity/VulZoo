luckily, i think anyone that actually reads the entire man page would
understand that.  ;)  from FreeBSD's inetd(8),

"
-c maximum
        Specify the default maximum number of simultaneous invocations of
        each service; the default is unlimited.  May be overridden on a
        per-service basis with the "max-child" parameter.
-C rate
        Specify the default maximum number of times a service can be
        invoked from a single IP address in one minute; the default is
        unlimited.  May be overridden on a per-service basis with the
        "max-connections-per-ip-per-minute" parameter.
-R rate
        Specify the maximum number of times a service can be invoked in
        one minute; the default is 256.  A rate of 0 allows an unlimited
        number of invocations.
-s maximum
        Specify the default maximum number of simultaneous invocations of
        each service from a single IP address; the default is unlimited.
        May be overridden on a per-service basis with the "max-child-per-
        ip" parameter.
"

so there are much better ways to address the problem in modern inetds.
also, OS' i use make installing inetd at all optional.  furthermore, many
Linux' i'm familiar with make xinetd the default...  so this is anything
but 'default insecurity'.
