Subject: Re: IE 5.x keep-alive session hijacking


Dear Domas Mituzas,

I can't confirm this behaviour for IE 5.5 and 6.0. May be behaviour your
observe is a result of customer having his own proxy server (for example
something  like proxymitron, or some kind of ad killer, etc) before your
transparent   proxy   and   customer's   proxy   server   doesn't  strip
Proxy-connection  header before resending reply to IE, so IE thinks this
header  comes  from  proxy.  This  should  be  treated  as  proxy server
vulnerability. 3proxy doesn't have one :)
