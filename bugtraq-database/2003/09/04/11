Certainly!!! For Red Hat (and all the major distros), 
you have a zillion mirrors all over the world, and,
additionally, you can in extremely straightforward way
(e.g. wget -r) bulk download all the patches from any
of those mirrors and apply them in a glitch (rpm -F).

Even if DoS attacks against the official names, IPs or
whatever take place, you always have your "local"
mirror to download patches from, which will be named
as mymirrorsite.mymirrordomain.mycountry. And if the
guys from RedHat (et al.) are wise enough, they can
set up out of band channels to distribute the patches
to the mirrors in the event of a major DoS attack.

No single point of failure, as you can see.
