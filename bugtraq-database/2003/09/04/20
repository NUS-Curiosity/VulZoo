I think you are. I'm not sure about reading it correctly, either, but
two central parts of the patent seem to be that the object is embedded
in the web page (which is not the case for CGI etc. - they send whole
web pages) and that there is a communication channel between the program
and the browser window for communicating UI events to allow using the
program interactively. While the language is vague, this implies to me
events like mouse movements and clicks, keystrokes, etc, not just the
clicking on a submit button or link (which wouldn't have been any
innovation in 1994, forms did already exist).

The patent as a whole sounds very much like the embedded X servers which
appeared around 1995/96, IIRC. I think there was at least a free
implementation from the X11 consortium and a commercial one from
Hummingbird (both as plugins for Netscape).
