this is only partly a remedy. in our case VirusWall (in SMTP daemon mode)
detects the virus if an 'original' mail containing the SOBIG.F virus is
manually bounced (e.g.  by bouncing it in the mutt MUA) to our VirusWall.

if the bounce is made by qmail on the other side, the bounced mail
contains some more text and the original mail and it is not detected by
our VirusWall (Solaris, engine 5.6150, current pattern).

ScanMail on NT detects the virus either way.
