And of course you can do exactly the same thing for Microsoft patches
(the downloading that is.)  You just have to know where to go.  But that
is usually the realm of sysadmins.  Individual users (obviously) don't
seem to have a clue how to patch their machines or even that their
machines are infected and spewing like crazy.  Which is worse?
Automated updates that keep them patched or infected bots DDoSing the
world?

And you can do exactly the same thing for Microsoft patches.  In fact we
do exactly that here.  All Microsoft patches are stored locally and
distributed locally after thorough testing.

I wouldn't exactly call Akamai a single point of failure, would you?  I
suspect Microsoft's distribution is broader and deeper than any *nix
mirroring system.  (For those unfamiliar with Akamai,
http://www.akamai.com/, they distribute load for large volume sites over
a massive number of servers distributed all over the world.)  Perhaps
this proposed system isn't *your* cup of tea, but then you don't have to
participate.  As far as its impact on the Internet goes, I suspect we
would all be a great deal better off if updates were automated for those
who don't know how to do anything else.  For the clueful, you simply
disable them.
