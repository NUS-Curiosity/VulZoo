Subject: Microsoft WordPerfect Document Converter Exploit


You can find a simple exploit for the Eeye vulnerability on
Microsoft WordPerfect Document Converter Buffer Overflow :
http://valgasu.rstack.org/word.zip

Modify the source and add new targets OS. This exploit works
on several french Windows NT/2K with Word 2000 9.0.2812
but it's trivial to modify exploit for Word 2000 SR1 for example
(offset in file of eip isn't the same). Read source code and test 
your own system.
