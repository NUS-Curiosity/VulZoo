Actually, this isn't anywhere near computer sabotage and certainly isn't
illegal. First, the X-Box has never been marketed as a general purpose
computer system. It's marketed as a device to play/use certain media.
Second, Microsoft does have a right to implement security features to
protect their network from attack (even if the threat was created by their
own incompetence). Would you rather they simply deny you access to the
network until you upgrade? If they did so, would you not eventually upgrade
to gain access to the network? Microsoft has the right to say you MUST be at
a certain patch level to access their network. If you aren't comfortable
with that then you can choose to not ever connect to the network. And
Microsoft isn't the only company that is/has been doing this. I remember
several games in the early to mind 1990's that immediately downloaded the
latest patches when you connected to the network. They never prompted you to
see if you wanted to and nobody complained. This is no different.
