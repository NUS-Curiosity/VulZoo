	IANAL, but my understanding was that, at least in some European 
countries (esp. Germany), an EULA is not binding unless you sign it before 
you buy the product.  I'm given to understand that, at least here in 
Australia, no customers are made to sign anything before they buy an 
X-box.  I suspect that this is why the original poster specifically 
mentioned Europe.
