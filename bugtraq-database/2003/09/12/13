No, they don't. In Germany it is not legal to unilaterally modify a
sales contract that has already been agreed on (if the result of not
agreeing would be not being able to use the product). So EULAs are
simply not effective in almost every case.

Stefan, you might want to read into the AGBG [1] and consult a lawyer,
but (IANAL) I'm not sure how much of a chance this would have in courts.
