If you have a problem with KMail 1.5 then why didn't you try 1.5.1 or 
1.5.2 or 1.5.3? Why do you think we make bugfix releases? Do you really 
think that such an obvious bug wouldn't have been reported and fixed 
months ago?

The next time please try the lastest stable release before you issue a 
"Security Advisory". Furthermore you should probably re-read the 
definition of "Security Advisory" since you are obviously confusing a 
simple crash with a security problem (like an exploitable buffer 
overflow).
