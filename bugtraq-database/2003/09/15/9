 resources

Nice work Chris & Team;

For folks that want to check if an email sender domain is being served 
by an authoritative nameserver, don't have sendmail, and have 
SpamAssassin, I've submitted patches to the SpamAssassin project to add 
this check.

For those interested in adding this, the SA bug link is:

http://bugzilla.spamassassin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2432

Thanks,
Devin Nate
