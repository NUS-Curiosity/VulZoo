I think the part that sucks the most is the fact they automagically
perform some filtering on the search results that are presented to you.
For example: http://sitefinder.verisign.com/preferences.jsp

By default the service is set to: "Partial filtering: Explicit content
is removed from category results and presented last in search results"

They could of at least defaulted to a non-filtered approach to providing
the service...not that I am likely to be taking advantage of their
amazing free technology
