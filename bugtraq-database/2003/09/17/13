At least a BIND patch could be useful for ISP's running BIND or even be
reused in DJBDNS and similar.

For now, it is returning the same IP address, but I have no trouble
imagining Verisign evading DNS filters by changing the A records every
now and then. Any solution to prevent Verisigns greed should keep this
in mind.

Dropping DNS replies would just result in repeated DNS queries, changing
the reply to NXDOMAIN as it originally would have been would be better.
