OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

Package:             openssh
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= openssh-3.7p1-20030916 >= openssh-3.7.1p1-20030917
OpenPKG 1.3          <= openssh-3.6.1p2-1.3.1  >= openssh-3.6.1p2-1.3.2
OpenPKG 1.2          <= openssh-3.5p1-1.2.3    >= openssh-3.5p1-1.2.4

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to an OpenSSH [1] Security Advisory [0], 2nd revision, all
  versions of OpenSSH's sshd(8) prior to version 3.7.1 contain buffer
  management errors. The discovery of additional similar errors by
  Solar Designer show that version 3.7.1 is affected, too. Those errors
  may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by causing an
  incorrect amount of memory to be cleared and corrupting the heap on
  fatal cleanups.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned
  the id CAN-2003-0693 [2] to the problem, as initially explained
  in the 1st revision of the OpenSSH Security Advisory [0]. In the
  current 2nd revision, similar problems were described and fixed, too.
  Additionally, Solaris Designer found 4 more problematic instances
  of similar memory management errors. The corrected OpenPKG packages
  (see versions above) contain the collected bug fixes for all of those
  errors.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  openssh". If you have the "openssh" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

  Notice that the previous package versions openssh-3.7p1-20030916,
  openssh-3.6.1p2-1.3.1 and openssh-3.5p1-1.2.3 contain the bug fixes
  from the OpenSSH Security Advisory [0], 1st revision, only. You are
  strongly advised to upgrade to the latest package versions because of
  the contained additional bug fixes.

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get openssh-3.6.1p2-1.3.2.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig openssh-3.6.1p2-1.3.2.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild openssh-3.6.1p2-1.3.2.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/openssh-3.6.1p2-1.3.2.*.rpm
