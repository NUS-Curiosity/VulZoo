I have to disagree with one point, it's not because they can tell you your
password that it is
stored in plain text.

I think that many ISPs are neglecting security to a point that is
ridiculous.
A simple yet stupid example is that I spent alot of my personal time with my
ISP
before I actually convinced them to add SSL support to one of their
webservices
that allows us, users, to change our passwords online.

That is something trivial on a security point of vue.  The sad part is their
webservices
where anyone could actually verify if an account name is valid and could
even crack
it's password because of their bad designs.

All that to say paranoia is a good virtue.

I encourage this "strategy" and would even recommend using them whenever
possible.
