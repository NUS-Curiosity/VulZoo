Siphon (on which this tool is, err, 'based', so to speak) was a very
simple proof of concept utility. Neither Siphon, nor many other commercial
and non-commercial passive OS fingerprinters (standalone or built-in),
ever evolved past the point of checking DF and window size, and are hardly
kept up to date, with a handful of vague signatures.

P0f checks a total of over 20 packet characteristics, detects many complex
dependencies (such as wss-mss correlation, a common practice nowadays)
and is capable of recognizing the effects of certain network
configurations and so on, is way more suited to work in a production
system, etc. It is far superior to other implementations I am aware of.

So there is no big deal, but the tool is an advance in this field, I
believe, and is the only seriously maintained and extended implementation
in the open-source area (and probably in the closed-source world, too)...
live with it ;-)
