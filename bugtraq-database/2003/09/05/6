Subject: Re: Re: [tool] the new p0f 2.0.1 is now out


i have used ..

Archaeopteryx v.1.0
    Copyright C 1999-2001, Sektor:Security
Archaeopteryx is a Passive mode OS Identification Tool.
It is based off Siphon v.666 by SubTerrain. It has a great 
GUI and a highly configurable OS signature file. It uses
POSIX threads for multi-threading (pthreads for Win32). Also 
requires WinPCAP Drivers.



for well over a year and it is quite effective.
i mention this for the simple fact that.. uhh, 
you  all seem to be making such a big deal out of this passive tool.
