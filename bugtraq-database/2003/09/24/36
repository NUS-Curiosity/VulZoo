That depends on the purpose of the decoder.

If your anti-virus decoder stops there, but a virus writer knows that
the decoder used by some popular mail client keeps going, then your
program isn't going to detect his virus.

If you're looking for something that might be hidden, then you need to
decode in _every_ way that _any_ mail client (that you support) does,
lest you have false negatives.
