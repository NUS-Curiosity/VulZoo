Then this software is severly broken (MIME-wise), imho, and needs to be
updated/changed/dumed.

With this approach, you are always on the "one step behind" side of
the problem. It's only a matter of time that someone finds out that
(made up example:) you can use a UTF8-mis-encoded "=" in Microsoft's
base64-decoder... The only sane way is to check if it's in the
standard-form ("abcABC=") and reject or convert if it's not.

99.99% of all software should create the standard form, so please
let the tiny fraction of users with broken software suffer
when their mails get rejected.

(Note: this of course applies not only to Base64 but to all aspects
 of header-parsing, file-format guessing etc...)
