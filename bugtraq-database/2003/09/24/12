  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  "Shawn" <ASUU.Webmaster@...u.utah.edu> discovered and reported an SSH
  passphrase disclosure vulnerability in the WebTool's User Password
  Changer via the engarde-users mailing list.

  The Guardian Digital WebTool provides functionality allowing local users
  to generate their own SSH keys.  The problem lies in the fact that the
  data was being passed around via an HTTP GET instead of an HTTP POST,
  resulting in the users passphrase being logged in /var/log/userpass.log
  along with the rest of the query string.

  Guardian Digital products affected by this issue include:

    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.5

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.

SOLUTION
- --------
  Guardian Digital Secure Network subscribers may automatically update
  affected systems by accessing their account from within the Guardian
  Digital WebTool.
