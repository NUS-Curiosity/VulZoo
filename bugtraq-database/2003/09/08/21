Isn't that the point of system administration, to set reasonable values 
for such things.  A balance between a reasonable load and a full DOS 
attack on the service or machine must be achieved.

I don't see how this feature is bad as long as its used properly.  
Besides many people run multiple services on a host.. if you set the 
value to unlimited all services are DOS'd.  For instance, I have a 
system running apache, sendmail, and imapd.  imapd is spawned by inetd 
and therefore could be DOS'd with a limit.  By setting a limit though, 
my apache and sendmail servers stay up.  I think this is a no brainer.
