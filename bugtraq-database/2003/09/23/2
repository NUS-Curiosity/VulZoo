Subject: Multiple PAM vulnerabilities in portable OpenSSH


Subject: Portable OpenSSH Security Advisory: sshpam.adv

This document can be found at:  http://www.openssh.com/txt/sshpam.adv

1. Versions affected:

        Portable OpenSSH versions 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple 
        vulnerabilities in the new PAM code. At least one of these bugs 
        is remotely exploitable (under a non-standard configuration, 
        with privsep disabled). 

        The OpenBSD releases of OpenSSH do not contain this code and 
        are not vulnerable. Older versions of portable OpenSSH are not 
        vulnerable.

2. Solution:

        Upgrade to Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 or disable PAM 
        support ("UsePam no" in sshd_config). 

        Due to complexity, inconsistencies in the specification and 
        differences between vendors' PAM implementations we recommend 
        that PAM be left disabled in sshd_config unless there is a need 
        for its use. Sites only using public key or simple password 
        authentication usually have little need to enable PAM support.
