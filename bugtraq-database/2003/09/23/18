Internet Security Systems Security Brief
September 23, 2003

ProFTPD ASCII File Remote Compromise Vulnerability

Synopsis:

ISS X-Force has discovered a flaw in the ProFTPD Unix FTP server. ProFTPD
is a highly configurable FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server for Unix
that allows for per-directory access restrictions, easy configuration of
virtual FTP servers, and support for multiple authentication mechanisms.
A flaw exists in the ProFTPD component that handles incoming ASCII file
transfers.

Impact:

An attacker capable of uploading files to the vulnerable system can
trigger a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code to gain complete
control of the system. Attackers may use this vulnerability to destroy,
steal, or manipulate data on vulnerable FTP sites.

Affected Versions:

ProFTPD 1.2.7
ProFTPD 1.2.8
ProFTPD 1.2.8rc1
ProFTPD 1.2.8rc2
ProFTPD 1.2.9rc1
ProFTPD 1.2.9rc2

Note: Versions previous to version 1.2.7 may also be vulnerable.
