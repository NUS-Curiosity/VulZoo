Subject: Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 released


Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2  has just been released. It will be available 
from the mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/portable.html shortly.

Please note that this is a release to address issues in the portable 
version only. The items mentioned below do not affect the OpenBSD 
version.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18

Security Changes:
=================

  Portable OpenSSH version 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple 
  vulnerabilities in the new PAM authentication code. At least one of
  these bugs is remotely exploitable (under a non-standard 
  configuration, with privsep disabled).

  OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 fixes these bugs. Please note that these bugs do not 
  exist in OpenBSD's releases of OpenSSH.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.7.1p1:
==============================

* This release disables PAM by default. To enable it, set "UsePAM yes" in 
  sshd_config. Due to complexity, inconsistencies in the specification and
  differences between vendors' PAM implementations we recommend that PAM 
  be left disabled in sshd_config unless there is a need for its use. 
  Sites using only public key or simple password authentication usually 
  have little need to enable PAM support.

* This release now requires zlib 1.1.4 to build correctly. Previous 
  versions have security problems.

* Fix compilation for versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.6. Some cipher modes 
  are not supported for older OpenSSL versions.

* Fix compilation problems on systems with a missing or lacking inet_ntoa()
  function.

* Workaround problems related to unimplemented or broken setresuid/setreuid 
  functions on several platforms.

* Fix compilation on older OpenBSD systems.

* Fix handling of password-less authentication (PermitEmptyPasswords=yes) 
  that has not worked since the 3.7p1 release.
