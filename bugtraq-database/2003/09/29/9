Subject: Possible Apache directory rules bypass / override


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi ,
I'm testing somethings in Apache about the url parsing of the server
,
i don't now if the Apache server parse completely provided urls when
those urls are in this format:

[PROTOCOL HTTP / HTTPS ][SITE]/[DIR TO OVERRIDE RULES]/../[DIR TO
OVERRIDE RULES]/../[DIR TO OVERRIDE RULES]/../[DIR TO OVERRIDE
RULES]/../[DIR TO OVERRIDE RULES]/../../[DIR TO OVERRIDE
RULES]/../../../[DIR WITH NO RULES OR ACCESS CONTROL]/../[THE SAME NO
CONTROLLED DIR OR OTHER NOT CONTROLLED]/../../../../[DIR WITH NO
CONTROL RULES]/../

If this can be possible , it can't affect ip based access controls
but other controls can be affected , or not ?

This is not a vulnerability because i can't confirm it but i want to
check the source code , i'm open for 
suggestions .

i'm posting this because i'm a little confused , and other
possibilities , if the url is encoded ? does Apache check
correctly this when it is encoded ?

One thing is sure:  this can not affect ip based rules such as deny
or allow

PS: can be this related with the mod_write vulnerabilities ?

Regards,
