I ve just tested this code against my SMC 2404WBR. Firmware Version 1.0.10.
But it didnt work.

I saw a lot of UDP & ICMP on the air, but I could access the AP all the
time. Slower as normal but there was still a connection. As stopping the
attack after ~ 10 min everything was just normal.

I ran the attack against the wireless port.
Perhaps it only works on the WAN Port?
