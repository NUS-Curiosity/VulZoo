- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

 It has been reported that under certain conditions a vulnerability in
 sendmail could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the sendmail daemon, typically root. This effects
 all versions of sendmail including the latest version, 8.12.9.

 For more details please see:
 http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-25.html
 http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/784980
 http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2003-September/010287.html

 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
 assigned the name CAN-2003-0694 to this issue:
 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0694

 SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
 neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures

 be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.  This issue has been
 corrected in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

 sendmail is install by default on IRIX.

 To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
 command:

   # /bin/uname -R

 That will return a result similar to the following:

   # 6.5 6.5.21f

 The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.21f" in
 this case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name
 is the "version" we refer to throughout this document.

 If the output shows a release below 6.5.22, then the system may be
 vulnerable unless patched.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

 There is no effective workaround available for this vulnerability.

 SGI understands that there are times when upgrading the operating system or
 installing patches are inconvenient or not possible.  In those instances,
 we recommend to run the following as root:

   # chkconfig sendmail off

   # /etc/init.d/sendmail stop

 Of course, you will no longer have the services of the sendmail server
 after doing this.

 SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.22 (when available),
 or installing the appropriate patch from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

 SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
 recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.22, or install the appropriate
 patch.
