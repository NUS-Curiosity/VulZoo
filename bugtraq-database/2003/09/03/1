I think it's wonderful that in today's world, whenever we want to play:
"Pong" or "Claim Jumper," circa 1982, there's always someone out of the last
5 remaining earth-bound gamers warning us about a BO, r00ting the box and
possibly turning the Atari800 emulator into an Intellivision.Â®   Or worse.

I'm deeply encouraged that the last of the "Great Five Players" can safely
continue their gaming experience.   Just don't mess with "Pole Position...."
That's where I draw the line, OK?

Warmest personal regards,
