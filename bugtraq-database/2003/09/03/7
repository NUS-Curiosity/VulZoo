Subject: SMC Router safe Login in plaintext

I found that the SMC Barricade SMC-7404BRB safe the Login for the Provider safe in plaintext!!!

If you go to PPPoE and look a the source code you found the password in plaintext.
Here a pic from the HTML site:

If you look at Source you can find the line:
<input type="password" name="p_passwd" size="25" maxlength="60" value="00000000"></font> 
The password is safe in plaintext!!! 00000000 = password in plaintext
