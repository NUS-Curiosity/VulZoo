I have forwarded both of your HPUX issues on to HP (incase someone else 
did not)... I did not recieve the same rejection response you did so It 
appears as if the information was properly relayed on to them. I have 
also cc'd Rich Boren on the message since he was my last point of 
security contact with HP.
