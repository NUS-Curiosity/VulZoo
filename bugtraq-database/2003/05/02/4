So eBay doesn't have any phones?!?!?!?  Well that makes a lot of sense,
who out there wants to build with me one of the most successful internet
web sites and not give any support at all?

I have a friend who works for e-bay, there is NO phone support, only
e-mail which is rswebform@...y.com that should get you to someone.

I recommend calling support and asking to speak with a supervisor, and
then their supervisor's supervisor, etc. etc.  That's worked well for me
at a number of companies.
