Yeah, i was talking about FreeBSD-current, where OpenPAM has replaced
LinuxPAM, and new PAM modules have been introduced.

Speaking about FreeBSD 4.x, it doesn't seem to be vulnerable to the big
timing leak described in the advisory, even if doesn't uses the "nodelay"
option in /etc/pam.conf. I've not furtherly investigated this behaviour.

I believe, however, that all systems (FreeBSD included) are vulnerable to
many smaller timing leaks, and not only in OpenSSH. But i guess this is a
known problem.
