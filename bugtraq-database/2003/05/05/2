I.
    A. Background
       Hewlett-Packard Company has become aware of a defect in the
       Kermit communications software supplied with its operating
       system in various releases.

    B. Fixing the problem *REVISED01*
       The problem can be fully resolved by applying the appropriate
       patches to the system. For HP-UX releases
                     11.00:           PHCO_22665 ,
   --->>>            10.20:           PHCO_23319 ,
   --->>>            10.10:           PHCO_23320 ,
   --->>>            10.01:           PHCO_23321.

       While this patch does not require a reboot, appropriately
       terminating any instances of Kermit before installation of the
       patch will assure that continued operation with Kermit is now
       with the patched binaries.
