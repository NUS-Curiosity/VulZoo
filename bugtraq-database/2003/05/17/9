This is a bit of a silly advisory ... the recommended production
deployment for PHP is to point run-time error logging to a file,
and not the script output.

Have a look at the 'display_errors' and 'log_errors' entries
in your php.ini.  Once you set these appropriately, any PHP errors
(including the above) will be safely stored in a log-file for the
admin to look at.
