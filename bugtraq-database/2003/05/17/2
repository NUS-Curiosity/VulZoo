You are right, is the same preoblem has affected OpenSSH/PAM timing 
attack about which Marco Ivald  from MediaService has post the bug and 
the solution.

I have been in touch with Marco Ivaldi, he has found that  is the same 
kind of problem, an the same soltion, but is not really goot to get this 
problem on the default installation . I mailed to the author but  I get 
no response

For the solution follow the same present on
