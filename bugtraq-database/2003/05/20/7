Subject: ntoskrnl crashing hard via isqlw.exe


lo all,
When messing around with Microsofts Query Analyzer, I 
tried to connect to a host name with +110 characters and 
to my surprise my box blue screened and rebooted. It saved 
the crash dump and I look through it but couldn't really 
see any thing obvious (i stuffed a ton of a's and didn't 
see an 0x41's in my registers.) I tested on Windows 2000 
SP3 all patches had been applied as of last night, so 
their might be 6 or 7 more today that I haven't applied. 
Anyways, can anyone see if this is a more serious issue 
with the kernel? Anything over 110 characters causes my 
box to bsod and reboot. Anything below 110 does nothing, 
just doesn't connect. This kind of reminds me of the 
Windows XP net use \\aaa[lots of a]aaaa\ipc$ reboot issue, 
has this been introduced into Win2k too?
