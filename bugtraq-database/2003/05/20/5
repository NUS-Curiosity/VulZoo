slocate in Debian is shipped setgid slocate only, so even if the user works
hard to make themselves vulnerable by recompiling the kernel to use an
absurd limit, an exploit only exposes read-only access to the slocate
database (a list of files on the system).  It does _not_ grant root access
by any means.

-rwxr-sr-x    1 root     slocate     24664 2003-02-17 22:59 /usr/bin/slocate
