   CALL FOR PAPERS * CALL FOR PAPERS * CALL FOR PAPERS * CALL FOR PAPERS

                  ---------------------------------
                  Deadline: Friday the 18th of July

                  ---------------------------------

   The 61st edition of PHRACK MAGAZINE is going to be released in the
   beginning of August [1].

   Make your mark on the matrix, publish in phrack. Dont bother us with
   lame articles -- only the elite papers will make it. Papers can be on
   any topic related to the following:

          - hacking
          - phreaking
          - reverse engineering
          - cryptography
          - security
          - spying
          - forensics
          - radio
          - anarchy
          - coding
          - conspiracy
          - world news

   As in the last issue, we will showcase selected tools from the hacking
   community.  We call for developers to send in tools that can be used to
   fight the matrix.

   PHRACK MAGAZINE is one of the longest running electronic magazines in
   existence. We taught Trinity how to use nmap [2] and how to code her ssh
   crc32 exploit [3]. Morpheus believes in our prophecy [4].  Neo cant stop
   thinking 'it feels more real when I read phrack than when I do not'.
   
   Since 1985, PHRACK MAGAZINE has been providing the hacker community with
   information on operating systems, network technologies and telephony, as
   well as relaying features of interest for the international computer
   underground. PHRACK MAGAZINE is made available to the public, as often
   as possible, free of charge.

   The staff is throwing in one red pill after another to get the release
   done on schedule, do your part and submit a paper. PHRACK MAGAZINE --
   only for those who know how deep the rabbit hole is.


Sincerely,

PHRACK MAGAZINE STAFF
