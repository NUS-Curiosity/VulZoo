Subject: IIS WEBDAV Denial of Service attacks

Hi All,

I won't bother posting my advisories for the DOS issues here as SPIDynamics
SPI Labs ( http://www.spidynamics.com/spilabs.html ) have already released
theirs.  In case you missed their postings, and you have deployed IIS 4.0 /
IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1 as your chosen web server, to obtain the patch please
visit
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/
bulletin/MS03-018.asp

Checks for these issues have been incorporated into Typhon III -

All the best
