Subject: Netbus 1.x exploit




Netbus 1.x server is able to be connected to without a password. you will 
need to open two clients that are compatable with the server being 
connected to. With one client connect to the server and wait until the 
password screen appears. once this happens connect to the same server with 
the other client and it will not ask you for a password. this is done 
because the server thinks you are already connected and notices the same 
IP connected to the same server allowing you to connect.

[I do not know if this has been posted before due to the fact that netbus 
is old. if it has I apologize.]
