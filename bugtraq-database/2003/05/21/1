Subject: [RHSA-2003:175-01] Updated gnupg packages fix validation bug


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated gnupg packages fix validation bug
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:175-01
Issue date:        2003-05-20
Updated on:        2003-05-20
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          gnupg trust UID
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2001:073
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0255
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated gnupg packages correcting a bug in the GnuPG key validation
functions are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a utility for encrypting data and
creating digital signatures.

When evaluating trust values for different UIDs assigned to a given key,
GnuPG versions earlier than 1.2.2 would incorrectly associate the trust
value of the UID with the highest trust value with every UID assigned to
that key.  This would prevent an expected warning message from being generated.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which include
patches from the GnuPG development team that correct this issue for GnuPG
versions 1.0.7 and 1.2.1. This update also upgrades Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2,
and 7.3 users to GnuPG version 1.0.7.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
