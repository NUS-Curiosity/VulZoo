[exp]
you open 
[CODE.URL]javascript:'some text'
in a new window.
then navigate that window to 'http://www.google.com'. 
at last, "history.back()" to make it back to 'some text'.

as you can see in the demo:
location bar is faked.


that's all


[how]
i often check netscape navigator's version by 
menu item: "Help" --> "About Netscape",
which navigates my browser to "about:".
after checking it, i navigated to another URL. accidently i 
pressed "Back", then the location bar didn't match content. 

after several mechanical tries, i got this.
