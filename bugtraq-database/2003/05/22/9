[slackware-security]  GnuPG key validation fix (SSA:2003-141-04)

A key validation bug which results in all user IDs on a given key
being treated with the validity of the most-valid user ID on that
key has been fixed with the release of GnuPG 1.2.2.

We recommend sites using GnuPG upgrade to this new package.

For detailed information about the problem, see this page:
