character anywhere within the "Attachment Converted:" string [these get

Attachments can still be spoofed by including a CR=x0d character anywhere
within the "Attachment Converted:" string (these get converted internally
into a NUL=x00 and ignored), e.g.:


Attachment<CR> Converted: "c:\winnt\system32\calc.exe" NoAttachIcon
Attachment
 Converted: "c:\winnt\system32\calc.exe" NoAttachIcon

(First line with four-character <CR> marker for the sake of Eudora users.)
