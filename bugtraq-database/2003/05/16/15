OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

Package:             gnupg
Vulnerability:       incorrect key validation
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= gnupg-1.2.1-20030408     >= gnupg-1.2.2-20030501
OpenPKG 1.2          <= gnupg-1.2.1-1.2.0        >= gnupg-1.2.1-1.2.1
OpenPKG 1.1          <= gnupg-1.0.7-1.1.0        >= gnupg-1.0.7-1.1.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) [0] development team discovered [1]
  that the key validation code in GnuPG 1.2.1 and older versions does
  not properly determine the validity of keys with multiple user IDs
  and assigns the greatest validity of the most valid user ID, which
  prevents GnuPG from warning the encrypting user when a user ID does
  not have a trusted path. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0255 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  gnupg". If you have the "gnupg" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get gnupg-1.2.1-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig gnupg-1.2.1-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild gnupg-1.2.1-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/gnupg-1.2.1-1.2.1.*.rpm
