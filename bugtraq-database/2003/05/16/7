Subject: Microsoft Solution for Securing Wireless LANs now available


Microsoft is pleased to announce the release of _Solution for Securing
Wireless LANs_.

This prescriptive guide addresses today's wireless network
vulnerabilities, and provides a reference implementation of certificate
services for securing WLANS, which is suited for organizations of
several hundred to many thousands of wireless network users. The
reference implementation is derived from Microsoft's own use of PKI for
securing the WLAN for its 55,000 employees, and best practices learned
while aiding customers with their own secure WLANs. 

The solution is divided into the following components:

PLANNING
	- Secure WLAN Strategy
	- Secure WLAN Solution Architecture
	- Designing PKI
	- Designing RADIUS infrastructure
	- Designing WLAN Security using 802.1x

BUILD & DEPLOY
	- Implementing PKI
	- Implementing RADIUS for WLAN Security
	- Implementing WLAN Security Using 802.1x

OPERATE
	- Managing PKI
	- Managing RADIUS and WLAN

The documentation also includes a Test Guide that outlines the overall
test strategy used by Microsoft to validate the solution, spreadsheets
for cost and risk analysis, and a project model.
