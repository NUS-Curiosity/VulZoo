Subject: eBay Security Contact


Hello,

I'm looking for contact information for the security department (if such a 
thing exists) at eBay.  If anyone has any security contact information 
(specifically, I'm looking for e-mail addresses), or just general "support" 
information where I can reach a human -- as such information appears to be 
deeply buried.  I'm really starting to become frustrated by the lack of 
support; everything they have is automated/robotic, and even that doesn't 
really
