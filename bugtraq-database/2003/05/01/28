+Subject: eBay Security Contact
+
+
+Hello,
+
+I'm looking for contact information for the security department (if such a
+thing exists) at eBay.  If anyone has any security contact information
+(specifically, I'm looking for e-mail addresses), or just general
+"support"
+information where I can reach a human -- as such information appears to be
+deeply buried.  I'm really starting to become frustrated by the lack of
+support; everything they have is automated/robotic, and even that doesn't
+really

Matt,

You can use spoof@...y.com. This is the address used to report the phony
Russian eBay e-mails claiming to be from eBay Billing saying that your
credit card was declined...yadda-yadda.
They do respond with a human reply and name along with the boilerplate
response.

And yes it is buried.

Tony
