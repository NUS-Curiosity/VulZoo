Summary

   Nessus exposes FTP and Telnet vulnerabilities in the Cisco ONS15454
   Optical Transport Platform, the Cisco ONS15327 Edge Optical Transport
   Platform, the Cisco ONS15454SDH Multiplexer Platform, and the Cisco
   ONS15600 Multiservice Switching Platform. Cisco ONS15454 hardware running
   ONS Releases 3.0 through Release 3.4.1, Cisco ONS15327 and ONS15454SDH
   hardware running ONS Releases 3.3 through Release 3.4.1, and Cisco
   ONS15600 hardware running ONS Release 1.0 is affected by these
   vulnerabilities. Nessus is a free security scanner software available from
   nessus.org.

   These vulnerabilities are documented as Cisco Bug IDs CSCdz83515 and
   CSCdz83519. There are workarounds available to mitigate the effects of
   these vulnerabilities.

   This advisory will be posted at
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030501-ons.shtml.

Affected Products

     * Cisco ONS15454 hardware running ONS Releases 3.0 through Release 3.4.1

     * Cisco ONS15327 and Cisco ONS15454SDH hardware running ONS Releases 3.3
       through Release 3.4.1

     * Cisco ONS15600 hardware running ONS Release 1.0

   Products not affected by these vulnerabilities are listed below.

     * Cisco ONS15454 hardware running ONS Releases 4.0 and 2.x

     * Cisco ONS15327 hardware running ONS Release 4.0 and Release 1.x

     * Cisco ONS15454SDH hardware running ONS Release 4.0

   No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
   vulnerabilities.

   To determine your software revision, view the Help > About window on the
   CTC network management software.

Details

   The affected Cisco ONS15454, ONS15327, ONS15454SDH, and ONS15600 hardware
   is managed via the TCC+, XTC, TCCi, and TSC control cards respectively.
   These control cards are usually connected to a network isolated from the
   Internet and local to the customer's environment. This limits the exposure
   to the exploitation of the vulnerabilities from the Internet.

   found at http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/.

Impact

   The timing for the data channels traversing the switch is provided by the
   control cards.

   On the Cisco ONS15454, ONS15327, and ONS15454SDH hardware platforms,
   whenever both the active and standby control cards are rebooting at the
   same time, the synchronous data channels traversing the switch drop
   traffic until the card reboots. Asynchronous data channels traversing the
   switch are not impacted. Manageability functions provided by the network
   element via the TCC+, XTC, and TCCi control cards are not available until
   the control card reboots.

   On the Cisco ONS15600 hardware platforms, whenever both the active and
   standby control cards are rebooting at the same time, there is no impact
   to the data channels traversing the switch because the TSC does a software
   reset which does not impact the timing being provided by the TSC for the
   data channels. Manageability functions provided by the network element via
   the TSC control cards are not available until the control card reboots.

Software Versions and Fixes

   All these vulnerabilities for the ONS15454, ONS15327, and ONS15454SDH
   platforms are fixed in the Cisco ONS software Releases 4.0 and later for
   the affected platforms.

   All these vulnerabilities for the ONS15600 platforms are fixed in the
   Cisco ONS software Release 1.1, which will be available in September 2003.

   Upgrade procedures can be found as indicated below.

     * The procedure to upgrade to the fixed software version on the Cisco
       ONS15454 hardware is detailed at
       http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/ong/15400/r40docs/sftupgrd/index.htm.

     * The procedure to upgrade to the fixed software version on the Cisco
       ONS15327 hardware is detailed at
       http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/ong/15327/327doc40/index.htm.

     * The procedure to upgrade to the fixed software version on the Cisco
       ONS1600 hardware is detailed at
       http://cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/ong/15600/index.htm.

Obtaining Fixed Software

   Cisco is offering free software upgrades to address these vulnerabilities
   for all affected customers. Customers may only install and expect support
   for the feature sets they have purchased.

   Customers with service contracts should contact their regular update
   channels to obtain the free software upgrade identified via this advisory.
   For most customers with service contracts, this means that upgrades should
   be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide website at
   http://www.cisco.com/tacpage/sw-center/sw-optical.shtml (registered
   customers only) .

   Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through a prior
   or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as Cisco
   Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
   support organization for assistance with obtaining the free software
   upgrade(s).

   Customers who purchased directly from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
   service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
   but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
   sale, should obtain fixed software by contacting the Cisco Technical
   Assistance Center (TAC) using the contact information listed below. In
   these cases, customers are entitled to obtain an upgrade to a later
   version of the same release or as indicated by the applicable corrected
   software version in the Software Versions and Fixes section (noted above).

     * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)

     * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)

     * e-mail: tac@...co.com

   See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
   additional TAC contact information, including special localized telephone
   numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
   languages.

   Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
   advisory as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade.

   Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
   "security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

Workarounds

   The Cisco PSIRT recommends that affected users upgrade to a fixed software
   version of code as soon as possible.

   Use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding and access control lists on routers
   and firewalls to allow only valid network management workstations gain FTP
   and Telnet access to the TCC+, XTC, TCCi, or TSC control cards.

Exploitation and Public Announcements

   The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use
   of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

   These vulnerabilities were reported to PSIRT by internal development
   testing and customers.
