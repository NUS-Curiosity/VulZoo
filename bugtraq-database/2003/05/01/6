ive noticed something similar in its handling of PermitRootLogin, if
this option is set to `no' you get the following behavior:

$ ssh root@...t
root@...t's password: <- arbitrary (non-null) string
[2 secs delay]
Permission denied, please try again.a

$ ssh root@...t
root@...t's password:  <- correct root password
[no delay]
Permission denied, please try again.

i haven't checked the current version to see if this is still true. 

i think you also will get no delay if DenyUsers or so is in use for
accounts your testing.
