                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Security Vulnerabilities in MediaBase Apache and PHP
Number   : 20030502-01-I
Date     : May 19, 2003
Reference: Kasenna Support Issue # 1095 and # 1330
Fixed in : Patches from Kasenna Support Website
______________________________________________________________________________

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that Kasenna Mediabase has insecure versions of
Apache and PHP.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with patches and in future releases of
MediaBase.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

MediaBase is an optional product from Kasenna, and is not installed by
default on IRIX 6.5 systems.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if mediabase is installed, execute the following command:

  % versions -b | grep mbase
  I  mbase_client         06/01/2000  WebFORCE MediaBase 2.1 - Client
  I  mbase_players        10/06/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - Players packaged
                                      for installation on server
  I  mbase_root           12/24/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - Development ROOT
                                      Files
  I  mbase_server         10/06/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - MediaBase Server
                                      Execution Environment
  I  mbase_server_spk1    12/24/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - MediaBase Server
                                      Service Pack 1

To determine if the version of Apache installed as part of MediaBase is
vulnerable, execute the following command:

  % /usr/kasenna/apache/bin/httpd -v
  Server version: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)
  Server built:   Dec 20 2000 15:52:52

If the version shown (in this case 1.3.14) is lower than 1.3.27, then the
system is vulnerable.


To determine if the version of PHP installed as part of MediaBase is
vulnerable, execute the following commands:

%/usr/bin/elfdump -L /usr/mbase/asset_gateway/php_apache.so | grep TIMSTAMP
  [46]    TIMSTAMP    Jan 13 14:50:39 2003

%/usr/bin/elfdump -L /usr/mbase/asset_gateway/php_mediabase.so | grep TIMSTAMP
  [45]    TIMSTAMP    Jan 10 14:02:48 2003

If the value shown for "TIMSTAMP" is earlier than the ones shown, then the
system is vulnerable.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems if MediaBase
is needed.  SGI and Kasenna recommend installing the patches shown below
from the Kasenna website.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

Kasenna MediaBase is an optional product, the system is vulnerable if
a vulnerable version of MediaBase and its associated Apache and PHP
components are installed.  Please run the commands shown in the "Impact"
section above and install the patches if those commands show
the system to be vulnerable.

Kasenna has provided patches for these vulnerabilities. Our recommendation
is to install the patches provided by Kasenna.

To obtain the Kasenna MediaBase patches, go to http://support.kasenna.com/
and install the patches shown in support issue 1095 (apache) and 1033 (PHP).
