Subject: [RHSA-2003:171-01] Updated CUPS packages fix denial of service attack


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated CUPS packages fix denial of service attack
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:171-01
Issue date:        2003-05-27
Updated on:        2003-05-27
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:

Obsoletes:         RHSA-2002:295
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0195
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated CUPS packages that fix a denial of service vulnerability are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

CUPS is a print spooler.  CUPS is used as the default print spooler on new
installations of Red Hat Linux 9, and has been provided (though not as the
default) for Red Hat Linux 7.3 and Red Hat Linux 8.0.

Phil D'Amore of Red Hat discovered a vulnerability in the CUPS IPP
(Internet Printing Protocol) implementation.  The IPP implementation is
single-threaded, which means only one request can be serviced at a time. 
An attacker could make a partial request that does not time out and
therefore creates a denial of service. In order to exploit this bug, an
attacker must have the ability to make a TCP connection to the IPP port (by
default 631). 

All print servers using CUPS should upgrade to these erratum packages,
which contain a patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
