    . Notification acknowledged by Axis: 2003-04-17
    . 2.34 Release candidate for the Axis 2400/2401 Video Servers

Release Mode: COORDINATED RELEASE


*Vulnerability Description:*

  An Axis Network Camera captures and transmits live images directly
  over an IP network (e.g. LAN/intranet/Internet), enabling users to
  remotely view and/or manage the camera from a Web browser on any
  computer. For more information see http://www.axis.com

  After setting up the Axis Camera, the user is provided with
  Web-based Administration Tools for configuring and managing the
  camera by accessing http://camera-ip/admin/admin.shtml, which
  requires a username and password.

  We have discovered the following security vulnerability: by accessing
     http://camera-ip//admin/admin.shtml
  (notice the double slash) the authentication for "admin" is bypassed
  and an attacker gains direct access to the configuration.

  Using this vulnerability, an attacker can reset the root password,
  then enable the telnet server by modifying configuration files,
  giving the attacker interactive access to a Unix like command line,
  allowing her to execute arbitrary commands as root.


*Vulnerable Packages:*

  . AXIS 2100 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2110 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2120 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2130 PTZ Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2400 Video Server versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2401 Video Server versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2420 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2460 Network DVR versions 3.00 and previous
  . AXIS 250S Video Server versions 3.02 and previous

  this issue.


*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

  We have discovered the following security vulnerability: by accessing
   http://camera-ip//admin/admin.shtml
  (notice the double slash) the authentication for "admin" is bypassed
  and an attacker gains direct access to the configuration.

  In the same way, an attacker can access the other administration
  tools for the camera, for example:
   http://camera-ip//admin/img_general.shtml
   http://camera-ip//admin/netw_tcp.shtml
   http://camera-ip//admin/sys_date.shtml
   http://camera-ip//admin/com_port.shtml
   http://camera-ip//admin/op_general.shtml
   http://camera-ip//admin/sys_motiond.shtml

  Note that the workaround for a recently published Axis HTTP Server
  vulnerability (see reference [1]) was to add authentication to
  some particular paths. With this vulnerability the authentication
  can be bypassed, so the mentioned Information Disclosure
  vulnerability can still be exploited.

  The affected Axis devices run a Linux like operating system. With
  this vulnerability an attacker can reset the root password. Then
  using the default open ftp server, the attacker can download
  configuration files, modify these files and upload them again.
  Modifying /etc/inittab it is possible to enable the Telnet server
  (see [2] a technical note explaining how to enable Telnet support),
  giving the attacker interactive access to a Unix like command line.
  Axis provides free developer tools (see [3]), so it is feasible
  for an attacker to build tools like port scanners or proxies to
  start attacks from the compromised camera (which are usually
  installed inside internal networks) which could lead to the
  compromise of the internal network.
