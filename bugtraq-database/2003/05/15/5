                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Multiple Security Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL
Number   : 20030501-01-I
Date     : May 14, 2003
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0131, CAN-2003-0147
Reference: SGI BUGS 884710 881989 883987
Fixed in : OpenSSL package from IRIX 6.5.20 CD set
______________________________________________________________________________

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that OpenSSL versions up to and including 0.9.7a contain
several security vulnerabilities:

  o  Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack
     http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030319.txt

  o  Timing-based attacks on SSL/TLS with CBC encryption
     http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030219.txt

  o  Cryptographic libraries and applications vulnerable to timing attacks
     http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030317.txt

See http://www.openssl.org/ for additional details on these vulnerabilities.

SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with a package you can install and in
future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The openssl subsystem is not installed by default on IRIX 6.5.19, but is a
separate package called "openssl".

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if openssl is installed, execute the following command:

  # versions -b openssl
    I = Installed, R = Removed
       Name                 Date        Description
    I  openssl              01/13/2003  openssl libraries, 0.9.6g


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.  SGI
recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.20, or installing the openssl
package we are providing.  See below.



- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

IRIX 6.5.19 shipped with openssl v0.9.7a which is vulnerable. SGI has provided
the openssl (v0.9.6g + security fixes) package from IRIX 6.5.20 for
installation on IRIX 6.5.19 systems.

The OpenSSL packages that ships with IRIX 6.5.19 and above are not supported
on versions of IRIX prior to 6.5.19.

   NOTES

     1) This version of the IRIX operating has been retired. Upgrade to an
        actively supported IRIX operating system.  See
        http://support.sgi.com/ for more information.

     2) If you have not received an IRIX 6.5.X CD for IRIX 6.5, contact your
        SGI Support Provider or URL: http://support.sgi.com/

     3) OpenSSL is not supported on versions of IRIX prior to 6.5.19.  If
        you have your own version of OpenSSL installed, it may be vulnerable
        if it is version 0.9.7a or earlier.  Our recommendation is that if
        you need an SGI supported version of OpenSSL, please upgrade to IRIX
        6.5.20 when available.

     4) Install the 6.5.20 version of openssl available for download from
        ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/patches/6.5.19/
        or upgrade to 6.5.20 when available on http://support.sgi.com/
