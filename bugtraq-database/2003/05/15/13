  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  There is a heap corruption vulnerability in sudo which may allow an
  attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

  Please note that this is the same vulnerability addressed in
  ESA-20020429-010.  Due to an error, this bug was never fixed in later
  EnGarde versions.

  The impact of this vulnerability is minimal, as only trusted users
  are permitted to access the sudo binary.

  Guardian Digital products affected by this issue include:

    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.5

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.

SOLUTION
- --------
  Guardian Digital Secure Network subscribers may automatically update
  affected systems by accessing their account from within the Guardian
  Digital WebTool.
