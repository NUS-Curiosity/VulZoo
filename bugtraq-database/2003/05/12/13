Details:
Vendor's site: www.movabletype.org

Vulnerable systems:
Movable Type version 2.63 and prior.

Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability found in writing the comments, in the 
Comments section there is sevral textboxs:
Name, Email Address, URL and Comments.
and all the textboxs allow using the javascript codes.
in order to causes a CSS attack on the target site we need to write a 
javascript code in the Name textbox (in some versions u can write the 
javascript code in the other textboxs of the Comments).

Examples:
You can use this javascripts codes:
&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;alert("CSS discovered by DarkHunter")&lt;/script&gt;
"DarkHunter>&lt;script&gt;  .. (This code is so bad :) .. it causes disappering 
of all the Comments textboxs and buttons .. in other words every thing 
after this code will disapper).
and of course there are many codes that u can use.


Solution:
Edit the source code to strip malicious characters from Name, Email 
Address, URL and Comments textboxs or escape malicious characters using 
addslashes().
check the vendor's website for new patches.
