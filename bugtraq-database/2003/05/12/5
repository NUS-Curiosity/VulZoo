Subject: makeunicode2.py release


I've re-released makeunicode2.py after editing it to work without CANVAS's
infrastructure. The revised makeunicode2.py can be found linked off of
http://www.immunitysec.com/CANVAS/ . This python module should allow
exploit developers to quickly and easily convert any shellcode into
unicode - expediating exploitation of unicode vulnerabilities, such as the
Microsoft Content Server overflow.

This revised makeunicode2.py is released under the Gnu Public License
(v2.0). I'll be going over the techniques it uses during BlackHat Europe
in Amsterdam this year.
