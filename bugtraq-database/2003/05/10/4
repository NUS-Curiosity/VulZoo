  ! [CRITICAL]


Hello!

I've contacted Microsoft (secure@...rosoft.com) about the first problem 
you've mentioned on 2003-02-17 and they told me that they'll looking into 
this. I've provided them further details on 2003-02-21 as I've found out 
that there are much more way to exploit this - telnet will work, but 
Windows supports a much higher number of possible protocols you can use for 
this with the same and other strange results (try scp:// for example on 
Windows ME/XP).

After some tries to get more information about this issue, a mail dated 
2003-04-08 finally got answered on 2003-04-13 with the results that's more 
or less "behaviour by design", but they want to research on this further. I 
never heared back from them anymore...

cheers,
Andreas Marx
