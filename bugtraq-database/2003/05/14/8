This bug was fixed within ten minutes of our being told about this report.

As for claims that the reporter was unable to contact us, I am rather 
surprised - we have scoured our support ticket system which accepts all 
email for @vbulletin.com and found nothing, we have all checked our own 
email and found nothing, so I'm not sure how hard the reporter tried to 
contact us in actual fact.

vBulletin 3 is not yet in public beta, so the number of sites affected 
will be extremely small, and in any case the fixed version is available 
for those customers who are part of the private beta to download.
