Subject: BEA WebLogic Server and Express 7.x Passwords Disclosure





------------------------------------------------------------
  BEA WebLogic Server and Express 7.x Passwords Disclosure
------------------------------------------------------------


Affected Versions
-----------------
BEA WebLogic Server 7.x
BEA WebLogic Express 7.x


ADVISORY
--------

This vulnerability concerns a number of clear-text passwords that have 
been identified in BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express. The 
following passwords were identified: 

--> JDBCConnectionPoolRuntimeMBean password was displayed in clear-text 
via weblogic.Admin. The password field was properly restricted. The major 
concern here was a passerby seeing the password on the screen of a 
privileged user. 

--> The default CredentialMapper stored the passwords in clear-text on 
disk. A knowledgeable attacker who had access to the disk files and knew 
how to extract passwords out of the binary data file could exploit this. 

--> Several secrets internal to WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 
concerning the encryption of passwords were potentially accessible to non-
privileged users. An attacker who obtained these passwords, had extensive 
knowledge about the internals of WebLogic's encryption algorithms and had 
access to files that contained the encrypted passwords could have stolen 
the passwords. This includes passwords stored in config.xml, 
filerealm.properties and weblogic-rar.xml. 


Solution
--------

BEA strongly recommends the following course of actions: 

Apply the appropriate Service Pack: 

For WebLogic Server and Express 7.0 and 7.0.0.1 
Upgrade to Service Pack 2 and apply the following patch:
ftp://ftpna.beasys.com/pub/releases/security/CR104520_700sp2.zip 

When Service Pack 3 becomes available, you may use that Service Pack 
instead of Service Pack 2 and this patch.
