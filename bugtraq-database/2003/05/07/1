NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Multiple Vulnerabilities in SLWebMail
Systems Affected: SLWebMail 3 on Windows
Severity: High Risk
Vendor URL: http://www.slmail.com
Authors: David Litchfield (david@...software.com)
 Mark Litchfield (mark@...software.com)
Date: 7th May 2003
Advisory URL: http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/slwebmail-vulns.txt
Advisory number: #NISR07052003B

Description
***********
SLWebMail is a web based e-mail system that runs on top of Microsoft's
Internet Information Server. It is vulnerable to many different kinds of
issues, such as buffer overflows, arbitrary file access and physical path
revelation.

Details
*******

Buffer Overflows
****************
Many of the ISAPI DLL applications that form SLWebmail are vulnerable to
buffer overflow vulnerabilities. By passsing an overly long value for
certain parameters in the query string the overflows can be triggered.

Module: showlogin.dll
Parameter: Language

Module: recman.dll
Parameter: CompanyID

Module: admin.dll
Parameter: CompanyID

Module: globallogin.dll
Parameter: CompanyID

Abritrary File Access
*********************
ShowGodLog.dll can be accessed without requiring a remote user to
authenticate. This ISAPI application is used to show SLWebMail's log file.
However, by providing the path, relative or full, to any file that the
anonymous Internet account has read access to then access to the contents
can be gained, even outside of the web root.

Physical Path Revelation
************************
By making invalid requests to certain DLLs such as WebMailReq.dll the
complete physical path to the DLL is revealed. This information can be used
to help with other attacks.

Fix Information
***************
NGSSoftware alerted SLMail to these issues in February and an update has
been released. See http://www.slmail.com for more details.

A check for these issues has been added to Typhon, a comprehensive automated
vulnerability assessment tool of which more information is available from
the NGSSite: http://www.ngssoftware.com/
