It is alarmist because you didn't take into account permission that is given
automatically by the provider.

The cable company assumes you're going to connect the above equipment to your
cable service.  Also, considering that most companies provide converter boxes
to use with the service, providing that equipment is the express permission to
connect devices to the service.  The self-install guide that came with my cable
box even has a specific set of steps for connecting a VCR/PVR inline with the
TV.

On the other hand, if they decide to limit what you connect, it's going to
create massive headaches and overhead for them.  There isn't any unique
identifier mechanism in home AV equipment, so they would have to do regular
physical checks of customer installations.  Truck rolls are expensive, and in
this case, they would have to eat the cost.

This is the same issue as above.  Wireless is a non-issue, since AUPs already
contain rules that prohibit the connection of open access points.
