Unfortunately, I think you are preaching to the choir here.  The dshield list 
is going through the same discussion.  Again, the choir.  This kind of thing 
needs to get to the news media so that the general public can learn of the 
lameness the MPAA and RIAA are lobbying against them.

I would love to hear ideas off-list.

| The proposed super-DMCA statutes reverse this traditional rule. Under
| these statutes, you would not be entitled to connect anything to your
| cable, satellite, or DSL line without the express permission of your
| service provider. The model MPAA bill accomplishes this by making it a
| crime to possess a device to "receive Â… transmit, [or] re-transmit"
| any communication service without the "express authorization" of the
| communication service provider. The various pending state bills
| include similar language.
|
| This provision would make you a criminal for simply connecting a TV,
| PC, TiVo or VCR (all of which can "receive" communication services) to
| the cable TV line in your living room without your cable company's
| permission. It could also make you a criminal for connecting a Wi-Fi
| wireless gateway (which can "retransmit" Internet traffic) to your DSL
| or cable modem line without the permission of your ISP. "
|
| Take particular note of the one-sided attorney's fee provision (You
| loose, you pay for both sides fees. You win, MPAA doesn't pay yours).
| and automatic injunctions (without their having to prove they suffered
| any harm).
|
| And Remote downgrades, abusive damages, etc. etc.
|
| Maybe it's time to boycott all American Movies and Music before
| the MPAA gets world domination through through stealth legislation.
| And write your state legislatures before it's too late!
