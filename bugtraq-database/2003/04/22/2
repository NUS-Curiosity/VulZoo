Subject: [VulnDiscuss] Office 2000 bug, Regristration


To whom it may concern,
I was reading some news today and noticed this:
http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2133703,00.html
It is a story about the Office 2000 registration flaw.
This flaw makes the user Register every time they open an office
application.
It is only applicable to Non-Admin users.
I have known about this for a long time (Since installing this on client
machines), but thought it just another bug.
As part of the resolution to this I have found out that if you open an
office application as an administrator then register it will not bother you
again.
So as part of the install process you need to:
1) Install Office
2) Open an office app.
3) Logout and let the user use office.

Hope that this helps
