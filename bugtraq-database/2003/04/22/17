While this is true, in this attack it is a malicious server which makes 
the client configuration important.  Unless LMCompatabilitylevel has been 
changed from its default of 0 or "Send LM & NTLM responses" this attack 
should still work.  This is the default on Windows 2000 and XP.

The hardening guide recommends setting this level as high as possible and 
there really isn't any reason these days not to run an NTLMv2 client 
environment by setting this LMCompatability level to 3 or higher.  This 
can be done through a domain security policy.  It is also a good idea to 
filter TCP ports 139 and 445 outbound on your perimeter if possible.
