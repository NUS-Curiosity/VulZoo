Subject: buffalo  AirStation G54 - (WBR-G54 ) DoS




Hellow!
 
I found bad bug/owerflow for buffalo g54 airstions:
 
here my simple tests:

schem of tests:
I used 2 broadband routers Airstation WBR-g54 (first named: g54-01, 
second - g54-02)
both broadband routers set to pear-to-pear connection mode (not point-
multipoint)

[atacker PC]--[g54-01]-.-.-per-to-pear-.-.-[g54-02]--[victim PC]
 
when I starts simple ping-flood from atacker PC (simple ping -f <victim 
IP> in linux), the g54-02 connected to the victim PC by net-cable after 
some seconds is going down and breakes connection :-(
 
in firmware ver. 1.10 g54-02 is going to reboot and then comes back online
after I install firware 1.11 (and 1.13 too) - g54-02 still die after ping-
flood, but not reboots and comes online automaticaly :(
 
 
With best regards, Pavel
