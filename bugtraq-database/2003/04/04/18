Subject: RE: NetBIOS could be used as network flood amplier


Its called a NetBIOS Broadcast Storm, and its 15 years old now. No need to write your own code, many manufacturers, like Ungermann-Bass, IBM, Tandem Computers and others all wrote code that could do this quite effectively. The only difference between your code and theirs is that theirs would do it when you didn't want them to.

Cheers,

Overview: 

Commonly used services, such as NetBIOS Name Server can be used to flood 
hosts with UDP data, sending spoofed name requests.
