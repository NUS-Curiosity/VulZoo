What I think is happening is that IE takes the URL '#' on it's own to
mean current document. (You can ahieve the same affect by specifying
data="document.html" where document.html is the name of the html file
running the code.)

When the data in the file '#' is embedded into the document and
executed it too contains the same object tag which embeds the document
again and again. Eventually it runs out of stack space. I doubt this is
exploitable on it's own except as a DoS.
