It has a number of features: emoticons and text formatting, 
a profanity or unwanted word filter, which can be modified as required,
images can be used in the Guest Book, e-mail notification of Guest 
Book entries, COOKIES can be used by the Guest Book administrator.

Vulnerability:
insertguest.asp neglects filtering user input allowing 
for script injection to the guestbook via "Name",
