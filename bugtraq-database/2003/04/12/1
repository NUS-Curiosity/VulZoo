_______________________________________________________________________________                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Brocade Firmware SNMP Vulnerability
Number   : 20030405-01-I
Date     : April 11, 2003
Reference: SGI BUG 876762
Reference: CERT CA-2002-03
Reference: CVE CAN-2002-0013
Reference: CVE CAN-2002-0017
Fixed in : Brocade Firmware v2.6.0d or later
______________________________________________________________________________

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that the certain firmware shipped with some Brocade switches
are vulnerable to the SNMP issues listed in CERT CA-2002-03:
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in the 2.6.0d and later revisions of the
Brocade firmware.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The Brocade firmware is not part of IRIX and is in fact not installed
on any IRIX machine, but is instead shipped installed in certain Brocade
switches SGI supplies in certain system configurations.

This vulnerability could result in a denial of service attack on TCP/IP
connectivity to the switch.  TCP/IP connectivity for the switch is not
a requirement for the switch to handle storage properly, and is there
for management purposes.

To see what version of firmware is installed in your Brocade switch, telnet
to it and it will show the firmware OS release in its banner.

  % telnet brocade.yourcompany.com (or the ip address of the brocade switch)
  Trying 192.38.62.4...
  Connected to brocade.yourcompany.com.
  Escape character is '^]'.


  Fabric OS (tm)  Release v2.6.0d

  login:
       Connection closed by foreign host.

If the release version shown is earlier than v2.6.0d, then you are
vulnerable and you should install the upgraded firmware.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.
SGI recommends upgrading the firmware.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided upgraded firmware for this vulnerability.
To obtain the upgraded firmware,

Go to http://support.sgi.com/search_request/power_search/index

Enter "brocade firmware" and look down the listing for the download link.

at large for their assistance in this matter.
