- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:

"KDE uses Ghostscript software for processing of PostScript (PS)
and PDF files in a way that allows for the execution of arbitrary
commands that can be contained in such files.

An attacker can prepare a malicious PostScript or PDF file which will
provide the attacker with access to the victim's account and privileges
when the victim opens this malicious file for viewing or when the
victim browses a directory containing such malicious file and has
file previews enabled.

An attacker can provide malicious files remotely to a victim in an
e-mail, as part of a webpage, via an ftp server and possible other 
means."

emerge \=kde-base/kdelibs-2.2.2a-r1
emerge \=kde-base/kdegraphics-2.2.2-r2
