Subject: Medium Vulnerability in SNMP on Linsys BEFVP41




While the following is not a critical vulnerability, it is a serious 
problem for those that are implementing these VPN routers in production 
environments. 




Problem:




  The MIB information available from the default 'public' community name on 
the external interface of a Linksys VPN router includes information about 
the hosts on the inside of the protected network including routes, hardware 
addresses ( MAC ), and some configuration information. What is NOT 
available include information about the VPN's configured, any preshared 
keys, VPN routes, or endpoint IP's. 




Testability:


  


 install the net-snmp package and run the following on any Linksys router


that has not had it's community names altered:




  snmpwalk -v 1 -c public {ip} 




This has been tested on versions 1.40.3f and 1.40.4 ( latest ) version.




Solution: 


  


 Change the community names configured in the 'password' section of the 


VPN routers web based config tool. There is no current way to disable SNMP. 




Vendor:




 I have sent numerous mails to the vendor concerning this issue starting 
about 90 days ago. The last several have been ignored.
