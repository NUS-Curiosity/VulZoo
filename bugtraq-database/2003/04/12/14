Subject:
Ocean12 ASP Guestbook Manager v1.00.

Description:
Written entirely in ASP and VBScript this is a completely 
web-based, easy to install, ASP Guestbook Program. It stores 
data in an Access 2000 database and is configured 100% 
through the web browser, which means an easy installation process.   

Vendor:
Ocean12 Technologies 
http://www.ocean12tech.com

Download:
http://scripts.ocean12tech.com/asp/guestbook/

Vulnerability:
add.asp neglects filtering user input allowing 
for script injection to the guestbook via "Name",
"E-Mail" and "Massage" fields. The injected 
script will be executed in anyones browser who visits the 
guestbook.

An attaker may download MS Acces database to gain 
administrator's password, which is not encrypted at all.
