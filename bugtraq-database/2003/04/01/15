Subject: Webserver CVS (In)Security

This is a weird one.. it's not a traditional advisory, and it's not a
traditional paper.. but it's a topic that doesn't seem to be very well
known. This affects _alot_ of people, in particular open source
websites, which seem to use CVS to manage their content more than other
people.
