Subject: [RHSA-2003:084-01] Updated vsftpd packages re-enable tcp_wrappers support


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated vsftpd packages re-enable tcp_wrappers support
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:084-01
Issue date:        2003-04-01
Updated on:        2003-04-01
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          vsftpd tcp_wrappers
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0135
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated vsftpd packages that re-enable tcp_wrappers support are available
for Red Hat Linux 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

In Red Hat Linux 9, the vsftpd FTP daemon switched from being run by xinetd
to being run as a standalone service. In doing so, it was accidentally
not compiled against tcp_wrappers.

Users of vsftpd who make use of tcp_wrappers features are advised to
upgrade to these errata packages.

This issue only affects Red Hat Linux 9 boxed sets manufactured for
distribution within the United States.  The part numbers, which can be
found on the bottom flap of the box, are RHF0120US and  RHF0121US.
Copies of Red Hat Linux 9 obtained through other means (such as from Red
Hat Network, FTP, or international boxed sets) already contain the packages
referenced by this erratum, and are not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/vsftpd-1.1.3-8.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/vsftpd-1.1.3-8.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
31bf5c2e87909c74f8ad9e76b2e46fea 9/en/os/SRPMS/vsftpd-1.1.3-8.src.rpm
d2e807f808c45407f08528f50d29933b 9/en/os/i386/vsftpd-1.1.3-8.i386.rpm


These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
