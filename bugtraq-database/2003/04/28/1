Subject: IIS Security and Programming Countermeasures e-book


My latest book "IIS Security and Programming Countermeasures" can now be
downloaded as an e-book:

http://forensics.org/IIS_Security_and_Programming_Countermeasures_e-book.zip

It is my hope that those administrators and programmers who are presently
at-risk due to the use of IIS will learn something valuable from this
manuscript.

Feedback is welcome.

Sincerely,

Jason Coombs
