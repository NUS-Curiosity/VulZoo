Subject: RE:  Format strings vuln in CGIwrap


This is not a security problem. This is a case of using an automated
tool to find these vulnerabilites and not attempting to understand the
code itself. 

Nowhere in the code is MSG_Error_General() passed anything other than a
static compiled-into-the-executable string. It's purely a utility
function to wrap common error text/footer/etc. around a generic string.

> I. BACKGROUND
> 
> This is CGIWrap - a gateway that allows more secure
> user access to
> CGI programs on an HTTPd server than is provided by the
> http server
> itself. The primary function of CGIWrap is to make
> certain that
> any CGI script runs with the permissions of the user

> 
> CGIWrap works with NCSA httpd, Apache, CERN httpd,

> II. DESCRIPTION
> 
> On line 91 of msgs.c the printf() function is used

> The binaries in cgiwrap, (cgiwrap and nph-cgiwrap) are

> 
> IV. DETECTION
> 
> This is vulnerable in the latest version of cgiwrap
> version 3.7.1 and 
> properly
> older versions(not checked). It would be exploitable on
