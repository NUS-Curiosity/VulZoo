4) Description of Vulnerability 

A vulnerability in Xeneo Web Server can be exploited by malicious 
people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) on the web service. 

The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of 
requests including a malformed URL encoding representation of a 
character. By sending a request like the following, "xeneo.exe" will 
crash with a runtime error. 

Example: 
http://[victim]/%A 

The web service needs to be restarted manually before functionality 
is restored. 

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

The vendor quickly responded by releasing version 2.2.10.
