Subject: [VulnDiscuss] Re: Xeneo Webserver Vulnerability


Tamer,

You may want to correct yourself.  You discovered http://target/% on an
OLD (Xeneo 2.1.0.0 (PHP version) and 2.0.759.6 are vulnerable.) version. 
I found a different bug in there latest version (which was 2.2.9.0. at the
time) by requesting a GET / with 4096 ?'s.  Now how would this be the same
as you released?  Care to explain?
