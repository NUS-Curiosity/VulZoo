Package        : mime-support
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary file creation
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no

Unfortunately yesterday's update for mime-support did not exactly work
as expected, which requires an update.  For completeness we include
the advisory text:

  Colin Phipps discovered several problems in mime-support, that contains
  support programs for the MIME control files 'mime.types' and 'mailcap'.
  When a temporary file is to be used it is created insecurely, allowing
  an attacker to overwrite arbitrary under the user id of the person
  executing run-mailcap, most probably root.  Additionally the program did
  not properly escape shell escape characters when executing a command.
  This is unlikely to be exploitable, though.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.18-1.2.

For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been
fixed in version 3.9-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been
fixed in version 3.22-1 (same as DSA 292-1).

We recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.


Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
