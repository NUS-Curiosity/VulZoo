Subject: Re[2]: Authentication flaw in microsoft SMB protocol


Dear Jesper Johansson,

This  attack  can  not  be  prevented  by  NTLMv2, because in a same way
attacker  can  relay  server's response. This kind of attack is possible
because  of pass-through authentication. This attack may be prevented by
SMB signing, which is available since SP3.

Kerberos  does  not  prevent  this  attack  too, because Kerberos is not
mandatory. Attacker can initiate NTLM with both client and server.
