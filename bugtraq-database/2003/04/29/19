You may also go this way using Windows and i.e. WinRar. Just right-click the
exe and choose "deflate to folder" (or simething like that) to get it
unpacked. It's such a lot of tools and information - even security-related -
packed into self-extracting .exe. Just to mention PGP with it's option to
create an encrypted, self-extracting .exe out of a bunch of files. Before
clicking that .exe you'll never know if clicking will then prompt for the
passphrase like expected or harm your system.

That's todays way of computer/internet life and (in)security is implemented
for free :-)
