SySS-Advisory: Auerswald COMsuite/ Back Door

DATE: April 16th 03 (Published 29th April 03)

        72070 Tübingen / Germany
        Tel.: +49-7071-407856-0

AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
   Auerswald COMsuite CTI ControlCenter 3,1,2001,6
   (also known as: 3.1 06/2001)
   (see: www.auerswald.de)

DESCRIPTION:
   If you install the CTI applicaton "Auerswald
   COMsuite CTI Control Center" a user "runasositron"
   is created. The user's password is known by SySS and
   very easy to guess (using L0phtCrack for example).

IMPACT: This account can be used locally and remotely to
        access the Windows PC on which COMsuite is installed.

WORKAROUND: Deactivate the user. CTI still works.

VENDOR STATUS: Auerswald has been contacted on April 15th 2003.
               Auerswald told me that deactivating the
               account might disable fax/voice mail if nobody
               is logged on.
