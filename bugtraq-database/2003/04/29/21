You do not need Microsoft Office to open word documents.. AppleWorks 
will do it, and maybe open office/star office?  Granted, Microsoft has 
a monopoly.  I think you can open word documents with Wordpad which is 
free (and lousy).  If you are reading a windows security document, you 
probably have a windows box with wordpad.  There used to be a word 97 
viewer as well that was free.

Plain text files would be the only "safe" format.  Even Acrobat 
documents have security problems.

Another thing that troubles me about this debate is MITM attacks 
period.  Lets face it, any file format is susceptible to this sort of 
thing.  I could put up a fake microsoft MSDN library website and use 
DNS poisoning to give developers bad documentation.

What next?  Force users to use SSL for all websites?  Stop using the 
internet all together?
