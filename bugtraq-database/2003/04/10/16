Subject: Re: AMaViS-ng 0.1.6.x and postfix: possible open relay and mail loss

Hi -

As long as the problem is not fixed by the AMaViS-ng maintainers, this patch 
could be helpful.

I took the relevant part from the version 0.1.4.1 source. This patch 
(attachment) applies to 0.1.6.3.

Kind regards,

Phil Cyc
