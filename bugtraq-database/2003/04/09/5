                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Samba Security Vulnerability
Number   : 20030403-01-P
Date     : April 9, 2003
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0201
Reference: SGI BUG 886996
Fixed in : Samba 2.2.8a or patch 5065
______________________________________________________________________________

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that there is a vulnerability in Samba versions up to and
including Samba 2.2.8. This vulnerability, if exploited correctly, leads to
an anonymous user gaining root access on a Samba serving system.

See: http://master.samba.org/samba/samba.html (Samba News 7 Apr, 2003)
     http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0201

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in future releases of Samba and with a
patch for SGI's Samba 2.2.8.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

Samba for Irix is not installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems.  It is an
optional product that can be purchased and installed as "samba_irix".

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if Samba is installed, execute the following command:

% versions samba_irix
I = Installed, R = Removed

   Name                 Date        Description

   I  samba_irix           07/02/2002  Samba 2.2.4 for IRIX
   I  samba_irix.man       07/02/2002  Samba Online Documentation
   I  samba_irix.man.doc   07/02/2002  Samba 2.2.4 Documentation
   I  samba_irix.man.manpages  07/02/2002  Samba 2.2.4 Man Page
   I  samba_irix.man.relnotes  07/02/2002  Samba 2.2.4 Release Notes
   I  samba_irix.src       07/02/2002  Samba Source Code
   I  samba_irix.src.samba 07/02/2002  Samba 2.2.4 Source Code
   I  samba_irix.sw        07/02/2002  Samba Execution Environment
   I  samba_irix.sw.base   07/02/2002  Samba 2.2.4 Execution Environment

If the result is similar to the above and the version shown is less than
2.2.8a, then the system is vulnerable.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

Though it is possible to limit exposure by filtering what IPs can talk to
your Samba server, there is no effective workaround to fully address these
problems.  SGI recommends upgrading to Samba 2.2.8 and installing patch 5065.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a patch for Samba 2.2.8 for this vulnerability. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to Samba 2.2.8 and install the patch.

Patch 5065 only applies to the samba_irix 2.2.8 package.
This patch will not apply to the freeware versions of samba available from:
http://freeware.sgi.com/ , http://www.samba.org/ and
http://master.samba.org/samba/ftp/Binary_Packages/IRIX/

   NOTES

     1) This version of the IRIX operating has been retired. Upgrade to an
        actively supported IRIX operating system.  See http://support.sgi.com
        for more information.

     2) If you have not received an IRIX 6.5.X CD for IRIX 6.5, contact your
        SGI Support Provider or URL: http://support.sgi.com

     3) If a version of Samba prior to 2.2.8a is installed, the system is
        vulnerable and you should upgrade to Samba 2.2.8 and install the patch.
