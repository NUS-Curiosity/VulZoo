     Great piece of research by Erik Forsberg and his team.  However, this 
vulnerability does NOT affect Remote Desktop Web connection (aka TSAC), 
when used with SSL.  This is because the RDP web client would rely on the 
Server-Side SSL cert to prove the authenticity of the server, making MTM 
attacks "virtually" impossible.

     Anyway, if you're deploying RDP and are worried about this exploit, 
try running it over SSL.  More information can be found at:
