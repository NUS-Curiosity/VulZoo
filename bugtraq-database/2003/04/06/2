Subject: Seti@...e exploit

I'm only human... here's the attachment. :P

It's a stripped version with the really cool features yanked out, but I'm sure you can code those yourself... You've got to ask yourself a question though: Could there be a remote compromise in the exploit itself ? Script kiddies beware...

Last minute notice:
Seti@...e has finally produced fixed versions, that's why the advisory was released today.
