1) If a user enters the right password in the voyager login window she is

internet.

2) As I said before, that only works for a+r files, not every file on the
system.

1) It being readable to all users *authorized to use the system* is
different
from it being readable to any bozo on the entire Internet.

2) /etc/master.password is used as a *Proof of Concept*.  Feel free to
substitute any other file that might be more damaging to have.  Hmm.. it
might be nice to snarf a copy of /etc/inetd.conf, see what's enabled.. or
maybe I want to grab a copy of.....
