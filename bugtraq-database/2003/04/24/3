May I ask how this applies to "IKE Shared Secret AAA"?
If a Radius backend authenticator is used, is the shared key
that is vulnerable one preconfigured in the VPN hosts or one
based on the Radius password? The reason I ask is that the
preconfigured shared key can easily be lengthened but the
backend password, if based on end user passwords, is not
as easy a solution. :)
