Subject: BEA WebLogic internal hostname disclosure


Hi,

During a penentration test, I discovered that the BEA Weblogic Server 
reveals it hostname (on windows machines NetBIOS name) while sending the 
following request:

GET . HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n

On older systems (Weblogic 7.0), a simple "BLAH . BLAH\r\n\r\n" will do 
the same trick.  BEA was contacted about two weeks ago, but I haven't 
heard from them (yet).

Regards,
Michael
