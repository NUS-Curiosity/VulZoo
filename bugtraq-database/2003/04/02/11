	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	samba
Affected products:	ImmunixOS 6.2, 7.0, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0085
Date:			Mon Mar 31 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-003-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...ex.com>

Description:
  Quoting from the Samba security advisory:
    The SuSE security audit team, in particular Sebastian Krahmer
    <krahmer@...e.de>, has found a flaw in the Samba main smbd code
    which could allow an external attacker to remotely and anonymously
    gain Super User (root) privileges on a server running a Samba server.
  in more detail:
    A buffer overrun condition exists in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment
    re-assembly code in smbd which would allow an attacker to cause smbd
    to overwrite arbitrary areas of memory in its own process address
    space. This could allow a skilled attacker to inject binary specific
    exploit code into smbd.
  The patch was prepared by "Jeremy Allison and reviewed by engineers
  from the Samba Team, SuSE, HP, SGI, Apple, and the Linux vendor
  engineers on the Linux Vendor security mailing list."

  We would like to thank Jay Fenlason at Red Hat for separating the
  security-critical portions of the patch apart from the rest of the
  Samba-supplied fix.
