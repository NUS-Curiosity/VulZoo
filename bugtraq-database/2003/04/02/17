                    Apache 2.0.45 Released

The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to announce the eighth public release of the Apache 2.0
HTTP Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in
2.0.45 as compared to 2.0.44.

OS2 users; note that Apache 2.0 versions *including* 2.0.45 still
have a Denial of Service vulnerability that was identified and reported 
by Robert Howard <rihoward@...bw.com> that will fixed with the release
of 2.0.46, but is too important to delay announcement today.  The patch
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/apr/file_io/os2/filestat.c.diff?r1=1.34&r2=1.35
must be applied before building on OS2.  This patch will already 
be applied to all OS2 binaries released for Apache 2.0.45.
[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0134]

This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
Of particular note is that 2.0.45 addresses two security
vulnerabilities, both affecting all platforms.

Prior Apache 2.0 versions through 2.0.44 had a significant Denial of 
Service vulnerability that was identified and reported by David Endler 
<DEndler@...fense.com>, and fixed with this release.  The specific 
details of this issue will be published by David Endler one week from 
this release, on April 7th.  No more specific information is disclosed 
at this time, but all Apache 2.0 users are encouraged to upgrade now.
[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0132]

This release eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child
processes, such as CGI scripts, which could consitute a security threat
on servers that run untrusted CGI scripts.  This issue was identified,
reported and addressed by Christian Kratzer <ck@...oft.de> and
Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@...badoz.net>.

The Apache Software Foundation would like to thank David Endler, 
Christian Kratzer, Bjoern Zeeb and Robert Howard for the responsible 
reporting of these issues.

Apache 2.0.42 and later releases mark a change in the Apache release 
process, and a new level of stability in the 2.0 series.  With the
release of Apache 2.0.42, we will make every effort to retain 
forward compatibility so that upgrading along the 2.0 series should 
be much easier.  This compatibility extends from Apache release 2.0.42, 
so users of that version or later should be able to upgrade without 
changing configurations or updating DSO modules.  (Users of earlier 
releases will need to recompile all modules in order to upgrade 
to 2.0.42 or later versions.)

We consider this release to be the best version of Apache available
and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache 2.0.45 source code is available for download from

  http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/

Apache 2.0.45 binary releases will become available for download from

  http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/

Please see the CHANGES_2.0 file, linked from the above page, for
a full list of changes.

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase.  For an overview of new features introduced
after 1.3 please see

  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/new_features_2_0.html

When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please keep
in mind the following:

If you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs, you must
ensure that the modules (and the libraries they depend on) that you
will be using are thread-safe.  Please contact the vendors of these
modules to obtain this information.


                    Apache 2.0.45 Major changes

Security vulnerabilities closed since Apache 2.0.44

 *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0132]: Close a Denial of Service vulnerability
    identified by David Endler <DEndler@...fense.com> on all platforms.
    Details embargoed until their announcement on 7 April 2003.

 *) SECURITY:  Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child
    processes, such as CGI scripts.  This fix depends on the latest
    APR library release 0.9.2, which is distributed with the httpd 
    source tarball for Apache 2.0.45.  PR 17206

Bugs fixed and features added since Apache 2.0.44

 *) Prevent endless loops of internal redirects in mod_rewrite by
    aborting after exceeding a limit of internal redirects. The
    limit defaults to 10 and can be changed using the RewriteOptions
    directive. PR 17462.

 *) Configurable compression level for mod_deflate.

 *) Allow SSLMutex to select/use the full range of APR locking
    mechanisms available to it (e.g. same choices as AcceptMutex.)

 *) mod_cgi, mod_cgid, mod_ext_filter: Log errors when scripts cannot
    be started on Unix because of such problems as bad permissions,
    bad shebang line, etc.

 *) Try to log an error if a piped log program fails and try to
    restart a piped log program in more failure situations.

 *) Added support for mod_auth_LDAP, with a new AuthLDAPCharsetConfig 
    directive, to convert extended characters in the user ID to UTF-8,
    before authenticating against the LDAP directory.

 *) No longer removes the Content-Length from responses via mod_proxy.

 *) Enhance mod_isapi's WriteClient() callback to provide better emulation 
    for isapi extensions that use the first WriteClient() to send status 
    and headers, such as the foxisapi module.

 *) Win32: Avoid busy wait (consuming all the CPU idle cycles) when
    all worker threads are busy. 

 *) Introduced .pdb debugging symbols for Win32 release builds.

 *) Fixed piped access logs on Win32.

 *) Fix path handling of mod_rewrite, especially on non-unix systems.
    There was some confusion between local paths and URL paths.

 *) Added an rpm build script.
