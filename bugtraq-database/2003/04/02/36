Subject: Re: NSFOCUS SA2003-03: Solaris dtsession Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Dear All,

I wonder Sunsolve has update the security patches.

The following patches are still:

Solaris 2.6     106027-11
Solaris 2.6_x86 106028-11
Solaris 7       107702-11
Solaris 7_x86   107703-11
Solaris 8       109354-18

Regards
Alan
