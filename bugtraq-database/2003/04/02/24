Subject: OpenSSH 3.6.1 released


OpenSSH 3.6.1 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
	http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18

and for European orders, use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu


Changes since OpenSSH 3.6:
========================== 

* The 'kex guesses' bugfix from OpenSSH 3.6 triggers a bug
  in a few other SSH v2 implementations and causes connections to
  stall.  OpenSSH 3.6.1 disables this bugfix when interoperating
  with these implementations.


Changes between OpenSSH 3.5 and OpenSSH 3.6:
============================================

* RSA blinding is now used by ssh(1), sshd(8) and ssh-agent(1).
  in order to avoid potential timing attacks against the RSA keys.
  Older versions of OpenSSH have been using RSA blinding in
  ssh-keysign(1) only.

  Please note that there is no evidence that the SSH protocol is
  vulnerable to the OpenSSL/TLS timing attack described in
        http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf

* ssh-agent(1) optionally requires user confirmation if a key gets
  used, see '-c' in ssh-add(1).

* sshd(8) now handles PermitRootLogin correctly when UsePrivilegeSeparation
  is enabled.

* sshd(8) now removes X11 cookies when a session gets closed.

* ssh-keysign(8) is disabled by default and only enabled if the
  new EnableSSHKeysign option is set in the global ssh_config(5)
  file.

* ssh(1) and sshd(8) now handle 'kex guesses' correctly (key exchange
  guesses).

* ssh(1) no longer overwrites SIG_IGN.  This matches behaviour from
  rsh(1) and is used by backup tools.

* setting ProxyCommand to 'none' disables the proxy feature, see
  ssh_config(5).

* scp(1) supports add -1 and -2.

* scp(1) supports bandwidth limiting.

* sftp(1) displays a progressmeter.

* sftp(1) has improved error handling for scripting.
