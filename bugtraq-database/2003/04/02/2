GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200303-26
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : openafs
          SUMMARY : cryptographic weakness in Kerberos v4
             DATE : 2003-03-30 15:50 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <1.3.2-r1
    FIXED VERSION : >=1.3.2-r1
              CVE : CAN-2003-0139

- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:
"A cryptographic weakness in version 4 of the Kerberos protocol allows an
attacker to use a chosen-plaintext attack to impersonate any principal in a
realm. OpenAFS kaserver implements version 4 of the Kerberos protocol, and
therefore is vulnerable. An attacker that knows a shared cross-realm key
between any remote realm and the local realm can impersonate any principal in
the local realm to AFS database servers and file servers in the local cell,
and other services in the local realm. An attacker that can create arbitrary
principal names in a realm can also impersonate any principal in that realm."

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-fs/openafs upgrade to openafs-1.3.2-r1 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge openafs
emerge clean
