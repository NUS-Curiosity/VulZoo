	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	cvs
Affected products:	ImmunixOS 7.0, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0015
Date:			Wed Apr  2 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-004-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...ex.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Stefan Esser discovered a double free() bug in CVS that can be
  remotely exploited by anonymous users to gain write access to the CVS
  repository. This write access can be converted into execute access
  using the CVS protocol commands "Checkin-prog" and "Update-prog".

  Igor Dobrovitski: "The impact of a successful exploitation is not
  that great: an unprivileged access to the system, where your calls to
  getuid() will return a number that's far from 0 (cvs drops provileges,
  and does it right)."

  We did not disable the Checkin-prog and Update-prog protocol commands;
  be aware that granting CVS write access is tantamount to also giving
  execute access on the repository.
