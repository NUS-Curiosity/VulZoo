Subject: [VulnDiscuss] Dangerous permissions in unitedlinux

Attached document explains all.

Rant: People using a product called 'antigen' should be shot, stabbed, and
shot again. Today, more than a month after posting DSR-toppler.pl and
sircd.sh, I _still_ get 5-8 emails a day saying that 'a virus have been
found and quarantined'. Oh please, get a grip. And please oh please stop
sending email from invalid addresses, I can't even mail you back and tell
you what I think of your AV solution.
