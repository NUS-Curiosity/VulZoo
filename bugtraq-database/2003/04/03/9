//@(#) Mordred Security Labs advisory

Release date: April 1, 2003
Name: Integer overflow in PHP array_pad() function
Versions affected: all versions
Risk: average
Author: Sir Mordred (mordred@...ail.com)

I. Description:

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.
Please visit http://www.php.net for more information about PHP.

II. Details:

The function array_pad(array input, int pad_size, mixed pad_value) returns
a copy
of the input padded to size specified by pad_size with pad_value.

Unfortunately the implementation of this function suffers from an integer
overflow caused by
a very long second argument and could allow a local/remote attacker in
the worst case
to gain control over the web server.

The following short script will cause a httpd child to die:

$ cat t.php
<?php
    array_pad(array(1,2,3), 0x40000003, "pad");
?>

III. Platforms tested

Linux 2.4 with Apache 1.3.27 / PHP 4.3.1

IV. Vendor response

Vendor has been contacted.
