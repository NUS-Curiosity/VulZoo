-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

______________________________________________________________________________
                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Sendmail parseaddr security vulnerability
Number   : 20030401-01-P
Date     : April 2, 2003
Reference: CERT CA-2003-12
Reference: CERT VU#897604
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0161
Reference: SGI BUG 886104
Fixed in : IRIX 6.5.20 or patches 5045 and 5046
______________________________________________________________________________

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that there is a vulnerability in Sendmail versions 8.12.8
and prior. The address parser performs insufficient bounds checking in
certain conditions due to a char to int conversion, making it possible for
an attacker to take control of the application.  This vulnerability may be
exploited by a remote attacker, no local account is required.  It may be
possible to gain root access through this vulnerability.

See the following:

  http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2003-March/008973.html
  http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-12.html
  http://www.sendmail.org/8.12.9.html
  http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/897604

for additional information.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with patches and in future releases of
IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The sendmail binary is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as part of
eoe.sw.base.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

At this time, there is no effective workaround (other than disabling
sendmail) for these problems.  SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX
6.5.20, or installing the appropriate patch from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20 when available, or install the
appropriate patch.
