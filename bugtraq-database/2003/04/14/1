---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated gtkhtml packages that fix a vulnerability are available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

GtkHTML is the HTML rendering widget used by the Evolution mail reader. 

GtkHTML supplied with versions of Evolution prior to 1.2.4 contain a bug
when handling HTML messages.  Alan Cox discovered that certain malformed
messages could cause the Evolution mail component to crash.

Users of Evolution are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a backported fix correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/gtkhtml-1.1.9-0.9.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/gtkhtml-1.1.9-0.9.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/gtkhtml-devel-1.1.9-0.9.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
