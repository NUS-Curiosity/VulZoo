Proposed Solution:
  If you have the licensed version of the product, protect the numerical
values within the CFQUERY tags:

for example:
  In queries/oraclen/qry_GetOriginalMessage.cfm
    change
  WHERE m.tpcid = #tpcid#
  AND m.userid = u.userid
  AND m.msgid = #msgid#

to

  WHERE m.tpcid = #VAL(tpcid)#
  AND m.userid = u.userid
  AND m.msgid = #VAL(msgid)#
