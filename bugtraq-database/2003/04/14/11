Subject: ActivCard password cache memory leakage




In December of the 2002 I was analysing the ActivCard product for a client.
During the analysis I noticed that making a memory dump of the process
"scardsrv" was possible to obtain the users stored staticaly in the card.

This issue at first, could seem smaller, although in depth already it has a
very serious character, but deepening the analisis I found that even with
the card pulled out from the pc the users and passwords remained in memory. 

This was reported properly to ActivCard (this can be reed in the mail thread
at next).

This was the answer

Here is the answer from our Product Manager about this issue:

The problem found relates to accessing static passwords stored (for
performance) in a memory cache by ActivCard Gold. ActivCard recognizes the
seriousness of this problem, and will fix it in the next version of the
product - ActivCard is currently working on a mechanism that will prevent a
memory dump to access any kind of personal data. 
Note that this problem is only applicable to static passwords. PKI private
keys and Dynamic Password keys are always stored securely on the card and
never loaded on the PC. 
Also note that this problem only happens after the user has accessed the
card with his PIN, and while the user is still using the card. As soon as
the user removes the card and logs out of his session, the cache is cleared
and the static passwords cannot be accessed anymore. (/****NOTE***** This is
not true, I do some test and even when pulled out the card the users and
pass remain in memory area******/)

I have  not recived any news or contact since february, I believe is
convenient to publish this "vulnerability" to accelerate the process of
correction.

I will try to collect more information to you, by now I send some answers to
your questions.
 
1) I�m using version ActivCard (R) Gold 2.2 (BN39) October 11th, 2002
 
2) The smart card type 16k ( What other info you need ? ) 
 
3) I�m not working in any way with the DoD.
 
4) I need to take an extra care in the dump of the memory because I cannot
send any private information. This can take some extra time...But if you
want to reproduce the test.  Add some static password to your card, then
only put your card pin ( without using any of the static passwords ) and
using pmdump dump the memory of scardsrv process and you will see the users
and passwords in the memory dump.

Thanks,
        Hern�n Otero

Hernan, 

Thank you for informing us of this. 

I have a few questions for you which will help me to diagnose and work on
this issue: 

1) What version of ActivCard Gold are you using?  This information can be
found in the readme.txt in the installation package or in c:\program
files\activcard\activcard gold\docs.

2) What type of smart card are you using? 

3) Is this in any way related to the DOD project?  If so, is this related to
RAPIDS? 

4) Could you provide me a copy of the dump and/or the analysis of the dump? 

All of these items will be useful in helping us to analyze the situation. 

Best Regards, 
Jensen Toma
