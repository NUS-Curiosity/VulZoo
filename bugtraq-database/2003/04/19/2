Subject: IE 6.0 - trivial crash - part II


Hello,

Nothing to add again, just a trivial IE crash.
http://www.sztolnia.pl/hack/TrivialIECrash2/TrivialIECrash2.html

I checked the net and haven't found any other sysmon.ocx 
vulnerability, except this one http://www.ussrback.com/labs57.html 
but this one uses different CLSID. 
Thx to Richard Moore who pointed out my rediscovery in my last post.
