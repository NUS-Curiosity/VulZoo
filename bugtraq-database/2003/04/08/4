Subject: RE: mIRC "dcc filename spoofing"


This is, of course, the same rehash of the same advisory released saying
the same thing about 3 times over as many years.

Has anybody actually reported the problem to the developer?

Attached document explains all.

Rant: People using a product called 'antigen' should be shot, stabbed,
and shot again. Today, more than a month after posting DSR-toppler.pl
and sircd.sh, I _still_ get 5-8 emails a day saying that 'a virus have
been found and quarantined'. Oh please, get a grip. And please oh please
stop sending email from invalid addresses, I can't even mail you back
and tell you what I think of your AV solution.
