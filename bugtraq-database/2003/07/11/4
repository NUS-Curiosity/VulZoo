Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0025

Package name:      apache
Summary:           DoS and possible incorrect cipher
Date:              2003-07-11
Affected versions: TSL 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Apache is a full featured web server that is freely available, and also
  happens to be the most widely used.

Problem description:
  From the announcement:

    This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
    A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document. Of 
    particular note is that 2.0.47 addresses four security vulnerabilities:

    Certain sequences of per-directory renegotiations and the SSLCipherSuite
    directive being used to upgrade from a weak ciphersuite to a strong one
    could result in the weak ciphersuite being used in place of the strong
    one.  [CAN-2003-0192]

    Certain errors returned by accept() on rarely accessed ports could
    cause temporal denial of service, due to a bug in the prefork MPM.
    [CAN-2003-0253]

    Denial of service was caused when target host is IPv6 but ftp proxy
    server can't create IPv6 socket.
    [CAN-2003-0254]

    The server would crash when going into an infinite loop due to too
    many subsequent internal redirects and nested subrequests.
    [VU#379828]

  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
