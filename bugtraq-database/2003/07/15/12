Subject: DSL- Router Teledat 530 DoS


Hello,

behind my DSL-router Teledat 530 I have a Windows-box with a Norton 
Firewall 2003. The Symantec security scan on 
http://security.symantec.com/ssc/ (I think a normal portscan) lets the 
router crash - reboot is required.

The vendor (Deutsche Telekom) told me to uninstall Norton Firewall to 
solve this problem. :-(
