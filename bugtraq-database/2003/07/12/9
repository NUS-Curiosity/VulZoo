Subject: cross site scripting htmltonuke




I find a bug in some versions of htmltonuke.

servers with php-nuke installed are not vulnerables

some versions of htmltonuke only have permisions to acces to html files, 
but if you tipe the script before a invalid html file, the script are 
executed.

exploit:
