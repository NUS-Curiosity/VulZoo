Let us consider ourselves lucky. That is an extremely low number.

As I see it, someone in the states should file a complaint with the FBI
(if one has not already been charged) and they can handle this guy.
If not, the best way, as I see, it is to check where the Trojan gets the
information it uses from, a.k.a. where it connects. Should give you the
right IP for abuse mail.
If you get rid of that one IP, you effectively get rid of the thousand
infected machines.

>    bigvolumesites.com
>    wolrdofpisem.com
>    arizonasiteslist.com

>    linkxxxsites.com

Here's a place to start with the abuse mails, find out what ISP hosts
them and cross your fingers they won't send your emails to /dev/null.

involved, but the evidence is not strong at the moment.

The DSL and Cable IP ranges get scanned _even_ more than the rest of the
world. Anybody remembers that paper that stated a computer would get
scanned 36 hours after it establishes a connection to the Internet?
Well, I am on ADSL with my home machine, and surprisingly enough I got
hit the second I switched to ADSL and I get ten to fifteen scans a
minute. That said not mentioning being a secondary victims to kiddies
using these IP ranges to spoof attacks (ICMP echo 3).
