Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a serious security flaw in all 
versions of
ASP-DEV Discussion Forum "with many updated features, bug fixes and code 
enhancements."


Details

*******

ASP-DEV Discussion Forum V2.0 is an ASP forum system that covers all the 
needs for a forum. 

It's possible to retrieve sensible users information. There is an 
administrative
section for administrating this forum. This section is located here:

http://www.example.com/forum/admin/ (if forum is the installation dir of 
the forum)

By default this page isn't restricted, so everyone can be the 
administrator of this
forum. Everyone can see every password and every users information.

Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced


Suggestions:

************

Protect the admin directory.
