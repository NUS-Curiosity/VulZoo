No, it's not.  We recently attempted to standardize the occurrences
of 'invalid' domain names to the accepted 'example.*' faux domains.
The stock configurations in the next releases of Apache Web Server
have corrected the few that were missed, including the example above.

On the other side of this issue, it's not unreasonable to use a class 
of addresses that doesn't exist, for the purposes of prohibiting all
access until the user takes the time to properly update their conf, 
IMHO.

On this point, too, it would be valuable to provide an example subnet as
a preferable alternative to reverse DNS queries.  That change has not been
made yet - but is referred to our documentation project.
