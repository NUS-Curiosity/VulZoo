Hi,

Lets keep this nice and tidy and don't give on, on people ok?
Your opinions about someone that he cannot code, which is true or untrue,
are in my opinion not for publical debat on a full-disclosure mailinglist.

Let's stick to the leaks spotting and giving technical feedback/answering
technical questions of this list.

Thanks in advance!

Advisory


HEY DONNIE! I LUB U BUDDY

Edited Message sent to two parties follows:

this *IS* an advisory. The person who made the script is the one e-mailing
you saying it is not. But if you would like it would take ten seconds to
download the script and see for yourself. He is embarrased that he can not
code so he is saying it is a fake advisory. The advisory IS NOT however from
"Donnie Werner", as the email and title states it is from ME
morning_wood@...gapore.net (as if two people have never had the same
nickname/handle before?)

While morning_wood@...loitlabs aka "Donnie Werner" may be ashamed that he
can not code yet claims to be a "security researcher", don't let him give
you false information on the advisory being fake. The advisory IS REAL.

Script: http://exploitlabs.com/files/woods/wnikto32-phpfe.zip

SECONDS!.

Donnie Werner: Don't spread lies because you are embarassed. I'm sure this
isn't the only person you have contacted. You are hurting peoples BUSINESS
NOW! SHAME ON YOU!! SHAME ON YOU!!
