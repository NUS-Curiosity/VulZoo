Subject: Unrealircd & Anope services - join segmentation fault in operserv.c




If an admin say this command: '/msg operserv raw
:nickserv join #chan' NickServ join in that chan, ok.
If the command was: '/msg operserv raw : join #chan'
ircd go to SEGFAULT. Why?
Case 1: operserv ordine to a nick (NickServ) to join #chan
Case 2: operserv ordine to server to join #chan
Ircd go to SEGFAULT because it don't find that nick
(eg. hub.server.net).
In fact, if you say: '/msg operserv raw : privmsg #chan
bye' the nick is hub.server.net and not OperServ.
Solutions?
Filter operserv.c in function do_raw or filter ircd
function m_join in s_user.c
