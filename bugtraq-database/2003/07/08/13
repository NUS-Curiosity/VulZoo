Published: 08/07/2003

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a serious security flaw in 
Rockliffe's MailSite Management Agent (version 5.3.4). This server allows 
remote users to access their POP3 accounts and read their mail over HTTP. 
The service usually listens on TCP port 80. The system allows an attacker 
to retrieve all attachments from it granting access to sensible 
information .

Details

*******

Many sites (you can find them using google) register all accesses to 
their websites. This information is collected in their stats page. It's 
very easy to find them (example www.site.com/stats/). From that point, an 
attacker could retrieve without authentication any attachments on every 
email that is online and not deleted from the mail server.

From the stats page it's possible to see every access on every page on 
the webserver so also in the MailSite structure. When a user visualizes 
the mail attachements, the stat package is generating a link like this 
one: 
http://www.site.com/express/cache/DC44AEECB46AE0C029E85BBD43089833/4118200
66/attachment

The default installation path of Mailsite Managements Agent is /express. 
Every attachment is stored in the sub directory called cache. Access path 
to this directory is granted through a randomly generated url so it's 
impossible to retrieve any attachments from it. Connecting instead from 
the link contained in the stat package page, it is possible to retrieve 
directly any attachment.

Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced

Suggestions:

************

Protect your web statistics page with a login procedure. Upgrade your 
current version of Mail Site Express when the vendor will release the 
patch to fix this problem.
