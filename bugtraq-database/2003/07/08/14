According to you, the IRC server crashes because ": " is expanded (or,
rather, interpreted) as the name of the server. This causes the server to
crash, since servers can't join channels and so forth.

My question is why any sensible administrator would actually use the RAW
command on Services to send such a command to an IRC server. The RAW
command does just as it says; it transmits the raw parameter string to the
uplink server. This can only be done by Services administrators, who are
supposed to be responsible enough not to send strings to the IRC server
which will crash it.

This "exploit" only seems like it would be usable after the server->server
authentication/link process has completed, and therefore presents no risk
from users who you do not trust.

Your advisory is akin to telling somebody not to stab his friend in the
chest with a pitchfork.
