it's much easier than that to reproduce; with the right combination of
cut and paste (think emacs key bindings) you can overfill  the field and
get through in just a few seconds :-). on one of the machines here
(version 10.2.6 for those who care) it took 10 - 15 seconds in most
cases.

hopefully no one considered the screensaver to be much protection...
