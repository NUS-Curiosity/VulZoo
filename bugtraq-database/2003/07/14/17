I'll add further information to this...

Part of StarSiege spawned Tribes 2, which is where Dynamix dissolved 
after being purchased by Sierra.  (In France?  WFT?  Dynamix was located 
in the US.)

Since then, another company now owns the Tribes 2 engine - Garage Games 
(http://www.garagegames.com) They took it, and stripped it of all the T2 
IP, and relicensed it to Indie game developers under the title of Torque 
(really nice engine with a great license scheme - I'm a licensee and 
getting close to completion of a title based off the engine.)  Since 
Torque is derived from Tribes by way of Tribes 2, I've passed along the 
information and attached code to Tim Gift, who's checking to make sure 
the Torque engine and the games that make use of it are / are not 
subject to this particular DoS.
