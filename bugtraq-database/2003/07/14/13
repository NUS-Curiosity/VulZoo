Subject: RE: Website to (Safely) Check Content Filtering S/W for Malicious Code???


Hello Scott,
Finjan Software may offer such a web proxy service in the future, using our gateway product for behavior analysis.
You can also send me the details of the web site, and it will be analyzed in our research center.
Please don't hesitate to ask questions.
