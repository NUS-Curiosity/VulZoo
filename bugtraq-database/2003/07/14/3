Subject: Netscape 7.02 Client Detection Tool plug-in buffer overrun




Advisory name
=============

Netscape 7.02 Client Detection Tool plug-in buffer overrun

Affected software
=================

Netscape 7.02 for Windows

Problem description
===================

Netscape 7.02 (and probably earlier versions) contains Client Detection 
Tool plug-in that handles application/x-cdt Mime type. One of this plug-in 
routines suffers from buffer overrun. To exploit this issue one needs to 
send mail message to victim with attachment that has specifically crafted 
filename and entice the victim to double-click it. When the victim double
clicks the attachment then attacker's code is executed in context of 
victim's user account. Proof-of-concept exploit is published in whitepaper 
"CDT plug-in bug: exploit in ASCII": 

http://jimmers.russia.webmatrixhosting.net/whitepapers/CDTbug.pdf

Mitigating factors
==================

Attacker must know OS and length of victim username to exploit this issue.
Also proof-of-concept exploit assumes that user runs Windows with default
settings.

Resolution
==========

Manually remove CDT plug-in (npcdt.dll) from Netscape /components folder 
or upgrade to latest version of the browser that has CDT plug-in removed.

Vendor status
=============

Netscape was notified. Netscape considers this bug as "internal" so no 
patch will be released.
