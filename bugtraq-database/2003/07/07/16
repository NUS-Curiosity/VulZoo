Subject: Re: MacOSX - crash screensaver locked with password and get the	desktop
 back


I can confirm this with Mac OSX 10.2.6 (Darwin 6.6)

It appears as though there's a buffer overflow somewhere in the password
handling of the screen saver password.  I haven't done enough testing to
know whether priviledge escalation is possible, but it might be.

At the best, this bug renders the screen-saver password feature useless.
Any user can bypass the screen saver and gain access to the system with
the rights of the currently logged-in user.  Until Apple provides a patch
for this, do not consider screen-saver passwords as offering any security
whatsoever.  The vuln is local only, as the attacker needs physical access
to the keyboard to exploit it.

He's quite right about the "5 minutes" of "held down key" to trigger it ...
I didn't bother to count or calculate how many characters this involves.
I also noted that it doesn't work all the time.  At least half of my tests
appeared to lock the screensaver up, but not in such a manner that I could
gain access to the machine.  Most often it worked on the second or third
try.
