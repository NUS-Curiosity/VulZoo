ZH2003-2SA (security advisory): QShop priviledge escalation
Published: 09/07/2003

Released: 09/07/2003

Name: QShop priviledge escalation

Affected Systems: QShop v2.5 (and older versions?)

Issue: Remote attackers can obtain full access to the remote system

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a serious security flaw in QShop v2.5 
(and older versions?). This storefront system allows remote 
administration for an online shopping system. The remote administration 
usually is in the directory /qshop/admin.

Details

*******

Q-Shop is an ASP shopping cart / storefront system that covers all the 
needs for ecommerce web sites. Q-Shop is not just a shopping cart but a 
full online shop system including web based shop administration.

In the remote administration there is a script that allows the 
administrator to add images, text etc. on the webserver. This page is by 
default located at: /qshop/admin/upload.htm . This page is reachable 
without authentication. Using this sample upload script it is possible 
for a remote attacker to upload files like ntdaddy.asp, cmd.asp, 
explore.asp on the webserver gaining full access to the webserver.


Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced


Suggestions:

************

Delete the upload procedure.
