I actually *would* describe the bug below as a logwatch bug.
If you have a uid=0 program calling shell scripts from
data like filenames, those filenames should be sanitized.
It would be easy enough to scan the filename for unexpected
characters and refuse to use them on that basis.

something as simple as:

if ($command =~ /[^\w]){
	carp "Unexpected filename: [[$LogFile]]. Not used\n"
}else{
     	`/bin/cat $Command`;
};

I believe that PERL actually has a pragma that you can set that
should cause it to complain about cases like this. (sorry --
don't have my book here with me).
