Subject: [SNS Advisory No.66] Apache HTTP Server v2 Causes a DoS When Parsing a Type-Map File

SNS Advisory No.66
Apache HTTP Server v2 Causes a DoS When Parsing a Type-Map File

Problem first discovered on: Thu, 26 Dec 2002
Published on: Wed, 09 Jul 2003
Reference: http://www.lac.co.jp/security/english/snsadv_e/66_e.html
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
  Apache versions prior to 2.0.47 contain a locally exploitable DoS
  condition.


Problem Description:
--------------------
  Apache HTTP Server v2 supports a content negotiation functionality, 
  which can provide the best resources based on the browser-supplied
  preferences for media type, languages, character set and encoding.
  
  The type-map file is one of the methods used for resources negotiation.

  A local attacker can trigger an infinite loop and deplete the system's
  resources by causing the Apache HTTP Server to parse a malicious
  type-map file.  Consequently, local exploitation can result in a denial
  of service condition.


Tested Versions:
----------------
  Apache 2.0.43
  Apache 2.0.44
  Apache 2.0.45
  Apache 2.0.46


対策:
-----
  This vulnerability can be eliminated by upgrading to Apache 2.0.47.
