Very good.

All one needs to do is ask. After wading through a mountain of childish,
 almost fanatical defences of Microsoft and bitter flames for asking
the question, we have a solution from Microsoft today.

Hi,
Thank you very much for your reply.
A new auto responder has been configured at security@...rosoft.com which
will redirect you to secure@...rosoft.com as a temporary solution until
we can fully migrate "security" to the Security Response Center-- which
is actually in progress.
Traditionally, security@...rosoft.com (which is our internal fire and
life safety department) has been very good about forwarding all email
destined for us.

Thank you again for your feedback. Please let me know if you have any
additional questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Terri

Why do you people insist on using such an unobvious address? Do you have
a catch-all in place?

secure@...rosoft.com is a whimsical address almost as silly as
designating
"abuse@...rosoft.com" to "badstuff@...rosoft.com".

If check where those people you heard saying they tried to contact you
tried first, you would see that the first and most logical address would
be security@...rosoft.com

I really do hope you have that address monitored as well, because as
long as you are in existence, people will not learn what the correct
address is and where to burrow down on your site to make submissions.

Can you confirm that this address security@...rosoft.com is being
monitored
as well.

Microsoft Security Response Center:

Periodically we hear people say they tried to contact Microsoft about
a product or service vulnerability and that Microsoft didn't respond.
 We are concerned that people may not know how to report security
vulnerabilities to Microsoft.

The Microsoft Security Response Center investigates all reports of
security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products. If you believe
you have found a security vulnerability affecting a Microsoft
product, we'd like to work with you to investigate it.

You can contact the Microsoft Security Response Center by emailing
secure@...rosoft.com directly, or you can submit your report via our
web-based vulnerability reporting form located at
https://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/se
curity/bulletin/alertus.asp.

Sincerely,
Microsoft Security Response Center
