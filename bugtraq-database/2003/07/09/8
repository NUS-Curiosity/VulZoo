                       Apache 2.0.47 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
   pleased to announce the tenth public release of the Apache 2.0
   HTTP Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in
   2.0.47 as compared to 2.0.46.


   This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
   A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   Of particular note is that 2.0.47 addresses four security
   vulnerabilities:

   Certain sequences of per-directory renegotiations and the SSLCipherSuite
   directive being used to upgrade from a weak ciphersuite to a strong one
   could result in the weak ciphersuite being used in place of the strong
   one.
   [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0192]

   Certain errors returned by accept() on rarely accessed ports could cause
   temporal denial of service, due to a bug in the prefork MPM.
   [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0253]

   Denial of service was caused when target host is IPv6 but ftp proxy
   server can't create IPv6 socket.
   [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0254]

   The server would crash when going into an infinite loop due to too many
   subsequent internal redirects and nested subrequests.
   [VU#379828]

   The Apache Software Foundation would like to thank Saheed Akhtar and
   Yoshioka Tsuneo for the responsible reporting of two of these issues.


   This release is compatible with modules compiled for 2.0.42 and later
   versions.  We consider this release to be the best version of Apache
   available and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

   Apache 2.0.47 is available for download from

     http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

   Please see the CHANGES_2.0 file, linked from the above page, for
   a full list of changes.

   Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
   boosts over the 1.3 codebase.  For an overview of new features introduced
   after 1.3 please see

     http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/new_features_2_0.html

   When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please keep
   in mind the following:

   If you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs, you must
   ensure that the modules (and the libraries they depend on) that you
   will be using are thread-safe.  Please contact the vendors of these
   modules to obtain this information.


                       Apache 2.0.47 Major changes

   Security vulnerabilities closed since Apache 2.0.46

    *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0192]: Fixed a bug whereby certain sequences
       of per-directory renegotiations and the SSLCipherSuite directive
       being used to upgrade from a weak ciphersuite to a strong one
       could result in the weak ciphersuite being used in place of the
       strong one.  [Ben Laurie]

    *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0253]: Fixed a bug in prefork MPM causing
       temporary denial of service when accept() on a rarely accessed port
       returns certain errors.  Reported by Saheed Akhtar
       <S.Akhtar@...is.com>.  [Jeff Trawick]

    *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0254]: Fixed a bug in ftp proxy causing denial
       of service when target host is IPv6 but proxy server can't create
       IPv6 socket.  Fixed by the reporter.  [Yoshioka Tsuneo
       <tsuneo.yoshioka@...ecure.com>]

    *) SECURITY [VU#379828] Prevent the server from crashing when entering
       infinite loops. The new LimitInternalRecursion directive configures
       limits of subsequent internal redirects and nested subrequests, after
       which the request will be aborted.  PR 19753 (and probably others).
       [William Rowe, Jeff Trawick, André Malo]


   Bugs fixed and features added since Apache 2.0.46

    *) core_output_filter: don't split the brigade after a FLUSH bucket if
       it's the last bucket.  This prevents creating unneccessary empty
       brigades which may not be destroyed until the end of a keepalive
       connection.
       [Juan Rivera <Juan.Rivera@...rix.com>]

    *) Add support for "streamy" PROPFIND responses.
       [Ben Collins-Sussman <sussman@...lab.net>]

    *) mod_cgid: Eliminate a double-close of a socket.  This resolves
       various operational problems in a threaded MPM, since on the
       second attempt to close the socket, the same descriptor was
       often already in use by another thread for another purpose.
       [Jeff Trawick]

    *) mod_negotiation: Introduce "prefer-language" environment variable,
       which allows to influence the negotiation process on request basis
       to prefer a certain language.  [André Malo]

    *) Make mod_expires' ExpiresByType work properly, including for
       dynamically-generated documents.  [Ken Coar, Bill Stoddard]
