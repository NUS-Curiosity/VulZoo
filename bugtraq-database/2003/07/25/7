- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that the PROTOS smnp test suite can potentially be used
to disrupt the operations of the Emulex 1Gbit Fibre Channel Hub, resulting
in a Denial of Service.

For more information, see:
  http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html
  http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/8115
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0013

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The Emulex FibreChannel hub is an optional product and is not part of the
IRIX operating system. It is supplied by SGI as a component in certain
system configurations.


- ------------------
- --- Workaround ---
- ------------------

SGI recommends the following workaround for this issue:

Use a router or other network device to block SNMP traffic destined for
the Emulex hub. Alternately, if you don't need to manage it via IP,
unplug it from the ethernet altogether.  Doing so should not impact
FibreChannel operations.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has not provided patches for these vulnerabilities. Our recommendation
is to follow the workaround instructions.


- ------------------------
- --- Acknowledgments ----
- ------------------------

SGI wishes to thank U-Oulu and the users of the Internet Community at large
for their assistance in this matter.
