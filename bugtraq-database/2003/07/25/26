Subject: scan.sygate.com.  over-scanning?


On a lark, I went to the sygate site, and asked them to do a
port scan.  From all I can see on the site, they seem to ONLY
claim to do a port scan, but a while later, I got a note from
my system about them doing a good bit more than just scanning
for an open port 80.

http://scan.sygatetech.com/

Is it just me, or are these kinds of vulnerability scans far
beyond what they were purporting to do?  Has anybody seen the
sygate site warn them of vulnerability to any of these scans?
