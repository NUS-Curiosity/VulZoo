Subject: Buffer Overflow in Netware Web Server PERL Handler


Topic: Buffer Overflow in Netware Web Server PERL Handler
Platform : Netware 5.1 SP6, Netware 6 under certain conditions.
Application : NetWare Enterprise Web Server
Advisory URL: http://www.protego.dk/advisories/200301.html
Identifiers: CERT: VU# 185593, CVE: CAN-2003-0562
Vendor Name: Novell, Inc. 
Vendor URL: http://www.novell.com
Vendor contacted: 10-Feb-2003
Public release: 23-Jul-2003

Problem:
The Netware Enterprise Server does not perform proper bounds check on
requests passed to the perl interpreter through the perl virtual
directory. This results in a buffer overflow condition, when large
requests are sent to the perl interpreter.

Details:
The issue can be triggered by requesting the perl virtual directory
followed by a long string.

http://server/perl/aaaaaa...[Unspecified number of characters]

The vulnerability occurs in the CGI2PERL.NLM module.

Impact:
A request like the above will overrun the allocated buffer and overwrite
EIP, causing the server to ABEND and either suspend the process or
restart itself, thereby creating a Denial of Service situation.

Corrective actions:
Novell has made a patch for this issue:
