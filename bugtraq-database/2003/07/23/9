============================ Description ============================

A Buffer Overflow in the PERL handler, (/perl/) may result in a 
server ABEND.  The problem is not in the Netscape-based Enterprise
Web Server, but in the Novell-supplied cgi2perl.nlm handler to PERL.

============================== Impact ===============================

One or more server ABENDs may be triggered by buffer overflows, 
resulting in degraded performance or crash of the server, in turn 
causing in a denial of service to legitimate users of the system.
There is no known ROOT shell exploit from this kind of failure on 
Netware.
