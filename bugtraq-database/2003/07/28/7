Wireless device.

Severity: High Risk

Description
***********
Cisco Aironet 1100 Series Access Point is a device manufactured by Cisco 
Systems offering a WLAN solution based on the 802.11b Wifi standard.
The Arionet Bridge is vulnerable to a denial of service.This can be 
exploited remotely by an attacker. No user login or password is necessary.

Details
*******

It is possible to cause Cisco Aironet Access Point to crash and reboot if 
the HTTP server feature is enabled. This can be accomplished by 
submitting a specially crafted request to the web server. There is no 
need to authenticate to perform this attack, only access to the web 
server is required. The Aironet bridge reboots upon receiving the request 
and failing to handle correctly this one. Afterwards, no further access 
to the WLAN or its services is possible.

Vendor status:
**************
Cisco was contacted June 19, 2003 and answered the same day. 5 days 
later, they told us that they would release a patch soon. The patch was 
finally released July 3, 2003.

Vulnerability Assessment:
A test case to detect this vulnerability was added to SecureScan NX in 
the upgrade package of July 28, 2003. You can see the documentation of 
this test case 17655 on SecureScan NX web site at 
http://securescannx.vigilante.com/tc/17655 . 
Fix:  A firmware upgrading the Aironet IOS version to c1100-k9w7 has been 
released by Cisco. Please note that this version fixes some other bugs as 
TC 15438 (refer to release note).

Bridge.
