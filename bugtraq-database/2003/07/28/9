VIGILANTe Security Watch Advisory

Name: Cisco Aironet AP1100 Valid Account Disclosure Vulnerability
Systems Affected: Tested on a Cisco Aironet AP1100 Model 1120B Series 
Wireless device.
Firmware version 12.2(4)JA and earlier.
NB : A large number of Cisco IOSes are affected by this flaw.
Severity: High Risk
Vendor URL: http://www.vigilante.com
Authors: Reda Zitouni (reda.zitouni@...ilante.com)
Date: 28th July 2003
Advisory Code: VIGILANTE-2003002

Description
***********
Cisco Aironet 1100 Series Access Point is a device manufactured by Cisco 
Systems offering a WLAN solution based on the 802.11b Wifi standard.
The Aironet Bridge is vulnerable to a Brute Force attack revealing if an 
account exists or not.

Details
*******
A flaw in firmware version 12.2(4)JA and earlier allows a malicious 
remote user to discover which accounts are valid on the targeted Cisco 
Aironet Access Point by using classical brute force techniques. 
Exploitation of this flaw is possible if the telnet service is enabled 
with authentication.

If an attacker submits an existing account as login he will be then 
prompted for the password. If not the case a ""% Login invalid" reply 
will be displayed by the server, revealing the account is not existing. 
By default on the Aironet AP1100, the 'cisco' account is set and is 
prompted for a password when submitted. That default account then allows 
an attacker to determine if this flaw on the remote device is patched or 
not. This may lead to further serious attacks.


Vendor status:
**************
Cisco was contacted June 19, 2003 and answered the same day. 5 days 
later, they told us that they would release a patch soon. The patch was 
finally released July 3, 2003. Please note that this flaw is released by 
Cisco as a Security Notice in CCO.

Vulnerability Assessment:
************************
A test case to detect this vulnerability was added to SecureScan NX in 
the upgrade package of July 28, 2003. You can see the documentation of 
this test case 15438 on SecureScan NX web site at 
http://securescannx.vigilante.com/tc/15438. 
Fix:  A firmware upgrading the Aironet IOS version to c1100-k9w7 has been 
released by Cisco. Please note that this version fixes some other bugs as 
TC 17655 (refer to release note).

Workaround:
***********
Restrict access to your telnet service from outside your WLAN. A stronger 
authentication mechanism, such as SSH can also be implemented.

CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures group ( reachable at 
http://cve.mitre.org/ ) was contacted and assigned CAN-2003-0512 to this
