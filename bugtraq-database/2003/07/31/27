It's been a few years and things may have changed, but in the past
Novell accomplished this by replacing the standard msgina.dll with one
of their own making. Microsoft provides information on how to do this
sort of thing:

FWIW, there is even a GNU replacement (well, for NT, anyway):

http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~frink/newgina_pre09/readme.html

It seems to me, though, that if the admin replaces Microsoft's GINA, he
can't complain about how (or whether) the replacement traps
Ctrl+Alt+Del. I don't think (though I may be mistaken) that there's a
way to trap those hotkeys when Microsoft's msgina.dll is in place and
working properly.
