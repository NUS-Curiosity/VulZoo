Summary
=======

Cisco routers and switches running Cisco IOSï¿½ software and configured to
process Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) packets are vulnerable to a
Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A rare sequence of crafted IPv4 packets
sent directly to the device may cause the input interface to stop
processing traffic once the input queue is full. No authentication is
required to process the inbound packet. Processing of IPv4 packets is
enabled by default. Devices running only IP version 6 (IPv6) are not
affected. A workaround is available.

Cisco has made software available, free of charge, to correct the problem.

This advisory is available at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030717-blocked.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

This issue affects all Cisco devices running Cisco IOS software and
configured to process Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) packets. Cisco
devices which do not run Cisco IOS software are not affected. Devices which
run only Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) are not affected.

Details
=======

Cisco routers are configured to process and accept Internet Protocol
version 4 (IPv4) packets by default. A rare, specially crafted sequence of
IPv4 packets which is handled by the processor on a Cisco IOS device may
force the device to incorrectly flag the input queue on an interface as
full, which will cause the router to stop processing inbound traffic on
that interface. This can cause routing protocols to drop due to dead
timers.

On Ethernet interfaces, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) times out after a
default time of four hours, and no traffic can be processed. The device
must be rebooted to clear the input queue on the interface, and will not
reload without user intervention. The attack may be repeated on all
interfaces causing the router to be remotely inaccessible. A workaround is
available, and is documented in the Workarounds section.

The following two Cisco vulnerabilities are documented in DDTS. CSCea02355
( registered customers only) affects all Cisco routers running Cisco IOS
software. CSCdz71127 ( registered customers only) was introduced by an
earlier code revision. Any version of software which has the fix for 
CSCdx02283 ( registered customers only) is vulnerable.

Registered customers can find more details using the Bug Toolkit at 
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl ( registered
customers only) .

To identify a blocked input interface, use the show interfaces command and
look for the Input Queue line. If the current size (in this case, 76) is
larger than the maximum size (75), the input queue is blocked.

Impact
======

A device receiving these specifically crafted IPv4 packets will force the
inbound interface to stop processing traffic. The device may stop
processing packets destined to the router, including routing protocol
packets and ARP packets. No alarms will be triggered, nor will the router
reload to correct itself. This issue can affect all Cisco devices running
Cisco IOS software. This vulnerability may be exercised repeatedly
resulting in loss of availability until a workaround has been applied or
the device has been upgraded to a fixed version of code.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Each row of the table describes a release train and the platforms or
products for which it is intended. If a given release train is vulnerable,
then the earliest possible releases that contain the fix and the
anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the Rebuild,
Interim, and Maintenance columns. In some cases, no rebuild of a particular
release is planned; this is marked with the label "Not scheduled." A device
running any release in the given train that is earlier than the release in
a specific column (less than the earliest fixed release) is known to be
vulnerable, and it should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or
a later version (greater than the earliest fixed release label).

When selecting a release, keep in mind the following definitions:

  * Maintenance
   
    Most heavily tested and highly recommended release of any label in a
    given row of the table.
   
  * Rebuild
   
    Constructed from the previous maintenance or major release in the same
    train, it contains the fix for a specific vulnerability. Although it
    receives less testing, it contains only the minimal changes necessary
    to effect the repair. Cisco has made available several rebuilds of
    mainline trains to address this vulnerability, but strongly recommends
    running only the latest maintenance release on mainline trains.
   
  * Interim
   
    Built at regular intervals between maintenance releases and receives
    less testing. Interims should be selected only if there is no other
    suitable release that addresses the vulnerability, and interim images
    should be upgraded to the next available maintenance release as soon as
    possible. Interim releases are not available through manufacturing, and
    usually they are not available for customer download from CCO without
    prior arrangement with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
   
In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices
to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and
software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new
release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco TAC for
assistance, as shown in the section following this table.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software free of charge
through their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on the Cisco
worldwide website at 
http://www.cisco.com/tacpage/sw-center/sw-ios.html.  

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior or
existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as Cisco
Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
support organization for assistance with obtaining the free software
upgrade(s).

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but
are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of sale
should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance
Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
   
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
   
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com
   
Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades for
non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
"security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
additional TAC contact information, including special localized telephone
numbers, instructions, and e-mail addresses for use in various languages.

Workarounds
===========

AFTER APPLYING THE WORKAROUND the input queue depth may be raised with the
hold-queue <new value> in interface command -- the default size is 75. This
will allow traffic flow on the interface until the device can be reloaded.

Cisco recommends that all IOS devices which process IPv4 packets be
configured to block traffic directed to the router from any unauthorized
source with the use of Access Control Lists (ACLs). This can be done at
multiple locations, and it is recommended that you review all methods and
use the combination which fits your network best. Legitimate traffic is
defined as management protocols such as telnet, snmp or ssh, and configured
routing protocols from explicitly allowed peers. All other traffic destined
to the device should be blocked at the input interface. Traffic entering
the network should also be carefully evaluated and filtered at the network
edge if destined to an infrastructure device. Although network service
providers must often allow unknown traffic to transit their network, it is
not necessary to allow that same traffic destined to their network
infrastructure. Several white papers have been written to assist in
deploying these recommended security best practices.

ACLs can have performance impact on certain platforms, so care should be
taken when applying the recommended workarounds.

Receive ACLs

For distributed platforms, receive path access lists may be an option
starting in Cisco IOS software versions 12.0(21)S2 for the c12000 and 12.0
(24)S for the c7500. The receive access lists protect the device from
harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the route processor. The CPU
load is distributed to the line card processors and helps mitigate load on
the main route processor. The white paper entitled "GSR: Receive Access
Control Lists" will help you identify and allow legitimate traffic to your
device and deny all unwanted packets:

Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your network, it
is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to target
your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your
network. The white paper entitled "GSR: Receive Access Control Lists"
presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for
infrastructure protection ACLs:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/customer/707/iacl.html

Transit ACLs

The two techniques described above protect infrastructure devices. This IP
protocol ACL can also be used to filter transit traffic passing through a
network. The ACL will need to permit all protocols used by end users, not
just those destined to routers. Since end users can run a wide array
of protocols, often unexpected or uncommon protocols, these protocol
requirements must be well understood prior to deploying this ACL. The
provided list is not a complete list of permissible protocols.  This
access-list is applied inbound on edge facing interfaces. For complete
protection this access-list needs to be implemented on the edge router.

For basic TCP,UDP and ICMP, the following ACL will provide protection:

    access-list 101 permit tcp any any  
    access-list 101 permit udp any any    
    !! GRE tunnel if required
    access-list 101 permit gre any any 
    !! IPSec ESP if required 
    access-list 101 permit esp any any
    !! IPSec AH if required
    access-list 101 permit ah any any 
    access-list 101 permit icmp any any   
    access-list 101 deny ip any any  

The last statement of the Transit ACL should be a deny any any for IP
traffic. Prior to deploying ACLs that filter transit traffic, a
classification ACL can be used to help identify required permit statements.
A classification ACL is an ACL that permits a series of protocols.
Displaying access-list entry hit counters helps determine required
protocols: entries with zero packets counted are likely not required.
Classification access-lists are detailed in the above link for
infrastructure access-lists.
