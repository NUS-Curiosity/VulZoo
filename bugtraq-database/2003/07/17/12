Subject: Windows Update - Unsafe ActiveX control


Hello,

I just tried to download the latest Microsoft security update by using the
Windows update utility in Internet Explorer. However, I could not do so
because I had disabled all ActiveX controls in the security settings (after
reading a terrifying paper on ActiveX security). 

After this I enabled "Download Signed ActiveX Controls" and "Run ActiveX
controls and plugins". I ran the Windows update utility again and got this
message:
"An ActiveX control on this page is not safe. Your current security settings
prohibit running unsafe controls on this page. As a result, this page may
not display as intended."
URL: http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp

After I clicked "Ok", I got the error message that this utility is to run by
"Administrators Only".

I am running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server SP4 and IE 6.0.2800.1106 SP1
Q818529.

So Microsoft expects me download critical patches using an unsafe ActiveX
control??

Regards,

Siddhartha Jain
