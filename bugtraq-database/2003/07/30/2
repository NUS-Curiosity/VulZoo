Subject: DCOM RPC - DEVESTATING IN SCOPE


 i think the severity of the RPC exploit cannot be diminished.. this is the
worst remote root compromise i have ever seen and i am literlaly screaming
at everyone i know to patch ASAP. the thought of media attention sonded
plausable.. this should be on the nightly news for the next 2 days minumum.
The ease and swiftness of the exploit makes it second to none in the
potential damage.. as you point out..

> I assumed that most XP boxes would be SP1.
> I got 6 command prompts.
> I then ran the same binary looking for Xp with Sp0.
> I got 156 command prompts.

i too have experienced these percentages in a block of ip addresses ..
"shocked and awed"
