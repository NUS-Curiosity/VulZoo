July 23, 2003
______________________________________________________________________

Summary:

The Oracle Applications AOL/J Setup Test Suite, used to trouble-shoot the
Self-Service framework, can be exploited to remotely retrieve sensitive
configuration and host information without application authentication.  The
AOL/J Setup Test Suite is installed by default for all 11i implementations.
A mandatory patch from Oracle is required to solve this security issue.

Product:    Oracle E-Business Suite
Versions:   11.5.1 - 11.5.8
Platforms:  All platforms
Risk Level: Low
_____________________________________________________________________

Description:

The Oracle Applications Self-Service Framework (OA Framework) is the
foundation for self-service HRMS, iProcurement, iExpenses, and other web
applications.  The OA Framework includes a Test Suite used to verify its
installation and configuration.  The AOL/J Setup Test Suite is implemented
as Java Server Pages (JSP) and the main JSP page is "aoljtest.jsp".  The
AOL/J Setup Test Suite is installed for all 11i web and forms servers in the
$COMMON_TOP/html/jsp/fnd directory.  

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the AOL/J Setup Test Suite allowing an
attacker to obtain valuable information on the configuration of Oracle
Applications without any database or application authentication.  This
information includes the GUEST user password and application server security
key.

Solution:

Oracle has released a patch for the Oracle E-Business Suite 11i to correct
this vulnerability.  Oracle has corrected multiple vulnerabilities in the
AOL/J Setup Test Suite JSPs.

The following Oracle patch must be applied --

      Version     Patch
      -------     -----
      11i         2939083     (11.5.1 - 11.5.8)

Oracle Applications customers should consider this vulnerability low risk
and apply the above patch during the next normal maintenance cycle.
Customers with Internet facing application servers should apply the patch
immediately or consider removing or restricting access to the AOL/J Setup
Test Suite.  In addition, the GUEST user account should be checked to ensure
that it has only publicly accessible responsibilities assigned to it.

Appropriate testing and backups should be performed before applying any
patches.
