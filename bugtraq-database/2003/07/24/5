Oracle E-Business Suite FNDWRR Buffer Overflow
July 23, 2003
______________________________________________________________________

Summary:

The Oracle Applications FNDWRR CGI program, used to retrieve report output
from the Concurrent Manager server via a web browser, has a remotely
exploitable buffer overflow.  A mandatory patch from Oracle is required to
solve this security issue.

Product:    Oracle E-Business Suite
Versions:   11.0 and 11.5.1 - 11.5.8
Platforms:  All platforms
Risk Level: High
______________________________________________________________________

Description:

The Oracle Applications Web Report Review (FNDWRR) program is used to view
reports and logs in a web browser.  FNDWRR is implemented as a CGI program.
The FNDWRR CGI program is named "FNDWRR.exe" on both UNIX and Windows
platforms.

A buffer overflow exists in the FNDWRR program allowing an attacker to
potentially gain control of the process and execute arbitrary code on the
server.  This buffer overflow can be remotely exploited using a web browser
and an overly long URL.

Solution:

Oracle has released patches for Oracle Applications 11.0 and 11i to correct
this vulnerability.  Oracle has fixed the buffer overflow in the FNDWRR
executable and related libraries.

The following Oracle patches must be applied --

      Version     Patch
      -------     -----
      11.0        2919943     (All Releases)
      11i         2919943     (11.5.1 - 11.5.8)

Oracle Applications customers should consider this vulnerability high risk
and apply the above patch during the next maintenance cycle.  Customers with
Internet facing application servers should apply the patch immediately.

Appropriate testing and backups should be performed before applying any
patches.
