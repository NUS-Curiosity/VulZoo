Description

************

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a serious security flaw in PHP-
G�stebuch Ver. 1.60 Beta and possibly in prior versions.
PHP-G�stebuch is a guestbook system that except a few bugs has functions 
like flooding and webfilter protections ... ;) 


Details

********

1.guestbookdat contains admin's saved settings for PHP-G�stebuch. Is not 
protected and an attacker can retrieve serious information about the 
guestbook.

  ex: www.example.com/guestbook/guestbookdat

2.pwd contains the admin's password which is encrypted by MD5 algorithm.

  ex1: www.example.com/guestbook/pwd  

  ex2:md5 encrypted password: ee21d5f27a8401788147f6f6184ddb11
      md5 unencrypted password: roland
                                                 
An attacker using a md5 cracker like Cain & Abel (www.oxid.it), can crack 
the hash and use the decrypted password in order to login as PHP-
G�stebuch's administrator. 

  ex: www.example.com/guestbook/admin.php



Solution

*********

Protect these two files: guestbookdat & pwd.

The vendor has been contacted.
