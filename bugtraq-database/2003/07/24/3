  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  This kernel update fixes several bugs and vulnerabilities.  A summary
  of the changes from the last kernel update are below.

    * A vulnerability in the TTY layer allows local attackers to cause
      a denial of service ("kernel oops").

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0247 to this issue.

    * The mxcsr code in Linux kernel 2.4 allows attackers to modify CPU
      state registers via a malformed address.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0248 to this issue.

    * Paul Starzetz discovered a race condition in the execve() system
      call.  This file read race condition could be used to cause a
      denial of service (local crash).

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0462 to this issue.

    * The execve system call records the file descriptor of the executable
      process in the file table of the calling process, which allows local
      users to gain read access to restricted file descriptors.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0476 to this issue.

    * The /proc filesystem allows local users to obtain sensitive
      information by opening various entries in /proc/self before
      executing a setuid program, which causes the program to fail to
      change the ownership and permissions of that entry.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0501 to this issue.

  This update also upgrades the Linux kernel to the most recent stable
  version (2.4.21).

  Guardian Digital products affected by this issue include:

    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.5

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.
