Package name:           xpdf
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:071-1
Date:                   July 23rd, 2003

Affected versions:	9.0, 9.1, Corporate Server 2.1
________________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 Martyn Gilmore discovered flaws in various PDF viewers, including xpdf.
 An attacker could place malicious external hyperlinks in a document
 that, if followed, could execute arbitary shell commands with the
 privileges of the person viewing the PDF document.
  
Update:

 New packages are available as the previous patches that had been
 applied did not correct all possible ways of exploiting this issue.
