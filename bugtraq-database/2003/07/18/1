This posting is completely false. Furthermore, the assertation in the
report that the vendor was notified is also false.

StoreFront 6.0 is a .NET application and contains no file named 
login.asp.  The previous version, StoreFront 5.0 was found to be subject 
to the SQL Injection vulnerability in October of 2002.  A patch was 
released on October 17th 2002 in build 50.4014.
