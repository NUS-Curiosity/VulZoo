Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0027

Package name:      nfs-utils
Summary:           Minor security issue
Date:              2003-07-18
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5, 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
  related tools, which provides a much higher level of performance than the
  traditional Linux NFS server used by most users.

  This package also contains the showmount program.  Showmount queries the
  mount daemon on a remote host for information about the NFS (Network File
  System) server on the remote host.  For example, showmount can display the
  clients which are mounted on that host.

Problem description:
  The old nfs-utils packages shipped with TSL has a remotely exploitable
  Denial of Service vulnerability. This update fixes the issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.


Location:
  All TSL updates are available from
  <URI:http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>


About Trustix Secure Linux:
  Trustix Secure Linux is a small Linux distribution for servers. With focus
  on security and stability, the system is painlessly kept safe and up to
  date from day one using swup, the automated software updater.


Automatic updates:
  Users of the SWUP tool can enjoy having updates automatically
  installed using 'swup --upgrade'.

  If you use TSL 1.2 or earlier, get SWUP from:
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/software/swup/>
  (Later versions of TSL are shipped with SWUP in the default installation.)
