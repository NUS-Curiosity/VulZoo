Summary
=======

Cisco routers and switches running Cisco IOS� software and configured
to process Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) packets are vulnerable to
a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A rare sequence of crafted IPv4
packets with specific protocol fields sent directly to the device may
cause the input interface to stop processing traffic once the input
queue is full. No authentication is required to process the inbound
packet. Processing of IPv4 packets is enabled by default. Devices
running only IP version 6 (IPv6) are not affected. A workaround is
available.

Cisco has made software available, free of charge, to correct the
problem.

This advisory is available at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030717-blocked.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

This issue affects all Cisco devices running Cisco IOS software and
configured to process Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) packets. Cisco
devices which do not run Cisco IOS software are not affected. Devices
which run only Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) are not affected.

Details
=======

Cisco routers are configured to process and accept Internet Protocol
version 4 (IPv4) packets by default. A rare, specially crafted sequence
of IPv4 packets with protocol type 53 (SWIPE), 55 (IP Mobility), 77
(Sun ND), or 103 (Protocol Independent Multicast - PIM) which is
handled by the processor on a Cisco IOS device may force the device to
incorrectly flag the input queue on an interface as full, which will
cause the router to stop processing inbound traffic on that interface.
This can cause routing protocols to drop due to dead timers.

Interfaces which are explicitly configured to run PIM will not be
affected by traffic with protocol type 103. An interface with PIM
enabled will have one of the following three commands in the interface
configuration: ip pim dense-mode, ip pim sparse-mode, or ip pim
sparse-dense-mode.

On Ethernet interfaces, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) times out
after a default time of four hours, and no traffic can be processed.
The device must be rebooted to clear the input queue on the interface,
and will not reload without user intervention. The attack may be
repeated on all interfaces causing the router to be remotely
inaccessible. A workaround is available, and is documented in the 
Workarounds section.

The following two Cisco vulnerabilities are documented in DDTS: 
CSCea02355 ( registered customers only) affects all Cisco routers
running Cisco IOS software. This documents the flaw with protocols 53,
55, and 77. CSCdz71127 ( registered customers only) was introduced by
an earlier code revision, and documents an input queue vulnerability to
protocol 103 with a device which is not configured for PIM. Any version
of software which has the fix for CSCdx02283 ( registered customers
only) is vulnerable.

Registered customers can find more details using the Bug Toolkit at 
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl ( 
registered customers only) .

To identify a blocked input interface, use the show interfaces command
and look for the Input Queue line. If the current size (in this case,
76) is larger than the maximum size (75), the input queue is blocked.

Use the show buffers command and look for the prot field. Below are two
examples:

    Router#show interface ethernet 0/0
    Ethernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up  
      Hardware is AmdP2, address is 0050.500e.f1e0 (bia 0050.500e.f1e0)   
      Internet address is 172.16.1.9/24
      MTU 1500 bytes, BW 10000 Kbit, DLY 1000 usec, rely 255/255, load 1/255

      ARP type: ARPA, ARP Timeout 04:00:00  
      Last input 00:00:41, output 00:00:07, output hang never
      Last clearing of "show interface" counters 00:07:18
      Input queue: 76/75/1091/0 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 0  
    !--- The 76/75 shows that this is blocked

     source: 212.176.72.138, destination: 212.111.64.174, id: 0xAAB8, ttl: 41, prot: 103 
    
    !--- prot: 103 is proof that this is one of the attack packets
    

Impact
======

A device receiving these specifically crafted IPv4 packets will force
the inbound interface to stop processing traffic. The device may stop
processing packets destined to the router, including routing protocol
packets and ARP packets. No alarms will be triggered, nor will the
router reload to correct itself. This issue can affect all Cisco
devices running Cisco IOS software. This vulnerability may be exercised
repeatedly resulting in loss of availability until a workaround has
been applied or the device has been upgraded to a fixed version of
code.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Each row of the table describes a release train and the platforms or
products for which it is intended. If a given release train is
vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases that contain the fix
and the anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the
Rebuild, Interim, and Maintenance columns. In some cases, no rebuild of
a particular release is planned; this is marked with the label "Not
scheduled." A device running any release in the given train that is
earlier than the release in a specific column (less than the earliest
fixed release) is known to be vulnerable, and it should be upgraded at
least to the indicated release or a later version (greater than the
earliest fixed release label).

When selecting a release, keep in mind the following definitions:

  * Maintenance
   
    Most heavily tested and highly recommended release of any label in
    a given row of the table.
   
  * Rebuild
   
    Constructed from the previous maintenance or major release in the
    same train, it contains the fix for a specific vulnerability.
    Although it receives less testing, it contains only the minimal
    changes necessary to effect the repair. Cisco has made available
    several rebuilds of mainline trains to address this vulnerability,
    but strongly recommends running only the latest maintenance release
    on mainline trains.
   
  * Interim
   
    Built at regular intervals between maintenance releases and
    receives less testing. Interims should be selected only if there is
    no other suitable release that addresses the vulnerability, and
    interim images should be upgraded to the next available maintenance
    release as soon as possible. Interim releases are not available
    through manufacturing, and usually they are not available for
    customer download from CCO without prior arrangement with the Cisco
    Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
   
In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco TAC for assistance, as shown in the section following this
table.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software free of charge
through their regular update channels. For most customers, this means
that upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on the
Cisco worldwide website at 
http://www.cisco.com/tacpage/sw-center/sw-ios.shtml.

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for assistance with obtaining the
free software upgrade(s).

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
   
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
   
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com
   
Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of
this notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
"security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers, instructions, and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.

Workarounds
===========

AFTER APPLYING THE WORKAROUND the input queue depth may be raised with
the hold-queue <new value> in interface command -- the default size is
75. This will allow traffic flow on the interface until the device can
be reloaded.

Cisco recommends that all IOS devices which process IPv4 packets be
configured to block traffic directed to the router from any
unauthorized source with the use of Access Control Lists (ACLs). This
can be done at multiple locations, and it is recommended that you
review all methods and use the combination which fits your network
best. Legitimate traffic is defined as management protocols such as
telnet, snmp or ssh, and configured routing protocols from explicitly
allowed peers. All other traffic destined to the device should be
blocked at the input interface. Traffic entering the network should
also be carefully evaluated and filtered at the network edge if
destined to an infrastructure device. Although network service
providers must often allow unknown traffic to transit their network, it
is not necessary to allow that same traffic destined to their network
infrastructure. Several white papers have been written to assist in
deploying these recommended security best practices.

ACLs can have performance impact on certain platforms, so care should
be taken when applying the recommended workarounds.

Transit ACLs

The following access list is specifically designed to block attack
traffic. Note that the attack traffic can include spoofed source
addresses. This access list should be applied to all interfaces of the
device, and should include topology-specific filters. This could
include filtering routing protocol traffic, management protocols, and
traffic destined for the internal network. Protocol 103 is Protocol
Independent Multicast (PIM), which is a commonly deployed application
in multicast networks. Interfaces with PIM enabled have not been found
to be vulnerable to exploit traffic with protocol 103; PIM traffic may
be permitted to those select devices.

    access-list 101 deny 53 any any
    access-list 101 deny 55 any any
    access-list 101 deny 77 any any
    access-list 101 deny 103 any any
    !--- insert any other previously applied ACL entries here
    !--- you must permit other protocols through to allow normal
    !--- traffic -- previously defined permit lists will work
    !--- or you may use the permit ip any any shown here
    access-list 101 permit ip any any 

Prior to deploying ACLs that filter transit traffic, a classification
ACL can be used to help identify required permit statements. A
classification ACL is an ACL that permits a series of protocols.
Displaying access-list entry hit counters helps determine required
protocols: entries with zero packets counted are likely not required.
Classification access-lists are detailed in the link below for
infrastructure access-lists.

Receive ACLs

For distributed platforms, receive path access lists may be an option
starting in Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the c12000 and
12.0(24)S for the c7500. The receive access lists protect the device
from harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the route processor.
The CPU load is distributed to the line card processors and helps
mitigate load on the main route processor. The white paper entitled
"GSR: Receive Access Control Lists" will help you identify and allow
legitimate traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/customer/707/racl.html

Infrastructure ACLs

Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your
network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be
allowed to target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at
the border of your network. The white paper entitled "Protecting Your
Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists" presents
guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure
protection ACLs:
