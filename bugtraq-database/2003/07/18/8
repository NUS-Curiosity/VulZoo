I have been asked by Phil Wade of Witango to mention the following: "We also
did some tests on older versions of the server and found the vulnerability
also exists in the previous version of the server which was known as Tango
2000.  Can you also mention that Tango 2000 is also vulnerable and should be
upgraded to Witango 5.0.1.062 especially if the Tango 2000 server is
accessible from the internet"
