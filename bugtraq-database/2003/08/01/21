Moderator please disregard last message. There were some problems with
the webmailers. :(

Original message follows:

Hi all, 
	
A problem related to the denial of an Http Request in a specific byte
check was encountered. The issue fixed is related to a very special
situation which does not interfere with the scanning and inspection
features of IISShield.
	
Users are advised to download the latest version (v1.0.2)  at
http://www.kodeit.org/tools/iisshield.zip	

Changelog available at http://www.kodeit.org/tools/iisshield_log.htm
	
Cheers,
