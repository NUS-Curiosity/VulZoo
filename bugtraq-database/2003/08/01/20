============================ Description ============================

When wireless phone users login to GroupWise WebAccess the userid and
password are recorded in the webserver's access_log file.  
 
============================== Impact ===============================

When wireless phone users login to GroupWise WebAccess the userid and
password are recorded in the webserver's access_log file.  
 
The access_log is located //server/sys/apache/logs/access_log  
 
It is not a problem for FRAMES or SIMPLE templates.  

GroupWise Webaccess users using their desktop or laptop computers do 
NOT have this problem. 

Only happens with WML & HDML. 

Only happens when using Wireless Phones. 

======================== Recommended Actions ========================

Workaround for webserver logging, until GW 6.5 SP1 can be applied:

This can be configured through the LogFormat and CustomLog directives
in the HTTPD.conf file.  Turning off the access_log is done by 
commenting out the CustomLog directive that defines it.  Altering the
content of the access log is done by changing the LogFormat directive
that corresponds to the access_log's CustomLog entry.  Both of these 
directives are documented at http://httpd.apache.org/docs- 
2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html 

    LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common 
    CustomLog logs/access_log common

Long-term fix:  Apply GroupWise WebAccess 6.5 SP1
