I agree. It's no more a security hole than having Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
enabled to kill one's X server when one starts X from the command line
with "startx"  rather than "exec startx".  This is a matter of good
security practice.  Relying on a screensaver app to provide you with real
security is probably not a good security practice.  Sticking a Post-it
note on one's monitor with root password written on it is certainly a bad
security practice.  However, neither of these practices are the fault of
the software.

Basing exceptions to rules on the name of the executable running sounds 
like a path towards madness, as well.
