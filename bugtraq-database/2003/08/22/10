	I think you'll find that there is a ton of overlap between these two
categories.

	Almost every piece of software contains a EULA/disclaimer that says that
absolutely nothing is guaranteed and you're on your own. You have no way to
audit the software if it's not open source and often are prohibited from
reverse-engineering it anyway. You often have to agree to limit the
author's/manufacturer's liability to the purchase price.

	Absolutely, the people who extended trust were foolish to do so. It's very
easy to say that in retrospect. However, "it's your fault for trusting me"
doesn't play.

	If I leave my home while a contractor is working on it and tell him to lock
up and slide the key under the door and he forgets to lock up and a burglar
walks in and steals all my stuff, yes, it's the contractor's fault for being
stupid and leaving my house unlocked. But that does not reduce the
culpability of the burglar, does it? If anything, it's worse to pick on
those less defended.
