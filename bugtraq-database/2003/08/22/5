Hi,

first, let me make one thing clear, I think what happened is very bad. They 
should have done anything else but secretly bug their system. But your logic 
is seriously flawed.

Very unpleasant for sure but also higlhly irrelevant. The people running AN.ON 
are German entities operating under German laws being situated in Germany. 
They were the ones that received the court order so they had to do something. 
If there are international users or not is really highly irrelevant in this 
case. Nobody claimed that German police or courts had juristiction in the US.

Well, you can be sure, people are not pleased here, either. But do you really 
think if american police or better yet the FBI would demand some kind of 
tracking for an anonymizer in the US, they'd care about international users? 
Maybe the individuals operating the anonymizer would react better but I'd be 
surprised if american law enforcement agencies wouldn't use similar measures 
if they could by law (not sure about american laws).

Not really. It's not a crime. You can argue about the correctness of their 
decision to secretly implement this backdoor in an *anonymizer* instead of 
standing up and tearing the service down. But following a valid court order 
is not a crime. Even though I really don't like those laws but spying on 
people seems to be hip after the events of Septembre 11th. 

Regards,

Richard
