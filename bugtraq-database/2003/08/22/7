	I'm 100% with you up to now.

	But now you're teetering on insanity. I get a ride home from a pub, but the
driver instead of taking me home takes me to a dark alley and beats me to a
pulp. My ire at the betrayal of trust should be based upon whether and how
much I paid the driver?!

	If you think purchased business loyalty is more reliable, and provokes a
more painful betrayal, than loyalty freely offered out of principled
devotion to a common cause, you're not in touch with the same reality I am.
This is a case of betrayal among people who thought they were engaged in a
common cause of principle.

	DS
