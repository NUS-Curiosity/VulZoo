   In case anyone needs a SNORT rule to catch attempts to exploit this 
vulnerability:

#-----
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Internet 
Explorer Object Data Remote Execution Vulnerability"; \
         content:"F935DC22-1CF0-11D0-ADB9-00C04FD58A0B"; \
         nocase; flow:from_server, established; \
         reference:cve,CAN-2003-0532; \
         classtype:web-application-activity; rev:1;)
#-----

   Any improvements and suggestions to this rule are highly welcomed.
