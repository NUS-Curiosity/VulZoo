Subject: Administrivia: List sluggish + buffer overflow protection thread.



It has been a long day.  I've rejected & deleted from the Bugtraq queue
well over 1000 messages with Sobig.F attachments.  I've got a few hundred left to
go.  I apologize if any of your messages havn't yet been approved.  It's because
they're buried in the queue, I'll get to them.  On another note, I'm
killing the buffer overflow protection thread.  There was lots of good
discussion and now it's time to move on.  Any new posts on the topic
should be sent to SECPROG <secprog@...urityfocus.com>.
