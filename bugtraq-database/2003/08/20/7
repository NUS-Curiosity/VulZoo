Subject: Is msblast.d code/binary publicly available?


In-Reply-To: <20030818155038.C14607@...g.CS.Berkeley.EDU>

Has anyone made the msblast.d code/binary publicly available?  If so, 
where can it be obtained?  I have been looking everywhere.  I want to 
analyze the code and view why it becomes so network intensive.


Thanks,


JD
