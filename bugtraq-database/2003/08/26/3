                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated pam_smb packages fix remote buffer overflow.
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:261-01
Issue date:        2003-08-26
Updated on:        2003-08-26
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0686
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated pam_smb packages are now available which fix a security
vulnerability (buffer overflow).

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The pam_smb module is a pluggable authentication module (PAM) used to
authenticate users using an external Server Message Block (SMB) server.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found that affects unpatched
versions of pam_smb up to and including 1.1.6. 

On systems that use pam_smb and are configured to authenticate a
remotely accessible service, an attacker can exploit this bug and
remotely execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0686 to this issue.

Red Hat Linux versions 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, and 9 ship with versions of pam_smb
that are vulnerable to this issue, however pam_smb is not enabled by default.

Users of pam_smb are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a patch to version 1.1.6 to correct this issue.

Red Hat would like to thank Dave Airlie of the Samba team for notifying us
of this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
