How could you implement an i386 solution if you still think it is impossible?

Ok, thank you for clarifying that. I didn't know that. All I've seen so far is
abusive language from you against the people who contacted you about this
matter.

Can you please stop making generalisations?

PaX is not my effort.

I can't speak for other people in the community you mention, but it seems to
me that the one who is foaming right now is you.

Right, PROT_EXEC|PROT_WRITE is W|X and not W^X. Denying it is what you could
call secure by default.

If you look at the PaX web site, you will notice that it mentions other Linux
patches that do memory protection. The Adamantix web site links to the OpenBSD
web site and to systrace.

My continued insistance? I've written only two messages about the subject, this
one being the second.

There is a saying which goes like: It takes one to know one.

Thank you for thinking of Adamantix as competition. I think competition is
good and having a choice is also good.
