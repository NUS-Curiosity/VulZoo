PAX was not really published in anything that I read.  Compare it to
stackghost, a usenix security paper, which we have put some effort at
integrating.

Our tact was to support it first on cpu's that had a proper X bit in
their pte.  Ie, sparc64 and alpha and such.  Solving the problem on
x86 was not on our radar until, lemme think, perhaps while we were
eating curry during Usenix Monterey at that Irish pub....
