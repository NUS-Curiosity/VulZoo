SySS Security Advisory

Permanent URL: http://www.syss.de/advisories.php?id=7&year=2003

Application: BitKeeper

Affected versions: All versions <3.0.2

Application notes: BitKeeper is an advanced source code control system
like CVS, see http://www.bitkeeper.com

Vendor status: The vendor of BitKeeper is aware of the problem and has
documented it since at least two years. BitMover has been contacted by me
on 2003-07-25.

Type: Configuration error: insecure by default, fix is documented

Description: Certain parts of the trigger functionality in BitKeeper can
be abused by an attacker if a user accepts a patch containing specially
crafted files.

Severity: Critical.

Affected persons: Any user running bitkeeper and accepting patches from
outside of a trusted network - possibly the majority of Linux Kernel
developers.

Additional notes: I have an exploit readily available.

Because of the severity of this issue, BitMover has been contacted and is
working with SySS and the BK users to resolve the issue before exposing
the details of the problem.  There will be a followup security advisory in
2-4 weeks, after people feel that the problem has been contained; the
followup will disclose the details of the problem.

Workaround: If you are worried about it you can add
	export BK_NO_TRIGGERS=YES
to your .profile and the trigger functionality will be disabled.


Regards,
Carl-Daniel
