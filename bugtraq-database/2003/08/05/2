The c program is not an exploit code. It's a malicious code.

For x86 architechture:

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
asm("jmp .");
}

The following is the disassembly of the above code:

Dump of assembler code for function main:
0x8048430 <main>: push   %ebp
0x8048431 <main+1>: mov    %esp,%ebp
0x8048433 <main+3>: jmp    0x8048433 <main+3>
0x8048435 <main+5>: pop    %ebp
0x8048436 <main+6>: ret
0x8048437 <main+7>: nop
0x8048438 <main+8>: nop
0x8048439 <main+9>: nop
0x804843a <main+10>: nop
0x804843b <main+11>: nop
0x804843c <main+12>: nop
0x804843d <main+13>: nop
0x804843e <main+14>: nop
0x804843f <main+15>: nop
End of assembler dump.


0x8048433 <main+3>: jmp    0x8048433 <main+3>
The jmp instruction jumps to its own address, so the process will never end.
