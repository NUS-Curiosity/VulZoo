You have thought that i386 solutions were possible, because you have
implemented them.

I'd say that the one thing that ``the various PaX people'' have in common is
that they use PaX. I believe I am one of them and I don't call you a liar. I
also know others who probably fit your definition who do not call you a liar.

You get rewarded for working on OpenBSD by donations and by selling CDs. For
other people the only reward is often public acknowledgement. The way you have
presented W^R to the world, i.e. as if there was nothing like it on this planet
does not acknowledge the hard work of others. Hard work that implemented what
you thought was impossible before you even started thinking about it. I would
say that is impressive, don't you think so? When people contacted you about it,
you treated them in a manner that was not exactly what one might expect from
a grown-up person.
