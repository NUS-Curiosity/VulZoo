Wagner and Soto published a paper about these 'mimicry' attacks:
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/mimicry.pdf

... with regards to intrusion detection systems; same applies for host
based security.  It's a problem that any behavioural models based purely
on syscalls have a tough time getting around.  That, and how to reduce
the size of the FSM generated if you trace through all possible
permutations of the control flow statically.

It just adds another layer of complexity to an already over-complex
kernel/userland interface.  If you're going to change the source like this,
I prefer privilege separation instead, which works without kernel changes.
