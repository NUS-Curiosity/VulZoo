BTW: have anyone tried to talk wih Linus about implementing some PaX (or
even GR) functionality in official Kernels?
I know that the argument for not implementing Solar Designer's
nonexecutable stack patch in official kernel was that it is easily
bypassable, so what about PaX???

I hate seeing GOT and other segments rwx nowdays (while it's marked as r-x
it IS executable).
