Well, you've immediately eliminated 90% or more of the threat, so it's a
good start. In any case, if we are talking about the famous determined
attacker it's reasonable to assume that they are going to get you no
matter what you do and that you need to carefully consider methods of
reducing the damage from intrusion (rather than betting on stopping the
intrusion all together).

If I'm the bank I'm probably running Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Irix etc, in
which case I don't even have the option of PaX etc. I would deploy any
kind of protection technology I could find (including non-executable
stack, moved library images etc). 

There is no such thing as a perfect protection, and most of the
protection technologies that have been discussed in this thread are
worth considering. It would seem most pragmatic to deploy whatever you
can in your environment.

I think it's generally accepted that homogenity breeds insecurity, in
which case it makes sense to try to be as different from everyone else
as possible even if that doesn't make it impossible for someone to break
you.

Cheers,
Shaun
