1) Subject line says "Samba security update available" - this is a *metamail* avisory.

> Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.2 Open UNIX 8.0.0 UnixWare 7.1.1 UnixWare 
7.1.2 : exploitable buffer overrun in metamail
> Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.15

>From the changelog for the RedHat metamail package:

* Tue Jun 23 1998 Alan Cox <alan@...hat.com>

- Here we go again. One more quoting issue.

* Mon Jun 22 1998 Alan Cox <alan@...hat.com>

- If you want to know how not to write secure software
  then metamail is a good worked example. Mind you to
  be fair the original author wrote it as a prototype
  MIME tool and it stuck. Anyway it might actually be
  safe now. More from the Linux Security Audit Project.

* Tue Jun 16 1998 Alan Cox <alan@...hat.com>

- Round and round the tmp fixes go
  Where they stop nobody knows
- More holes in metamail fixed - (Linux Security Audit Project)

When you take *5 years* to get the fix out the door, could you at least
take the time to get the *SUBJECT* of the e-mail right????
