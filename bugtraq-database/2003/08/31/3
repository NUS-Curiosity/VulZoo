Okay, it's time for the "elephant in the living room":

The descriptions I've heard of this suggest that this patent could be
applied equally to prevent (or grab payment from implementors of)
Javascript, Java, Flash, etc.

I'm with you on the security issues with ActiveX (and Javascript) - I
disable ActiveX on the principle that it has no security consideration, and
Javascript on the basis that it's been frequently implemented in a
vulnerable manner.  But this is a considerably further-reaching patent than
merely killing off ActiveX.  Before we sing "ding dong the witch is dead",
let's have some concern for the peaceful Wiccans that might be next on the
chopping block.

Alun.
