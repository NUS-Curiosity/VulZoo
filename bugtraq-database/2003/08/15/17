Side Note: This is my first post ever on bugtraq, so bear with me. 
Vendors: Contacted

A vulnerability exists within Poster.version:two that allows a remote 
attacker to add accounts to a Poster.version:two. The vulnerability 
exists within Poster's setup. The setup doesn't lock itself after it is 
ran, so the setup is still active and usable. A sample is listed below

http://www.website.com/poster/?
go=setup_submit&un=DarkKnight&pw=123456&em=EMAIL&submit=submit

The above link would add the user "DarkKnight" with the password "123456" 
and the email "EMAIL" to the list of users for the Poster script. The 
user has complete admin access to Poster and will be able to delete 
accounts, modify news, post news, change the formation of the news, and 
steal the password of the users who use Poster, which may be the password 
to their email or website.

The two people who deserve credit for this vulnerability are: Fusen and 
DarkKnight [me :)]
