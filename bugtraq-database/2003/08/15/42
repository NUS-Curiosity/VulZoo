Subject: AntiGen Email scanning software allowes file through filter....




An older version of AntiGen software package for exchange allows any file 
with the name of test.zip and test.exe to pass through the filter list 
even if you are filtering *.exe and *.zip. I believe that anything 
called "test.*" would be permitted through the filter.  I have not 
confirmed the versions yet. But thought this was interesting.
