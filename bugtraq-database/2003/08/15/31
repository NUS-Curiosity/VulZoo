Please address technical commentary to the paper (which addresses this 
point) and not to the cute tag line.

WRT this point: correct, PointGuard does not stop all buffer overflows. 
IMHO it *nearly* stops all shell code. To bypass PointGuard, you have to 
corrupt the logic of the program itself to get its own code to do what 
you want; you can't readily generate a jump to arbitrary code.

Caveat: I can't prove the above, and someone may generate a bypass. But 
I don't know of one.
