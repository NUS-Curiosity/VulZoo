Indeed.  Where do you come up with this stuff?

When I read this, I immediately thought of some work that I did back in
the 60's.  Without giving too much away, it is possible to monitor sound
patterns in such a way that you can *uniquely* identify moving objects.
(Think of looking for unique "noise" frequencies in the full spectrum of
random noise, such as the sound of a motor.)

The corollary is that you could uniquely monitor /dev/random access to
do the same thing.  All you need is something that records all the
"traffic" and then analyzes it for patterns.   Controlled research would
identify what each pattern signified, and within a reasonable amount of
time you might even be able to identify machine operators simply by the
pattern of their keystrokes.  From there, capturing *what* their typing
is a matter of relative ease.

Very interesting indeed.
