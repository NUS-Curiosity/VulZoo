Subject: [ paper + project release ] kless - connecting to void and getting
 out alive


hello list,

  For the last couple of months i've been researching some peculiarites 
of the
transport layer protocol which deflowered into a project of mine.
  The name is kless, and its goal is to be able to communicate using 
transport
layer protocols (tcp/udp) without opening any ports ( at least on the 
 server-
side ) and still be able to talk transparently to a client. Even if this 
topic
and probly the same technique are already known and a few tools already 
exists
i've written a paper which explains the whole concept and further more 
extends
it.
  The project also explains a way for you to kill udp sockets, even if 
you do-
nt have anything todo with the connection and a few other tricks. The 
text wi-
ll culminate into the coding of a remote portless shell  and some other 
 tools
for explaning purpose..

  Hope you guys enjoy it, comments/flames/feedbacks are expected...
