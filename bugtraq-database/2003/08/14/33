You're right, I didn't do any research to back up that claim.  I just assumed 
it was included since Gentoo had it but in fact they just include the patch.
As previously mentioned, you can get it here if you're interested:

And as also mentioned before, Grsecurity complements this protection well to 
build a very secure server environment.  I highly recommend it.
