ProPolice (http://www.research.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp/) is a
great tool that not only protects the return address on the stack, but
also changes the order of local variables and protects the function
arguments! It's a way better protector than StackGuard and is a way more
efficient than a "two stack approach", providing _almost_ as good
protection, which sometimes is even better!!![1]


[1]: it protects the local variables (pointer) and function arguments,
which neither StagGuard nor StackShield ("two stack approach") do.
