Subject: WorldFlash - Spyware and BO

I use the demo-version of the WorldFlash News-Ticker Gold M5.30i
(http://www.worldflash.com/). While investigating some unexpected crashs
of the programm with a sniffer, I noticed that some privat informations
are sent back to WorldFlash, i.e. my real IP behind the firewall, the
mailserver I use, and other stuff (see attachment).

When I contacted the vendor I was told to uninstall the program - YES
SIR, I WILL DO SO

The crash seems to be a buffer overrun while getting news. Some sites
send back a whole bunch of useless HTML-crap back to the ticker.

Best regards

Markus a Campo
