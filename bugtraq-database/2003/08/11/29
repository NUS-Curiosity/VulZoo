A Bugtraq user has already pointed out that a worm has been
discovered in the wild that exploits the Microsoft Windows DCOM RPC
Interface Buffer Overrun Vulnerability (Bugtraq ID 8205) to infect
host systems.  Symantec has been tracking its activity and is
currently conducting analysis/full disassembly of the malicious code,
which has been named "Blaster".  The results of our analysis are
being made available to the public at the following location:

It is expected that this report will be updated frequently as more
