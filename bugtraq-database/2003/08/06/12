________________________________________________________________________

Package:             perl-www (CGI.pm)
Vulnerability:       cross site scripting
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:            Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= perl-www-20030726-20030726 >= perl-www-20030802-20030802
OpenPKG 1.3          <= perl-www-1.3.0-1.3.0       >= perl-www-1.3.1-1.3.1
OpenPKG 1.2          <= perl-www-1.2.0-1.2.0       >= perl-www-1.2.1-1.2.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a security advisory [0] from obscure@...onsecurity.org a
  cross site scripting vulnerability exists in the start_form() function
  from CGI.pm [1]. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the id CAN-2003-0615 [2] to the problem.

  Note that beginning with perl-www-20030609-20030609 and
  perl-www-1.3.0-1.3.0 a preliminary vendor patch was already included
  which fixes the specific issue discussed in the original advisory. Our
  corrected packages now include the more generalized patch the author
  uses in his latest version.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q perl-www". If you have the "perl-www" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get perl-www-1.3.1-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig perl-www-1.3.1-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild perl-www-1.3.1-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/perl-www-1.3.1-1.3.1.*.rpm
