11/08/2003 Rev 17 and 18 of the Intelligent updator from Norton Antivirus
identifies the worm as W32.Blaster.Worm.  You can run the intelligent
Updater out of
ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/antivirus_definitions/norton_antivirus/beta

The one we have been using on campus for our version 8 Corp Edition  is
symcbetadefsx86.exe

Hope this helps some of us stay ahead of this.
