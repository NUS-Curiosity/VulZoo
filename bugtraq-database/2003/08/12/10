I'll ignore the sloppiness in that description, as several of the 
published descriptions have (or at least initially got) it confused 
through slightly wrong too...

Well, despite the sometimes sloppiness in the descriptions of these 
things (as suggested above), the folk responsible for these 
descriptions also do get things right...

Unlike CodeRed, which was hard-coded for a specific IP that happened, 
when it was written, to map to one of the two physical addresses in the 
www.whitehouse.gov DNS round-robin (which  probably saved adding around 
25% to the worm's code size), this DCOM RPC worm, being a full-blown, 
file-system bound, PE EXE does a GetHostByName for windowsupdate.com 
without so much as bloating the .EXE beyond its current cluster 
allocation.

And, of course, if MS started messing with the DNS entries for 
windowsupdate.com, it would be cutting an awful lot of users off from 
much needed updates. which could be as disturbing as the rest of the 
worm's effects...
