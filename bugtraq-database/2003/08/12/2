i've just got a copy of this exe.  it matches the MD5 at
http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?date=2003-08-11 of
5ae700c1dffb00cef492844a4db6cd69.  that's the EXE's MD5, not the
unpacked
version or the MD5 of the ZIP i received it in.

we've got NAV Corporate 8.00.0.9374 with scan engine 4.1.0.15 and
definitions of 06/08/2003 rev. 4 (the most current at this time) and it
is
not detected.
