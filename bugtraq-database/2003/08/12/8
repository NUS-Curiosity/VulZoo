Subject: Windows Dcom Worm planned DDoS


Hi,

The examinations of the code so far indicate that the worm is 
coded to DoS the windowsupdate site from the 15th of August 
onwards through the end of the year.

I haven't seen anything mentioning whether or not the IP is
hardcoded. If not, shouldn't Microsoft just set the forward
resolve to 127.0.0.1 for a period of time?

That will probably save many, many $'s of wasted traffic.
