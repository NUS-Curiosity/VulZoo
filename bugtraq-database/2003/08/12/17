ZH2003-23SA (security advisory): HostAdmin Path Disclosure


Published: 12 august 2003

Released: 12 august 2003

Name: HostAdmin

Affected Systems: current version

Issue: Remote attackers can know the path of the site

Author: G00db0y@...e-h.org

Vendor: http://dreamcost.com/?page=hostadmin

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in HostAdmin (and older
versions?). "HostAdmin is based on PHP, MySQL, and uses HTML templates 
and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which can be modified for site-wide 
changes by any novice".



Details

*******
 
It's possible to make a malformed http request in HostAdmin and in doing 
so 
trigger an error. The resulting error message will disclose potentially 
sensitive 
installation path information to the remote attacker.

Example:

http://www.site.com/pathofhostadmin/?page='


Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced.


Suggestions:

************

Filter the ' character.
