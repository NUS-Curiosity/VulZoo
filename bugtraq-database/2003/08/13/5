That may have been true in the first half hour or so.  Just remember that the
*first* time the worm hops to another /8, it will start creating another large
concentration around THAT address range... and inside 30 minutes there's too
many pools to count.

Another way to look at it - by the time you started seeing "me too" postings
that *something* was up, it had gotten out of the original ranges (remember
that the "me toos" are in general evidence that it's left the original range)
