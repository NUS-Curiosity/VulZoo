Subject: RE: Microsoft MCWNDX.OCX ActiveX buffer overflow



I find no "MCWNDX.ocx" on my system nor on google. It may be a Windows
locality issue. Microsoft Multimedia Control fits the description,
though, as you noted. It does have a "FileName" method and uses the .mci
filetype, but on Windows 2000 it is not a safe activex control for
scripting on webpages in the Internet Zone.
