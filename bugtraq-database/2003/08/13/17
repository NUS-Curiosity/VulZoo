Portcullis Security Advisory

CiscoWorks 2000 Priviledge Escalation Vulnerability

Vulnerability discovery and development: 

Omicron@...tcullis-security.com

Affected systems: 

Ciscoworks 2000

Details:

Portcullis have discovered that using the default Guest account 
which has no password set, that it is possible to view page information
that the user should not have access to.

Whilst requesting certain pages the raw HTTP shows a statement
of who the logged on user is:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Date: Tue, 01 Jul 2003 13:01:12 GMT 
Server: Apache/1.3.24 (Unix) mod_perl/1.26 
Content-Length: 5 
Connection: close 
Content-Type: text/html  

guest

By replacing guest with admin and using POST to sent on the information, 
(for the Modify\delete users page) the system responds with information
on all the users on the site IE:

user1::::7 user2::::2 portcullis:portcullis@...where.com:::3F admin::::F
guest::admin::0

This allows Guest to then view information restricted to the Admin account
on all users on the system.


Impact:

Users are able to view information restricted to Administrators

Exploit:

As described in Details, edit raw HTML requests and replace user with a
known one of higher privileges.


Vendor Status:

Vendor Confirmed.

Following discussions with the vendor, Portcullis agreed to joint
advisories. The Cisco advisory can be found at the following URL.

Portcullis Security Advisory

CiscoWorks 2000 Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

Vulnerability discovery and development: 

Omicron@...tcullis-security.com

Affected systems: 

Ciscoworks 2000

Details:

Portcullis have discovered that using the default Guest account 
which has no password set, that it is possible to elevate the Guest
users privileges to the equivalent of Admin. Following this a new user
account can be created with full rights and complete access to the 
systems managed by Ciscoworks.  

When submitting changes to the user account, the raw HTML shows 
the users information in the following string:

cmd=modifyUser&name=guest&pwd=cGFzc3dvcmQ%3D&email=test%0test.com&ccoId=&cco
Pwd=&proxyId=&proxyPwd=&priviledges=0

>From information obtained it is possible to change the users privileges from
0 to F where F is the code for Admin rights.

The Guest account can now create a new user with all available security
options.

Impact:

Once access has been achieved, an attacker has complete control over
all Cisco devices managed by Ciscoworks. 

Exploit:
