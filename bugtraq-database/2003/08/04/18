According to the Sun Alert on this vulnerability,

  http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert/55680

Various patchlevels of Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, and 9 sparc and i386 are all
vulnerable.

On Solaris 2.5.1,

  $ uname -a  
  SunOS wallace 5.5.1 Generic_103640-40 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise

When I try the simple,

  $ LD_PRELOAD=/`perl -e 'print "A"x2000'`/ passwd
  passwd:  Changing password for cclark
  Enter login(NIS) password:

It doesn't crash. That reassures me somewhat, but does anyone know if
2.5.1 is not listed because it is (a) no longer supported and not
tested and patched, or (b) not actually vulnerable?

Thanks.
