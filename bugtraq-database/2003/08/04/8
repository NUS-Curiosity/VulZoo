Subject: OpenPKG Security Engineering now covering 1.2 and 1.3 only


Starting with todays release of OpenPKG 1.3 (see press release
http://www.openpkg.org/press/PR-004-openpkg-1.3.html for more details)
the (one year old) OpenPKG 1.1 release becomes deprecated.

Following our community commitment to provide security updates for the
last two releases, the OpenPKG Security Team now officially abandons the
support of OpenPKG 1.1 and from now on provides security updates for
the OpenPKG releases 1.2 and 1.3. If you're still having OpenPKG 1.1
(or even older) instances installed on your machines, please consider
upgrading to OpenPKG 1.3 or at least OpenPKG 1.2 now.
