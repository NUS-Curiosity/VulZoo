Subject: Announcement:  "A Treatise on Informational Warfare"


 Dear Security Focus Community:

This is an announcement for the public release of the publication "A
Treatise on Informational Warfare".  It is available for download in PDF
format at http://63.230.73.253/treatiseiw.pdf and the table of contents is
included at the end of this announcement so that you can determine if you
have an interest.

This research paper involves making connections between informational
warfare and enterprise security design.  The research focuses on a proposed
"Informational Warfare Model" that is based on strategic, operational, and
tactical design.  It builds on my previous publication "Computer
Vulnerabilities" that was released to BugTraq about three years ago, and
greatly expands on the conceptualizations that were originally presented.

The research should be used to provide assistance on the construction of
enterprise security models currently being developed as well as give
security professionals a way to predict and understand computer security
advancements in technology and their meaning in a networked environment.

The publication also provides a moderately detailed explanation and
comparison of IW warfare that the proposed framework is capable of which may
be interesting reading for non-designers.  It covers a capability analysis
for human against computerized agent, agent against agent, agent against
combined enterprise security, and combined security against combined
security.

I have made a considerable effort to make this document a detailed and well
thought out example and to keep as much speculation as I could out of the
text.  I certainly welcome all comments and discussion on the model I've
presented.

Thank you,

Eric Knight
