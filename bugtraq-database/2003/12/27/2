Subject: Landesk Management Suite IRCRBOOT.DLL buffer overflow


Landesk Management Suite IRCRBOOT.DLL buffer overflow
 =================================================

 PROGRAM: Landesk Management Suite
HOMEPAGE: http://www.landesk.com
VULNERABLE VERSIONS: 8.0 (untested, but highly possible vulnerable)
                                               7.0 and below (tested)


 DESCRIPTION
 =================================================

 Landesk Management Suite is the flagship of LANDesk family of
 systems  management products in managing medium-to-large networks.
LANDeskÂ® Management Suite enables IT professionals to automate systems
management tasks and proactively control desktops, servers and mobile
devices - all from a single console.


 DETAILS
 =================================================

Continuing our goal on cleaning dangerous ActiveX/COM components in
popular products, we have developed a Fuzzing Tool for ActiveX/COM
called "XKnight" (Not XXX, you perverts ! 8-) . XKnight works by fuzzing
the interface of the component to hunt for low-hanging fruits. And
fortunately, there are so many low-hanging fruits out there !!!

 IRCRBOOT.DLL  is an ActiveX/COM component that comes with
 Landesk Management Suite. YAUTO.DLL is registered under a CLSID named
 "DACBF5A1-33C5-11D3-A97E-00C04F72C145". In this component,
 function SetClientAddress(bszAddr as String) is vulnerable to a
 bufferoverflow  attack when argument bszAddr is passed with a long string.
 Since this is an ActiveX component, the vulnerability can
 be exploited just by making a website with the correct CLSID of
 the ActiveX and calling the function directly.


 WORKAROUND
 =================================================

 Waiting and apply the patch from vendor and/or remove the file
 temporary. Vendor is contacted (privacy@...desk.com) more than
3 weeks and they don't give a damn ! By the way, they don't put
an email on their website for contacting regarding about security problems.
