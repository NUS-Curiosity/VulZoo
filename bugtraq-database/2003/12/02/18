Considering the complexity of such a change (isn't it funny you say
"Simple" here and go on to explain how tricky the change is?), and the
fact it clearly goes right against MS's own intentions, it might be
easier, simpler and more reliable to send MSIE to where it belongs (to
the digital hell, IMHO...yes, I am biased) and use another browser.

What about vendors who fix implementation errors but refuse to fix fatal
design errors?

In the MSIE's case, the fatal design error is a poor separation of zones
(anyone who knows a little bit about mandatory access control and
information labelling should be able to prevent any future vulnerabilities
of this kind rather easily) or, from a more extremist point of view, the
mere existence of the "My Computer Zone"--why the hell should a piece of
code running on the top of a *web* browser ever be allowed to mess with my
computer?
