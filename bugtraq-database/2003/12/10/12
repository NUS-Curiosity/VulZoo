Cisco Security Advisory: Vulnerability in Authentication Library for ACNS

Revision 1.0


For Public Release 2003 December 10 16:00 UTC (GMT)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======
By entering an overly long password, it may be possible to execute
arbitrary code on a vulnerable device. This vulnerability affects all
devices and hardware modules that are running ACNS software releases
prior to 4.2.11 and 5.0.5. The workaround is to disable the CE GUI
server.

This advisory will be available at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20031210-ACNS-auth.shtml

Affected Products
=================
All Cisco products running ACNS software versions prior to 4.2.11 or
5.0.5 are affected. The hardware models that supports ACNS are:
   
   
  * Content Routers 4400 series
  * Content Distribution Manager 4600 series
  * Content Engine 500 and 7300 series
  * Content Engine Module for Cisco Routers 2600, 3600 and 3700 series

ACNS version 5.1 is not affected.

Details
=======
By supplying an overly long password, it is possible to trigger a buffer
overflow in the authentication module. This may enable an attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

This vulnerability is assigned Cisco bug IDs CSCeb25596 and CSCeb27087.

Impact
======
The impact of the exploitation of this vulnerability can range from a
Denial-of-Service to complete control of the device.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================
This vulnerability is fixed in 4.2.11 and 5.0.5 releases of ACNS.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================
Cisco is offering free software upgrades to remedy this vulnerability for
all affected customers. Customers may only install and expect support for
the feature sets they have purchased.

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact
that support organization for assistance with the upgrade, which should
be free of charge.

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). In those cases, customers may only upgrade to a
later version of the same release as indicated by the applicable row in
the Software Versions and Fixes table. TAC contacts are as follows:
   
   
  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * email: tac@...co.com.

See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
additional TAC contact information, including special localized telephone
numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
languages.

Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades
for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
"security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades

Workarounds
===========
The workaround is to disable the CE GUI server using the following
command:

no gui-server enable
