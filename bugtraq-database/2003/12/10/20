There are different types of physical access.  For example, many
computers at my university are publically accessible but strapped to
the table in such a way that the case cannot be removed without a key
or a lot of force.  It is trivial to reboot them and attempt to enter
BIOS, but an entirely different matter to open it up and move a jumper
or swap the hard drive.
