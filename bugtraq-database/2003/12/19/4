I've looked through the literature and the software (4.0 rel) for the 
past week, I haven't been able to find
anything related to this. I've had several people brighter than I look 
into this, they also weren't able to find any
sort of fix. we may very well may have missed it, but is it possible 
this feature went missing in 4.0?

Thanks,
Chris
