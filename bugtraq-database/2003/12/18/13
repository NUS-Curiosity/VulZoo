Subject: SARA 5.0




We have not posted any of our updates on SARA for over two years (except a rebuttal today) so I would like to share what we have done with SARA.

1.  We are the only current open source implementation of SATAN
2.  Yes, current with updates monthly.
3.  We run on most Unix and MAC OS/x installations
4.  We scan Unix and Windows targets with current probes
5.  We are not looking for $'s or support or donations (impartial)
6.  We are providing www.cisecurity.org with their free SANS Top 20 scanner

If interested in SARA, pls go to http://www-arc.com/sara for details.
