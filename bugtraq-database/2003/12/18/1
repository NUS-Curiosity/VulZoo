Subject: Re: Edonkey/Overnet Plugins capable of Virus/Worm behavior

I'm not familiar with the Edonkey/Overnet plug-in mechanism, so I'm a
little bit unclear on what your concern is:  Are you worried about
malicious plug-ins doing destructive things to the systems on which they
were (knowingly) installed, or that malicious code could propagate from
infected systems to clean ones?  Neither is good, but the second one
would concern me a lot more than the first.

Thus spake Julian Ashton (ashton@...tmedia.com):

I am writing the FastTrack plugin for Edonkey/Overnet and during this process have realized that this is by far the worst and most insecure plugin architechture I have ever seen in my life. Here is a short list of what they have given 1.14 million users(currently online) to have done on their machine if they are to download an "bad" plugin.
