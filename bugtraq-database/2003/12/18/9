Hi there, 

Bob Todd from Advanced Research Corporation, the developer of SARA.  I have been talking to Tom and I am somewhat surprised by his email.  Let me
explain:

1.  CSS: Tom indicates that SATAN and older versions of SAINT are not
    vulnerable to CSS.  Tom is incorrect as all used the SATAN engine
    which did not tranlate "<" and ">" to their html codes "&lt;" and 
    "&gt;  I suspect that SAINT has fixed it, SARA has, but SATAN has
    not.

2.  SARA Web Server:  Tom implies that the SARA server is not secure.  The
    SARA server is based on the SATAN engine with additional IP protection.
    We have received no complaints of this interface in nearly 5 years of 
    service.

3.  Tom suggests against using the intractive interface to SARA.  We
    believe that this is unfounded as there has been no basis in over five 
    years of use.  We have always professed that the SARA computer be
    secured so as operations and data could not be compromised.

In summary, I wish that Tom had done more research on SATAN and SAINT and had not indicted only SARA.  SARA is the only open source SATAN derivitive.
It can be better, but erroreous charges against it are not beneficial.
Maybe Tom should join our list server and contribute rather than complain!

>Description:
>SARA, a descendent of SATAN, is a tool for probing networks for vulnerabilities

>running on them is displayed, and in some cases this includes banners from
>the service.  In SARA version 4.2.7 and before, the service banners were not

>Solution:

>I would also recommend against performing scans in interactive mode in any

>(or a script), thereby avoiding the invocation of the interactive http
>interface as root.  Data analysis does not require root privileges, and it
>would be safer to only use the interactive interface with less privileged
>accounts (though access to the results files still required).
