        1) security vulnerability resolved: gpg
           problem description, discussion, solution and upgrade information

           - kernel
        3) standard appendix (further information)

______________________________________________________________________________

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    The gnupg (the SUSE package is named gpg) package is the most widely 
    used software for cryptographic encryption/decryption of data.

    Two independent errors have been found in gpg (GnuPG) packages as shipped
    with SUSE products: 

 A) A format string error in the client code that does key retrieval
    from a (public) key server
 B) A cryptographic error in gpg that results in a compromise of a
    cryptographic keypair if ElGamal signing keys have been used for
    generating the key.


 A)
    There exists a format string error in thhe client code for key retrieval
    from a keyserver. gpg-1.2.x version packages are affected by this 
    vulnerability.
    The format string error can be used by an attacker performing a 
    man-in-the-middle-attack between you and your keyserver, or by a
    compromised keyserver. The result is a crash of gpg or a potential 
    execution of arbitrary code provided by the attacker, if the keyserver
    is used for key retrieval at the time of the attack.

 B)
    Werner Koch, the author of the gpg package, has publicly announced a
    weakness in gpg that has been reported to him by Phong Nguyen: 
    ElGamal signing keys can be attacked within seconds to reveal the
    private key of the keypair. It is strongly advised that ElGamal signing
    keys should be revoked immediately. Only ElGamal keys are affected, other
    types are not vulnerable.

    To find out if you are using an ElGamal signing key, list your public
    keys using the command

         gpg --list-keys your_keyid

    Example:
    $ gpg --list-keys build@...e.de
    pub  1024D/9C800ACA 2000-10-19 SuSE Package Signing Key <build@...e.de>
    sub  2048g/8495160C 2000-10-19 [expires: 2006-02-12]
    $ 

    If your key lists a capital "G" after the key's length (like in
    pub  1536G/...), then your key is vulnerable. A small letter "g" after
    the key length does NOT indicate any problem.
    ElGamal keys can be used for primary keys as well as for subkeys. In the
    case where only a subkey is an ElGamal key, it is sufficient to revoke
    this specific subkey.

    To revoke a key, generate a revocation certificate using the following 
    command:

         gpg --gen-revoke your_keyid > revocation_certificate.pgp

    Then, the revokation certificate must be imported into your keyring:

         gpg --import < revocation_certificate.pgp

    As your last action, send the key with its revocation certificate
    to the keyservers that know your key:

         gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net --send-keys your_keyid


    ElGamal keys can only be generated by gpg if a special option (--expert)
    has been used to reveal "expert" options, and if a warning has been
    ignored after your choice to use ElGamal keys. Such keys are rare 
    (Werner Koch reports 848 primary ElGamal signing keys and 324 vulnerable 
    subkeys on the keyservers.). Therefore, we expect that only experienced
    users of gpg may be vulnerable to the ElGamal signing key error.

    

 UPDATES:

    The nature of the ElGamal error implies that a possible compromise was 
    made possible with the generation of the key in the past already. There is
    no way that an update package can prevent the compromise. However,
    the update packages that we provide prevent the use of ElGamal signing
    keys for key generation once the packages are installed. 

    SUSE Linux 8.1 and before contain a gpg package of version 1.0.x 
    (vulnerable to the ElGamal signing key bug only), a version of 1.2.x
    has been shipped with SUSE Linux 8.2 and 9.0 (vulnerable to both errors).
    We provide update packages that fix both vulnerabilities, meaning that
    only the packages affected by both vulnerabilities are being updated.
    For this reason, there are only update packages for SuSE Linux 8.2
    and SUSE LINUX 9.0 available for download.

    Important Note:
    A proper installation of the gpg update package is critical for future
    updates on your system. The gpg program is being used by YaST Online
    Update (YOU) to verify the authenticity of your update package. A failure
    of a signature verification will result in a failure of the installation
    of update packages.


    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update.
    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SUSE Distributions and Workarounds:

  - kernel: brk() vulnerability
    All SUSE Linux kernels (except for the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 8)
    are vulnerable to a privilege escalation vulnerability that can be 
    exploited by an attacker who has local shell acccess to your system.
    We are in the process of testing the update packages for all of our
    products. The packages are expected to be released within hours and
    are being published as they are ready.
    Please follow the guidelines in the announcement about the kernel that
    follows this announcement.


______________________________________________________________________________

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SUSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over 
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be 
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used 
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command 
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SUSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is 
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@...e.de), 
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the 
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing 
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all 
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course, 
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory 
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SUSE in rpm packages for SUSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SUSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@...e.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .
