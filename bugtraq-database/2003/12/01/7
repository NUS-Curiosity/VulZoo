Greetings,

I would like to announce the availability of a new and free resource to the 
software security community, the SC-L email discussion forum.  The moderated 
forum is open to the public.  The group's purpose is, "to further the state 
of the practice of developing secure software, by providing a free and open, 
objectively moderated, forum for the discussion of issues related to secure 
coding practices throughout a software development lifecycle process 
(including architecture, requirements and specifications, design, 
implementation, deployment, and operations)."  (The complete text of the 
group's charter, including its acceptable and unacceptable usage policies, 
can be found at http://www.securecoding.org/list/charter.php.)

To subscribe to the list, simply connect to http://www.securecoding.org/list 
and follow the directions on the form.  Submissions should be sent (by 
subscribers only) to sc-l@...urecoding.org.

Cheers,

Ken van Wyk
Moderator, SC-L mailing list
