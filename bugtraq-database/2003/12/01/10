Subject: [ANNOUNCE] glibc heap protection patch


Hi all,

I'd just like to announce that we have a heap protection system for 
glibc available for download. The system detects and prevents all heap 
overflow exploits that modify inline control information from 
succeeding against a protected application, can be installed 
system-wide or on a per-process basis using LD_PRELOAD, and is 
transparent to existing applications.

We would definitely appreciate any feedback and bug reports on the 
code. The patch and some additional information is available at:

http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~wkr/projects/heap_protection/

Enjoy!
