Hard disk passwords are somewhat less worthless.  See:

page 84.  If the security level is set to Maximum and the User password is
unknown, you can either erase the drive (if you know the Master password) or
throw it away.  I'm sure it's feasable to recover the data by physical
disassembly or modifying the drive's circuits or firmware, but at least it's
not trivial like BIOS passwords.
