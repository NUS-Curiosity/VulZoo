Subject: Re: Is this the first case of a Distributed Denial of Physical Service?


This isn't the first use of the internet to attempt a Denial of Service 
style attack on something in the physical world. In late 2002, people 
from http://slashdot.org teamed together and executed a 
postal-service-DoS on a spammer. After obtaining his physical address, 
they signed him up for thousands of free catalog mailings and the like.
More details, including a link to a paper written about how such attacks 
could be executed automatically here:
