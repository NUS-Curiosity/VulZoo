	Excuse me but what good is something for Win2K SP0 when that level
has a half live of about 1 hour (IF THAT) on the net in the face of the
background ambient noise of Welchia/Nachi/MS-Blaster before being
compromised?  Anything against W2K SP4 rolled up to MS03-026?  This can't
even be tested in a live fire environment.

	Does it work against anything that can survive the current
network environment on the Internet?
