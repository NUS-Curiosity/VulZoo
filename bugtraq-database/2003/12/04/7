Subject: XSS vulnerabilities in register.asp in Alan Ward Acart




Vulnerability:	XSS vulnerabilities in register.asp

Description:	The registration form in register.asp does not properly sanitize user input.  This means a malicious user can place script into the form fields when they register.  The script is stored in the database intact and is called and executed when the data is to be displayed.

Exploit:	The exploit was proven with a test script placed into several of the formï¿½s fields.
	&lt;script&gt;alert("test")&lt;/script&gt;

Solution:	The developer needs to properly sanitize user input in the register.asp form.
