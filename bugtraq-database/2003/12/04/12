Subject: Improper authentication checking in Alan Ward Acart




Vulnerability:	Improper authentication checking for delete

Discussion:	Due to improper authentication checking a pop-up opened by any of the multiple XSS vulnerabilities by the admin of the site can cause a database compromise.

Exploit:	By using one of the multiple XSS vulnerabilities in this script, an attacker can cause the site administrator to open a new window and delete products or entire categories of products from the database.  The syntax is below:
	
www.example.com/acart2_0//admin/category.asp?catcode=1&stage=delete

Solution:	The developer needs to implement a new authentication mechanism for deletion of data.
