This has been patched to use /dev/urandom in v1.4, which also fixes a 
couple of other issues.

We didn't find this when we did our related work search back during 
late spring, but Andreas contacted me after our announcement.  From 
looking at the code, I don't think the goals are quite the same.  We 
only try to protect the chunk headers, but it seems that he wants 
instead to protect data contained in the user-visible memory region.  
This would be nice, but I think this has its own set of issues.

I've started looking at it, but I don't think I'll have time to 
seriously evaluate the situation there for a week or two, so feel free.
