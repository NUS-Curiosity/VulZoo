As an alternative to firewalling one can add a local address for
link.altova.com into %SYSTEMROOT%/system32/drivers/etc/hosts, like so:

127.0.0.1      link.altova.com

I tested this on my system. Here is the data that I received from the
program by running "nc -lp 80":

POST /liveupdate.asp HTTP/1.1
Referer: LicMan 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: AltovaLiveUpdate
Host: link.altova.com
Content-Length: 95
Cache-Control: no-cache

I can confirm the fact of "phoning home", but I could not confirm the
alleged disclosure of private information (e parameter is empty).

Thanks
