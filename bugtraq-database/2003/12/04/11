Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0048

Package name:      rsync
Summary:           remote code execution
Date:              2003-12-04
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5, 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Rsync uses a quick and reliable algorithm to very quickly bring
  remote and host files into sync.  Rsync is fast because it just
  sends the differences in the files over the network (instead of
  sending the complete files). Rsync is often used as a very powerful
  mirroring process or just as a more capable replacement for the
  rcp command.  A technical report which describes the rsync algorithm
  is included in this package.

Problem description:
  All versions of rsync prior to 2.5.7 contains a heap overflow that can
  be used to exceute arbitary code from remote.
  The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2003-0962 to this issue.

  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
