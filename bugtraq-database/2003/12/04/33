The arc4random() function does not deplete the Linux kernel's entropy
pool, as reading from /dev/random does.  As long as arc4random() is
properly seeded from /dev/random to begin with (and periodically stirred
with more entropy from /dev/random), it's perfectly good unpredictable
pseudorandom data, suitable for most anything except actually generating
cryptographic keys.

OpenBSD uses arc4random() as the basis for the mkstemp() function to
generate unpredictable temporary filenames, for example.

In sum, using a properly seeded arc4random() under Linux is similar to
reading from /dev/urandom, but it uses the ARC4 algorithm to generate
the pseudorandom data rather than the undocumented algorithm used by
Linux's /dev/urandom.
