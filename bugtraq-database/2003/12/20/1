Hi all!


I'm sorry for my absence from the list for the past few months, but I have
been very busy traveling outside the US, and my mail account was
experiencing problems.  Now that I am receiving the messages again, I have
been playing "catch up," by reading the old posts.

I do have some good news, and was hoping that some of you might be able to
assist me.  I have been commissioned by Wiley & Sons to write a second book,
which is tentatively titled, "The Art of Intrusion."  This book will
chronicle detailed accounts of real, untold hacks by the perpetrators who
did it, and I will provide a security analysis and described how the attack
could be mitigated/prevented in today's environment.  I am going to tell the
story from the perpetrator's stance, not just from research obtained from
law enforcement officials and records.

I am looking for former/retired hackers that would be willing to tell me the
details of their sexiest hack.  I am not interested in the run-of-the-mill
attacks such as, exploiting RPC DCOM, but rather creative ones that
incorporated technical, physical and/or social engineering aspects.

                 

I am offering $500 for the most provocative story that makes it into the
book, and if the person wishes, we can protect their anonymity by the use of
a handle.  All contributors selected for the book, will receive a copy of
both books autographed by the authors.

I should have more information up on FreeKevin.com today, as well as
DefensiveThinking.com.  If someone would like to contact me with a story or
a possible lead on a storyteller, please write to me at
hacks@...ensivethinking.com, or call at (310)689-7229.  I would appreciate
any assistance you can offer. 

All my best,

 

Kevin Mitnick
