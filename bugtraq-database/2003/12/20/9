Subject: Multicast from Orinoco wireless stations



It seems that some Orinoco 802.11 base stations
send multicast packets on 224.0.1.76/2313 (IAPP.MCAST.NET).

By sending a multicast join (opening a socket with netcat or other tool)
to this group, one can discover other base stations on  multicast-enabled
portions of the Internet, such as the academic networks CA*net, ESnet etc.

There is administrative access to these units via telnet and http.

The group should probably be filtered at an administrative boundary as a
matter of principle.
