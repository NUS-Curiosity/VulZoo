While the whole thing seems to be a really sorry attempt of someone who
knows next to nothing about e-mail, looking at the URI the victim is
supposed to go to suggests the scammer attempted (unsuccessfully, it
appears - I couldn't check it because I don't use Windows, but there
doesn't seem to be the 0x01 char anywhere) to exploit the Internet
Explorer URL parsing vulnerability discovered not long ago, in order to
obscure the real target host from superficial inspections that many users,
especially of the kind that would believe such messages, never go
beyond.

AOL and iPowerWeb (where the scam site is located) have been notified.
