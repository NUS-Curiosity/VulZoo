I've written similar patch few days ago. The patch only modifies first
instructions of do_brk() (it replaces them with jmp to function in LKM.
It can be downloaded from http://wizard.ath.cx/fixbrk.tar.gz

But beware, I wrote it in rush and it's pretty odly written :-) But it
worked on my two servers (both were running 2.4.21 kernel with grsecurity
patch).
