Summary

   This advisory documents two vulnerabilities for the Cisco Firewall
   Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series and Cisco 7600 Series
   (FWSM). These vulnerabilities are documented as CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth) and
   CSCeb88419 (SNMPv3).

   There are workarounds available to mitigate the effects of CSCeb88419
   (SNMPv3). No workaround is available for CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth).

   This advisory will be posted at
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20031215-fwsm.shtml.

Affected Products

   All Cisco FWSM devices running the affected Cisco FWSM software, as
   documented below, are affected by these vulnerabilities.

     * CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth)

       1.1.2 and earlier.

     * CSCeb88419 (SNMPv3)

       1.1.2 and earlier.

   The Cisco PIX firewall is also vulnerable to the SNMPv3 issue and is
   documented as
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20031215-pix.shtml. No other
   Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
   vulnerabilities.

   To determine your software revision, type show version at the command line
   prompt.

Details

     * CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth)

       The Cisco FWSM may crash and reload due to a buffer overflow
       vulnerability while processing HTTP traffic requests for
       authentication using TACACS+ or RADIUS. This request is initiated when
       a user starting a connection via FTP, Telnet, or over the World Wide
       Web (HTTP) is prompted for their user name and password. If the user
       name and password are verified by the designated TACACS+ or RADIUS
       authentication server, the Cisco FWSM will allow further traffic
       between the authentication server and the connection to interact
       independently through the Cisco FWSM's "cut-through proxy" feature.

     * CSCeb88419 (SNMPv3)

       The Cisco FWSM crashes and reloads while processing a received SNMPv3
       message when snmp-server host <ip_addr> is configured on the Cisco
       FWSM. This happens even though the Cisco FWSM does not support SNMPv3.

   The Internetworking Terms and Cisco Systems Acronyms online guides can be
   found at http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/.

   These vulnerabilities are documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID
   CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth) and CSCeb88419 (SNMPv3). To access this tool, you
   must be a registered user and you must be logged in.

Impact

     * CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth)

       This vulnerability can be exploited to initiate a Denial of Service
       attack on the Cisco FWSM.

     * CSCeb88419 (SNMPv3)

       This vulnerability can be exploited to initiate a Denial of Service
       attack on the Cisco FWSM.

Software Versions and Fixes

     * CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth)

       1.1.3 and later.

     * CSCeb88419 (SNMPv3)

       1.1.3 and later.

   The procedure to upgrade to the fixed software version is detailed at
   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps368/products_module_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080159caa.html#1047362.

Obtaining Fixed Software

   Cisco is offering free software upgrades to address these vulnerabilities
   for all affected customers.

   Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they
   have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise using
   such software upgrades, Customers agree to be bound by the terms of
   Cisco's software license terms found at
   http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html, or as otherwise set
   forth at the Cisco Connection Online Software Center at
   http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

   Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
   regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
   should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
   website at http://www.cisco.com/tacpage/sw-center/lan/catalyst/crypto/. To
   access the software download URL, you must be a registered user and you
   must be logged in.

   Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior or
   existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as Cisco
   Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
   support organization for assistance with obtaining the software
   upgrade(s).

   Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
   service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
   but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
   sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
   Assistance Center (TAC) using the contact information listed below. In
   these cases, customers are entitled to obtain an upgrade to a later
   version of the same release or as indicated by the applicable corrected
   software version in the Software Versions and Fixes section (noted above).

   Cisco TAC contacts are as follows.

     * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)

     * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)

     * e-mail: tac@...co.com

   See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
   additional TAC contact information, including special localized telephone
   numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
   languages.

   Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
   notice as evidence of your entitlement to a upgrade. Upgrades for
   non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

   Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
   "security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

Workarounds

     * CSCeb16356 (HTTP Auth)

       No workaround. Please upgrade.

     * CSCeb88419 (SNMPv3)

       There are two workarounds available.

          * Restrict access to only allow trusted hosts on specific
            interfaces to poll the SNMP server on the FWSM.

            snmp-server host <if_name> <ip_addr> poll

          * Disable the SNMP server on the FWSM as follows:

            no snmp-server location

            no snmp-server contact

            snmp-server community public

            no snmp-server enable traps

            Note:  The Cisco FWSM does not allow one to remove the community
            string altogether. It will always be either public or a user
            configured string. show snmp will still show snmp-server
            community public, but this does not mean SNMP is enabled.

       More details at
       http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/iaabu/pix/pix_62/cmdref/s.htm#1026423.

   The Cisco PSIRT recommends that affected users upgrade to a fixed software
   version of code.
