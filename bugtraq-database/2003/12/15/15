Lars,

Nope. The set of attacks discussed in RFC1858 is indeed old, but has
nothing to do with the TCP/IP injection vector I have described. The
RFC1858 attacks describe firewall-bypassing attacks: "tiny fragment
attack", where a malicious TCP or UDP packet is sent in chunks too small
to be properly analyzed by the device; and "source porting", where the
header of a previously analyzed packet is modified by an overlapping
chunk.

Both techniques are old, well known and easy to prevent (and, indeed,
prevented by all modern implementations). The attack I described, for a
change, is not aimed at bypassing a firewall, and seems to be pretty damn
impossible to fix without breaking some functionality.

Cheers,
