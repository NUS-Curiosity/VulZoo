Unbelievable. Yet another 'silent delivery and installation of an 
executable on a target computer. No client input other than viewing 
a web page ' fully patched XP and Internet Explorer 6 series of 
browsers:

Xp/index.html 

All one needs to do is point a spoofed link to something like this. 

Can the so-called "PCHealth" gimmick be uninstalled?
