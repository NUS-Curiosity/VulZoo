Subject: osCommerce SQL Injection && DoS && Cross Site Scripting




Vendor  : osCommerce
URL     : http://www.oscommerce.com
Version : osCommerce 2.2-MS1 / osCommerce 2.2-MS2
Risk    : SQL Injection Vulnerability & XSS in MS1
          And Denial Of Service to users in MS1 & MS2



Description:
osCommerce is an online shop e-commerce solution under on going 
development by the open source community. Its feature packed 
out-of-the-box installation allows store owners to setup, run, and 
maintain their online stores with minimum effort and with absolutely 
no costs or license fees involved. It is used by millions of people
all around the world, and has been implemented into other web apps
such as oscMall and OSC-Nuke.



SQL Injection && Denial Of Service Vulnerability:
osCommerce 2.2 MS1 is vulnerable to SQL Injection vulnerability that can 
allow an attacker to (or have an unsuspecting user) influence SQL Queries and/or 
deny a legitimate user service. By sending a user a malformed URI an attacker 
can effectively deny a user legitimate access to their account. Below is an 
example URI and an explanation of the URI parameters.

/default.php?cPath=[MID]&sort=5a&page=1&action=buy_now&products_id=[PID][JNK]

[MID] = A Valid Manufacturer ID Number
[PID] = A Valid Product ID Number
[JNK] = SQL query or junk. %22 %5C %27 or %00 Will cause a DoS

The Denial of service will cause an unremovable item to be placed in the
users shopping cart. The next time that user logs out and logs back in they
will be greeted with the following SQL error message. If a user is not logged
in they will have an unremovable item until their session is terminated. If
a user is not logged in, is sent the malicious URI, and then logs in they
will have an unremovable item in their cart until the database is manually
altered by an admin. If it is a 2.2 MS1 installation the query will execute.

--[ Begin Error ]---------------------------------------------------------

1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax. Check the manual that corresponds 
to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '[Problem_Here]' 
and pd.products_id = p.products_id and pd.langu

select p.products_id, pd.products_name, p.products_model, p.products_price, 
p.products_weight, p.products_tax_class_id from products p, products_description 
pd where p.products_id='79'[Problem_Here]' and pd.products_id = p.products_id 
and pd.language_id = '1'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have found NO WAY to have a normally functioning account after this attack 
is executed. Even if you are able to return to your shopping cart page you still 
cannot purchase items or view your shopping cart. Furthermore, an attacker can 
obviously use this flaw to possibly compromise the database, or even worse, 
have some unsuspecting customer run SQL queries for them. While this attack does
not cause the SQL queries to be executed in osCommerce 2.2 MS2, it does allow
for an attacker to execute a Denial Of Service attack on a user by placing an
unremovable item in their shopping cart. Any webmasters experiencing this kind
of attack can delete the malicious values from the "customers_basket" table, but
be aware that will not stop any arbitrary SQL queries from being executed. Queries
are not executed in osCommerce 2.2 MS2 because the addslashes() function is being
used. However, someone out there may be able to figure something out ;)



Cross Site Scripting:
Cross site scripting is present in osCommerce 2.2 MS1 An attacker can exploit
this flaw by passing an invalid request to the Manufacturers ID parameter. An
example of this can be seen below

/default.php?manufacturers_id="><iframe src=http://www.gulftech.org>



Solution:
Vendor was contacted an plans on releasing a fix this week. Please see their
website at http://www.oscommerce.com for any details about the fix.
