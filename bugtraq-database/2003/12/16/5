Subject: Invision Power Board SQL Injection Vuln [ All Versions ]




Vendor  : Invision Power Services
URL     : http://www.invisionpower.com
Version : All Versions Up To v2.0 Alpha 3
Risk    : SQL Injection Vulnerability


Description:
Invision Power Board (IPB) is a professional forum system that has been 
built from the ground up with speed and security in mind, taking advantage 
of object oriented code, highly-optimized SQL queries, and the fast PHP 
engine. A comprehensive administration control panel is included to help 
you keep your board running smoothly. Moderators will also enjoy the full 
range of options available to them via built-in tools and moderators control
panel. Members will appreciate the ability to subscribe to topics, send 
private messages, and perform a host of other options through the user 
control panel. It is used by millions of people over the world.


Problem:
Invision Power Board is vulnerable to an SQL Injection Vulnerability. All
versions up to 2.0 Alpha 3 seem to be affected. Below is an example URL
to test if you are vulnerable.


/index.php?showforum=1&prune_day=100&sort_by=Z-A&sort_key=[Problem_is_here]

If you are vulnerable (you should be) you will see an error message similar
to the one posted below. The only requirement is to know a valid forum number
and to have read access to that forum (must be able to view it).
