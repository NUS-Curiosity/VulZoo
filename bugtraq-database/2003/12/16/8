Are you sure about this? exit(3) will perform cleanup functionality with
at least stdio streams before calling exit(2). If FILE * are located in
the same autovariable space as the overflowed buffer, there exists the
possibility those stream pointers have been smashed; if those stream
pointers have been smashed, I would NOT be confident in claiming this
buffer overflow poses no problem.

Remember that the latest OpenSSH vulnerabilities relied on the cleanup
behaviour embedded throughout the code. (A call to a fatal-death
function wasn't as fatal as the name would indicate. Oops.)
