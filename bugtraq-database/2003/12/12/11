Not really. A variant of the same test addressed to common ports such as
139 resulted in four SYN+ACKs coming back, compared to 50 SYN+ACKs when
the checksum was correct - which is roughly similar to the previous
figure. Quite surprisingly, some of this comes from what seems to be
Windows XP SP1 - but maybe an intermediate device rewrites the packet
instead.
