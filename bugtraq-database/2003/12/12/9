Works fine and as expected for me (with framework 1.1 anyway). Are you suggesting that simply reading an XML file in an overriden OnLoad method somehow deadlocks the OS? There is a known deadlock issue for mixed-mode assemblies, but this requires use of MC++.

Is this a troll? Which groups did you post in on msnews.microsoft.com?
I read the .NET XML, Framework, and C# groups, and didn't see any posting, and I've just double-checked, and haven't seen any posts from you at all.
