Indeed, and you have no way to know that you are storing the right
fingerprint.

That's not true; such attacks have been widely documented at every recent
IETF meeting.

Nothing prevents you from using certificate-authenticated IKE the exact
same way you use your web browser: store individual host certificates,
instead of the root certificate and the DNs of the parties you expect to
connect to.  However, nothing *enables* you to use SSH with either a
hierarchical trust model (which you seem to not like) or a web-of-trust
model (ala PGP) where you decide whom to trust and how much, because
both have been proposed to the working group and both have been,
effectively, shot down.  As I said, that is very unfortunate, and the
dsniff and other attacks at recent IETF meetings and elsewhere (e.g. on
college campus networks) illustrate that real users are suffering for
it in the real world right now.
