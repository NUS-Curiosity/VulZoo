			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.1 : Bind: cache poisoning BIND 8 prior to 8.3.7 and BIND 8.4.x prior 8.4.2
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.33.1
Issue date: 		2003 December 01
Cross reference: 	sr886768 fz528464 erg712479 CAN-2003-0914
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	 UPDATED: Maintenance Pack 4 is now prerequisite. Previous releases 
	          required update pack 2.

	 UnixWare 7.1.3 is unaffected by this issue because the
	 version of bind included in UnixWare 7.1.3 is 9.2.1. 

	 Open UNIX is also unaffected by this issue because the version
	 of bind in Open UNIX 8.0.0 is 9.1.0. 

	 CERT/CC Incident Note VU#734644 

	 BIND is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) 
	 protocols. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability 
	 may result in a temporary denial of service.

	 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
	 has assigned the name CAN-2003-0914 to this issue.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Binaries

		ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/security/tools


	4.3 Installing Fixed Binaries

	Upgrade the affected binaries with the following sequence:

	1. Download the erg712479b.Z file to the /tmp directory on your machine.

	2. As root, uncompress the file and add the package to your system
	   using these commands:

	        $ su
	        Password: <type your root password>
	        # uncompress /tmp/erg712479b.Z
	        # pkgadd -d /tmp/erg712479b
	        # rm /tmp/erg712479b

	Alternatively, this SLS package may be installed in quiet mode,
	that is, without displaying the release notes and asking for
	confirmation.  To do this, use these commands:

	        $ su
	        Password: <type your root password>
	        # uncompress /tmp/erg712479b.Z
	        # pkgadd -qd /tmp/erg712479b all
	        # rm /tmp/erg712479b

	3. There is no need to reboot the system after installing this package.
