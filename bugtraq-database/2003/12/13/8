And we have technology deployed that solves exactly the same problem in
a reasonable way: SSH.

I have to admit that we were blinded as well.  I didn't look too closely
at XAUTH at that time because it was proprietary software and no
GNU/Linux client was in sight.  We should have forced Cisco to implement
hybrid mode over two years ago, but failed to do so.  I'm sorry about
that mess.
