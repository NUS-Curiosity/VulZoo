I can understand your point in hating him, because he released
some 0day things like CVS double free. But isn't it a bit
megalomaniac to accuse one of the TESO exploit coders of stealing
and leaking other one's warez? Especially when everyone knew that
TESO had found these exploits, too?

Oh yeah and a happy new year to everyone out there.
