                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           cvs
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:112-1
 Date:                   December 10th, 2003
 Original Advisory Date: December 8th, 2003
 Affected versions:	 9.1, 9.2
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability was discovered in the CVS server < 1.11.10 where a
 malformed module request could cause the CVS server to attempt to
 create directories and possibly files at the root of the filesystem
 holding the CVS repository.
 
 Updated packages are available that fix the vulnerability by providing
 CVS 1.11.10 on all supported distributions.
  
Update:

 The previous updates had an incorrect temporary directory hard-coded
 in the cvs binary for 9.1 and 9.2.  This update corrects the problem.
