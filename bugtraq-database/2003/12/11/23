I tried this on Netgear RP614 router (4-port dsl, not wireless, never
upgraded firmware). I tried a password with a space in it, but it didnt
work. I pulled the plug for about 24 hours, and it still doesnt accept the
default password.
Looks like it isnt a generell problem. But would be interessting on which
devices it works.
