Using the POC at http://www.zapthedingbat.com/security/ex01/vun1.htm

The following do NOT have the vulnerability.

MacOSX 10.2.28 	Mozilla Firebird 0.6		NOT vulnerability
MacOSX 10.2.28 	Mozilla Firebird 0.7.1 		NOT vulnerability
MacOSX 10.2.28 	IE 5.2.2 (5010.1)			NOT vulnerability
MacOSX 10.2.28 	IE 5.2.3 (5815.1)			NOT vulnerability

With both Firebird and IE the following is the same result. The
line below is a cut/paste.

Someone have a different test site?

Bugtraq seems to be holding my posts lately so if you don't see this
please relay it to the list.
