This also adds another effect, Since it's dropping to the right most url and
it's a parsing issue with the display url, SSL is additionally compromised
for this problem.

Scenario: Fake bank setup in .ru somewhere, attacker has a valid cert that
is signed by a authoritative Trent, and of attacker goes phishing. They
click to go to www.bank.com (looks legit of course, especially now), and it
has their usual SSL login prompt without any warnings. This is not an actual
SSL technical problem, but it adds to the trickery.
