Unfortunately, there appears to be a misconception surrounding Java
prepared statements.  Many developers assume that the only reason to use
them is performance, and are extremely reluctant to switching (even if
the application architecture would allow for that with a reasonable
delevelopment effort).

I believe that the relative fragility of database gateways written in
PHP is a result of the late availability of higher-level database
interface libraries (comparable to JDBC or Perl's DBI) and thus the
large amount of hand-written SQL statement generation code.
