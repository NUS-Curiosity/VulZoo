This issue has been resolved in ScreenOS 5.0, which was released last 
month.

In ScreenOS 4.0, if you are concerned with a malicious user using your 
browser session to access the NetScreen web UI, you should quit the 
browser application manually when you step away from your computer or 
when you have finished using the web UI.
