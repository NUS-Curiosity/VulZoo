Subject: Problem with Appleshare IP FTP server




This affects versions 6.3.1 and lower.

It will say 'Appleshare IP FTP server.'

But, there is a problem with it, Im not quite sure why, that when you login as an anonymous user, and type RMD / the system freezes.  My bet is that because Non-OSX macs dont use slashes for directories, that the ftp server doesnt understand / very well.  It copes with \ fine.  

Versions that arent affected:
Anything that actually displays a version number that is over 6.3.1

I dont think you could use this for anything besides crashing machines.  

Solution: upgrade to newer versions of appleshare.
