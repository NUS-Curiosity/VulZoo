I applaud Macromedia's commitment to security, being willing even to work
around a security problem in InternetExplorer.

Storing in an unpredictable location might help. Obfuscation does not:
instead of setting a cookie of BadThing, the attacker could set one that
will become BadThing. The need to reverse-engineer the obfuscation, and
details like possible character sets, are a minor hindrance only. Security
by obscurity does not work.

The problem of predictable location and content is NOT in Flash but in IE.
It is arrogant of MS apologists to suggest, and of MS to expect, that other
software should work around their security issues. Will user habits of
downloading to MyDocuments (or the desktop or C:\) be patched also?

Avenues of exploitation, not using Flash, will be found. Fix IE, or else.
