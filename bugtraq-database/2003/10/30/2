	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	apache
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0542
Date:			Tue Oct 28 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-025-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Andrï¿½ Malo discovered two stack-based overflows in the Apache web
  server; one in mod_alias, the other in mod_rewrite. Quoting from the
  OpenPKG adivsory: "These occurred if a regular expression with more
  than 9 capturing parenthesis was configured. To exploit this, an
  attacker would need to be able to locally create a carefully crafted
  configuration file (.htaccess or httpd.conf)."

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0542 to the problem.

  The vulnerability is in an apache wrapper function around the regex(3)
  interface; the affected uses of ap_regexec() are called with string
  inputs, so it would be difficult to construct the StackGuard canary
  value 0x000aff0d when attempting to overwrite the stack-stored
  regmatch_t structure arrays; thus, we expect StackGuard should prevent
  exploitation of this vulnerability. However, an exhaustive analysis
  has not been performed.

  In the event StackGuard prevents exploitation of this vulnerability,
  the apache process handling the request would still be killed; thus,
  Immunix recommends all users upgrade when convenient.
