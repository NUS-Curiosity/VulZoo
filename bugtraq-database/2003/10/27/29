Subject: Root Directory Listing on RH default apache


Hello everybody

[root@...alhost root]# cat /etc/redhat-release 
Red Hat Linux release 9 (Shrike)

# Install apache from cd or the latest one rpm
[root@...alhost root]# rpm -Uvh /tmp/httpd-2.0.40-21.5.i386.rpm

==============================================
From /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# 
# Disable autoindex for the root directory, and present a
# default Welcome page if no other index page is present.
#
<LocationMatch "^/$>
    Options -Indexes
    ErrorDocument 403 /error/noindex.html
</LocationMatch>
==============================================

It's true if you made a request like

GET / HTTP/1.0

Not true if you type:

GET // HTTP/1.0

If you have a simple index.html like

<html><body></body></html>

you aren't able to see the directory listing.
Well... a little problem but out there there are
lot of people that install default RH apache and
create "secret" (not linked) directory... :)
Well that's all, bye

TfM
