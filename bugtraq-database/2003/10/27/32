Hi Mindwarper.

It seems you can actually get it to work without pressing refresh and
without knowing the username (at least on my fully patched win2000 pro
machine).

How? Remember the vulnerability
"Microsoft Internet Explorer %USERPROFILE% Folder Disclosure Vuln."
http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/bugtraq0306/52.html
found by Eiji James Yoshida and published on Bugtraq 5 June 2003. It will
allow us to link to local files without knowing the username.

Basically this will repeat the test I did:
- Infect mlsecurity.sol with html code by visiting:
http://www.mlsecurity.com/ie/wee.php

- Create an iframe dynamically:
document.write('<iframe src=location.php><'+'/iframe>');

- Redirect to local file with the following http header:
Location: ftp://%@.../../../../Application Data/Macromedia/Flash
Player/mlsecurity.com/mlsecurity.sol

No username needed, no refresh.

Sincerely,

Andreas Sandblad
