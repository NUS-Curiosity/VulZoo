Subject: Re: Internet Explorer and Opera local zone restriction bypass


I can only reproduce it together with user-interaction, that is
manually pressing refresh in Internet Explorer. I did some attempts to
try to automaticly refresh the page using javascript but without any luck
(denied access due to cross-site-policy).

If this vulnerability depends both on manually pressing refresh and
knowing the username of the person visiting the malicious page (exact
path to known local file), then actual exploitation becomes much harder.

Environment: Latest fully patched IE on Win 2000 pro.
