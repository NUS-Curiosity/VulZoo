 implementation


Hi Alla,

Sun also applied the classloading fix to java.net.URLClassLoader, according
to my jardiffer tool, which automatically finds the location of
those fixes.

I am waiting for the detailed paper of LSD, because loading the class
is only a first tiny step to get real control, although if you load enough
classes you have at least a Denial-of-Service. But I am sure they
will have a good exploit in their sleeve.

IMHO there already enough dangerous classes deployed in the rt.jar
of the JDK. q.e.d. with the floppy hardware attack on IE&
(http://www.illegalaccess.org/exploits/java/applet/MyFloppySucks.html)

Marc

P.S.: on Opera 7.21 , Java 1.4.2_02 enabled your
 applet just displays a gray box .....
