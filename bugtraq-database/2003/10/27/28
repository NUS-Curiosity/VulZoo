Subject: Re: CensorNet: Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability


Hi,

"An attacker may construct a link to a vulnerable server such that it
exploits this vulnerability. When an innocent user follows this link, the
script code will be reproduced by the server, and execute within the
context of the vulnerable site. This may result in the exposure of
sensitive data and cookie information, or allow the attacker to subvert
the content and functionality of the site."
Regards,
	Richard Maudsley
