We have finished the latest quarterly audit of the DNS <http://www.ep.net>
and now include not only the reverse trees, but 64% of the forward map too.
This is the rough cut, using  version.server and version.bind replies.

Presenting some preliminary numbers for your amusment.  

For the DNSsec junkies... we have some work to do - 0.1% penetration is
	really poor, but its better than last quarter.
For the wildcard zelots - time to play catch-up w/ the latest ISC code.

The bind 4.x tail off is dragging. :(  Time to kill the beast.
And for you folks w/ the user generated strings, the next pass will 
have some additional tests.

	----------------------------------------------------
164,395  unique servers

user generated strings = 73034   ~44%
bind 4.x               =  1589   ~ 0.9%
bind 8.x               = 34792   ~21%
bind 9.x               = 54980   ~33%
