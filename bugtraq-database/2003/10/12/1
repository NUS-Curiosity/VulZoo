Subject: RE: Local DoS in windows.


Umm nope, not on my XP SP1 machine. I have about 15 windows running and avg
1% utilization. I do your little trick and there is no change. 

Though maybe it is because my machine is one of those really fast 900Mhz
PIII's. 

Maybe the problem is you are running a hacked version of shell32.dll from
http://www.geocities.com/visitbipin/ and he screwed it up. 

Thanks for playing.

The image is self explanatory...

--- [Description] ---
When you click to "any" close, maximize or minimize button's in windows Xp,
[No matter whether it's IE or a WordPad] surprisingly there is 100% CPU use
at the instant and it continues............ until you release the button!
Moreover, we've noticed if you continuously click the button for a long time
[... not release it and hold ON ] we've seen gradual/slow rise in page-file
use too...!!!

--- [Conclusion] ---
Hell... local DoS! That could be used by employees working at different
terminal..... (O;
