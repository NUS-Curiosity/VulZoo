Well.. sometimes, you need to store a small amount of data (20-30K of 0day
exploit or encryption key or similar, perhaps?) where people perusing the
bookshelf won't notice it.

I know of somebody who worked out a filesystem that used the "dead space"
between end-of-file and end-of-block to store data.  Who cares?  Somebody who
doesn't want it noticed.....
