 vulnerabilities


Let me start off by saying that I am NOT a geeklog developer.  I would also
like to mention, like any project, alot of this code was inherited by the
developers and they have been working hard to squash security bugs when
notified properly.  Give the developers a chance to keep their users
secure.

Dirk,

Ok let me get this straight, basicly what your saying is,
He's correct on one point the xss issue, and the others might possibly
affect mysql 4.1" (it does)
and then you go about and tell him how he wasted everybodys time
So if it affects only 1% of your userbase its not an issue and you
shouldn't
be reporting it ?
even on mysql 3 its probably posible to constuct some url that will suck up
a lot of resources

on your site you claim Three members of the Geeklog development team have
now been trying to reproduce
these issues and failed, wouldn't your time have been better spend *fixing*
these issues,
it's hardly rocket science. why wait until someone comes up with a clever
way to exploit it. It's obviously
a risk why wait until it becomes a threat

---
First, if you cant reproduce a problem, how can you expect to fix it?  It's
not rocket science, you are correct.  Even so, why not approach it
properly?
---

IMHO you've got the wrong attitude. Anyway I am not done yet
I don't normally "do" sql injection but beeing anoyed with your response as
I was i took a quick
look at this geeklog, and I was stunned at how insecure it was

---
I've been annoyed at the disclosure as well.  People need to contact the
developers *FIRST*, before running at the mouth, for a number of reasons.
To confirm the installation environment of the elleged security breach. To
let the authors attempt to reproduce it accordingly.  To not compromise the
userbase that can't do anything about it until the programmers are done.
Shall I go on?  Yes, geeklog has security issues, name one piece of
software that doesnt.
---

- It by default stores the password hash in a cookie, you cant turn that
off
- you dont have to enter your old password in order to change it

this means that any xss issue in this site will lead to compromises of
accounts, you can steal the
hash and userID place it in your cookie, log in and voila, if you do this
you have to be *EXTREMELY*
wary of xss issues, well your not, you can find these all over the place

---
And 90% of geeklog sites are non-ssl, so what's your point?  The username
and password pairs are already transmitted in cleartext.  Remember what
geeklog is geared towards, blogging.  This isn't a HIPPA qualified
application, nor was it meant to be.
---

all the classics just work like

<img src="javascript:alert()">

<b style="background-image: url(javascript:alert(document))">test</b>

in the forum, I wont even bother listing all the issues

parameters passed in urls that get inserted into queries get sanitized
hardly anywhere ,
I attached a python script that should crack any users account  who ever
posted to the forum's in under half an hour,
just get the hash stuff it and the acomanying user id in a cookie, get to
the site and change the password
The exploit is rather messy and I haven't tested it too thorougly but it
should work (i think :) )  note this is a seperate issue as the ones
reported by Lorenzo. but again these issues all over the place

---
And did you contact the developers about this before emailing the security
lists?  Let's *ALL* be responsible about discloser.  It's not just the
developers that have to be repsonsible about security
