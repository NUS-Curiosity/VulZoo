I think you have missed the point. Carrier media level juggling is
pointless, indeed, and we're not claiming otherwise; quite the opposite,
we consider it to be silly and we are not focusing on it. Network-level
juggling is much more interesting, because packet-processing latencies are
far higher; how much longer? There are some surprises.

Should you actually read the paper, it would be easier to comprehend the
idea. The paper proposes several approaches that do not require you to
send the data back and forth all the time; in some cases, you can achieve
near-infinite latency with a very low "sustaining traffic" necessary to
prevent the data from being discarded. Besides, the storage size is not
the main point, the entire approach is much more interesting from the
limited deniability high-privacy storage point of view.

Your latency can be much higher, that's the first observation of the
paper, and it is possible without increasing access times in many cases.
Funny.

The second observation is that not all the data has to be send back and
forth all the time. Interesting.

The third observation is that there are some interesting applications of
this approach other than storing warez. Could there be?

So, while I hate to say this, reading the paper is usually a good idea
before ridiculing it...
