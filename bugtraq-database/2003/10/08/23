Not really; the problem is trivially solved by maintaining a redundancy of
the data. Choosing the right parameters to maintain realiability is
perhaps the only challenge here, and it depends on the environment and
the set of bounce hosts.

No need to - the problem is solved by fire-and-forget + redundancy,
likening TCP to UDP; in addition, the paper proposes a method of storing
data using mechanisms such as a sustained command on the remote server,
where there is no need to resend the data on a regular basis, so even if
you use reliable TCP/IP stack, there is no need to keep any data for an
extended period of time on your end.
