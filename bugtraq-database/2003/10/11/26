Subject: Another example of completely incorrect behavior of vendor: SmartFTP.com


Hi friends,
Here is another example of an incorrect Vendor behavior and cynic response.
You warned them , they patched it and then anothet thing like XSS:,
they say: It is not my responsability.
Go to:
http://advisories.nsrg-security.com/SmartFTP.com-XSS

It is self explanatory.
Enjoy and laught lots of times.
Best Regards.
PS: he patched it but he didn't say , ok , i will patch it , no i'm sure !
hahahha
