Subject: RE: Bad news on RPC DCOM vulnerability


Security Community,

The following information references a serious security threat to you or
your organization if the proper measures have not been taken to prevent
its destructive intent.
  
Description of Issue
--------------------
VigilantMinds has successfully validated the claims regarding the latest
Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) vulnerability.  Specifically,
VigilantMinds has validated that hosts running fully patched versions of
the following Microsoft operating systems REMAIN subject to denial of
service attacks and possible remote exploitation:
  
   * Microsoft Windows XP Professional
   * Microsoft Windows XP Home
   * Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstation

Although it has not been verified at this time, other versions of
Microsoft Windows are also suspected to be subject to this
vulnerability.

As with the prior RPC vulnerability (MS03-039), these attacks can occur
on TCP ports 135, 139, 445 and 593; and UDP ports 135, 137, 138 and 445.


Remediation Actions
-------------------
VigilantMinds has notified CERT/CC and informed the vendor of this
issue.  As of this posting, no vendor patch is yet available.

As a temporary solution, VigilantMinds suggests that firewall rules be
placed on all affected ports for any exposed systems.  All external
connectivity (including VPN) should be firewalled actively for
unnecessary incoming RPC activity.

A Snort signature that will detect traffic patterns associated with this
attack is below.  Note that current Snort signatures may also identify
this attack.

Dear bugtraq@...urityfocus.com,

There are few bad news on RPC DCOM vulnerability:

1.  Universal  exploit  for  MS03-039  exists in-the-wild, PINK FLOYD is
again actual. 2.  It  was  reported  by exploit author (and confirmed),
Windows XP SP1 with  all  security  fixes  installed still vulnerable to
variant of the same bug. Windows 2000/2003 was not tested. For a while
only DoS exploit exists,  but  code execution is probably possible.
Technical details are sent to Microsoft, waiting for confirmation.

Dear  ISPs.  Please  instruct  you customers to use personal fireWALL in
Windows XP.
