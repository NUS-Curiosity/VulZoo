Subject: Excuse me , oh no! it was discovered before....;-(


Hi again dear friends,
I'm a little sad about this: the "vulnerability" was discovered before , i
made a little research in the wmplayer ocx and i saw it but i didn't imagine
the possibility that it was discovered before.
But , why it is not patched ?
if you set the counter to lots of times... it is not a funny joke.
the best regards,
