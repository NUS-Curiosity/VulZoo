(more code snipped).

Soooo... let's see... if I feed this thing something that has *both*
a legitimate X_FORWARDED_FOR and a malicious VIA, this code
will only check the FORWARDED.  I think you really wanted to do

for i in (FORWARDED VIA REMOTE_ADDR) do
	if (isset($_server($i)) banit($_server($i)....)
done

or however you do it in PHP.
