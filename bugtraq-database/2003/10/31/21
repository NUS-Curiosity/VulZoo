VERSIONS AFFECTED : <== Tritanium Bulletin Board 1.2.3 (http://www.tritanium-scripts.com/)

Description:

I found a security bug in Tritanium Bulletin Board:
Normal Users can read the content of Threads to which they have no access rights!
(and can answer to it which may be a problem if the internal forum has the right to insert html code)

Author of the Software has been notified.

Example:

http://[target].com/[path]/index.php?faction=reply&thread_id=[ID OF THE THREAD TO READ]&forum_id=[ID OF FORUM]&sid=[your sid]

Shows the window where The Attacker can answer to the topic and below that a window with the content of the thread!!!
The Attacker can easily read all protected Threads since the thread_id is counted for every forum newly so just put from 1 on upwards :-)

Solution:
Hey sorry this time i had no time for a solution :-)
