The irritation has begun  :/
A new version of Mimail.C has cropped up.  It spoofs the recipients domain and sends the mail as 'james@<spoofed domain>' and has an attachment: pictures.jpg.exe

Some clients have reported massive amounts of lag due to its mass mailing and one client's firewall dropped as a result, although this might not be related.

More info can be found on:

Antigen pics the attachment up as I-Worm.WatchNet

Keep an eye out and inform your users

cheers
