GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200310-04

          PACKAGE : net-www/apache
          SUMMARY : buffer overflow
             DATE : Fri Oct 31 07:59:00 UTC 2003
          EXPLOIT : local
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <apache-2.0.48
    FIXED VERSION : >=apache-2.0.48
       GENTOO BUG : http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32271
              CVE : CAN-2003-0789 CAN-2003-0542

Quote from <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.html>:

    This version of Apache is principally a bug fix release. A summary of
    the bug fixes is given at the end of this document. Of particular note
    is that 2.0.48 addresses two security vulnerabilities:

    mod_cgid mishandling of CGI redirect paths could result in CGI output
    going to the wrong client when a threaded MPM is used.
    [CAN-2003-0789]
    
    A buffer overflow could occur in mod_alias and mod_rewrite when a
    regular expression with more than 9 captures is configured.
    [CAN-2003-0542]
    
    This release is compatible with modules compiled for 2.0.42 and later
    versions. We consider this release to be the best version of Apache
    available and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.


SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-misc/apache 2.x upgrade:

emerge sync
emerge '>=net-www/apache-2.0.48'
emerge clean

Please remember to update your config files in /etc/apache2
as --datadir has been changed to /var/www/localhost.

Note that a forthcoming GLSA-200310-03 will address similar issues
in Apache 1.x.
