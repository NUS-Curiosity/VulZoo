You're commenting on 1 of 14 issues listed in

I am perfectly capable of reading the CVE entries, and deciding, issue
by issue, if it's worth fixing, and if so, how to fix it.  However,
being a security expert should not be a requirement for using a
commericial OS.  If these issues are worthy of fixing, they should be
fixed in 10.2.8.
