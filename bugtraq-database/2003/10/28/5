Package:             apache
Vulnerability:       local buffer overflow
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= apache-1.3.28-20031009 >= apache-1.3.29-20031028
OpenPKG 1.3          <= apache-1.3.28-1.3.0    >= apache-1.3.28-1.3.1
OpenPKG 1.2          <= apache-1.3.27-1.2.2    >= apache-1.3.27-1.2.3

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Andr√© Malo discovered buffer overflows [0] in the mod_alias and
  mod_rewrite modules of the Apache [1] webserver. These occurred if
  a regular expression with more than 9 capturing parenthesis was
  configured. To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to
  locally create a carefully crafted configuration file (.htaccess or
  httpd.conf). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the id CAN-2003-0542 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  apache". If you have the "apache" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.28-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig apache-1.3.28-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.28-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.28-1.3.1.*.rpm
