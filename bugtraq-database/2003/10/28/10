There is absolutely no requirement for any user-interaction, as you can
programmatically click the Refresh button - or rather, trigger the exact same
non-window-object-dependant non-cross-site functionality in the current window
object where you have all the access you need.

document.execCommand("Refresh");

Refresh is just one of the many command identifiers that document and range
objects can utilize

Use a third window object to store the state on wether or not you have refreshed
already, to avoid an infinite loop.
