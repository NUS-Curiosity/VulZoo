Subject: New DNS Security Paper


Hi

DNS is the most widely used protocol on the Internet yet many security
professionals do not have a full understanding of the many weaknesses
which surround it which are needed for Penetration Testing and day to
day security. 

We have released a paper on DNS security taken from our
DefensiveDeployment course within which we highlight basic and advanced
DNS attacks. Please download from the below link.
