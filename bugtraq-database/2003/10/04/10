Chris,

This is a known bug, and we were able to reproduce the behavior you 
reported, however the commands cannot actually be executed. As you 
demonstrated, you can get the 'help' text for non-enable commands at the
password prompt, but the command is not completed, all that is returned is
an error message. These commands are publicly available:

http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/lan/cat6000/sw_5_5/cmd_refr/cli.htm

This bug cannot be used to gain control of the switch, gather further
information about the device or gather details about the traffic it carries.
It is documented as CSCdr87435, and it is fixed in 5.5(3) and later, and
6.1(1) and later. Details about the problem can be found on our website if
you are a registered user:

Thank you for your work on this problem. As always, working with the Cisco 
PSIRT team is the best way to verify the accuracy of information before
posting it publicly.
