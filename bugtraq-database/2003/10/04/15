Subject: Conexant Access Runner DSL Console login bypass vulnerability




A vulnerability has been discovered in the Conexant Access Runner DSL Console Port 3.21. This vulnerability will let a remote attacker bypass the login screen and have full admin rights even if admin password is set. The login bypass works in the following way:

When at login screen you may press any key to get the invalid password, please try again message. At this point all an attacker has to do is tap the [ENTER] key to gain access to the main menu of the system with admin rights. 

This has been found to work on all 3.21 versions. At this time I am not aware of a fix as I could not get in contact with Conexant about this issue.
