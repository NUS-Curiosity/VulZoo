Subject: Re: New IE crash: CSS + HTML


Greetings,

I use Eudora v6 for e-mail, and when it processed the e-mail from 
arachnid__notdot_net@...a.net.nz re: "New IE crash: CSS + HTML," Eudora 
crashed with a MSHTML.DLL error.  Since the e-mail was then selected by 
default, Eudora continued to crash on startup until I renamed the 
MSHTML.DLL file in my \windows\system32 and \dllcache folders.  I deleted 
the message, un-renamed the file, and now Eudora's fine.  Information for 
my MSHTML.DLL file is as follows:

MSHTML.DLL
Microsoft HTML Viewer
v6.00.2800.1226
2,793,472 bytes

I am running McAfee VirusScan Pro with the latest dats, HFNETCHK Pro, etc. 
and have not found any infections, corruption, etc.  I attempted to contact 
"arachnid__notdot_net@...a.net.nz" about the problem; however, e-mail to 
following addresses was undeliverable:

arachnid__notdot_net@...a.net.nz
arachnid__notdot_net@...a.nz
arachnid@...a.nz

Is it arachnid__@...a.nz?  Anyhow...  Did anyone else on the list 
experience similar problems?  Thanks.
