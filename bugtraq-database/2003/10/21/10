Subject: SQL Injection Vulnerability in FuzzyMonkey MyClassifieds SQL Version

18 October 2003

Original Advisory
http://www.sintelli.com/adv/sa-2003-04-myclassified.pdf

Background
My Classifieds SQL is a Perl/CGI/MySQL script which will quickly and easily
allow the hosting of a classifieds forum on a website.
.
More information about the product is available here:
http://fuzzymonkey.org/newfuzzy/software/perl/classifieds/readme.html

Description
MyClassifieds SQL Version is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The
problem is due to improper sanitization of user input for the $email
variable. A remote attacker could insert arbitrary SQL code in the $email
variable. The passwords of the users can be written into a file and made
world readable.

Example:
If the value of $email is aaa@....com' OR 1=1 INTO OUTFILE
'/<directory-path>/pass.txt, the SQL request becomes:

select passmd5 from people where email=' aaa@....com' OR 1=1 INTO OUTFILE
'/<directory-path>/pass.txt'

and the passwords of the users can be written into the file pass.txt.

Impact
It is possible for an attacker to obtain passwords of users.
