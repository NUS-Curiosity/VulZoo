			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		OpenServer 5.0.5 : Insecure creation of files in /tmp
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.27
Issue date: 		2003 October 20
Cross reference:	sr865679 fz521201 erg712072 CAN-2003-0872
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	Several scripts use files /tmp in a insecure way. These
	filenames can be symlinked to by a malicious user, and cause
	various nefarious things to happen. 

	OpenServer 5.0.6 has previously fixed all these scripts,
	hence this issue does not affect OpenServer 5.0.6 or 5.0.7.	

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
        the name CAN-2003-0872 to this issue. This is a candidate for
        inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes
        names for security problems. Candidates may change significantly
        before they become official CVE entries.

2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Binaries
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenServer 5.0.5 		/etc/init.d/VDISK
					/etc/init.d/VDRESTORE
					/etc/tcp
					/usr/lib/mkdev/hostmib
					/etc/init.d/hostmib
					/etc/nfs
