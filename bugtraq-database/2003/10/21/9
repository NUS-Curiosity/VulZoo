-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	fetchmail, fetchmailconf
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2002-1365, CAN-2003-0792, CAN-2003-0790
Date:			Fri Oct 17 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-023-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  This update fixes several bugs in fetchmail, including a broken
  boundary condition check in the multidrop code, a header overflow that
  neglected to account for '@' signs in email addresses (CAN-2002-1365),
  a header-rewriting bug (CAN-2003-0792), and a head-reading bug
  (CAN-2003-0790; this CAN is likely to be revoked, but the patch appears
  to be nicely defensive).

  Immunix would like to thank Stefan Esser, Dave Jones, Markus Friedl,
  Nalin Dahyabhai, Mark J Cox, and Eric S. Raymond for diagnosing and
  fixing the problems.

  It is unknown if any of these problems lead to more than a Denial of
  Service attack. We do not believe StackGuard provides protection for
  any of the bugs addressed here.
