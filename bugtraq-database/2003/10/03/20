Subject: RE: Process Killing - Playing with PostThreadMessage


I've done a test with softice to check if the pskill of sysinternals sends
any WM_QUIT to the process that you want to kill, the breakpoint didn't
break so I guess these are two diferent things, with the same objective.

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but isn't this also how the PSKill
application from SysInternals work?
