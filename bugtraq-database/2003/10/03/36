  It looks like Squirrelmail 1.4.0 doesn't filter it, while 1.4.2 does.
  
  Upgrading Squirrelmail is not a bad idea anyway, as before version 1.4.1, 
external images could be loaded through the "lowsrc" attribute on browsers
that handle it. But this was not a bug in Squirrelmail either, just a
combination to avoid.
