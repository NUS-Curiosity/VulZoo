Actually there have been a couple, just of of the top of my head there's

quartz.dll overflow

http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/securityfocus/bugtraq/2003-07/0301.html

urlmon.dll overflow

http://lists.insecure.org/lists/bugtraq/2003/Jul/0019.html

and then  0day also doesn't exist right ?

I dont think there's cause for this kind of speculation.

There hasn't been an Outlook vulnerability for years, the only
vulnerabilities you can exploit these days in Outlook are the ones that
are caused by the fact that Outlook uses IE to render HTML mails.

Hence the speculation on my part ;)

Um, the way that site reads it was a buffer overflow
in Outlook.  The thread's author just mentions IE as an aside.
