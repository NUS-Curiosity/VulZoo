Summary

   New vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL implementation for SSL
   have been announced.

   An affected network device running an SSL server based on the OpenSSL
   implementation may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack when
   presented with a malformed certificate by a client. The network device is
   vulnerable to this vulnerability even if it is configured to not
   authenticate certificates from the client. There are workarounds available
   to mitigate the effects of these vulnerabilities.

   This advisory will be posted at
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030930-ssl.shtml.

   vulnerabilities.

Details

   An affected network device running an SSL server based on the OpenSSL
   implementation may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack when
   presented with a malformed certificate by a client. The network device is
   vulnerable to this vulnerability even if it is configured to not
   authenticate certificates from the client.

   More information on these OpenSSL vulnerabilities is available at
   http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt .

     * Cisco IOS - All 12.1(11)E and later IOS software releases in the 12.1E
       release train are affected by the OpenSSL vulnerabilities. The command
       no ip http secureserver may be used to disable the HTTPS web service
       on the device.

     * Cisco PIX Firewall - This vulnerability is documented as Bug ID
       CSCec31274 .

     * Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) - This vulnerability is

       documented as Bug ID CSCec45573 .

     * Cisco Content Service Switch (CSS) 11000 series - Cisco WebNS versions
       6.x and 7.x are vulnerable. WebNS version 5.x is not vulnerable to the
       OpenSSL vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is documented as Bug IDs
       CSCec45165 and CSCec45342 .

     * Cisco Global Site Selector (GSS) 4480 - This vulnerability is
       documented as Bug ID CSCec45380 .

     * Cisco Application & Content Networking Software (ACNS) - This
       vulnerability is documented as Bug ID CSCec41413 .

       ID CSCec44103 .
       
     * CiscoWorks 1105 Hosting Solution Engine (HSE) - This vulnerability is
       documented as Bug ID CSCec38542 .

     * CiscoWorks 1105 Wireless LAN Solution Engine (WLSE) - This
       vulnerability is documented as Bug ID CSCec38526 .

     * CiscoWorks Common Services (CMF) - Both Solaris and Windows version of
       CMF 2.2 and CMF 2.1 are vulnerable. Windows versions of Core 1.0 are
       also vulnerable. This vulnerability is documented as Bug ID CSCec43722

     * Cisco SIP Proxy Server (SPS) - This vulnerability is documented as Bug
       ID CSCec31901 .

Impact

   An affected network device running an SSL server based on the OpenSSL
   implementation may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack when
   presented with a malformed certificate by a client regardless of whether
   it is configured to process client certificates or not.

Obtaining Fixed Software

   Cisco is offering free software upgrades or patches to address these
   vulnerabilities for all affected customers. Customers may only install and
   expect support for the feature sets they have purchased. By installing,
   downloading, accessing or otherwise using such software upgrades or
   patches, Customers agree to be bound by the terms of Cisco's software
   license terms found at
   http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html, or as otherwise set
   forth at the Cisco Connection Online Software Center at
   http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

   Customers with service contracts should contact their regular update
   channels to obtain the free software upgrade(s) or patches identified via
   this advisory. For most customers with service contracts, this means that
   upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
   worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com/tacpage/sw-center/. To access
   the software download URL, you must be a registered user and you must be
   logged in.

   Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through a prior
   or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as Cisco
   Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
   support organization for assistance with obtaining the free software
   upgrade(s).

   Customers who purchased directly from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
   service contract, and customers who purchase through third party vendors
   but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
   sale, should obtain fixed software by contacting the Cisco Technical
   Assistance Center (TAC) using the contact information listed below. In
   these cases, customers are entitled to obtain an upgrade to a later
   version of the same release or as indicated by the applicable corrected
   software version in the Software Versions and Fixes section (noted above).

   TAC contacts are as follows.

     * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)

     * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)

     * e-mail: tac@...co.com

   See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
   additional TAC contact information, including special localized telephone
   numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
   languages.

   Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
   notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade.

   Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
   "security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

Workarounds

   The Cisco PSIRT recommends that affected users upgrade to a fixed software
   version of code as soon as it is available.

     * Restrict access to the HTTPS server on the network device: Allow
       access to the network device only from trusted workstations by using
       ACL's / MAC filters that are available on the affected platforms.

     * Disable the SSL server / service on the network device. This
       workaround must be weighed against the need for secure communications
       with the vulnerable device.

Exploitation and Public Announcements

   The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerabilities
   described in this advisory at this time.

   These vulnerabilities have also been documented by the NISCC at
