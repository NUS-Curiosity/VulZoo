Store your data on a crypto-loopback partition, but that requires a 
passphrase, _and_ a key file containing random data to access it.

In the event of an "emergency", simply shred -uvz /path/to/keyfile, and 
reboot.
Your data will be rendered completely useless.

I started playing with this, and wrote a simple shellscript to help out with 
this.
