Subject: JAP Wins Court Victory




Hi all,

The JAP folks have won a major court victory.
See their site.
http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/index_en.html

Since you ran all the negative side of their
backdoor activity, how about running the new
positive outlook - anonymity has a bright
future and JAP is cool.  And the German courts
are not all bad.

Ever considered that the spooks would not have
needed a court order if they knew how to crack
JAP?  It's solid code.  Do your due diligence
and follow up on the negative headlines with
the good news now.
