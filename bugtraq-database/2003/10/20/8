Subject: @stake tool announcement: RedFang 2.5: The Bluetooth Hunter


All,

Tool:        Redfang - The Bluetooth Hunter
Version:     2.5 (15 oct 2003)
Platforms:   Linux (tested on Redhat 9 / Mandrake 9.1)
Author:      Ollie Whitehouse, Simon Halsall (of QinetiQ), Stephen Kapp

Redfang v2.5 is an enhanced version of the original application that finds
non-discoverable Bluetooth devices by brute-forcing the last six bytes of the
device's Bluetooth address and doing a read_remote_name(). This new version
has streamlined code, enumerates service information, and supports multiple
threads for substantial speed gains using multiple devices (maximum
theoretical limit of 127 USB devices). This release of Redfang was developed
in collaboration with QinetiQ as part of their work in the DTI Next Wave
Technologies project FORWARD. (For more information about the underlying
concepts of Bluetooth discovery, read our research report War Nibbling:
Bluetooth Insecurity.)
