Note that the biggest problem the Allies had after they broke Enigma was being
*VERY* careful how they used the information, lest the Germans figure out it
had been compromized.  We intentionally let several of our ships get torpedoed
rather than let the Germans know that we had intercepted and decoded messages.

It's quite possible the spooks already HAD the decodes they needed in this
case, but had to get a court order so they could introduce the data in court
without somebody figuring out that JAP had been broken.
