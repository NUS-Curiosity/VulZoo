In this case, I'd assume it's the responsiblity of the vendors to hire
people who improve the quality of security advisories.

You need not restrict yourself to these signal words.  While it's common
to write just three lines about a vulnerability, nobody (well, except
your legal department) forces you to be so terse.

Risk assessment is something that has to be done locally because it is
greatly affected by local implementation decisions and the threats you
face.
