Well, no, that open does invoke a shell, albeit one with
no user input.  It's still better to 

	pipe
	fork
	child exec explicitly
	parent read pipe

Newer perl can actually use list form in the 'file'
section for open, so you'd be able to use that to
avoid a shell in the open without writing the code
yourself.
