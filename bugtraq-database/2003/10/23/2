Excuse me.  No it doesn't.  I dare you to watch a trace of that
program and tell me if EVER a /bin/sh is invoked.  It doesn't.  It
forks, and calls festival directly.  Just a child.  No grandchild.  No
chance for a shell interpretation.

When the pipe-open is simple enough (no shell metachars) Perl goes
directly to the $PATH and figures out how to parse that string into
the argv[] and calls execve directly.

Please don't challenge such obvious Perl knowledge for
someone who has spent the past twelve years writing more Perl
documentation and teaching Perl more than anyone else on the
planet.

I'm sorry if I sound irate, but Perl and Security are my two
expert areas.  Sheesh.  Trust me on this one, OK?

That is *precisely* what this is doing, using the shortest
syntax known to man. :)

Not needed.  This already avoids the shell.

JUST LIKE I ALREADY FRICKIN SAID.
