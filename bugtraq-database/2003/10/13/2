As with the previous AIM exploit we saw, this one is just trying to use the
Object Data vulnerability variation.

MS03-040 was released last friday, fixing this variation.

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms03-040.asp

As such, this is not trying to use any unpatched vulnerabilities and provided
that you are up-to-date on at least critical patches you are safe. The MS03-040
patch is one of those cumulative patches that all IE users should install
immediately, since it is a revised version of MS03-032 it fixes not only several
critical vulnerabilities (of which Object Data is just one) but it also fixes
all previously patched IE vulnerabilities. Consider it your starting point.
