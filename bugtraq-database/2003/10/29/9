Thor,

Sorry, I hadn't read the vendor response section of the advisories fully,
I'd rather assumed they would be issuing a security update for 10.2 as
per usual.

I'd have to agree it's a pretty poor showing from Apple if the only fix is
to
buy the next version of the operating system. I believe Microsoft are about
to stop patching Windows Me shortly (which has been around for a few years
now) and usually support the current and previous service pack of an OS.

If Apple are only going to support the most recent version of OS X - which
equates to about 12 months lifetime, as I believe they're planning a major
new release each year - then it's going to be either difficult or expensive
to
keep secure.

Given the current climate with regards to security, I don't think they're
doing
themselves any favours if they take this route. I hope they'll reconsider
if this
is their policy.

Regards,

Graham Coles

Graham,

Thank you for the feedback.

I can't locate any new patches or updates through the software update tool
on our 10.2 systems, and Apples security site (which I now received the URL
to) mentions nothing about these security updates for OS X 10.2

The only way for any Mac OS X 10.2 user to stay secure is to pay Apple for
an upgrade to Mac OS X 10.3, there are simply no patches for these
vulnerabilities in 10.2 even though 10.2 is affected.

 I usually download main updates (10.2.8) and security patches from
 http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple

 There's also an automated update from within OS X which will check
 for and install patches automatically.

 These are non-chargeable updates, I believe the price you quote is
 for a single user copy of Mac OS X.

 Graham Coles

 I couldn't find any security contacts on apple.com that didn't look
 fee-based so
 I am asking here in response to these latest disclosures of security
 vulnerabilities in Mac OS X.

 When most vendors are notified of security vulnerabilities in their
 products,
 they produce a patch for the affected versions of the software and
 distribute it
 for free. Does Apple plan to distribute a free patch for these security
 vulnerabilities to Mac OS X 10.2, or will my clients have to spend $129
 per
 workstation (the single user upgrade price) to have their Apple computer
 stay
 secure?
