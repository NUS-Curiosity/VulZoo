Which is why the pharmeceutical companies got special tax breaks for
developing "orphan drugs" that treat diseases that only a handful of
people get, to keep the cost of R&D down so the people could AFFORD
the drugs, right?

For it to be commercial, it needs to be both useful *and* have a sufficiently
large target audience to support a business.  If your fixed costs are $1M,
and the marginal costs are $20/item, the economics work out a LOT differently
for 100K customers and for 100 customers. (Do the math yourself if you don't
believe me...)
