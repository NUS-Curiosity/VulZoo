Subject: Shattering By Example


A new white paper on shatter attcks has been released and is available 
from our website;

www.security-assessment.com/Papers/Shattering_By_Example-V1_03102003.pdf 

This white paper includes information from both shatterseh2.txt and
shatterseh3.txt.

It also includes a shatter attack exploit against statusbars that uses
the following messages;
* WM_SETTEXT
* SB_SETTEXT
* SB_GETTEXTLENGTH
* SB_SETPARTS
* SB_GETPARTS

and demonstrates the following techniques.
* brute forcing a useable heap address
* placing structure information inside a process
* injecting shellcode to known location
* overwriting 4 bytes of a critical memory address

Any feedback or followup to this is most welcome,

Regards
