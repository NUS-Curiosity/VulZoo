Subject: About eMule web server "Buffer Overflow" discovered vulnerability


Hi again,
Umm , i've read in the website of my friend , 3APA3A , ( security.nnov.ru )
a person discovered a supposed "Buffer Overflow" in the eMule
webserver used for remote administration.
It is not a Buffer Overflow , you don't corrupt the stack and then insert
data to gain shell access or similar
and definately it is not a non-remote exploitable buffer oveflow,
it is only a typical Denial of Service attack against an incorrect data
handler with the only protection of the user side.
So , if you read one of my past advisories you can see my advisory about
Sambar Server search.pl Buffer Overflow,
it was wrong too xD , i was confused but long time passed since that
advisory.
Its common to confuse the DoS attacks and Buffer Overflows.
NOTE: the search.pl script of sambar had the same problem , an incorrect
input data handler that allowed to make DoS attacks against
the sambar webserver and the perl executable ( i wrote Buffer Overflow due
to this , i didn't know if the perl executable could allow to
corrupt the stack or similar ), so it was only a DoS , simple and easy.

Best regards to all,
PS: can somebody tell me about the l0l experssion ? is it laughting on the
loud ? xD a stupid question i know !
