- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that IRIX's websetup package (which uses WebMin) has a
security problem that allows unauthenticated remote access to Webmin.

For more information, see:
http://www.webmin.com/updates.html
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0101

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with the 6.5.20 webmin 1.070 package and
in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The websetup package is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as
"websetup.sw.eoe".

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if websetup is installed, execute the following command:

  $ versions -b websetup
  I = Installed, R = Removed

     Name                 Date        Description
     I  websetup             11/19/2002  Web Setup and Administration, 3.4

If the result is similar to the above, then websetup is installed and the
system may be vulnerable.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems if you want to
use the websetup package.  If you don't need it, then you can remove the
package with "versions remove websetup". SGI recommends either upgrading to
IRIX 6.5.20, or installing the websetup v 3.5 package from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided the websetup v3.5 package from IRIX 6.5.20 Apps CD for
these  vulnerabilities. Our recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20
when available, or install the upgraded websetup package.
