First off, the example bug I demonstrated:

http://meme-boi.netfirms.com/werd.html

while true it doesn't show remote class loading , is not fixed in 1.4.

I haven't tested 1.3 but I assure you there are serious issues , and the
bug is different , but I'll let you figure that out.

For authentication purposes and further proof of concept that someone(s)
dropped the ball and opened up old and new cans of worms I provide silly
denial of service code that should work on mo , opera and netscape:

( this won't work on 2.1.4 based browsers )

I thank you for the invitation , but I am a wal-mart janitor and I don't
have much time for finding bugs so I am saving more interesting methods of
bug harnessing for stalking clearchannel communications employees and
making them pay for forcing the world to listen to justin timberlake.
