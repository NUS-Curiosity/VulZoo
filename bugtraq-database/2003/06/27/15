These reccomendations and the test are largely meaningless. For all we know
some of the AV vendors look for that exact string, i.e. have a very
simplistic detection method. Had these tests actually been done using a
"real" virus (say one of the more recent mass mailers like klez or sobig)
they might be meaningful. Now I'm not saying AV products are perfect, who
knows maybe the NOP/JMP tricks will work with "real" viruses, but I wouldn't
assume so until actually tested.

In any event most AV is a reactive solution, bound to fail at some point
because of the time delay between virus in the wild and installaiton of
signature on user's platform.
