Subject: Vulnerabilities In Pablo Software Solutions FTP Service 1.2




Plaintext Password Vulnerability
------------------------------------
User info is stored in users.dat in plaintext. If the
anonymous account is present (it is by default) the
entire FTP server can be compromised

ftp://somewhere/program files/pablo's ftp service/users.dat


Default Anonymous Account
------------------------------------
The anonymous account is by default set to 
have download access to anything in the C:\
directory. While this can be disabled by simply
deleting the anonymous account, it poses a 
serious threat for anyone not aware of the problem.

ftp://somewhere/windows/repair/sam


In conclusion this application is totally open to
complete compromise by default. Vendor was notified
and plans on releasing a fix soon.
