Provided their Palm unit's hotsync data matches one in the Palm Desktop's
database, otherwise the palm desktop will prompt (the prompt appearing, of
course, on the locked desktop) as to whether the new device is a replacement
for an existing profile's device, or is a new device requiring a new user
profile. To retrieve any useful data from a locked workstation, one would
need either the target user's PDA or be able to forge the hotsync ID. (I
suspect the latter to be rather trivial)

I do not know what behavior Palm Desktop will exhibit if the target user's
device was password protected; either the device or the software may prompt
for the password before transferring data, especially data marked as
private. This would, however, be something worthy of testing.

In my experience, admin rights are required:

A. To install the software, and
B. To perform the first sync operation with a given model of device.

Admin rights are not needed to perform subsequent sync operations with the
same device, nor are they generally needed to perform sync operations with a
device that uses the same device driver as a device previously synchronized.
If each user is using the same model of PDA, only the first user to perform
a sync should need admin rights. (If the devices are different, i.e. a Palm
device and a Handspring device, separate drivers may be needed for each, and
a sync should be performed with one device of each type by a user with admin
rights)

Users do, however, need appropriate permissions for the directories where
their Palm data is stored on the hard disk; this is normally in Program
Files, where non-admins typically do not have sufficient rights to perform a
sync. (Each Palm device's profile is stored in a separate directory in the
Palm Desktop's main program folder. To sync a device, each user needs full
control over the directory corresponding to their device's profile. In
addition, new users need permission to create new profile directories)
