1. DESCRIPTION
=================================================

"TUTOS is a tool to manage the the organizational needs of small
groups, teams, departments ...
To do this it provides some web-based tools"

(direct quote from http://www.tutos.org)


2. DETAILS
=================================================

¤ Cross Site Scripting :

Many exploitable bugs was found in Tutos which cause script
execution on client's computer by following a crafted url.

This kind of attack known as "Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability"
is present in many section of the web site, an attacker can input
specially crafted links and/or other malicious scripts.

An attacker can upload a file and execute it on the client's computer.
The browser IE can execute a HTML page without extension.


3. EXPLOITS
=================================================

¤ Cross Site Scripting :

http://[target]/tutos/file/file_select.php?msg=<hostile code>

All url with attribute msg...

The hostile code could be :

[script]alert("Cookie="+document.cookie)[/script]

(open a window with the cookie of the visitor.)

(replace [] by <>)

¤ Upload a file with a malicious script

We can upload via http://[target]/tutos/file/file_new.php?link_id=1065

The path is http://[target]/tutos/repository/[project number]/[file
number]/FILE


4. SOLUTIONS
=================================================

The Problem is solved for all new releases where the given <hostile
code> is strictly interpreted as NON-HTML code by TUTOS. And most
messages are stored in the sessiondata and no longer in URLs (there was
also a problem with too long URLs)

The version that implements this is available via CVS as BRANCH-1-1
How to get CVS is described on <https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8047>


5. WORKAROUND
=================================================

¤ Cross Site Scripting :

Use the function php eregi_replace to filter the input data.
