	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	LPRng
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0136
Date:			Wed Jun  4 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-013-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Quoting from the Red Hat security advisory:
     LPRng is a print spooler.  LPRng includes a program, psbanner,
     that can be used to produce Postscript banner pages to separate
     print jobs.

     A vulnerability has been found in psbanner, which creates a temporary
     file with a known filename in an insecure manner.  An attacker could
     create a symbolic link and cause arbitrary files to be written as
     the 'lp' user.
  
  Our thanks to Karol Lewandowski for discovering this problem.

  We've also changed ownership of the utility programs from lp:lp to
  root:root, which should help mitigate the potential problems in the
  event of future security problems in LPRng.
