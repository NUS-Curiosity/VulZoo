Subject: possible remote buffer overflow in atftpd


Hello,

There is possible remote buffer overflow in atftpd. It has to do with length
of filename which client sends to atftpd server. If you send filename over
~253 bytes, it crashes with segfault. When I attach to process with gdb I
can see it trying to run instruction from EIP 0x41414141. That cant be a
good thing. I've tested this on debian woody. I've creating proof of concept
exploit for it but having few troubles :)

later,
Rick Patel
