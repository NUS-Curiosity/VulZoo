Coming from someone who posts live virus samples to mailing lists, 
considers running strings against unknown binaries that any 3-month 
old virus scanner would tell you what it was anyway is sufficient
"analysis" to be worth posting to an international security mailing 
list and who reposts "personal" Email to mailing lists, such charges 
of "unprofressionalisim" are even too lame to be considered mildly 
amusing.  You ought to get out more.
