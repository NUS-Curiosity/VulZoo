You could do some improvement if you store the collisions
not in a list, but in a new hash table.

In that 2nd hash table you add a salt.

So the attacker must find many sets of data that result not only
in a collistion, but additional result in collisions in the
2nd hash table.

If the salt is some on the spot generated random data,
that should be nearly impossible...

Generating the 2nd hash table only if there at least n collissions
should keep the load on the system low...
