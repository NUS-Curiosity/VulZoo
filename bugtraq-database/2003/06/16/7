search.asp Search Feature XSS Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------
Snitz search feature is vulnerable to XSS which
can aide an attacker in stealing cookies, and thus
compromising the account, as described below

http://path/search.asp?Search=">&lt;script&gt;alert()&lt;/script&gt;



Account Compromise Via Cookie Poisoning
-------------------------------------------
In order to steal another users identity, all an attacker 
needs to know is thier encrypted password. This is not
very hard to obtain using the XSS as described above, or
other methods. Once an attacker has this info, all they
have to do is login to thier normal account to get a valid
session id, close the browser, replace thier username and 
encrypted pass with that of the victim, and return to the 
site where they will be recognized as the victim.



password.asp Password Reset Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------
This is the most serious of the vulns, as it requries no
real effort and leaves the entire snitz forum open to attack.
All an attacker has to do is request a forgotten password, save
the password reset page offline,edit the member id to the desired
member id, and submit the form. The members password will then
be reset to that of the attackers choosing.
