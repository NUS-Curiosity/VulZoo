We like to annouce that DNSDigger is now available 
from our website:
www.ernw.de/download/dnsdigger.zip

DNSDigger is a program to gather as much as 
possible informations from DNS Servers. Two 
different methods are used:

1. DNS Server Query
Query every DNS Server that is responsible for the 
domain, primary and each secondary. Sometimes 
only one DNS Server is misconfigured, but that could 
be enough to get the whole zone file or a provider DNS
is used. Some providers allow zone transfers from 
their DNS Servers.

2. DNS Digging
The idea is to use the same technique as with password 
attacks based on dictionaries to find hostnames hidden 
in the DNS zone.There's a names.txt which contains the 
dictionary. The option HYBRID will append the nummbers 
01 to 99 to each entry in the names.txt to uncover 
additional hostnames.

The tools might be useful for all pen-testers that have to 
gather DNS informations during a pen-test.

I hope you will find it as useful as I do ,-)
cheers
Michael
