NMRC Introduces New "Am I Owned?" Service

Sunday June 8, 3:42 am CT

UNDERGROUND BUNKER, June 8 /PR-BS/ -- Nomad Mobile Research Centre, the
premiere hacking group, is announcing a new service to customers called
"Am I Owned?", which lets a company or organization learn if they have
been compromised, or "owned" to use the vernacular of the computer
underground.

"Online threats to businesses are increasing. Between hackers, corporate
espionage efforts, monitoring, and of course the growing cyber-terrorism
threats, we feel that this threat can only be met by a group such as NMRC,"
said Simple Nomad, NMRC founder and media whore.

Utilizing a newly developed technology called Intercontinental Reactionary
Crossreference, NMRC can proactively monitor for signs of intrusions into
various corporate and government computer systems. Using a unique console
which allows monitoring and logging of various channels of information
coursing through the system, NMRC can monitor thousands of sources of
information around the clock.

This is how the new system works:

 - NMRC members monitor IRC consoles, refered to as "clients", and watch
the detailed and sophisticated security information flowing by on key
channels.
 - The information is typically encoded using various dialects and a
series of advanced encryption techniques (e.g. the letter 'o' is
represented by the number '0'), however NMRC hackers have been trained to
automatically, intuitively, and in real time completely interpret the
encoding.
 - Utilizing a technique known as "idling", multiple IRC channels can be
monitored simultaneously.
 - Upon spotting references to subscribers' systems being compromised, the
subscriber is immediately notified.

NMRC reports that they can access these collection nodes from anywhere,
including client sites. "An entire global network consisting of hundreds
of servers and thousands of 'points of information' are at the fingertips
of NMRC for monitoring," reported Daaihliuh, NMRC's main IRC client coder.

After the initial Phase One of "Am I Owned?" is rolled out, additional
monitoring modules are expected to be added including an email-based
monitoring system with two parts called "Basic Underground Group Tracking
Response And Query" and "Vector Underground Limitless Network With
Algorithmic Time Check Heuristics", and a web-based monitoring system
called "General Obfuscation Oscillating Grep Like Engine".

"With NMRC members monitoring IRC, we can learn a lot. But once you bring
BUGTRAQ, VULNWATCH, and GOOGLE into the picture, there is no limit to the
value we can bring to a company," said Weasel, a Senior Executive on the
Owned project.

"We feel that in this climate of anti-Americanism by countries abroad, it
is simply un-democratic and completely un-American for an American company
to not be using this service. If you are not using this service, you might
as well lie down and let terrorists walk all over you. The choice is
simple -- you are with America, or against it," stated jrandom, technical
lead for the GOOGLE portion of the Owned project.

"As one of the Canadians represented in NMRC, let me state that it is our
fondest wish to be involved in protecting American culture and way of
life, simply because of the riches it has brought our country. Your
television alone makes it worth it, because any culture that can produce
such quality shows as 'Cop Rock' and 'Manimal' should be preserved at all
costs. Our only greater wish is that you make Canada an official state in
the United States (except for Quebec) and we promise to publicly execute
Celine Dion," spoke an empassioned hellNbak, Canadian IRC project lead.

The "Am I Owned?" monitoring services are expected to start at $72,000 per
month and higher, depending upon the size of the company.

In other NMRC news, the group reports it will be featured at both Black Hat
Briefings USA 2003 and DefCon XI in Las Vegas at the end of July. At DefCon
NMRC will be giving a panel discussion and presentation entitled "Free Your
Mind: The NMRC Info/Warez Panel Presentation", where they will be discussing
new tools, techniques and other items of interest to the hacking community.
Also at DefCon XI, Inertia will be giving a presentation called
"Introducing nmrcOS", going into detail about the new NMRC Linux
distribution. Simple Nomad and Weasel will also be participating in the
"Hacker Court" presentation at Black Hat, and finally Simple Nomad will
be giving a Black Hat talk entitled "Covering Your Tracks" which introduces
some new tools. For more information on these rare Las Vegas presentations,
