It should be noted that the "bugfix" into the "cs-ircd" release was
actually inherited from the bahamut-inet6[1] codebase, from which the
cs-ircd team started its own daemon :).

This little snippet of code demonstrates what I say:

#ifdef USE_SYSLOG

if (level == DEBUG_ERROR)
syslog(LOG_ERR, "%s", debugbuf); /*AZZURRA format string exploit
patch.*/

#endif

The key word is "Azzurra".

Best regards.
