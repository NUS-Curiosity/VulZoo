Multible Vulnerabilites in Aldos Webserver
==========================================

Aldo's Web Server is a super-compact Web service daemon that not only 
let you share easily your files, it also acts as a Advertisment or
site blocker.

Version:
========

1.5 on Windows Platform

Vulnerabilities:
================

1) Physical Path Disclosure

   Connecting to Aweb via Telnet/Netcat, and entering any character will
   lead to an output similar to this:

   	"Oliver_karow||D:\webserverMAI\aweb\"

   whereby oliver_karow is the user which runs the webserver process.
    

2) Directory Traversal

   Connecting to Aweb via Telnet/Netcat, and requesting a file like
   "GET /../../../boot.ini HTTP/1.0" enables an attacker to get access
   to files outside of the webroot folder.
