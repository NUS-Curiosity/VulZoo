Subject: Arbitrary code inclusion in phpShop

A vulnerability has been discovered in the popular E-Commerce package
'phpShop'. The vulnerability's details are available in the attached
advisory, or at http://www.fribble.net/advisories/phpshop_29-04-04.txt

Due to the nature of this vulnerability, I notified the lead programmer
for this package over a week ago, and no reply or patch has yet been
released.

Once again, this unfortunately another PHP package falling victim to
the 'register globals substitution' vulnerability that many other high-
profile packages have had (phpNuke, phpBB, just to name a couple). When
will people learn that replacing one bad configuration error with a (even
worse!) programming one is NOT the way to migrate into new versions of
PHP.
