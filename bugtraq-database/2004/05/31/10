No, the advisory was not fake.  At the time, I didn't
realise that -1 or any negative will not get past
sys_setsockopt().  Without the sanity check in
setsockopt, there would be a bad security issue,
though.  It's still worth upgrading, anyway.  The bug
exists, just not a very big possibility of exploiting.



Thank you for your time.
Shaun.
