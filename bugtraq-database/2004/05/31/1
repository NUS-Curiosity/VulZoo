Being able to do something intentionally doesn't make it safe or 
ethical. You are hiding tracking information from the person using your 
site; in effect and in fact you are lying to your visitor.  As a visitor 
to your site I would not appreciate my browser hiding the real contents 
of information used to track me and or hide the real purpose of a 
benign-looking link. I would want my browser to be my agent, not yours.

Your anecdote rather establishes the vulnerability and points to its 
current use "in the wild."
