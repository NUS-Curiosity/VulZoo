In last year's Usenix security symposium an attack which
looked very much like one in the first paragraph was performed
agains tthe audience (immediate linkloss was the result of the
presenter pressing a button on his laptop).

This was with with plain COTS components, so what is different
with this attack or is it the same attack rediscovered?
I don't remember it getting any press.
