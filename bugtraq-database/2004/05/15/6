Subject: LHA buffer overflow (not the last one already fixed)

it seems that lha is quite poorly written. after your last advisory, i
decided to take a look at the code and found 2 BO in function extract_one
(file lhext.c):
        if (extract_directory)
                sprintf(name, "%s/%s", extract_directory, q);
        else
                strcpy(name, q);

i bet there is more...
