Subject: Exploit codes for CVS Vulnerability and snort rules from ISC




hello,

as you know two exploits were released for the CVS vulnerability discovered by S.Esser

http://www.k-otik.com/exploits/05212004.CVS_Solaris.c.php
http://www.k-otik.com/exploits/05212004.CVS_Linux.c.php

the ISC Handlers George Bakos and Mike Poor put together some simple and very good snort rules to detect these cvs exploits ...take a look at ISC.
