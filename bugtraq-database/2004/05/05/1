Usually I would agree, but as you mention below in your post security 
and AV companies have come a long way in detecting worms faster since 
the days of code red. The time between when a worm is released and when 
it goes "in the wild" is called seeding time. In many occasions a worm's 
success is pre-determined by how well (or not so well) the VX-er seeded 
the worm in the first few hours to days.

I agree, we do not have enough data to determine if worms are being 
released faster as a trend, but it sure appears that they do. We do get 
a lot more worms nowadays though, so things even out. I think things are 
going faster now but I don't believe a full research was done on this 
particular issue before (I am probably wrong).

I agree 100%, but that is not a good enough reason to reply, so -
This started from the issue of the usefulness of an historical 
perspective.. so.. let us get factual.

Network worms are nothing new and in fact "original-named" worms were 
network worms (rather than email). However, although honey pots and 
honey nets were always in use, until around the time of code red they 
weren't the main tool the AV industry used for finding new threats. The 
threats invented the means, and in this case it was just re-enforcing 
the use of honey pots.

I believe there are a couple of articles about this by Costin Raiu on 
the web which may be interesting to demonstrate AV-used honey pots.

Well, I agree that in the end it doesn't matter much exactly how long it 
takes for the worm to show up. But let us get back to the fact that a 
worm nearly always does - knowing that and being prepared is what 
matters and I do believe that is the point you were trying to make, so 
although I agree exact timing is not that important, I don't really see 
why the timelines do not matter?
