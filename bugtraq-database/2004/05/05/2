1. Problem Description

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
	has assigned the following names to these issues.

	CAN-2003-0192: Apache 2 before 2.0.47, and certain versions
	of mod_ssl for Apache 1.3, do not properly handle "certain
	sequences of per-directory re-negotiations and the
	SSLCipherSuite directive being used to upgrade from a weak
	cipher suite to a strong one," which could cause Apache
	to use the weak cipher suite. 

	CAN-2003-0542: Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in 
	mod_alias and mod_rewrite for Apache before 1.3.29 may allow 
	attackers to create configuration files to cause a denial of 
	service or execute arbitrary code via a regular expression
	with more than 9 captures.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Binaries
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
