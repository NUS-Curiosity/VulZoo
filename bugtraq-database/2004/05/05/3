You are absolutely correct. Moreover, the timeline does not take into
account when the vulnerability was "found" (vs. disclosed) which is
imposible to know.

I agree with your overall appreciation. However, since Klez/Code Red
you can see that the "time to detect a worm since the vulnerability
was published" has reduced from months (sometimes even close to a
year) to less than a month. Even though the data might not be
accurate
to the day (if detection was weeks off) it still shows a trend.
[BTW, If anyone wants the full data, please speak up, no black magic
here, it's gathered from public sources]

I partly agree with your statement here. However, knowing that
current
worms are very vicious is as important as trying to see a trend
there.
Specially if that trend can raise threat awareness, and might people
make a difference selection between, for example, choosing an
inappropiate (IMHO) security measure like "keep your antivirus
up-to-date" instead of better security measure like "harden your
systems, ask for and purchase a hardened/secure OS/application and
demand proactive security of your vendor (or else)".

The first one is not going to save the day when worms start being
releasing hours after a vulnerability is disclosed (or even before
that). As Caida's data shows, current worm propagation methods assure
that most of the vulnerable (and exposed) population is infected in a
very short amount of time (less than a day?). The second one will
probably do.

Still, the worst threat will still be users themselves in insecure OS
that allow them help somebody fully compromise their system when
double clicking something :-)
