NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: WildTangent Web Driver Long FileName Stack Overflow
Systems Affected: WildTangent Web Driver 4.0 (earlier versions not tested)
Severity: High
Vendor URL: http://www.wildtangent.com
Author: Peter Winter-Smith [ peter@...software.com ]
Date Vendor Notified:    31th March 2004
Date of Public Advisory: 27th May 2004
Advisory number: #NISR27052004
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/wildtangent.txt


Description
***********

WildTangent provide high quality interactive media technology to the
Internet in the form of their WebDriver. This is used by some of the
largest companies and corporations world-wide to provide advanced media
content to over 80 million users of their Internet plug-in.


Details
*******

It is possible to cause a number of buffer overruns within the WildTangent
package, namely within the WTHoster and WebDriver modules, via any method
which takes a filename as an parameter. During the process of constructing
an absolute path for this file, a concatenation of a predefined directory
path and the filename supplied as a parameter occurs through an unchecked
call to strcat(). This can easily be made to overflow the buffer and can
allow arbitrary remote code execution on the target system.

A working exploit has been created and tested against a vulnerable system,
and as such it is highly recommended that users of the WildTangent plug-in
install the updated version immediately.


Fix Information
