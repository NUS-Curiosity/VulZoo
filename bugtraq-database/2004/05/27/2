Synopsis
========

Several security vulnerabilites have been fixed in the latest release
of Apache 1.3.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/apache       < 1.3.31                           >= 1.3.31

Description
===========

On 64-bit big-endian platforms, mod_access does not properly parse
Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a netmask which could
result in failure to match certain IP addresses.

Terminal escape sequences are not filtered from error logs. This could
be used by an attacker to insert escape sequences into a terminal
emulater vulnerable to escape sequences.

mod_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by
using a AuthNonce secret. This could permit an attacker to replay the
response of another website. This does not affect mod_auth_digest.

On certain platforms there is a starvation issue where listening
sockets fails to handle short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed
listening socket. This causes the child to hold the accept mutex and
block out new connections until another connection arrives on the same
rarely-accessed listening socket thus leading to a denial of service.

Impact
======

These vulnerabilities could lead to attackers bypassing intended access
restrictions, denial of service, and possibly execution of arbitrary
code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version of Apache 1.3.

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-www/apache-1.3.31"
    # emerge ">=net-www/apache-1.3.31"
