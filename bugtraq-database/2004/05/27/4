1. Description:
----------------

Vendor's description:

"MiniShare is meant to serve anyone who has the need to share files
to anyone, doesn't have a place to store the files on the web,
and does not want or simply does not have the skill and possibility
to set up and maintain a complete HTTP-server software such as Apache.
The application is meant to be as easy to use as any common software
most users use daily. However, this doesn't mean experienced users
can't find it useful."

2. The bug:
------------

The program is unable to manage some user's requests.
In fact it waits at the end of each request at least two newlines.
So if you send to the webserver a GET or an HEAD request with no or
at most one newline, the webserver will crash.

-------------
3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerability send to the webserver a request like:

GET: 

1. GET /something HTTP/1.1
-
2. GET /something HTTP/1.1\n
-


HEAD:

1. HEAD /something HTTP/1.1
-
2. HEAD /something HTTP/1.1\n
-


and the webserver will crash.

4. The fix:
------------

Vendor was contacted.
Bug will be fixed in the next version.
