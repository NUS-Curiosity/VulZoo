- ------------------------
Samba is an Open Source/Free Software suite that provides seamless file and 
print services to SMB/CIFS clients. Samba is freely available under the GNU 
General Public License.

- -> Problem description:
- ------------------------
Included with the immensely popular Samba Package, there is a small script 
called 'smbprint', which is quite widely used to print documents over shares. 
There are many versions of the script floating about - older versions of the 
script are more vulnerable than the smbprint script included with the latest 
release of Samba (3.0.2a). Attacker's can write to arbitrary files, and in 
theory, elevate privileges.
