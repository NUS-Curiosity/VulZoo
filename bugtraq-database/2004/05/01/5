But that is *exactly* what is meant by "separation" of R and X.

I have no idea what you mean by it not being "sensible". Most every CPU 
I have ever seen does this except the x86. Someone apparently thought 
there was no value in separate R and X bits for the i386 back in the 
mid-80s. It was a false economy :)
