Almost any compromise is conducted in this manner. I can't think of any
single compromise that didn't start at one point and then turn into a romp
through more vulnerable resources. Dig around for horror stories of IP
capable printers configured with default gateways and default admin
passwords. Another example would be the use of worm style backdoor
infections used as launchpads for more nefarious hilarity.

Go, go, gadget google.
