Synopsis
========

There is a format string flaw in Pound, allowing remote execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the Pound process.

Background
==========

Pound is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end. It allows
to distribute the load on several web servers and offers a SSL wrapper
for web servers that do not support SSL directly.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/pound        <= 1.5                                >= 1.6

Description
===========

A format string flaw in the processing of syslog messages was
discovered and corrected in Pound.

Impact
======

This flaw may allow remote execution of arbitrary code with the rights
of the Pound daemon process. By default, Gentoo uses the "nobody" user
to run the Pound daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to
upgrade to the latest available version of Pound.

Resolution
==========

All users of Pound should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-www/pound-1.6"
    # emerge ">=net-www/pound-1.6"
