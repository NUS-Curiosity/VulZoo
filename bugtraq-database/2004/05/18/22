Subject: WebCT: XSS vulnerability


Vendor : WEBCT
URL : http://webct.com/

Risk : Cross site scripting

Cross site scripting: The filtering script for the discussion board doesnt 
filter iframe,

img, or object. All of which can take advantage of xss and because of the 
way my schoo was

setup this lead to full access to their email, and account information.

Solution: The easiest way would be to just disallow iframe,img,and object 
tags or html tags

at all.

Credits: Credits goto http://hackthissite.org. It provided a nice, open, 
legal environment

for me to try new things and learn from those who know. A place where you 
are not

reprimanded even if u deface a page or two. A place where I started with no 
knowledge and

in less than a year found new vulnerabilities of my own. Thank you 
http://hackthissite.org.

Lab rats: The Nick's, Shrinidhi, Charbel and most importantly to Halley, you 
give me the

strength and courage to do all that I do, without you I am nothing. Thank 
you sweetheart.

Exploit: This is exploited using iframe,img, or object tags to redirect you 
to a maliscious

site.
