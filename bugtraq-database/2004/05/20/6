Subject: Question About Ethics and Full Disclosure



I have sat on 2 vulnerabilities for a shopping cart for over a year and
nothing has changed.  Now I have found a 3rd with new services added to this
shopping cart. 

I have emailed support several times but NEVER get a response.
As a security professional and not to be Unethical what would be a
recommended path to follow?
	
* Notify their customers (several 100)
* Notify the Payment Gateways they are Authorized to use 
(VeriSign, PayPal, Authorize.NET)
* Be a total A** and just release it to all the mailing lists and at DEFCON

BTW...I have sent several emails to various parts of VeriSign and NOBODY has
responded as to the proper person to notify within the organization about
this. I chose VeriSign because this cart is at the Top of Their List!

IF anyone knows who to contact from VeriSign, authorize.net and PayPal about
this please email me directly.

Thanks,

Tom Ryan
