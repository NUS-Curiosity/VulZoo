Is it ethical to not let these customers know that you have an
open door into their systems?

Is it ethical to not let them know that someone else may have the
same open door into their systems?

You can land in hot water if you email the customers directly. Customer
lists are generally considered proprietary information. 

You can let the customers know through posting to full disclosure
lists.

Post the time details and the contact details.

I don't see how you possibly could have sat on this for a year in
good conscience.

You seem to be going beyond what your role should be in this. 

That can give you legal problems if you are not careful.
