Synopsis
========

There is a vulnerability in the Subversion date parsing code which may
lead to denial of service attacks, or execution of arbitrary code.
Both the client and server are vulnerable.

Background
==========

Subversion is a version control system intended to eventually replace
CVS. Like CVS, it has an optional client-server architecture (where the
server can be an Apache server running mod_svn, or an ssh program as in
CVS's :ext: method). In addition to supporting the features found in
CVS, Subversion also provides support for moving and copying files and
directories.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/subversion       <= 1.0.2                       >= 1.0.3

Description
===========

All releases of Subversion prior to 1.0.3 have a vulnerability in the
date-parsing code. This vulnerability may allow denial of service or
arbitrary code execution as the Subversion user. Both the client and
server are vulnerable, and write access is NOT required to the server's
repository.

Impact
======

All servers and clients are vulnerable. Specifically, clients that
allow other users to write to administrative files in a working copy
may be exploited. Additionally all servers (whether they are httpd/DAV
or svnserve) are vulnerable. Write access to the server is not
required; public read-only Subversion servers are also exploitable.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

Resolution
==========

All Subversion users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-util/subversion-1.0.3"
    # emerge ">=dev-util/subversion-1.0.3"
