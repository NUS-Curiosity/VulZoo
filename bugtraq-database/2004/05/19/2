Unethical intruders don't always require "privilege escalation", executing code on another system is enough, depending on the goal.

Networks where say developers are sharing source tree's and the like, placing a hostile piece of code in the central store will allow remote code execution on the developer nodes.

Other registers other than EIP can be written, depending on the version, however we need not rely on EIP to allow for a buffer overflow exploit, we don't "need" to overwrite any register in fact to execute code, only to cause a buffer overflow  >;]
