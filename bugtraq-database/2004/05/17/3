Subject: Re[2]: Denial of Service Vulnerability in IEEE 802.11 Wireless Devices




I wasn't there, but I know the Deauth Flood attack [1] is a very effective
attack that most 802.11b networks are vulnerable to.  In security
testing, it is trivial to use a Prism2 based card with the HostAP
drivers and flip your wireless NIC into an AP, spoof the BSSID of the AP
station, and flood the wireless clients with deauth frames -
legitimate traffic never passes as a result.  Reyk Floeter's Void11 Penetration testing tools
implement this attack [2].

I saw this attack mentioned in at least one book, but I don't know why
it wasn't released as a vulnerability.  It is similar to the released
vulnerability, but involves spoofed frames instead of the physical layer.
