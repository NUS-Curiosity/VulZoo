Cross site scripting: The filtering script for the discussion board doesnt 
filter iframe, img, or object. All of which can take advantage of xss and 
because of the way my schoo was setup this lead to full access to their 
email, and account information.

Solution: The easiest way would be to just disallow iframe,img,and object 
tags or html tags at all.

Credits: Credits goto http://hackthissite.org. It provided a nice, open, 
legal environment for me to try new things and learn from those who know. A 
place where you are not reprimanded even if u deface a page or two. A place 
where I started with no knowledge and in less than a year found new 
vulnerabilities of my own. Thank you http://hackthissite.org. Lab rats: The 
Nick's, Shrinidhi, Charbel and most importantly to Halley, you give me the 
strength and courage to do all that I do, without you I am nothing. Thank 
you sweetheart.

Exploit: This is exploited using iframe,img, or object tags to redirect you 
to a maliscious site.
