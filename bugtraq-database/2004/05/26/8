Subject: [Full-Disclosure] iDEFENSE Security Advisory 05.26.04: 3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812
 ADSL Router Telnet Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability


iDEFENSE Security Advisory 05.26.04
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=105&type=vulnerabilities
May 26, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

The 3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router is a standalone
bridge/router, with interfaces to a Local Area Network and an ADSL
interface to a Wide Area Network.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow in firmware release 1.1.9.4 of
3Com's OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router could allow a denial of
service.

By sending a specially formed long string to the telnet port of a
vulnerable device containing Telnet escape sequences, it is possible to
get it to either reboot or stop handling packets. If the device does not
reboot spontaneously, it will require a manual reboot before continuing
normal operation.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to stop the device from
responding thereby preventing legitimate users from accessing the
internet.

More information about the 3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router is
available at
http://www.3com.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?tab=support&pathtype=suppo
rt&sku=3CP4144.

IV. DETECTION

3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router with the last firmware patch
available has been confirmed vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUNDS

A previously given workaround for other issues with the http interface
is available at the link shown. This shows how to configure the router
to prevent external access to the http port. By changing occurences of
port 80 into port 23, this method should also work for the telnet port.
