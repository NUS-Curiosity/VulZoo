Synopsis
========

SquirrelMail is subject to several XSS and one SQL injection
vulnerability.

Background
==========

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP and
SMTP, and can optionally be installed with SQL support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/squirrelmail       <= 1.4.2                 >= 1.4.3_rc1

Description
===========

Several unspecified cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and a
well hidden SQL injection vulnerability were found. An XSS attack
allows an attacker to insert malicious code into a web-based
application. SquirrelMail does not check for code when parsing
variables received via the URL query string.

Impact
======

One of the XSS vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker to
steal cookie-based authentication credentials from the user's browser.
The SQL injection issue could potentially be used by an attacker to run
arbitrary SQL commands inside the SquirrelMail database with privileges
of the SquirrelMail database user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to
upgrade to version 1.4.3_rc1 or higher of SquirrelMail.

Resolution
==========

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/squirrelmail-1.4.3_rc1"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/squirrelmail-1.4.3_rc1"
