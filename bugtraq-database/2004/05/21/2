Try calling the sales department for the shopping cart vendor.  Tell
them you hard about the 2 vulnerabilities, thll them that when they are
fixed, you might perhaps buy their product...  Sales motivates
development... Or at the least might get you to a person at the vendor
who cares.

I have sat on 2 vulnerabilities for a shopping cart for over a year and
nothing has changed.  Now I have found a 3rd with new services added to
this shopping cart. 

I have emailed support several times but NEVER get a response.
As a security professional and not to be Unethical what would be a
recommended path to follow?
	
* Notify their customers (several 100)
* Notify the Payment Gateways they are Authorized to use (VeriSign,
PayPal, Authorize.NET)
* Be a total A** and just release it to all the mailing lists and at
DEFCON

BTW...I have sent several emails to various parts of VeriSign and NOBODY
has responded as to the proper person to notify within the organization
about this. I chose VeriSign because this cart is at the Top of Their
List!

IF anyone knows who to contact from VeriSign, authorize.net and PayPal
about this please email me directly.

Thanks,

Tom Ryan
