1. Isoqlog

Isoqlog is an MTA log analysis program written in C. It designed 
to scan qmail, postfix, sendmail and exim logfile and produce 
usage statistics in HTML format for viewing through a browser.

Total mails and bytes; it keeps your main domain mail statistics 
with regard to Days Top Domain, Top Users values for per day, 
per month and years. 



2. Problem Description
   There are several stack and heap overflows in several routines in
   Parser.c, loadconfig.c, LandCfg.c, Dir.c and Html.c files.


   2.1 Parser.c
	There are several remote buffer overflows in parseQmailFromBytesLine,
	parseQmailToRemoteLine, parseQmailToLocalLine, parseSendmailFromBytesLine,
	parseSendmailToLine, parseEximFromBytesLine, parseEximToLine functions.

	There are several local buffer overflows in lowercase and check_syslog_date
	functions.

   2.2 loadconfig.c
	loadconfig and removespaces function has some code which result in
        buffer overflows.

   2.3 LangCfg.c
	loadLang function has some code which result in buffer overflows.

   2.4 Html.c has some functions which doesn't do bounds checking.


   2.5 Dir.c has some code which result in local buffer overflows.


3. Solution

Package		 	: spamguard

			  port/package.
Vulnerability type	: both local and remote


1. spamguard
spamGuard scans your MTA log files within fixed intervals, which 
can be defined by yourself, say 10 minutes, and if an expression
" from " is matched more than a predefined value, which is of 
course can be cofigured by yourself, spamGuard adds the mail 
address to $BADMAILER file. Therefore any further mails by this 
user will be rejected by your MTA.


2. Problem Description
   There are several stack and heap overflows in several routines in
   parser.c, functions.c loadconfig.c, files.


   2.1 parser.c
	There are several remote buffer overflows in qmail_parseline
        and sendmail_parseline functions.

   2.2 loadconfig.c
	loadconfig and removespaces function has some code which result in
        buffer overflows.

3. Solution
   Those who are using spamguard 1.6 and spamguard-devel before May 16, 2004
   should download and install spamguard 1.7-BETA.

   Package source can be downloaded from
	
	http://www.enderunix.org/spamguard/spamguard-1.7-BETA.tar.gz

    new work which obsiously requires much more knowledge, talent and brain!".

   This part is dedicated to those newbie lamers vomitting idiotic exploits which 
   need to be run as root to get root ;).

   Turkish people, especially kidz @ core.gen.tr and karatakke.org should read
