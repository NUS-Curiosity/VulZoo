I strongly disagree with this principle.  Automount points (at least on
Solaris) are supposed to be transparent to the user; just an
implementation optimization over having them permanently mounted.

Linux automounters work differently.  I've never quite understood the
various implementations, but the ones that use symlinks in the
implementation are quite horrible, since the symlinks leak out and
affect user programs.  Solaris' automounter is really quite
unobtrusive, except for programs like `find' that check the dev and
inode for constancy.
