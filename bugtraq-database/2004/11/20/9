CAN-2004-0942 (under review)

Description
Apache webserver 2.0.52 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (CPU consumption) via an HTTP GET request with a MIME
header containing multiple lines with a large number of space characters.


Perhaps you meant CAN-2003-0264:

Multiple buffer overflows in SLMail 5.1.0.4420 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via (1) a long EHLO argument to slmail.exe, (2) a
long XTRN argument to slmail.exe, (3) a long string to POPPASSWD, or (4) a
long password to the POP3 server.

Or is this a new/different issue?
