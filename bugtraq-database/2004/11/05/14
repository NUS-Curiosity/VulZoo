This is a different vulnerability than the one referenced to with CA-2002-12.
This new vulnerability has been assigned CAN-2004-1006 in order to provide
a unique identifier to this vulnerability.  This vulnerability is only
present in version 2.x of dhcp.

The data for this id should become visible during the next days:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1006
