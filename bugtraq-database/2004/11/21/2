I disagree.  Until the research is credible and vetted, investigating is 
premature.  Many people don't seem to understand, investigating supposed 
discrepancies in the vote costs millions of dollars.  The recount in Ohio 
will cost the state $1.5 million.  That's money that could pay for other 
things.  So you don't run off on wild goose chases just because some 
"researcher" says, "Oooooo, look at this.  This looks really unusual."

*If* the research is credible and stands up to scrutiny, *then* you spend 
whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of it and determine if there is 
a problem.  In this particular case, their "research" is laughable and 
doesn't merit followup, much less the expenditure of millions to get to the 
bottom of a nonexistent problem.
