Subject: Address Bar Spoofing on Double Byte Character Set Locale Vulnerability
 (CAN-2004-0844) Patched in MS04-038


Overview
========
On "Double Byte Character Set Locale" systems(Chinese, Japanese, etc), 
there exists a spoofing vulnerability within Microsoft Internet Explorer 
that enables attackers to fake the Address field.

Exploit
=======
http://umbrella.name/originalvuln/msie/DieSlowlyThisTime/DieSlowlyThisTime.html

Patch
=====
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-038.mspx

Details
=======
The research started when I found:
Input %fe@...rella.name in the address field and press ENTER: MSIE will 
go to the homepage of Umbrella.name, but the address field will display 
"http://@...rella.nam/e". After playing this for several times, I made 
the exploit mentioned above.

I still do not know the mechanism behind this bug.

It may be helpful to read the official description of this issue from 
Microsoft TechNet
-----QUOTE-START-----
Aspoofing vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer's processing of URLs 
on Double Byte Character Set systems. This vulnerability could result in 
an incorrect URL being listed in the Address bar that is not the actual 
Web page that is displayed by Internet Explorer.
