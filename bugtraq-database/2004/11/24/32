 	Ok, so the sequence in find is currently (in pseudo-perl):
-----------
$old = stat $dir;
chdir $dir;
$new = stat $dir;
wd_sanity_check($old, $new);
-----------

 	If your information is correct, then what we need to do is 
something like:
-----------
$tmp = $dir . '.';
$old = stat $tmp;
chdir $dir;
$new = stat $tmp;
wd_sanity_check($old, $new);
-----------

 	Would that do it, or am I missing something?

 	Assuming that accessing /mount/SUBDIR/. also triggers a mount on 
the other OSs, the example above should work on everything.  If it 
doesn't, we might have to do two stats the first time, one on $dir and 
then one on $tmp.
