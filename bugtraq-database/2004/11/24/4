This is what I've been able to determine through observation of
automounted directories on Solaris 8.

For the sake of example let's say that /mount is the root directory
for an automounter map.  /mount/<subdir> are the individual mount
points within the automounter map.

  * / has device no. R

  * /mount has device number X (where X != R).  X doesn't seem to
    change.

  * /mount/SUBDIR has device number X when not mounted (same device
    number as /mount)

  * /mount/SUBDIR has device number Y when mounted (where Y != X)

  * Unlike some automounter implementations, the directory
    /mount/SUBDIR will not disappear when /mount/SUBDIR becomes
    unmounted.  Nor will it disappear when the automounter exits.
    /mount/SUBDIR is created when the automounter starts.

  * If /mount/SUBDIR is not mounted, accessing /mount/SUBDIR does not
    trigger a mount.

  * If /mount/SUBDIR is not mounted, accessing /mount/SUBDIR/. does
    trigger a mount.


With other automounter implementations (Fedora core 1 & 2, Mac OSX
10.3), a mount will be triggered merely by accessing /mount/SUBDIR (as
opposed to /mount/SUBDIR/.).  These cases don't pose a problem -- as
far as find is concerned, it sees the device number after the mount
has occurred.
