Hence the security@...illa.org address.

If you are anxious to get the bug fixed you have the option of filling 
out the form and thereby making yourself available for further 
questions, getting email with bug updates and the ability to submit 
coredumps and whatnot.

If you're not so anxious you can simply send in an email and be content 
with having let them know about it. Firefox still has the benefit of 
running on a multitude of platforms and architectures. Someone trying to 
exploit a vulnerability in it (as opposed to just crashing it) would 
have to know both to be successful.

Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that the mozilla coders want people 
to use the forum so they don't promote the security@...illa.org mail 
address enough?
