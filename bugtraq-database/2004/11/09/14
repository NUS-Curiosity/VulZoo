Symantec is aware of this posting. Symantec engineers are reviewing the issue.  If it is validated we will respond accordingly.  

According to HexView's advisory, Symantec was notified 2004-11-03 and did not respond prior to HexView's posting.  
However, HexView's initial notification to Symantec was received late afternoon on 2004-11-03 and Symantec's initial response acknowledgement and offer of coordination in reviewing and reporting if found to be valid went back to HexView the following morning, 2004-11-04, well within the 24 hour window that is published in their stated disclosure policy.  No further communications of any nature have been received from HexView concerning this issue.

Symantec takes the security of our products seriously and is a responsible disclosure organization.  We would like to work directly with anyone who believes they have found a security issue in a Symantec product to validate the problem and coordinate a response.  

Please contact secure@...antec.com concerning security issues with Symantec products.
