A few minutes of careful thought and pondering over what security measures
have been deployed and proposed will reveal the following:

1) Invisible effective measures don't do much good, because they don't
sway votes.

2) Highly visible measures, even if ineffective, do "good" because they allow
the projection of a "We're doing something about it" spin.

Now, why do you think "quality" counts as an objective here?  (Consider in
your discussion the chances that the Department of Homeland Security will
*ever* lower the Threat Level to 'green', and under what conditions that would
happen, and what that would mean for the continued employment of the people
responsible for lowering it to green....)
