I am reading between the lines here...

"TSA improperly identified a weapon in a fliers bag.  Instead of taking
responsibility for the accident/misidentification, TSA is blaming it on
the equipment."  Yeah.  What he said.

OK, let's stop here for a moment. Before we get to the digitizing of
pictures,
let's look at something here. According to the story, the man's bag had
the
image of a grenade in it. Yet, he was able to move away from the
screening
area, sit down at a set of seats _with_ his bag, then move away from
there to
the food courts with a friend all without being stopped, watched,
tailed, or
any other security measures taken regarding him. 

During this time, the security forces protecting the airport are
informed of
the potential threat, start their sweeps and find the gentleman in the
food
court. Let me ask a couple questions, having spent many years as a
soldier,
that bother me to the extreme regarding this situation.

- WHY was this man allowed out of the screening area in the first place?


- WHY was there no security force on either side of the mouth of the
opening
out of the security checkpoint? 

- WHY was the security force not immediately alerted to the potential
threat
BEFORE the man left the checkpoint?

- WHY was this man allowed to move to a set of seats _having passed the
security checks_ where this supposed 'ghost image' was seen? 

- WHY was this man then allowed to roam freely _within_ the airport to
the food
court? 

- WHY did the security forces NOT have a monitoring device or similar
human
presence watching this man?


Notice nothing of what I have said touches on the electronic
technologies used
to examine baggage, personnel, or passengers, such as what caused this
apparent
ghost image. This is purely monitoring, notification, response, and
crisis
management that I'm speaking of. We have numerous holes within the
security
protocols at this airport that this man slipped through without even
touching
on the original gist of this thread.

Add on the complaints Jason brought up and we have a much larger
security issue
in this country than most people suspect. Is it cause for panic? Hardly.
Is it
cause for a very serious review and a VERY firm set of response policies
created? Yes, definitely.

Just my 2 cents. :-)
