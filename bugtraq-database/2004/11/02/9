Subject: Safari vulnerable to URL spoofing


Following the discovery by Benjamin Tobias Franz for spoofing URLs in 
IE by using tables within links.

http://www.packetstormsecurity.nl/0410-advisories/msieLink.txt

It is possible to spoof URLs under OS X in the latest Safari browser 
1.2.3 (v125.9) by using the same method.
Ironically, this does not work with Internet Explorer on OS X version 
5.2.3 (5815.1).

Tested on OS X 10.3.5 (build 7M34) with latest software update.
