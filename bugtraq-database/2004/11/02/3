Furthermore, only the connection to the attacker will be affected,
since a separate pppd process handles each ppp connection.  In other
words, an attacker can terminate their own connection, but they can
not affect any other connection, or prevent new connections from being
established.  Given that, I don't think that this is even a DoS
vulnerability.
