The purpose is to test that the operators are catching the images.

Reports are generated at month end on how many false-positives were
discovered.

The problem in this case, is that the operator must not have been
trained to handle the situation properly, since they could have quickly
determined that it was an intentional false-positive, instead of a real
threat.
