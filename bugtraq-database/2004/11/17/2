Package description:
  gd:
  gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
  complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
  other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or
  JPEG file. This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
  where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images
  by most browsers.

  samba:
  Samba provides an SMB server which can be used to provide network
  services to SMB (sometimes called "Lan Manager") clients, including
  various versions of MS Windows, OS/2, and other Linux machines

  sqlgrey:
  SQLgrey is a Postfix grey-listing policy service with auto-white-listing
  written in Perl with SQL database as storage backend.

  sudo:
  Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
  users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
  as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a
  per-command basis.  It is not a replacement for the shell.  Features
  include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a
  per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear
  audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo
  command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers)
  on many different machines.


Problem description:

  gd:
  There has been found serveral overflows in gd.  This can be used to
  execute arbitary code in programs using the gd library.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0941 and CAN-2004-0990 to these issues.


  sqlgrey:
  Matt Linzbach made us aware that the maintainers of SQLgrey have issued
  a new release that fixes an SQL injection bug.


  samba:
  From the Samba advisory:
  Invalid bounds checking in reply to certain trans2 requests 
  could result in a buffer overrun in smbd.  In order to exploit 
  this defect, the attacker must be able to create files with very 
  specific Unicode filenames on the Samba share. 

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0882 to this issue.

  From the Samba advisory:
  A bug in the input validation routines used to match
  filename strings containing wildcard characters may allow
  a user to consume more than normal amounts of CPU cycles
  thus impacting the performance and response of the server.
  In some circumstances the server can become entirely
  unresponsive.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0930 to this issue.


  sudo:
  Bash exported functions and the CDPATH variable are now stripped from 
  the environment passed to the program to be executed.
