If you do not wish to participate, ignore it.  Otherwise, get a clue.
Perhaps not all of the discussion is security-related, but this last post
you ranted about has everything to do with security.  Physical and
Technical security.  While the claims which started the discussion are not
necessarily valid for these lists, e-voting is an extremely relevant topic.
Unless a moderator says otherwise, the discussion seems acceptible.

The counting systems mentioned in the article (where the votes from
different counties are tabulated) have nothing to do with
direct-user-contact.
