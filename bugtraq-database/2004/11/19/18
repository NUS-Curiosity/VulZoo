Summary
=======
SecurityForest.com is a collaboratively edited Forest consisting of Trees
which anyone can contribute to. SecurityForest's trees are specific security
repositories that are categorized for practical reasons. The technologies
currently in use in these repositories are based on Wiki technology and CVS
(Concurrent Versioning System) technology. Depending on the species of the
tree - the suitable technology will be used. SecurityForest.com is a
collection of repositories (trees) for the community - by the community. In
other words - the updating, modifying and improving can be done by anyone in
the community.

The Open Source Idea
====================
The basic idea behind Open Source is very simple: When people can read,
modify and improve a piece of software, the software evolves. People improve
it, people adapt it, people fix bugs. And this can happen at a speed that,
if one is used to the slow pace of conventional development, seems
astonishing.
We at SecurityForest have learned that this rapid evolutionary process
produces better results than the traditional closed model, in which only
very few people improve the Security Repositories and everybody else must
use what these individuals have come across and added. SecurityForest is not
only based on OpenSource software, but itself is opensource meaning the
updating, modifying and improving can be done by anyone in the community.


Tree's in the Forest
====================

ExploitTree
-----------
ExploitTree's ambition is to obtain a categorized collection of ALL
available exploit code and therefore to become the most organized, rich and
up-to-date exploit repository on the internet. The ExploitTree is based on
CVS (Concurrent Versioning System) and therefore allows the user to keep an
up-to-date offline mirror of the repository on their hard drive. When a user
updates their local copy with a new/updated exploit, it is requested that
they update the repository and give back to the community. Furthermore, a
web interface for web browsing is available.

ToolTree
--------
The ToolTree is made up of various Penetration and Security Tools. The
branches are categorized according to the Hacking Defined Methodology and
each tool in the Tree has a description, homepage link, download link and OS
support. Tools are easy to find for a specific situation and so the massive
amount of tools available on the internet used to their full potential.

TutorialTree
------------
The TutorialTree (soon to be EducationTree) is a collection of articles and
tutorials to educate in the different fields of security. Currently in Beta
stage.

LinkTree
--------
The LinkTree is a repository of hyperlinks to useful websites which are
currently categorized into the following:
* Security Sites
* Consulting Companies
* Education Companies
* Miscellaneous


GreenHouse
==========
The greenhouse is an idea that evolved to allow anyone who has an idea to
use the GreenHouse as a framework for it to grow with the help of the
community into one of SecurityForest's trees. The life cycle of a Tree in
the SecurityForest is as follows:
Seed → GreenHouse → Forest
Anyone who has an idea for a tree is welcome to propose it by "Planting a
Seed". Anyone who can back up a Seed with content and maintain it can plant
it in the GreenHouse. once a GreenHouse Tree is mature enough it will made
an official tree and be planted in the forest. Currently, the GreenHouse is
home to PasswordTree which consistes of Default Passwords but is soon to
grow other password branches.


Thanks
======
Many thanks goes out to ports, Physaro, Tal.z, Devicez, Anthrax and all the
other members for their ongoing support in the forest.
