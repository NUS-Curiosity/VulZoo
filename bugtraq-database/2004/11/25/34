I agree, not to mention that that "bugzilla crap" is not really crap.
I find it to be a solid system for the most part. Also, It has been
proven that involving the general public to help out in filing bugs
has been useful  in resolving problems that would otherwise go
unnoticed until script kiddies start abusing them.

Plus bugzilla is not really that hard to use, takes just a few minutes really.
