PATH_MAX is not a limit on the depth of a directory hierarchy; standard 
versions
of UNIX have no such limits. PATH_MAX limits the length of a path 
passed to
the kernel in a single call, but that can be a relative path. Many 
programs
limit the lengths of the path they will deal with to PATH_MAX, but in
general this is only a way of simplifying the problem; you could write 
the program
to use relative paths and ignore PATH_MAX. PATH_MAX is relevant here 
only
because the standard allows you to give up there.
