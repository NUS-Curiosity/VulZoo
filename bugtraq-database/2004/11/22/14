I don't believe in conspiracies.  They require large numbers of people to 
act in concert for extended periods of time.  Given man's overwhelmingly 
selfish and greedy nature, it's impossible to think that every single 
participant in the conspiracy would maintain both their loyalty *and* their 
silence throughout.
