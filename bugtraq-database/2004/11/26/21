Subject: FluxBox crash vulnerability




Name: FluxBox
Homepage: http://www.fluxbox.org

ISSUE:

FluxBox is a popular window manager for X, working under Linux/Unix operating systems. It's based on BlackBox and has 100% theme/style compability.

(Xman is a manual page browser for the X Window Systems.)

DESCRIPTION:

Fluxbox always crashes totally while executing XMAN with long value of 
'-title' parameter. Simple usage example:

$ xman -title `perl -e 'print "X" x 10000 '`

It was tested on 0.9.10 version and some older ones. Probably all are affected.
