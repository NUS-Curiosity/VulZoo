applies to SVGALIB target only which is deprecated and should no longer
be used. Normal binaries (curses, framebuffer, X11 and all others) are
not suid root.

yes, it was, because I were notified about this problem a year ago (see
below).

see the DOC/ChangeLog:

2003-11-13  Petr Stehlik  <pstehlik@...hics.cz>
* log.c: corrected buffer overflow found by Laios Mircea

I think it was found by Debian security team but I might be wrong (it's
more than year ago so I don't remember details).

> Best regards Adam Zabrocki (pi3).

thanks for the analysis. I'll fix the other problem (in the config file
parsing).
