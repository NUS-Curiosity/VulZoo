 	According to the description by Steve Revilak which was sent 
through, if you at this point do:

$tmp = $tmp + '.';

 	...then that will fix the problem.  So instead of statting eg. 
"/usr/local/bin", you'll be statting "/usr/local/bin/." (note the dot in 
the second one).

 	Point C, according to Steve Revilak.
