	Read the whole thing and didn't see any evidence.  Just wild
speculation and baseless conjecture.  Hell, there were countless counties
across the nation in which more people were registered to vote than were
eligible residents, but -- for some reason -- that ain't news.

	Why was this politically-motivated nonsense approved for Bugtraq?
The Democrats lost.  Get over it already.
