That's a good question for your Microsoft sales rep. If you want 
technical details, Immunity has a working and reliable Wins exploit in 
the Vulnerability Sharing Club version of CANVAS. I think there's an 
interesting difference between how the Linux community handled the 
recent kernel bugs, and how Microsoft and other commercial vendors 
handle all bugs.
