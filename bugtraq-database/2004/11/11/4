	On this we are in total agreement.  I would much prefer that we
push Diebold out of the picture and put open source solutions in play.
And I'm certainly open to that possibility as it would afford critical
design review from top to bottom.

	But let's be clear on one thing right now: we've been relying on
technology to do our vote-tallying for decades...long before this one
election.  Making claims of fraud now is disingenuous; particularly since
it's only made when a Democrat loses his bid for the Presidency.
