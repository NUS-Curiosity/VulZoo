Since we're going the whole nine yards here, let's toss in the following 
as well:

1. This will of course give a different reading in the status bar
2. More importantly it will bypass the so-called 'popup blocker' in IE XP 
SP2

It's a hand-made Excel spreadsheet using OWC11 for Office 2003. One might 
suspect that the older versions will function the same.

Perhaps someone with more knowledge can get it to automate:

'foo.ActiveCell.openHyperlink
'foo.Worksheets(1).Hyperlinks(1).Follow

Then you're back in the popup business.
