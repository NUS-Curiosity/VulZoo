====================

there is a statistically significant deviation that correlates to 
particular equipment: this *IS* a technology and security issue *NOT* a 
political issue (although there are certainly political implications).

i've gotten quite a bit of hate mail over this, but if there were 
allegations that the vote was hacked in favor of kerry (hypothetically, 
let's say in a state where kerry's brother were governor) i'm sure there 
would be quite a bit of interest among those who now claim that this is 
irrelevant, off topic, sore losers, etc.

the issue really is bigger than who won or lost... it's about how the game 
is played. as computer security professionals we owe it to ourselves to 
take this sort of allegation very seriously *regardless* of what candidate 
we prefer.
