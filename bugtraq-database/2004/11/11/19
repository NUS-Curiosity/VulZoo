Subject: Re: RE: Norton AntiVirus Script Blocking Exploit -- Symantec's response


Here Symantec, much like Microsoft does very often, prefers to give a silly 
excuse instead of admitting their product needs to be fixed. I agree with 
you in that Script Blocking is supposed to block *any* script-based threats, 
without the need for any signatures. Obviously, that's not the case and 
Symantec won't admit Script Blocking has a hole.
