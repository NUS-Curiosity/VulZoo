Subject: Unofficial Internet Explorer FRAME/IFRAME fix


Hello list,

http://www.cherryware.de/framefix/

This is a program, which patches the FRAME/IFRAME vulnerability 
described on the mailing list SecurityFocus 
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/380175> 
(http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/380175) on Windows 2000 and XP. 
This vulnerability has been public for a rather short time and is 
already being used by MyDoom.AI and MyDoom.AH to spread themselves.

This patch does just-in-time patching. It does not change any system 
files, but rather installs a program that changes the loaded system 
files' code before a HTML page is loaded. Because of this, the patch is 
easily uninstallable.

Any comments appreciated,

Thomas Rogg
