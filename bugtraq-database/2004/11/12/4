>>Look at the difference between exit polling and actual results. 

The election results and exit polls differ, therefore you assume the
election results are wrong? This is really dumb. There are endless
reasons to believe that exit polls are inaccurate. For one thing,
they're self-sampling: they ask you whether you want to participate.

Of all the bad arguments made to claim the election was hacked this is
the easiest to dismiss.
