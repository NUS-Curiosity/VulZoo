That's dangerously subjective.  Rather than putting the weight on the
moderators, how about the posters show some responsibility?  Most posts
are doing it for the publicity -- if it's negative perhaps they'll learn
to be more responsible in the future.

I agree completely.  Let the company release a patch, and release a POC
shortly after so admins can test the fix.

Um, no.  As a system administrator, I would love for these POC posts to
not exist, but if the code is written, I want to see it.  The entire
purpose of bugtraq (in my eyes) is to inform sysadmins of the existence
of exploit codes.  If they're rejected from here, it's not going to stop
their distribution in IRC.  It's just going to give sysadmins a false
sense of security.
