If you make a BT a list that filters out the exploits there will appear a
lot other lists or distributions channels that spread exploits/PoC (no
matter what they are).
The result is: Admins reading BT will think that the BUG just mentioned
is hardly, or not exploitable as they seen no exploit, while the exploit
is distributed among blackhats.

It's been discussed here many, maaaaaany times. We don't see a need to
quote it again.
