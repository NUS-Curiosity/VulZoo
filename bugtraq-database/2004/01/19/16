Richard,

More disturbing is that simply blocking the printing of currencies is
not the right thing.  There are in fact only limits on how close a
currency is allowed to be reproduced.  There is no law or regulation
(at least for the Euro) that prohibits reproducing the bank notes in
general.

For example you are explicitly allowed to reproduce Euro notes if:

 1. it is only reproduced electronically (ie. Website) when the
    resolution is not higher than 72dpi

 2. it is only printed one-sided and it is at most 75% or at least
    125% the size of the original

 3. it is printed double-sided and it is at most 50% or at least
    200% the size of the original

 4. is is printed on something that clearly is not paper and does
    not look and feel like real bank note paper (here it can be a
    100% size reproduction)

 5. some more possibilities...

Thus a wholesale blocking of the printing or editing of currency
images is neither required nor correct and denies legal and fair
use.

Reproducing at least the Euro currency IS LEGAL provided the rules
are followed.
