What am I missing about this worm?  

How many companies allow *.exe attachments @ the perimeter? Then allow 6777
outbound.

I'm speculating that small shops / home users are the largest targets. But
*shouldn't* enterprise 
solutions stop this.


Say that a remote user with no desktop firewall and old defs got infected...
THEN---  the user connects to the core switch..  It's only going to spread 
with the emails collected off the HD right?

Because it doesn't exploit another *wndoze vuln it has an .exe payload...?

This possible worm outbreak warning was received on TH-Research (The 
Trojan Horses Research Mailing List) from Moosoft Development 
(www.moosoft.com) a few hours ago.

AV and AT firms have had a few hours to update their databases.

Info can be found only on Kaspersky's web page, so far:
http://www.viruslist.com/eng/alert.html?id=783050

Let's hope it is stopped before it can do too much damage!

This email comes and an heads-up and FYI so you can take measures to 
stop it.
