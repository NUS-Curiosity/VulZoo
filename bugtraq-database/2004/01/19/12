  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  Several buffer overflows were recently discovered in tcpdump, a program
  used for inspecting network traffic.  By sending specially constructed
  packets across the wire a malicious remote attacker could cause tcpdump
  to crash or potentially run arbitrary code as the user under which
  tcpdump was being run.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the following names to these issues:

    CAN-2004-0057 -- The rawprint function in the ISAKMP decoding
      routines (print-isakmp.c) for tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier allows
      remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
      via malformed ISAKMP packets that cause invalid "len" or "loc"
      values to be used in a loop, a different vulnerability than
      CAN-2003-0989.

    CAN-2003-0989 -- tcpdump before 3.8.1 allows remote attackers to
      cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via certain ISAKMP
      packets, a different vulnerability than CAN-2004-0057.

    CAN-2003-1029 -- The L2TP protocol parser in tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier
      allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop
      and memory consumption) via a packet with invalid data to UDP port
      1701, which causes l2tp_avp_print to use a bad length value when
      calling print_octets.

  Guardian Digital products affected by this issue include:

    EnGarde Secure Community v1.0.1
    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.1

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.
