Subject: RE: HP printers and currency anti-copying measures


>>Are companies being required to include currency anti-copying technology in their
products?  If not, what incentives are being offered to companies to include the
technology on a voluntary basis?

Perhaps they're doing it to protect themselves against any possible accessory claims. I
don't know if there's any law on this point. Perhaps they're expected to take some sort
of precautions against their products being used for counterfeiting.

BTW, note that the registrant name for rulesforuse.org is "EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK".
Nothing sinister I suppose, just interesting.
