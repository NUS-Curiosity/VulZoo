Do us all a favor kids, tell your email admins to configure the MTA to not
send a reject notice UNTIL the source as been verified via reverse lookup. I
am getting 3-4 times the reject notices than I am getting the damn virus
which means I will start dumping rejects to /dev/null so that I don't see
them.

Get the word out.
