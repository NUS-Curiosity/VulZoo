Subject: information and reverse engineering bits of the Mydoom worm


We've released a digest of a few of the messages that passed through 
TH-Research about this new worm.

In it is information about the worm that is not included in the 
different vendors web pages, and requires a higher understanding of 
assembly and reverse engineering.

We release it for the purpose of assisting sysadmins and security 
researchers by making the information available publicly.

You can find the digest at: http://www.math.org.il/newworm-digest1.txt.

As always, this information is released with the agreement of the 
different authors, according to the list's FAQ guidelines.

	Gadi Evron.
