Yes it is alot of naming confustion

Trend is detecting this as the MIMAIL.R
Mcafee As Mydoom
Symantec as Novarg
CA as Shmig

Propogates via SMTP & Kazaa

Also it starts up 63 threads all requesting the index page of 
www.sco.com every 300 milliseconds.

Confirmed - just a name confusion.
This is the same worm.

It seems to possibly be a new mimail variants so Trend probably had the
