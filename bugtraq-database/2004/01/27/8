Subject: New MiMail variant is DDoS'ing SCO.com


MiMail.R, also known as W32/Mydoom@MM (McAfee), Novarg (F-Secure),
W32.Novarg.A@mm (Symantec), Win32.Mydoom.A (CA) and Win32/Shimg (CA), is
a polymorphic variant that collects/spams/forges email addresses using
its own SMTP engine, installs a backdoor (most likely for use by
spammers) and engages in a DDoS attack against SCO.com by routinely
sending 63 HTTP requests. It's send as a ZIP attachment containing an
executable file with the file extension masked by numerous spaces.

McAfee is calling this a High Outbreak worm, which definitely fits the
bill according to the number of samples we are receiving.

Is the SCO.com DDoS an attempt at distraction from the fact that this
virus installs a proxy backdoor?

CA used to have a removal tool at

but it's no longer available.
