Subject: massive outbreak - expect a major network slowdown


This is not the mimail worm from yesterday.

There are four different names from different vendors, so it is possible 
there are four different outbreaks out there.

Whichever the case this outbreak is HUGE.

Largest in a while and it is spreading VERY FAST.

VERY FAST.

Information will be posted as it becomes available.
