Details
=======

Default installations of Microsoft Windows 2000 Server automatically
enable the Workstation service. This vulnerability is not isolated to
Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstation edition.

The Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstation service is vulnerable to buffer
overflows and denial of service (DoS) attacks. This vulnerability can
be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a computer system or to
disrupt normal operation of the server.

The vulnerability has been described in more detail at the following
URL:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-049.asp 

Impact
======

According to Microsoft, an attacker could gain System privileges on an
affected system, or could cause the Workstation service to fail. For a
full list of symptoms and for the most up to date information, please
see Microsoft's Bulletin at the following URL:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-049.asp 

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Affected Cisco IP Telephony Applications: for all versions of Cisco
CallManager and all compatible versions of Cisco IP Interactive Voice
Response (IP IVR), Cisco IP Call Center Express (IPCC Express), Cisco
Personal Assistant (PA), Cisco Emergency Responder (CER), Cisco
Conference Connection (CCC), and Cisco Internet Service Node (ISN).

Customers should apply the win-OS-Upgrade-k9.2000-2-5sr4.exe or later
package located at the following URL: 

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/cmva-3des?psrtdcat20e2

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/bbsm52

Instructions for installing service patches on BBSM can be found at the
following URL: 

http://cco.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/netmgtsw/ps533/products_user_guide_chapter09186a00801da1bc.html

Cisco HotSpot 1.0

For HotSpot1.0, apply Service Pack 1 available at the following URL: 

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/bbsmhs10

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Where Cisco provides the operating system bundled with the product,
Cisco is offering software upgrades free of charge to address these
vulnerabilities for all affected customers. Customers may only install
and expect support for the feature sets they have purchased.

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for assistance with the upgrade,
which should be free of charge.

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
   
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
   
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com
   
Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of
this notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
"security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

If you need assistance with the implementation of the workarounds, or
have questions on the workarounds, please contact the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC).

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
   
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
   
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com
   
See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.

Workarounds
===========

Currently there are no known active worms exploiting this
vulnerability. However, users can protect themselves from the potential
infection by applying access control lists (ACLs).

The Workstation service receives packets on UDP and TCP ports 138, 139
and 445. Restricting traffic to these ports may help mitigate the
spread of any worm that exploits this vulnerability. Restricting
traffic to these ports may also help prevent improper access, DoS, and
other non-worm related exploitation.

Please also reference the Microsoft posting for additional workarounds:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-049.asp 

Customers who have firewalls, or have deployed Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS) and/or Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)
in their network may be able to use these devices to detect attempted
exploitation or protect themselves from exploitation of this
vulnerability. Customers with these products should refer to their
product documentation from their vendor for information on how to
properly configure these devices.

Customers who have Cisco IDS devices installed in their network can
find more information at the following URL: 

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/front.x/csec/csecHome.pl
