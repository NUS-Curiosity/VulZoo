i don't know much at all about windows, but this spam got past my spam
filter and drew my attention. i tested the suspect file in some on-line
virus checkers, and they all reported the file as not being a threat.
looking at the page that the spam requested (hidden after "@" in the link)
i can only think that the file is up to no-good.

the original spam, the page that it requests, and the suspicious "exe"
file:
	http://smasher.suspicious.org/tmp/live-virus.tgz

live-virus.tgz
md5:  42e6edfe1dcbb3e83f3da997014c7858
sha1: 372ef9ce498b3cd23cd7c0c2b404a18f7d1b7771

the TGZ contains:
- -rw-r--r-- atom/atom      1606 Jan 29 00:34 2004 spam
- -rw-r--r-- atom/atom      1941 Jan 29 00:31 2004 gift-with-headers.html
- -rw-r--r-- atom/atom      8704 Jan 28 22:41 2004 updatte.exe

updatte.exe was tested on:
   yahoo-mail
   http://www.kaspersky.com/remoteviruschk.html
   http://www.dials.ru/english/www_av/
   http://www.rav.ro/scan/indexn.php
and they all reported that the file poses no threat. i suspect they're
wrong.
