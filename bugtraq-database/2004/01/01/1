                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           proftpd
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:095-1
 Date:                   December 31st, 2003
 Original Advisory Date: September 26th, 2003
 Affected versions:	 9.1, 9.2
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability was discovered by X-Force Research at ISS in ProFTPD's
 handling of ASCII translation.  An attacker, by downloading a carefully
 crafted file, can remotely exploit this bug to create a root shell.
 
 The ProFTPD team encourages all users to upgrade to version 1.2.7 or
 higher.  The problematic code first appeared in ProFTPD 1.2.7rc1, and
 the provided packages are all patched by the ProFTPD team to protect
 against this vulnerability.
  
Update:

 The previous update had a bug where the new packages would terminate
 with a SIGNAL 11 when the command "NLST -alL" was performed in
 certain cases, such as if the size of the output of the command was
 greater than 1024 bytes.
 
 These updated packages have a fix applied to prevent this crash.
