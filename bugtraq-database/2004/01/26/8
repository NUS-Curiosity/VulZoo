2. The bugs:
-------------

[1] directory traversal bug, the program does't make a good check on
    the user input string ( /../ ) so an attacker is able to see and
    download all the files on the remote system simply using his
    browser.

[2] cross site scripting bug, the program doesn't make a full check
    on the strings sent by the client, in fact the input strings are
    not filtered and they will appear in the returned page.

3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerabilities:


[1]

http://[host]/../PATH/windows/system.ini


[2]

http://[host]/<script>alert("Test")</script>

4. The fix:
------------

Bugs will be fixed in the next version of BremsServer. So go on the
BremsServer's official web site: http://www.herberlin.de/
and check for a new version.
