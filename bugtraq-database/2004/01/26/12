Subject: RE: Self-Executing FOLDERS: Windows XP Explorer Part V


Why don't we call a spade a spade? You renamed an HTML file from "My
Pics.html" to "My Pics.Folder", it's still an HTML file and not a folder.

In fact, except for the changed file extension this is simply just a repeat
of your previous post, "Self-Executing HTML: Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0
Part IV", except that the ".Folder" file extension is new to Windows XP and
makes the file have a folder icon.

When you open any file regardless of extension, Explorer tries to find the
proper application to open the file with. This involves inspecting the first
section of the files content and comparing it to a list of known signatures.
You can read about "MIME Type Detection in Internet Explorer" at

We already know that opening HTML files from the My Computer zone is
equivelant to opening an EXE file, given the executional rights provided by
the zone. The only solution to this is to lock down the My Computer zone
which I have been trying to advocate for some time now and Microsoft has now
promised to do in Service Pack 2 for Windows XP.

Subject: Self-Executing FOLDERS: Windows XP Explorer Part V

The following file is a 'folder' comprising both scripting and an executable
[*.exe].

We inject scripting and an executable into the 'folder' which is designed to
point back to the executable in the 'folder' and execute it. Provided the
'folder' is an html file, Windows XP Explorer will execute it.

Because it is an 'folder' proper, Windows Explorer opens it. The scripting
inside is then parsed and fired. That scripting is pointing back to the same
executable file and because it is a self-executing 'folder',  it executes !

Fully self-contained harmless *.exe.

Windows XP only:

Be aware of 'folders' out there.
