That's pretty much like teaching your kids to never talk to strangers, or
never visit the "bad" part of town. Fact is, most crimes are committed by
people we know. Microsoft is often victimized, mainly because they are so
ubiquitous. Cisco is running a poll right now to see which of the 17
critical patches are most important to users, because they only have the
manpower to fix 10 of them. Should we all stop using Cisco products?

This anti-MS drivel is so tiresome.

That Web site is utterly disingenuous.  Rather than giving low-value
information, how about high-value information that actually protects people:

1) Don't use Windows.
2) Don't use Outlook.

Our company uses neither Windows nor Outlook, and although we do have a
firewall, we do not use anti-virus software.

Of course, the sponsors of the site (Microsoft and a bunch of anti-virus
vendors) can hardly see it as being in their interest to actually create
a secure computing environment.

David.
