this only works in an env whence M$ does not have the power to force all
PC vendors to *have* to include unsafe apps and OS's on their systems
rather then put out alternatives.

except perhaps for the mac OS, which is not available I beleive for the PC
users, there's not really another OS available that has the ease of
use./install/and click and play capabilities that windows tries to
provide, so, few corp env's will go another route for the desktop, as they
are already far too commited in present envestments to consider it.  And
mom and pop will never get printers, cameras, and various other devices
like scanners to work in any other OS's, withouth having their skilled
kids and grandkids devote some time to educate and advise.  But, seems
none of then are willing to offer mom & pop their time, it;s to 'valuable'
to even help them get a bit of protection in place and they are of far
higher value mailing lists of complaints about how imperfect their world
is...

OK, so you're a Ph.D.  Just don't touch anything.
