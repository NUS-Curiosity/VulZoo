Subject: OpenSSL ASN.1 parsing bugs PoC / brute forcer

Hi,

exactly a week ago Mark Lachniet asked on the list(s)
for PoC code for the OpenSSL ASN.1 parsing bugs
( http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt ).
I replied and gave details on how I made my brute
forcer for that but didn't provide a PoC due to
ugly code (and actually.. other reasons too).

Since then, several people have mailed me off-list
for it and I haven't seen any other PoC yet..
so I've now decided to release it anyway :)

Feel free to modify/rip it off/etc.
If you got any positive results or made some
kind of improved version, please let me know.

Have fun,

	Syzop.
