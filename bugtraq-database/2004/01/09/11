Here is were the usefulness of exploit code is demostrated.

The best way to determine if a system is vulnerable to a given vulnerability 
is to actually try to exploit it. If you had a reliable exploit for the bug
you wouldnt care that much about putting a great effort into identifying
the specific codebase and version of the SSL implementation you are
testing.

Writing a good-enough vulnerability check without explotation is sometimes 
as hard or even harder than writing a working exploit.

And while we are at this. Has anybody done any research on the possibility
of stack overflows due to infinite recursion on windows or linux systems?
