I'm not aware of any POC code, but inferring the community is safe
because the patches have been out for a while may not be correct. 
Yesterday, HP revised HPSBUX0310-284   SSRT3622 to include:

Previously it was DOS-only.  

It may just be that HP discovered their 10/1 patch needed more work. 
Or it could be someone has done some more testing and we're going to
see some patch announcements in the next few days.  Given that HP is
not known for excellence in issuing advisories and patches on the
first day a problem is discovered, it seems more reasonable they're
fixing their patch.  But that's just another inference.  

OTOH their action probably stimulated others to re-look their patches
too.  "What does HP know that we don't?"
