Synopsis:          Updated kdepim packages resolve security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:006-01
Issue date:        2004-01-07
Updated on:        2004-01-07
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0988
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated kdepim packages are now available that fix a local buffer overflow
vulnerability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The K Desktop Environment (KDE) is a graphical desktop for the X Window
System. The KDE Personal Information Management (kdepim) suite helps you to
organize your mail, tasks, appointments, and contacts. 

The KDE team found a buffer overflow in the file information reader of
VCF files. An attacker could construct a VCF file so that when it was
opened by a victim it would execute arbitrary commands.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0988 to this issue.

Users of kdepim are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a backported security patch that corrects this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/kdepim-3.1-6.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/kdepim-3.1-6.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/kdepim-devel-3.1-6.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

321f8aba915e8008150a4c9b69b3e161 9/en/os/SRPMS/kdepim-3.1-6.src.rpm
414e36538ebef58c63f9c5e4b299d35f 9/en/os/i386/kdepim-3.1-6.i386.rpm
69e81163e29537f303fc294886ad8103 9/en/os/i386/kdepim-devel-3.1-6.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
