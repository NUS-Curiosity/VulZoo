Subject: The Israeli Post Office Break-in HTML article


The following in the story I composed when I couldn't find an English 
article on it - the Wireless Entry Point hack into the Israeli Post 
Office in Haifa (Israel), amounting to about $13K in losses.

It's not much of an HTML, but it should do.
