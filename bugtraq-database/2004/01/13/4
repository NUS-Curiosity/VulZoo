AFAIK Post Office branches in Israel have 1 to 3 hubs (I think) that manage
the whole branch network.
So the intruder doesn't have to know the whole topology of the PO network.
Getting access to these hubs is a different story, but I still think that
with some social engineering you could get to them.
Hiding a small AP in very messy place is not a problem. 
Post offices are very unorganized and no one really controls what's going on
in there from the aspect of networking. (Although POs branches have CCTV)
By sniffing the branch network they could have gathered CC numbers and
account numbers.
The rest is just stealing the money. Also AFAIK, Western Union is connected
to the same network :).
All the information above is collected from my personal observations and
it's not very reliable.

Good Day,
Evgeny Pinchuk.

I can't resist any longer. I have to ask a few questions.

1. How did they know which switch to connect to? Wouldn't this require some
knowledge of network topology.
2. If it is indeed a switch and not a hub, how did they obtain access to set
this port to monitor traffic?
3. How did they get access to the switch. Shouldn't it have been locked
away.
4. How did they convert electrons to money? Was this by raiding bank
accounts or collecting credit card numbers? 
5. How could they be unable to hide a WAP in a rack (assuming the switch was
in a rack)? I can think of several ways to hide one without it being
visible.

Seems like a bit of an inside job to me, but I'm no Dick Tracy...
