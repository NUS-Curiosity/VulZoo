                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           ethereal
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2004:002
 Date:                   January 13th, 2004

 Affected versions:	 9.1, 9.2
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Two vulnerabilities were discovered in versions of Ethereal prior to
 0.10.0 that can be exploited to make Ethereal crash by injecting
 malformed packets onto the wire or by convincing a user to read a
 malformed packet trace file.  The first vulnerability is in the SMB
 dissector and the second is in the Q.391 dissector.  It is not known
 whether or not these issues could lead to the execution of arbitrary
 code.
 
 The updated packages provide Ethereal 0.10.0 which is not vulnerable
 to these issues.
