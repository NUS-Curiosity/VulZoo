I'm sure that the guys at Sourceforge and Savannah are overjoyed to hear that
attitude.

So tell me - at what point are there enough users to worry?  100K? 10K?  I'm
sure there's over 10K machines running a CVS server - a *lot* of ISPs and
hosting companies use it to track config changes.

Now, for whatever value of N you chose - are you running *any* software that
has less than N users, but *you* would be worried if there was a vulnerability
found in it?
