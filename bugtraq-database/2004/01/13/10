      Dear Citibank Account Holder,



      On January 10th 2004 Citibank had to block some accounts in our system
connected with money laundering, credit card fraud, terrorism and check
fraud activity. The information in regards to those accounts has been passed
to our correspondent banks, local, federal and international authorities.

      Due to our extensive database operations some accounts may have been
changed. We are asking our customers to check their checking and savings
accounts if they are active or if their current balance is correct.

      Citibank notifies all it's customers in cases of high fraud or
criminal activity and asks you to check your account's balances. If you
suspect or have found any fraud activity on your account please let us know
by logging in at the link below.
