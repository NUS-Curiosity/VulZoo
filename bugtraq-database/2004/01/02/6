Subject: Microsoft Word Protection Bypass

Hi all,

Microsoft Word provides an option to protect "forms" by password. This is 
used to ensure that unauthorized users cannot manipulate the contents of 
documents except within specially designed "form" areas. This feature is 
also often used to protect documents which do not even have form areas 
(quotations/offers etc.).

This form protection can easily be removed without any additional tools 
(apart from a hex-editor).

Please find the full advisory attached.

best regards,
/tdk
