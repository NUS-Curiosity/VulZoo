Hi,

Re: http://www.elitehaven.net/switchoff.txt

I neglected to mention the fact that just issuing a regular HTTP GET
request with no other headers seems to cause the application to error
within the module 'msvcrt.dll'. I have not attempted to investigate why
this happens. Such a request may be as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------
GET / HTTP/1.1


--------------------------------------------------------------

How strange ;o)
