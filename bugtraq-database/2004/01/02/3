Subject: Self-Executing HTML: Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0 Part IV




Thursday, January 01, 2004 


The following file is an html file comprising both scripting and 
an executable [*.exe]. 

We inject scripting and an executable into the html file which 
is designed to point back to the executable in the html file and 
execute it. Provided the html file is an html file, Internet 
Explorer 5.5 and 6.0 will execute it. 

Because it is an html file proper, Internet Explorer opens it. 
The scripting inside is then parsed and fired. That scripting is 
pointing  back to the same executable file and because it is a 
self-executing html file, it executes ! 


Fully self-contained harmless *.exe:

Be aware of html files out there.
