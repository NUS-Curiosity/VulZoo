Subject: RE: yet another new phising scam


It is very nice indeed to see the contemporary awareness of Phishing
scams and how they trick everyday Joe users, but it is also important to
highlight that this scam does not exploit the recent 0x01 address
spoofing vulnerability.

The only encoding performed is standard URL encoding and the only
spoofing is in Basic Authentication, which has literally been used for
years by phishers and scammers.

This is the relevant part of the HTML email:

<a href=3D"http://web.da-us.citibank.com%6Csignin%6Ccitifi=
%6Cscripts%6C@...%31%2E%35%32%2E%31%38%33%2E%32%30%37:%32%30%37=
%35/%63/%69%6E%64%65%78%2E%68%74%6D">

The above link decodes to 

http://web.da-us.citibank.comlsigninlcitifilscriptsl@...52.183.207:2075/
c/index.htm

The server is on port 2075 at 61.52.183.203 which seems to be down by
now.

Subject: yet another new phising scam


This phishing scam was first detected (as far as I know) by a friend of 
mine 3 days ago, on the 20th of January.

He sent it to some related security companies, but I haven't seen much 
on it, so I figured it's time to let administrators know exactly what's
up.

This one targets Citibank users.

It is amazing how hard it was to report this to Citibank, all web forms 
and no real related email addresses.

You can find the GIF file (with the exact wording of the scam) at 
http://www.math.org.il/pic.gif (safe to view).

The email headers + test body are attached below.
