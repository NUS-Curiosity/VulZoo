But don't you need root to add extentions?

Again, you need an admin to update apache's config.

I would think apache should have a safe and defined interface
between itself and modules. I cannot possibly think of any file
descriptor besides 0, 1, &2 that a module would need. The logs
should be stderr, the module should open a descriptor itself, or
apache have an API just for that purpose.

Xinetd, stunnel, and sshd can all run completely untrusted
applications without leaking their listening descriptor. Why
can't apache? Its not just mod_perl, mod_php leaks the https
descriptor, too.
