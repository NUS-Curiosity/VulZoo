Subject: [Fwd: [TH-research] Modified Bagle]


Hi, here's an heads-up from Daniel Otis Vigil on TH-Research (The Trojan 
Horses Research Mailing List) about a modified Bagle worm, a lot sooner 
than expected by most experts, but not too surprising.

More information will be posted if it will be determined that this is a 
new outbreak situation.

As always, this message is forwarded under the guidelines as they are 
specified in the TH-Research FAQ.
