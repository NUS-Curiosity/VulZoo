Subject: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Phorum 3.4.5

Phorum 3.4.5 Vulnerabilities

-----------------------------
Credit:
Author:     : Calum Power
Version(s)  : <= 3.4.5
Vendor      : Phorum
Vendor URL  : http://phorum.org

Vendor Contacted: Yes
Vendor Fix: Phorum has released Phorum v3.4.6 as a response to this
advisory. Please patch your vulnerable software ASAP.

Vulnerabilitiy:
Type: Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection
Severity: Moderately Critical

Summary:
Phorum  versions prior to 3.4.6 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and
SQL injection bugs that could allow for the remote compromise of any
server running the affected software.

Details:
VULN #1:
     An XSS vulnerability exists in the script 'common.php' that allows
arbitrary code
     execution on the client-side browser.
     Ironically, this vulnerability is in the 'phorum_check_xss()' function.
     The vulnerable code is below:
         if(!is_array($value) && $key!="body" && $key!="subject" &&
$key!="hide" && stristr($value, "<DEFANGED_script")){
             echo "script detected in $key";
     By sending a HTTP/POST variable to any Phorum script, an attacker
could craft the key of the variable into
     an XSS attack, providing the value of the variable contains the string
"<DEFANGED_script".

     *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

     Severity: Medium - This vulnerability may be exploited to obtain user
login details, spam, or perform social-engineering upon the user.

VULN #2:
     Another XSS vulnerability exists in the script 'profile.php'. This
vulnerability exists via insufficient
     sanitization of the variable 'EditError'. If a user is logged on, an
attacker could use this vulnerability
     to include arbitrary code on the user's browser.
     NOTE: Phorum (common.php) does checks for '<DEFANGED_script>' tags, 
however XSS
attacks are NOT limited to just the
     <DEFANGED_script> tags! An attacker could use many forms of XSS (such as
<DEFANGED_iframe>) to launch attacks upon users.
     *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

     Severity: Medium/Low - This can only be exploited when the user is
logged on, but as such could be used to reset passwords, or change any
other user info without the user knowing.

VULN #3:
     Once again, there is an XSS vulnerability in the script 'login.php'
that may allow attackers to execute
     arbitrary code in the users' browser (Woah, deja moo...)
     This exploit is due to (again) the 'Error' variable not being
sanitized correctly.
     I have created Proof-of-Concept code (using an <DEFANGED_iframe>) that 
allows
for the stealing of user passwords as they are
     submitted into the form.
     *** This vulnerability has been fixed in Phorum 5.0.2alpha. ***

     Severity: High/Critical - Due to the nature of the page, sensitive
form values could be harvested by an attacker.

VULN #4:
     A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the script 'register.php' in
the field 'hide_email'.
     This vulnerability could lead to the execution of SQL commands inside
the script.
     *** This code appears to not exist in Phorum 5.0.2alpha, so is
therefore fixed. ***

     Severity: High - Due to the location in which the SQL injection
variable is placed, it is increasingly hard to exploit this
vulnerability to obtain any sort of privilege escalation.
