Subject: [SST]ServU MDTM command remote buffero verflow adv


Serv-U Ftp Server Long Filename Stack Overflow Vunlnerablity
 
Application:           Serv-U
 
Affected Versions:     All versions prior 4.2 (include 4.1.0.11) 
 
Vendor:                RhinoSoft (http://www.rhinosoft.com 
                       http://www.serv-u.com)
 
URL:                   http://www.0x557.org/release/servu.txt

Vunlnerablity:
 
  An internal memory buffer may be overrun while handling "site chmod" command 
with a filename containg excessive data. This condition may be exploited by 
attackers to ultimately execute instructions with the priviledges of the serv-u
process, typically administator or system.
 
Details:
  
  While exectuing chmod on a nonexistent file, serv-u will call sprintf to
construct response string. And the code is like
  sprintf(dst, "%s: No such file or directory.", filename);
 
  The length of dst buffer is only 256 bytes.If a long filename was sent,
serv-u will crash.
 
  A writable directory is needed to exploit this vulerablity.By overwriting SEH,
we have created proof-of-concept exploit successfully on win2k/xp.
 
Solution:
 
  Upgrade to servu 5.0.
