1. Description:
----------------

Vendor's Description:

"Reptile is a web server made in Python. It supports server side
scripting with "Embedded Python", PHP, and CGI scripts. It has an
integrated HTML/XML validator that checks the pages before publication
and others handy features."

2. The bug:
------------

The program doesn't well manage the user input string.
In fact it waits the HTTP version. So an attacker can consume a lot of
CPU resources, sending crafted strings.



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

-------------
3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerability simply send to the webserver some (about 10)
strings like:

GET index.htm

without specify the HTTP* at the end of the GET request, and where
the requested file must be avaible in the public_html directory.



xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

------------
4. The fix:
------------

No fix.
Reptile Web Server is no more supported.
