Their advisory says that this protection is only to protect against
accidental modification....harumph!  That's not what they used to say;)

Hi all,

Microsoft Word provides an option to protect "forms" by password. This
is 
used to ensure that unauthorized users cannot manipulate the contents of

documents except within specially designed "form" areas. This feature is

also often used to protect documents which do not even have form areas 
(quotations/offers etc.).

This form protection can easily be removed without any additional tools 
(apart from a hex-editor).

Please find the full advisory attached.

best regards,
/tdk
