Subject: another Trojan with the ADO hole? + a twist in the story


The past Trojan horses which spread this way took advantage of the fact 
web servers send an HTML 404 message if a file doesn't exist.

The original sample - britney.jpg - was simply an html file itself, and 
using that fact, and IE loading it. It was combined with one of the 
latest exploits of the time (I don't think MS patched it yet), and 
downloaded the Trojan horses.

This time around there is actually a picture on the web page, of a real 
honest to God girl. But in another frame.. the same story all over again.
