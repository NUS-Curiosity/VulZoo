Actually the Photoshop restriction works pretty well when scanning the 
bills, we ofcourse had to test this as soon as we saw the announcement. 
What was dissapointing was the way it worked, even if we embedded the 
bill in to a bigger image it was still able to spot it from there, we 
didn't ofcourse go as far as we could have with the trickery, but it 
turned out to work pretty well.

What was even more disappointing was that if we used the same scanner 
tools and saved the bill in to a TIFF file and loaded it from there to 
Photoshop, we were able to open and edit the image. Again, we didn't 
want to push our luck and print the bill with a color laser, but it was 
enough to convince us of a good attempt, and a bad implementation.

I do know that the Adobe had to think about the users while creating 
this block, some users might need the ability to load an image of some 
worlds currency and embedd it in to an image, but this leaves a big loop 
hole. If i was a counterfitter, i wouldn't settle for 'hey, you can't 
scan this' and i would look for other means to scan the bill.
