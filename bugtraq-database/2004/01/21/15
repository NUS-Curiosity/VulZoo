My police experience (that is forensics of the captured computers) shows
that PS is not used in the real counterfitting. Instead they use vector
based packages like CorelDraw and create images themselves (sometimes
starting from a scaned image, sometimes not). I guess this is world wide
practice and so either people who invent "currency anti-copying measures"
never talk with experts or ignore what they was told :-)
