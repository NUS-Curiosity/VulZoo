Subject: [Fwd: [TH-research] Bagle remote uninstall]


Good morning.
The following forwarded message is from Joe Stewart to TH-Research (The 
Trojan Horses Research Mailing List).
In it Joe explains of a way for admins (or anybody really) to easily and 
massively remove Bagle infections from their networks.
There are other ways to do this, but this is the most simple that I saw 
thus far.

Thanks again to Joe for all his work.
Drop him a thank-you note if this helps you, he's a good guy!

Mail from Joe Stewart <jstewart@...hq.com>

If you can't wait till January 28, Bagle has a remote uninstall command
which can be sent over port 6777, the port also used to upload the
second stage.

For instance, using perl and netcat, you could send the uninstall
command with the one-liner below:
perl -e 'print "\x43\xff\xff\xff\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0412\x00"' \
| nc infected_host_IP 6777

When the command bytes above are received by an infected host, the virus
will exit and delete its executable (using a batch script after the
fact). The registry keys are not removed.

-Joe
