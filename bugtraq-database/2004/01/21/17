Synopsis
========

Identification of Honeyd installations allows an adversary to launch
attacks specifically against Honeyd. No remote root exploit is currently
known.

Background
==========

Honeyd is a virtual honeypot daemon that can simulate virtual hosts on
unallocated IP addresses.

Description
===========

A bug in handling NMAP fingerprints caused Honeyd to reply to TCP
packets with both the SYN and RST flags set. Watching for replies, it is
possible to detect IP addresses simulated by Honeyd.

Impact
======

Although there are no public exploits known for Honeyd, the detection of
Honeyd IP addresses may in some cases be undesirable.

Workaround
==========

Honeyd 0.8 has been released along with an advisory [ 1 ] to address
this issue. In addition, Honeyd 0.8 drops privileges if permitted by the
configuration file and contains command line flags to force dropping of
privileges.

Resolution
==========

Users are encouraged to upgrade to honeyd version 0.8:

~    $> emerge sync
~    $> emerge -pv ">=net-analyzer/honeyd-0.8"
~    $> emerge ">=net-analyzer/honeyd-0.8"
