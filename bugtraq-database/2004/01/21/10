Yup, my apologies for this sort-of-false alert. The only excuse I can
offer is that I failed to find any related information during a routine
run of Google queries, and that the flaw is still very much alive
nowadays.

The problem is ineed known, both the use of ETags and Last-Modified
headers to store data, and the indirect variant I described later on. The
issue had been initially reported by Martin Pool here:

Cheers,
