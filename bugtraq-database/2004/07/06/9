Subject: BENCHMARK() is not the only way to determine successfull MySQL injection


Hello,

As far as the timing attack using BENCHMARK() is concerned, the same effect
can be achieved as follows:

1. Inject GET_LOCK(1, 60);
(this injection will return immediately regardless of success)

2. Inject GET_LOCK(1, 5);
(if successfull, this injection will return in 5 seconds rather than
immediately)

This method provides exact delays independent of CPU speed, does not load
the processor and does not require selecting an appropriate expression to
BENCHMARK().
