SSRT4718 rev.0 HP Tru64 UNIX NTP Integer Overflow

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE:
 There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
 provided that it remains complete and intact. The information
 in this Security bulletin should be acted upon as soon as
possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    02 July 2004


POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    Integer overflow on NTP server that
                              corrupts the NTP Client time/date.

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
                HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    CERT VU#584606

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:


The NTP (Network Time Protocol) package provided with
HP Tru64 UNIX contains an integer overflow. The overflow
may cause clients with clocks set too far in the past to
receive an incorrect date/time offset from the ntp server,
resulting in an incorrect date/time on the client.


SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.

HP Tru64 UNIX V5.1B  (PK4)
HP Tru64 UNIX V5.1B  (PK3)
HP Tru64 UNIX V5.1B  (PK2)
HP Tru64 UNIX V51.A  (PK6)
HP Tru64 UNIX V4.0G  (PK4)
HP Tru64 UNIX V4.0F  (PK8)

BACKGROUND:

RESOLUTION:

Until the corrections are available in  mainstream release
patch kits, HP is releasing the following Early Release Patch
(ERP) kits.

The ERP kits use dupatch to install and will not install over
any installed Customer Specific Patches (CSPs) that have
file intersections with the ERPs.  Contact your service provider
for assistance if the installation of the ERPs is blocked by any
of your installed CSPs.

The fixes contained in the ERP kits are scheduled to be available
in the following mainstream patch kits:

5.1B (PK5)
5.1A (PK7)

ERP kits are available for the versions listed below. The kits
provide NTP V4.1.1 and distribute the following files:

/usr/bin/ntpq
/usr/bin/ntp
/usr/bin/xntpdc
/usr/sbin/ntpdate
/usr/sbin/ntptrace
/usr/sbin/xntpd
