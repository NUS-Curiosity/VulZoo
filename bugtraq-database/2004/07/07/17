That's a common perception, but when we looked at vendor patch
updates, as an indicator of patches that have problems, we didn't see
it.  And really, we looked.  We would have been happy to tweak vendors
for releasing shoddy patches, because bad patches stand out in an
admin's memory, while ok patches cognitively disappear.

Now, it could well be that the problems that cause MS to pull a patch
and replace it are more severe than the ones that cause a Linux vendor
to do so.  We didn't examine that, although I'd love to see someone do
that study.  What we found was that about 1 patch in 6 gets replaced
at some point, and most of that happens in about 30 days or less.
