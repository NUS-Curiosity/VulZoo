Dear Hugo van der Kooij,

It depends on how antiviral check is actually implemented. If connection
is  broken  immediately after signature is detected - there is no way to
download  infected  file,  because signature will not pass to client and
client  will  not  be  able  to  use "Range:" header to resume partially
downloaded  file.

If  antiviral  filter  checks data _after_ all data received from client
with  20%  buffering  yes,  it's possible to bypass this check for HTTP,
because  there  is  no  way  (at least for HTTP/1.0 and FTP) to indicate
error to client and make him to delete partially downloaded data.

You can check it, by sending EICAR with some additional data: if you can
find  EICAR  signature  on  the  client  after  connection  is broken by
antiviral filter you can bypass it's protection.
