Subject: Physical access exploit: Apple iTunes Visualiser disables screen lock


The full-screen Apple iTunes Visualiser currently disables the screen 
lock timer on both Mac & PC.

Synopsis:
This a physical access security concern at present since anybody who 
uses the iTunes Visualiser in full-screen mode is essentially leaving 
their PC unlocked for that duration. Since many people leave the 
Visualiser on in office or POS situations this leads to a computer that 
can easily be accessed as the local user.

Suggested workaround:
Never leave a computer running iTunes Visualiser in full-screen mode 
unattended. Never deploy a computer with iTunes installed in a POS 
situation, and carefully consider the ramifications on the IT Security 
Policy in an office environment.

Recommended action:
Have the default be to lock the screen after the required time elapsed 
(exactly as if the screensaver became enabled) and have a preference to 
disable screen locking if the user wishes. Most users (and IT 
departments) would assume if they had screen locking enabled for their 
screensaver that they would be safe.
