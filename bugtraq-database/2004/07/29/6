1. Problem Description

	CERT Advisory CA-2003-12 

	There is a vulnerability in sendmail that can be exploited 
	to cause a denial-of-service condition and could allow a 
	remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges 
	of the sendmail daemon, typically root.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2003-0161 to this issue.

	CERT Advisory CA-2003-25

	The prescan function in Sendmail 8.12.9 allows remote attackers 
	to execute arbitrary code via buffer overflow attacks, as 
	demonstrated using the parseaddr function in parseaddr.c.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2003-0694 to this issue.
