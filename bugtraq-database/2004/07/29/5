It looks like quite some people check the .cvspass into cvs itself. When
doing a quick check of yesterdays advisory, most hits were from
cvs-viewing utilities.

Maybe they just don't know what .cvspass is for and think "oh, there's a
.cvs in there, I'd better check it in". Of course this doesn't explain
why they move it into the respective directory in the first place, as
it usually resides in $HOME, while CVS sources usually create their own
directory on checkout.

Also note, that for exploitation you do not even need to reverse the
password. You just add the .cvspass entries to your own .cvspass and 
get access.


Kind regards,
