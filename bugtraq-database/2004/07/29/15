!!! VIVA COLOMBIA !!!

1. Systems affected:

All DansGuardian up to and including DansGuardian 2.8.

2. Overview:

DansGuardian (http://dansguardian.org) is a web Open Source content filter
available
for various Unix based operating systems, including Linux. It filters the
actual
content of pages based on many methods including phrase matching, PICS
filtering and
URL filtering.

DansGuardian may allow malicious users to bypass the extension filter
rules when
processing URLs which contain an hex encoded filename (e.g:
http://server/file.%65%78%65 or http://server/file%2eexe).


3. Impact:

Under some installations, this may violate security policy, or allow users to
inadvertantly access malicious web content.


4. Solution:

Upgrade to DansGuardian 2.8.0.1

5. Patch:

--- FOptionContainer.cpp.diff ---
806d805
<     url.hexDecode();
