This won't work on a modern Unix (incl Mac OS X or Linux) or Windows, memory
made available to a process is cleared (usually with zeros, but sometimes
with some magic debug value for reasons that should be obvious to developers) 

Of course sometimes there are bugs, but that's the same with any security
critical behaviour in an operating system. If you find such a bug please
report it to your vendor and here on Bugtraq once you're sure.

Nick.
