Subject: Re: Public Review of OIS Security Vulnerability Reporting and  ResponseGuidelines


Instead of publishing personal opinions over the OIS, its better to
focus on the Guideline again. The Process is based entirely on the vendor
but not on the customers, going against the "efforts to safeguard
customers". Even the participants group doesnt include them as
active part of the process.

Its so vendor oriented that doesnt address the case where they
find  security vulnerabilities on their own products. It should be the
same process, but in this case the vendor is the finder. In reality many
companies doesnt disclosure their own vulnerabilities (and dont create
a fix, just release the next "new" version, leaving the customers
unprotected).

The process assumes that nobody knows about the vulnerability 
discovered by the "finder". If someone discovers a  vulnerabiluity theres
a big chance that someone else has allready discover it in the past and
that has been actively exploited. 

In the end the vendor will protect his comercial interest instead of
protecting the customers.  And becouse is the owner of the process it can
delay, or stop the process at any phase without  producing any results
(fix, advisory etc).
