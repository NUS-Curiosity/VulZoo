I have to disagree with this.  Its not about endangerment.. legit users 
must upgrade their software to avoid risk.  The problem is that 
internet worms eat up bandwidth on the net and slow down servers and 
clients with useless requests.  If we can limit the number of users who 
run antique software, the whole world is a better place. :)

Then we just have to worry about other malicious attacks and script 
kiddies playing.
