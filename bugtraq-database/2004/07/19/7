Hi,

The DNS paper is not at the mentioned URL since it was published in phrack instead, and can be
found at the URL http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=62&a=3

> 
> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
> 
> This paper provides a brief overview of basic Domain Name System (DNS)
> spoofing attacks against DNS client resolvers.  Technical challenges are
> proposed that should help to both identify attempted attacks and prevent
> them from being successful.  Relevant Request for Comments (RFC)
> guidelines, used by programmers to help ensure their DNS resolver code
> meets specifications, are reviewed.  This results in the realisation
> that the RFC guidelines are not adequately specific or forceful to help
> identify or prevent DNS spoofing attacks against DNS client resolvers. 
> Furthermore, the RFC guidelines actually simplify such attacks to a
> level that has not previously been discussed in the public domain until
> now.
> 
> To highlight the consequences of merely conforming to the RFC guidelines
> without considering security ramifications, an example DNS spoofing
> attack against the DNS resolver in Microsoft Windows XP is provided.
> This illustrates serious weaknesses in the Windows XP DNS resolver
> client implementation.  For example, Windows XP will accept a DNS reply
> as being valid without performing a thorough check that the DNS reply
> actually matches the DNS request.  This allows an attacker to create a
> malicious generic DNS reply that only needs to meet a couple of criteria
> with predictable values in order to be accepted as a valid DNS reply by
> the targeted user.
> 
> This paper discusses the practical impact of the issues raised, such as
> the ability to perform a successful and reasonably undetectable DNS
> spoofing attack against a large target base of Windows XP users, without
> the attacker requiring knowledge of the DNS requests issued by the
> targeted users.  Finally, a comparison with the DNS resolver in Debian
> Linux is supplied.
