No need to defend Mozilla. I'm sure there has been plenty of bugs and 
vulnerabilities in Mozilla, it happens to all software, no way around 
it. The issue at with Internet Explorer and Microsoft products in 
general is that they don't patch the issues fast enough, and they don't 
take a proactive attitude. Thus, they end up with a peice of software 
that kills any computer it touches.
The people at Mozilla, on the other hand, patch these things in a timely 
manner, and because of their proactive outlook on security they already 
have prevention steps in place to minimize the effects of a vulnerability.

So, don't defend Mozilla, it happens to everyone. Rather inform people 
what it really happening. Mozilla has the same problems as IE, but the 
people patch it quicker and minimize the effects of vulnerabilities. The 
last thing we want is a browser war in which the masses are ill-informed.
