Subject: Buffer overflow in Whisper FTP Surfer 1.0.7


PRODUCT
Whisper FTP Surfer is a freeware FTP client for Windows

DETAILS
A buffer overflow in version 1.0.7 (latest version) occours when trying
to open a file with a long name from an FTP Server.
For common extension (as .txt) FTP surfer create a temporary file and
tries to open it. When closing the FTP Surfer, it tries to delete the
temporary file.
The long name of the file added to the name of the temporary folder
overflows the buffer.

POC
Create a file with a very long name with the ".txt" extension, put it on
an FTP Server and try to open it from FTP Surfer, you'll get an error
message: "Unable to execute program". Then when you close the FTP Surfer
the EIP will be invaild.

EXPLOITATION
Remote exploitation is not very easy because an attacker must guess the
space occupied by the path of the temporary folder to exactly overwrite
the return address, but is possible.

VENDOR STATUS
I notified this bug to the vendor on 10/07/04 but they haven't replied.
