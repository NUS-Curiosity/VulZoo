Subject: Re: Public Review of OIS Security Vulnerability
 Reporting and Response Guidelines


Nobody trusts the OIS or its motives. I imagine this is similar to the 
feedback you've gotten from everyone else as well, but Immunity has no 
plans to subscribe to your guidelines, and is going to oppose any 
efforts you make to legislate those guidelines as law. In section 1.1 
the draft proposes that the purpose of the OIS's model is to protect 
systems from vulnerabilities. This is fairly obviously untrue - the 
purpose of the OIS is to lobby towards a business model for Microsoft 
and the other OIS members that involves the removal of non-compliant 
security researchers.

This call for feedback is a thinly disguised attempt to get public 
legitimacy and allow the OIS to claim it has community backing, which it 
clearly does not.

It's rare, but there are still security companies and individuals who do 
not owe their entire business to money from Microsoft. It's July 4th. 
and some of us are Americans who understand the concept of independance.
