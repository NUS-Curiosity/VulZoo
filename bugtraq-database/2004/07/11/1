Bugzilla Security Advisory
July 10, 2004

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers security bugs that have recently been discovered
and fixed in the Bugzilla code: In the stable 2.16 releases, one instance
of arbitrary SQL injection exploitable only by a privileged user, several
instances of insufficient data validation and/or escaping, and two
instances of unprivileged access to names of restricted products. We know
of no occasion where any of these vulnerabilities have been exploited.

All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.16.6, which was released today.

Development snapshots prior to version 2.18rc1 are also affected, so if
you are using a development snapshot, you should obtain a newer one
(2.18rc1) or use CVS to update.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
- -------
Class:       Database Password Compromise
Versions:    2.17.1 through 2.17.7 (2.16-based releases are not affected)
Description: If the SQL server is halted but the webserver is left running,
~             older versions of DBI display an error message to the remote
~             user which contains the database password. While a properly-
~             configured database would still only be accessible by a local
~             user using that password, all installations are advised to
~             change the password after upgrading.

Issue 2
- -------
Class:       Privilege escalation
Versions:    2.17.1 through 2.17.7 (2.16-based releases are not affected)
Description: A user with privileges to grant membership to one or more
~             individual groups (i.e. usually an administrator) can
~             trick the administrative controls into granting membership
~             in groups other than the ones he has privileges for.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233486

Issue 3
- -------
Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    All versions prior to 2.16.6 and 2.18rc1
Description: If Bugzilla is configured to hide entire products from some
~             users, both duplicates.cgi and the form for mass-editing a
~             list of bugs in buglist.cgi can disclose the names of those
~             hidden products to such users.

~             http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234855

Issue 4
- -------
Class:       Cross-site scripting vulnerability
Versions:    All versions prior to 2.16.6 and 2.18rc1
Description: Several administration CGIs echo invalid data back to the
~             user without escaping it.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235265

Issue 5
- -------
Class:       User Password embedded in URL
Versions:    2.17.5 through 2.17.7 (2.16-based releases are not affected)
Description: The user's password can be embedded as part of an image URL,
~             and thus visible in the web server logs, if the user is
~             prompted to log in while attempting to view a chart.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235510

Issue 6
- -------
Class:       Remote SQL injection vulnerability
Versions:    All versions prior to 2.16.6 and 2.18rc1
Description: A user with privileges to grant membership to any group
~             (i.e. usually an administrator) can trick editusers.cgi
~             into executing arbitrary SQL.
Reference:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=244272
