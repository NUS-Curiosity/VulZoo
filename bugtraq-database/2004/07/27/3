NOTICE:
 There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
 provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
 as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    26 July 2004



POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    remote root access

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    CAN-2004-0686

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX
running the CIFS Server.  This buffer overflow could potentially
be exploited remotely to gain root access.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.22, B.11.23.
BACKGROUND:

AFFECTED VERSIONS

Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
      search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
      for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
      recommended patch or update is installed.

HP-UX B.11.23
HP-UX B.11.22
HP-UX B.11.11
HP-UX B.11.00
=============
For revision A.01.11.01 and previous:
CIFS-Server
action: Please see the Resolution section.

END AFFECTED VERSIONS

Note: The HP CIFS Server versions do not map directly to
         original Samba versions.  The what(1) output will show
         the HP version string, for example: A.01.11.02.  Samba
         commands such as "smbd -V" or "smbstatus" will report the
         underlying base Samba version, for example: 2.2.10.

Note: The HP CIFS Server versions A.01.11.02 and previous are
      not affected by the vulnerability reported in CAN-2004-0600.

RESOLUTION:
Until an update is available the potential vulnerability can
be avoided by setting "mangling method = hash2" or
"mangled names = no" in smb.conf.

Note: CIFS Server installations requiring the hash mangling
          method must evaluate the impact of converting to the
          hash2 mangling method.



MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - NonUpdate
Until a product update is available, modify smb.conf as described
in the Resolution section.
