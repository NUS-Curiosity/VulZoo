Anyone using the CVS pserver mechanism for anything other than totally
anonymous access gets only what they deserve.

If you want to keep your CVS repository secure then don't try to use CVS
as a security tool -- it wasn't designed for it, and it cannot be
"fixed" either (it's not a bug -- CVS is a version control tool, not a
security tool and CVS is designed _only_ to be executed by the unique
user performing operations on repository).

Use SSH or some other secure remote job execution tool to create a
secure connection for CVS to work with.
