This appears to be the case with 0.9.2.
The spoofed PayPal site (from
http://www.nd.edu/~jsmith30/xul/test/spoof.html) cannot hide FireFox's
status bar - so you get 2 status bars displayed.

Even so, the site is incredibly convincing, and I suspect the average user
would be understandably fooled.

Since the CERT recommendation, Mozilla browsers are gaining ground.  Firefox
is now the browser of choice throughout the company I work for.

I suspect the best defence will be to block all xul on the proxy.
