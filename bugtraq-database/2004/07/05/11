Subject: RS-2004-2: "Content-Type" XSS vulnerability affecting other webmail systems

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


  Hello,

  On 29.May.2004, I disclosed an important XSS vulnerability in latest
versions of a well-known webmail: SquirrelMail. Upon publication I
received the notice that other important webmails were also vulnerable
to the same bug. Indeed the same exploits released for SquirrelMail
worked without any changes in these systems. I decided to contact
several other webmail vendors and ask directly to check their software
and confirm or deny the vulnerability.

  The purpose of this brief advisory is to provide you with the
collected info in an objective and summarized way.

  PS: Sorry for the big delay.

 Saludos,
 --Roman
