Subject: RE: Re: IE Shell URI Download and Execute, POC


Problems with MSIE

1.	Too many vulnerabilities
2.	Too closely tied to OS, thereby making OS more vulnerable
3.	34 (at last count) unpatched vulnerabilities, reference
http://umbrella.name/originalvuln/msie/
4.	Taking their time in fixing/patching vulnerabilities.


By themselves, they are not a reason to dump IE at the corporate level.  But
taken all together, CIOs should really consider the safety of their network
with users running IE.  The mozilla folks are at least promptly fix
vulnerabilities, not to mention the fact that Mozilla/Firefox have had far
less vulnerabilities and does not lock itself into the OS kernel.

Once again, they are trying to patch the attack vector used instead of the
core IE problem itself (which is directly related to it being tied into the
OS level). I was once very pro-microsoft SMS Admin for my company but it is
getting out of hand. 

If you patch a hole, instead of a vector, then L33tPrincess wouldn't be able
to add a couple of lines to the code and change the vector to make the
exploit workable in like 10 mins.

It is like they are throwing the media and the mass public trash "fix" to
make them happy while people like us shake our heads at what the public
doesn't know. The multiple patches for the same problem with different MS
numbers, it is a sad thing.

The fun is MS says we fixed "shell" but it's still active for me.
