Subject: Trend Micro Officescan for Win2k strange behaviour






Hello List!

I've noticed the following "weird" behaviour of the Trend Micro Officescan
client vers. 5.58 update to pattern 1.936.00 Engine 7.100 for WinXP/2k/NT:

The AV client is protected for unloading the Realtime Scan agent prompting
for a password (which I don't know of course). Moreover I have NOT admin
rights which allows me to perform a full system scan but not to unload the
client and/or the realtime protection.
Playing with the "net" command on a DOS prompt, I found out that the AV
launches itself and the realtime prot as services automatically. Then I
tried to stop the services with the simple command

net stop "OfficeScanNT Listener"
net stop "OfficeScanNT RealTime Scan"

Guess what? The two services have been successfully stopped from my system.

What do you guys think of this? Should I advise the AV Company of this or
this is normal behaviour?

Tnx for feedback.

Ciao
