My bad, I meant to say MS04-022 which correctly list a patch for Windows
XP. I tried correcting my error in an immediate followup post and wrote
bugtraq-owner@...urityfocus.com to clarify but the original post got
approved.

<< Microsoft should update the MS02-022 bulletin to reflect that
automated exploitation is possible. Currently, the only listed affected
software is Windows 2000 but I had no problems reproducing this on
Windows XP as well. Since there is no patch available for Windows XP to
fix this vulnerability the only workaround is to disable the dynamic
icon handler for JobObject files, as described above >>

This issue was also reported to Microsoft by Peter Winter Smith of NGS
Software, with his sole testing platform being that of Windows XP as
stated in his advisory.  He had not confirmed exploitation against
Windows 2000.
As far as I am aware, there is a fix available for XP available from
