Well, the whole idea of relying on part of a file's name to determine
how it is opened is just plain stupid, IMHO.  If I took the name plate
off of a ford, and stuck it on my nissan, would my mechanic put ford
parts into it when I took it in for repair?

(Yeah, I know, I used the tired-old automobile analogy, but I am too
tired right now to come up with something better.)
