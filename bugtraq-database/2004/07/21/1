** I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH MI2G IN ANY WAY **

On July 6, someone made a parody advisory post to Full-Disclosure spoofing
mi2g (mi2g.com).  The person attempted to CC the Bugtraq and Vulnwatch
mail list, but the moderators of those lists rejected the post.

http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2004/Jul/

Instead of laughing along with the obvious hoax, mi2g responded in typical
fashion by releasing a "News Alert" in which they spread FUD, lie about
events that never took place, and libel the Bugtraq and Vulnwatch moderators.
 It took them 14 days to release this, probably the same time that passed
before their collective blood pressure dropped.  Some amusing clips from
their release:

>Subject: RESTRICTED LIST:  News Alert - Ransom demands coming through
>to subdue negative publicity; Reputation damage accelerates through

>hoax postings

Ransom demands?  Negative publicity?  Reputation damage accelerates?

mi2g is saying that "trusted web sites and security portals" posting
the original hoax have contacted mi2g, offering to not post it in return
for up to one MILLION dollars.  Who are these black hearted criminals?
 Read on.

Because of this obvious advisory parody, the poor masses are going to
have a hard time figuring out which advisories are legitimate?  I think
mi2g assumes every security professional and administrator is as big
a retard as themselves.

A number of vulnerability postings?  Check the archives!  There is a
single post to Full-Disclosure, none to Bugtraq, none to Vulnwatch. 
Where are these "number" of postings mi2g?

http://seclists.org/lists/

One out of three correct, good job mi2g!  Again, check the archives.
 Bugtraq and Vulnwatch did not post the hoax advisory, this is clearly
a defamatory statement meant to gain sympathy from your eight customers.
 The post hit the Full-Disclosure list because it is the only list of
the three that is UNMODERATED.

Perhaps someone in the security industry could teach a class at mi2g
headquarters on the basics of mail lists and automatic mail list archives.
 These sites archive 100% of the content posted to hundreds of mail lists.
 The material in the archives is clearly marked as coming from the original
person, and they make no claims as to the accuracy of such information
posted to the lists.

Read the list above again.  These are the black hearted criminals that
mi2g claims tried to extort them for money in return for "silence". 
What a complete load of manure.

If it was blatantly evident that the post was a hoax, why is mi2g crying
like a six year old with a skinned knee?  It is clear these "security
portals" are ignoring your request because you are asking them to alter
history in a sense.  They maintain archives of mail list traffic.  To
arbtirarily delete one post compromises the integrity (look that word
up please) of their service.  If you check the vulnerability databases
like ISS, SecurityFocus and Secunia, you will notice they did not mirror
the content and clearly filtered it instead of including it in a database.

Put up or shut up DK Matai.  None of these sites are attempting to extort
money from mi2g in return for "being silent" and witholding an obscure
hoax advisory buried in the thousands of trash posts to the Full-Disclosure
mail list.  This is a blatant lie from Matai and mi2g, nothing more.
