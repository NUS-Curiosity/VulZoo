               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mailman resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1734
Issue date:        2004-07-19
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1734
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0412
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated mailman packages that fixes a remote security vulnerability are now
available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives each
mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, etc.
over the Web. Even the list manager can administer his or her list
entirely from the Web. Mailman also integrates most things people want to
do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so
on.

A flaw in Mailman 2.1.* allows a remote attacker to retrieve the mailman
password of any subscriber by sending a carefully crafted email request to
the mailman server.

A simple patch is available and is fixed upstream in Mailman 2.1.5.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Marc Deslauriers for reporting this
issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
