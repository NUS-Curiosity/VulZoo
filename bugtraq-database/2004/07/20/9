I suspect this domain is a BlackHat server - period. We had a keylogger
trojan ("Padonok" - it WAS NOT detected by our any of our virus scanners,
malware detectors et al) hit one of our desktops more than a month ago.  
It tried to deliver the stolen data to that server. That they are *still*
in operation tells you that they are either unbelievably incompetent or
actually owned in the financial sense by the bad guys.

Here is what little I know about them:

That dates all the way back to March...
