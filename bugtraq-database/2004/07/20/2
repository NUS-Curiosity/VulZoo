1. Problem Description

	Deprotect discovered a buffer overflow in execmail.  After reviewing 
	our code we determined the whole MMDF package needed a security audit.

	Various buffer overflows and other security issues that affect all 
	MMDF binaries have been corrected. 

	All but one of the MMDF binaries that were setuid root are no 
	longer setuid. 

	Additional changes in this version of MMDF are documented at
	ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5/507/mp/mp3/osr507mp3.html#rn507mp_mmdf
	and in the updated man pages which are included in SCOSA-2004.7

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned MMDF buffer overflows the name CAN-2004-0510.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned MMDF null dereferences the name CAN-2004-0511.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned MMDF core dumps the name CAN-2004-0512.
