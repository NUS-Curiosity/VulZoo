> Microsoft Outlook Express is prone to a vulnerability which will allow
javascript to execute in the message window. Outlook Express uses a
webbrowser control to view email messages, with all features except
javascript, objects, and a couple more. Apparently, it only filters out
stuff in the window.document object. If something were to access any other
components of the window object, it would be given as much access as if the
mail message had been an html document opened in internet explorer.

> The example presents the viewer with a link to a javascript page with the
target set to "_blank" (opens the page in a new window). The javascript
calls opener.execScript, displaying an alert with the message body's
innerHTML.
