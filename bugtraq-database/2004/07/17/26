Subject: Re: MSOE Javascript Execution Vulnerability


Hello,

Couldn't reproduce this on MSOE v6.0.2800.1123. Win2k SP4.

I get an "opener is null or not an object" javascript error when I 
load the link from MSOE.

gr,
David

Outlook Express uses a webbrowser control to view email messages, with all features except javascript, objects, and a couple more. Apparently, it only filters out stuff in the window.document object. If something were to access any other components of the window object, it would be given as much access as if the mail message had been an html document opened in internet explorer.
