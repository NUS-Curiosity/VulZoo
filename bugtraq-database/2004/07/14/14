Subject: Re: IE Shell URI Download and Execute, POC

Ferruh,
Is this a new variant (wscript.shell)?  Is the vulnerability mitigated by today's Microsoft patch?
 
 
 
Hello;

Code is based on http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/367878 (POC by
Jelmer) message. I just added a new feature "download" and then execute
application. Also I use Wscript.Shell in Javascript instead of
Shell.Application.
