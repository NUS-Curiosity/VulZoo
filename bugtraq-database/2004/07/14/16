Depends on how Microsoft fixed IE. If they did the same thing as the ADODB
patch from last week and just focused on the Shell.Application variant
instead of the code IE problem, then it won't stop this WSH variant by
L33tPrincess. Which I must say is a sweet name. =)

Ferruh,

Is this a new variant (wscript.shell)?  Is the vulnerability mitigated by
today's Microsoft patch?

 

 

 

Hello;

Code is based on http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/367878 (POC by
Jelmer) message. I just added a new feature "download" and then execute
application. Also I use Wscript.Shell in Javascript instead of
Shell.Application.
