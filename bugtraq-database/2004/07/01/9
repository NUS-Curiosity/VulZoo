Or it could be something a tad more deceptive from the marketing end of
M$.  Kinda like all the backpeddling that happened when the paper was
released about the dependance upon a major single vendors SW in corporate
america and the world at large, that cost at least one well known security
pundit his job.  At that time those with a hand in the M$ deep pockets did
start to spin defensive lines around that major vendor and it's products,
if only to keep their hands in those pockets.  While this set of
statements are purely my oppinion, I certainly do not doubt that M$ might
well be trying to fight the current rants against it's 'efforts' with FUD,
and in the mainstream media.  It's certainly easy enough to later claim a
fubar of hoof and mouth in an aftermath of 'rediscovery' of what was know
and what was not and what is new and what's been on a back burner for
almost a full year.  and it certainly fits with their well known marketing
paradyme.

Thanks,

OK, so you're a Ph.D.  Just don't touch anything.
