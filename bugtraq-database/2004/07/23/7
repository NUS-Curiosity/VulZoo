1. Problem Description

	Mozilla upgrade to version 1.6. fixes several security isuses.  

	Mozilla Browser Scope Cross-Domain Function or Variable Disclosure 

	Jesse Ruderman has reported a vulnerability in Mozilla where a 
	malicious site may detect whether functions or variables are defined 
	in another browser window. The issue is reported to exist due to a 
	lack of sufficient access controls enforced on eval() calls. An 
	attacker may exploit this issue to potentially enumerate browsing 
	habits of an unsuspecting user. 

	Mozilla Browser Proxy Server Authentication Credential Disclosure 

	Darin Fisher has reported an information disclosure bug in Mozilla. 
	When the user attempts to connect to a malicious server subsequent to 
	successfully authenticating to the trusted server and if the malicious 
	proxy with a same realm as the trusted server sends the user a "407 
	Proxy authentication required" message, Mozilla will send the cached 
	authentication credentials from the previous exchange with the trusted 
	proxy to the malicious server. This is carried out regardless of the 
	different domain name or IP address of the malicious server. 

	Mozilla Custom Getter/Setter Objects Same Origin Policy Violation 

	Jesse Ruderman has reported a same origin policy violation vulnerability
	in Mozilla. It has been reported that custom getter/setter objects do 
	not possess a check for the Same Origin Policy.  This may allow the 
	object to be invoked to gain access to properties of another domain in 
	a frame or iframe. 

	Mozilla URI Sub-Directory Arbitrary Cookie Access Vulnerability

	Stephen P. Morse discovered a problem in the behavior of the cookie 
	handling in Mozilla. If similar path attributes exist in two separate 
	cookies, it may be possible for a site to gain unauthorized access to 
	cookies issued by another site in the same domain. The correct behavior
	is to restrict this type of access based both on domain and exact path 
	attribute information. 

	Mozilla Browser Cookie Path Restriction Bypass Vulnerability 

	Daniel Veditz has reported a vulnerability in Mozilla where a malicious
	site  may read  cookies  from unauthorized  paths  due  to a lack of 
	sufficient sanitization performed on cookie paths. A malicious cookie 
	path containing certain escape sequence will reportedly bypass cookie 
	path access controls. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2003-0594 to this issue.

	Mozilla Browser Script.prototype.freeze/thaw Arbitrary Code Execution 

	Brendan Eich has reported a vulnerability in Mozilla that may permit 
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The issue is in the 
	JavaScript Script.prototype.freeze/thaw functionality. An attacker with
	knowledge of JavaScript bytecode and JavaScript engine internals, as 
	well as the native architecture of a client system may theoretically 
	cause arbitrary code to be executed.
