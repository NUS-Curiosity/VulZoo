Subject: MD5 hash cracking service


I've set up a quick website and system to crack md5 hashes online using Rainbow tables. The project is using RainbowCrack and currently ~47 Gb of tables. At the moment it can crack hashes of lowercase letters and/or numbers up to 8 characters long.

The cracking service is free

If you are interested you can check out the site here: http://passcracking.com
