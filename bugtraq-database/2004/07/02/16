Subject: Brightmail leaks other user's spam


Brightmail Spamfilter 6.0 offer a possibility to manage mails 
identified as spam in a http-driven "control-center" on the 
Brightmail-Server via links like
http://SERVER:41080/brightmail/quarantine/viewMsgDetails.do?id=QMsgView-3;3-0

Simply altering the last numbers in the URL (3;3 to 4;4, eg.) shows 
other domain-users Spam-Mail without any authentication.

Confirmed with Version 6.0.0.100 and previous beta-versions.

Brightmails support is aware of the problem, but didn't bother to 
confirm the problem in the 6.0 final.
