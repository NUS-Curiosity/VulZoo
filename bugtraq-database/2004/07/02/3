Your subject makes it sound like this is a spoofing vulnerability when
in fact this is expected functionality that has been around since
Netscape 2 and IE3 which does not grant additional privileges of any
kind and requires the user to activate WindowsUpdate from your site.

Your script opens a new window and then uses a timer to change the
location of whatever window object has focus. This does not switch
security zone or even protocol, all it does is to load your site into a
subframe of another site. You can accomplish the exact same without
trying to 'trick' anything by using the following 2 lines:

W=window.open("http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com");
W.frames[2].location.href = "http://pivx.com/";

This is no different than loading WindowsUpdate in a frame on your own
site.

It has always been standard practice that you can change, but not read,
the location of any window object to a site from the same protocol and
security zone. A frame is a window object and all window objects are
safely exposed because they by themselves does not reveal any
information about the site inside the frame. You can get a handle of any
window object to any depth because the frames collection is also safely
exposed. This does not give you any kind of access to the document
object inside, which would be necessary for any kind of code injection
or cookie theft.

Subject: SUPER SPOOF DELUXE Re: [Full-Disclosure] Microsoft and Security




Thomas Kessler was kind enough to inform that this is not new, but in
fact on old "issue" with Internet Explorer which by all accounts was
supposed to be "patched" back in 1998[?]:

Microsoft Security Program: Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS98-
020) Patch Available for 'Frame Spoof' Vulnerability

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms98-020.mspx

Quite clearly this contraption known as Internet Explorer is just
broken. It's oozing pus from every pore at this stage.

If indeed the issues are the exact same. 

You'd better wipe hands of it anyway.

We give up.
