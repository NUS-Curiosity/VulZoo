Subject: VA Appliance Deployment White Paper


Our company is in process of deploying Vulnerability Management
Appliances to all of its worldwide datacenters.

Are there any white papers out there that talk about the VA Appliance
Deployment Process?

Best practices? 

How it should be deployed? etc.. 


Any help would be greatly appreciate it. 


Thank You
