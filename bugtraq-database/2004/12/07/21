This is the result of an Apple-introduced problem in bash-2.05b.  Bash,
as distributed, gives up setuid privileges when invoked without the -p
option, if the kernel allows setuid scripts to run.  Apple changed bash
to keep setuid if bash is invoked as `sh'.

You can solve this particular problem by removing the setuid bit from
the scripts and tightening up path checking, but it's going to be a
potential problem until Apple reconsiders their permitting setuid scripts.
