MPlayer Bitmap Parsing Remote Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.16.04
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=168
December 16, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

MPlayer is a movie player for Linux that also runs on many other Unices, 
and non- x86 CPUs. It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, 
ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG, FILM, RoQ, PVA 
files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can 
watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and other formats. 

More information is available at http://mplayerhq.hu/.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Unix MPlayer 
could allow attackers to gain access to the computer. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to a lack of bounds checking 
within the demux_open_bmp() routine defined in /libmpdemux/demux_bmp.c. 
If a specially crafted file specifies a large value for the "biClrUsed" 
field, an overflow is triggered in stream_read(). 

The vulnerable portion of code is displayed here: 

demuxer_t* demux_open_bmp(demuxer_t* demuxer)
{
    sh_video_t *sh_video = NULL;
    unsigned int filesize;
    unsigned int data_offset;
    bmp_image_t *bmp_image;
    ...
    sh_video->bih->biClrUsed = stream_read_dword_le(demuxer->stream);
    sh_video->bih->biClrImportant = stream_read_dword_le(demuxer->stream);
    // fetch the palette
[!]  stream_read(demuxer->stream, (unsigned char *)(sh_video->bih) + 40,
    sh_video->bih->biClrUsed * 4);
    ...
} 

In the given example call to stream_read(), an unchecked amount of data 
as specified by "biClrUsed" will be read into the fixed size buffer 
"bih." This allows control of execution by overwriting the saved return 
address on the stack.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to 
execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the user who attempted to 
view the bitmap file. Exploitation is not trivial, as a high level of 
precision is required. It is not a requirement for the malicious file to 
have an extension of .bmp because MPlayer will correctly determine if it 
is a bitmap file despite its extension.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that MPlayer version 1.0pre5 is vulnerable.

The following distributions of Linux include MPlayer:
	
	Debian Linux 
	Fedora Linux 
	Gentoo Linux 
	SUSE Linux 

V. WORKAROUND

Users must be careful when accepting and opening media from untrusted 
sources.
