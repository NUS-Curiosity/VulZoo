Veritas Backup Exec Agent Browser Registration Request Buffer Overflow
Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.16.04
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=169
December 16, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

Backup Exec is a next generation backup and restore solution for
Microsoft Windows server environments. More information is available
here:

http://veritas.com/Products/www?c=product&refId=57

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Veritas Backup Exec allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists within the function responsible
for receiving and parsing registration requests. The registration
request packet contains the hostname and connecting TCP port of the
client which is stored in an array on the stack. An attacker can send a
registration request with an overly long hostname value to overflow the
array and take control of the saved return address to execute arbitrary
code.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation does not require authentication thereby allowing
any remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of
the Backup Exec Agent Browser (benetns.exe) process which is usually a
domain administrative account.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Backup
Exec for Windows Servers 9.1.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a firewall to restrict incoming connections to trusted workstations
running the Backup Exec client software.
