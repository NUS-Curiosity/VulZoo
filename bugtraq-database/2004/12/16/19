MPlayer Remote RTSP Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.16.04
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=166
December 16, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

MPlayer is a movie player for Linux that also runs on many other Unices, 
and non- x86 CPUs. It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, 
ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG, FILM, RoQ, PVA 
files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can 
watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and other formats. 

More information is available at http://mplayerhq.hu/.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Unix MPlayer 
could allow remote users to gain access to the computer.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to an error in dynamically 
allocating memory in /libmpdemux/realrtsp/real.c. The vulnerable code
follows:

rmff_header_t  *real_setup_and_get_header(rtsp_t *rtsp_session, uint32_t
bandwidth) {
  char *description=NULL;
  char *session_id=NULL;
  rmff_header_t *h;
  char *challenge1;
  char challenge2[64];
  char checksum[34];
  char *subscribe;
  char *buf = xbuffer_init(256);
  char *mrl=rtsp_get_mrl(rtsp_session);
  unsigned int size;
  int status;

[...]
  if (!rtsp_search_answers(rtsp_session,"Content-length"))
    printf("real: got no Content-length!\n");
  else
[!]  size=atoi(rtsp_search_answers(rtsp_session,"Content-length"));
[...]
  description=malloc(sizeof(char)*(size+1));

  if( rtsp_read_data(rtsp_session, description, size) <= 0) {
      buf = xbuffer_free(buf);
    return NULL;
  }
  description[size]=0;
[...]
}       

If a malicious server specifies a content-length of -1 for the stream, 
only 4 bytes are allocated due to an integer overflow. An arbitrary 
length stream of data is then copied into that 4 byte buffer, 
corrupting the heap and allowing for possible code execution
        
III. ANALYSIS

Remote exploitation of this vulnerability is difficult because success 
requires a great deal of precision. If remote exploitation were 
successful, the attacker would be able to gain access with the 
privileges of the user who attempted to play the media file.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that MPlayer version 1.0pre5 is vulnerable.

The following distributions of Linux include MPlayer:
	
	Debian Linux 
	Fedora Linux 
	Gentoo Linux 
	SUSE Linux 

V. WORKAROUND

Users must be careful when accepting and opening media from untrusted 
sources. Do not accept media from those you do not trust. Do not stream 
media from servers you do not trust.
