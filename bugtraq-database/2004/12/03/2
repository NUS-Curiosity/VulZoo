Subject: RE: Official IFRAME patch - make sure it installs    correctly


I fully understand that Nick. I am a former SMS admin and had to deal
with this fact in a corporate patch environment. 

I was helping a person that didn't understand how Microsoft uses the
baseline for patching systems. I believe you looked a bit too deep into
my mail or liked to assumed I was a patch n00bs. Which is not the case.

And XP1 become the "new" baseline after Windows XP gold lost its
extended support. Just like XP2 will become the "new" baseline once SP1
passes its extended support.
