Package description:

  secret-key cryptography.  A free implementation of this protocol is
  available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Problem description:
  There is a buffer overflow in the password history handling code of
  libkadm5srv which could be exploited by an authenticated user to
  execute arbitary code on a Key Distribution Center (KDC) server.
