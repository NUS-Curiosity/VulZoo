Subject: Re: Multiple Vulnerabilities in paFileDB 3.1



I don't think this issue can be considered a vulnerability in paFileDB.
It's rather about Apache indexing the content of a web directory.
This is a misconfiguration issue in your httpd.conf.
Note that paFileDB is doing things right: it builds secure filenames
(since they cannot be guessed by trial-error in a reasonable amount of
time).

Hope this helps,
