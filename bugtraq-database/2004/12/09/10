Actually, no, it is not. Try catting it on linux console. It takes
the garbage, overwrites it with ^Hs, then writes ... "its saddle and
harness for price   1", then shifts cursor right (over 4 or `,
depending on first block), then continues with "000 dollars".

My trick does *not* work in Gnome Terminal (I've just verified
it). You need actuall linux console, press ctrl-alt-F1 on most distros
to get to one... but if you tell me what terminal you use, I can
probably create terminal sequence that works there...
