I think all this conversation is doing is showing that the terms 'local' and
'remote' are vague and maybe not terribly useful anymore.

That'd be a good start.  In most cases what people really want to know when
they look at 'remote' or 'local' attacks is whether any random person on the
Internet can execute the attack, or whether they only have to worry about
their own users.  This is especially true at small sites where if a local
user acts up, the sysadmin can just go dope slap them. ;)  I take it under
your system, the NASM vulnerability would be considered "credentialed"?
