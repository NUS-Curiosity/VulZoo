Subject: Re: phpBB Worm


Last look at my log files and I was hit a total of 421 times by 278
different IPs. It seems to be moving rather quickly as these were from
the last 2 days. Good luck to those who have not patched yet.

The script then proceeds to traverse the entire directory structure, overwriting .php, .htm, .shtm, .phtm, and on our server, .ssi files, and then spreads itself.  Correct?

I looked at the decoded Perl script, but I'm not a Perl expert, so I couldn't understand all of it.  And what about the difference in file permissions?

If, for example, an HTML file on the server was uploaded by user bob, and has permissions of 755, how can the Perl script delete that file?  Shouldn't the Perl script be created with the Perl process's permissions, which was invoked by PHP, which should have the Web server's permissions, which should be, at least on most *nix servers, the nobody user?

Our site is on a shared server, and our site does not even run phpBB, but most of our HTML files were replaced with the worm's content.  Obviously, then, another site on the server must have an old version of phpBB.  But why could the worm, coming in through another site, modify files created by other users?  Even if the worm's script ran as the owner of the vulnerable viewtopic.php file, how could it then modify non-world-writable files created by other users?

Since PHP almost always runs as an Apache module, and Apache usually runs as nobody, one must make files and directories world-writable for PHP scripts to be able to write to them.  But that means that any process on the server, including anyone's PHP script, can modify the files.
