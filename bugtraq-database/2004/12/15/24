Summary
=======

Several default username/password combinations are present in all
available releases of Cisco Unity when integrated with Microsoft
Exchange. The accounts include a privileged administrative account, as
well as several messaging accounts used for integration with other
systems. An unauthorized user may be able to use these default accounts
to read incoming and outgoing messages, and perform administrative
functions on the Unity system.

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID 
CSCeg08552

This advisory is available at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20041215-unity.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco Unity versions 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x when integrated with Microsoft
Exchange.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following products are confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Any version of Cisco Unity when integrated with Lotus Notes
  * Cisco Unity Express
  * Cisco CallManager and CallManager Express
  * Cisco MeetingPlace

No other Cisco products are currently known to create these specific
default account/passwords.

Details
=======

Cisco Unity is a communications solution which delivers unified
messaging (e-mail, voice, and fax messages sent to one inbox) and
intelligent voice messaging. Cisco Unity integrates with desktop
applications such as Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Notes.

Several default username/password combinations are present in all
releases Cisco Unity when integrated with Microsoft Exchange.

An unauthorized user may be able to use these default accounts to read
incoming and outgoing messages, or to perform administrative functions
on the Unity system.

The specified accounts with default passwords are:

EAdmin<systemid>
UNITY_<servername>
UAMIS_<servername>
UOMNI_<servername>
UVPIM_<servername>
ESubsubscriber

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID 
CSCeg08552

Impact
======

An unauthorized user may utilize EAdmin<systemid> to access the Cisco
Unity Administrator in order to create, edit, or delete classes of
service, restriction tables, call routing tables, call handlers,
schedules and holidays, subscribers, public distribution lists, or to
perform other administrative functions.

An unauthorized user may utilize UNITY_<servername>, UAMIS_<servername>,
UOMNI_<servername>, or UVPIM_<servername> to read
incoming and outgoing messages as they are passed to and from external
voicemail systems. Please note that local messages which do not pass to
non-Unity voicemail systems are not made visible by this vulnerability.

ESubscriber is an example user account that conveys no administrative
or other special abilities. However it is contrary to best security
practices to have unused accounts with default passwords.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Cisco Unity 4.0(5), which is scheduled for released in the first
quarter of the calendar year 2005, will contain the fix for this issue
for NEW INSTALLS ONLY.

Note: An upgrade to Cisco Unity 4.0(5) from any previous version will
still contain this vulnerability. Customers upgrading to version 4.0(5)
from any previous version must apply the workaround listed below to
eliminate the vulnerability.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

As the fix for this vulnerability is a default configuration change,
and a workaround is available, a software upgrade is not required to
address this vulnerability. However, if you have a service contract,
and wish to upgrade to unaffected code, you may obtain upgraded
software through your regular update channels once that software is
available. For most customers, this means that upgrades should be
obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's Worldwide Web site at 
http://www.cisco.com/

If you need assistance with the implementation of the workarounds, or
have questions on the workarounds, please contact the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC).

  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)

See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they
have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise
using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by the terms
of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com
Downloads at http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Workarounds
===========

It is recommended to change to a strong password for all accounts
created by Cisco Unity.

The accounts that are created automatically when Cisco Unity is
integrated with Microsoft Exchange are: (replacing <servername> with
that of the particular Unity server, and <systemid> with that of your
particular system id)

EAdmin<systemid>
Unity_<servername>
UAMIS_<servername>
UOMNI_<servername>
UVPIM_<servername>
ESubscriber

Note: Please note that the account ESubscriber is only created during
installation of versions PRIOR to version 4.0(3). If your initial
installation of Unity was 4.0(3) or later, Esubscriber will not be
present.

See
http://cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps2237/products_tech_note09186a0080093f54.shtml
for additional information on how to change account passwords.

For guidance on strong passwords, please refer to your security policy.

The CERT Coordination Center also has suggestions on strong password
policy at 
http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/unix_configuration_guidelines.html#A 

Optionally, a customer may disable (but not delete), these specific
accounts for extra security. Beginning with version 4.0(5) of Cisco
Unity, these specific accounts will be created in a disabled state. For
additional instructions on how to disable these accounts, please see 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/advanced/help/default.asp?url=/windows2000/en/advanced/help/dsadmin_disable_andenable_accounts.htm 


With the exception of ESubscriber, it is important to NOT delete any of
the accounts listed above. Deletion of EAdmin<systemid>, Unity_<servername>,
UAMIS_<servername>, UOMIN_<server>, or UPVIM_<servername> will have an
adverse affect on Cisco Unity operation.

No interruption of service, nor restart of Cisco Unity is required to
apply this workarouund.
