Not by disabling the syscall but by replacing it in the manner that a
rootkit replaces syscalls.  Build a new kernel from the same
source/config except for patch.  Replace syscalls where there is change.
Practical?
Stable?
No.  Much easier to simply reboot to new kernel.  If service(s) are so
critical as to not tolerate a reboot yet have a single point of failure
on this one component then there are greater problems at play.
