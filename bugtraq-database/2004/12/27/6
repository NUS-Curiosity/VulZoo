Well, of COURSE they will. Unlike the lazy dudes at Microsoft, no self-respecting 
worm or spyware author would goof off on Christmas when there was such a tempting
vulnerability to exploit. I expect to see half a dozen worms, spyware programs,
"phishing" spams, and hacked Web sites to be infecting users within the week.

What's more, McAfee and Symantec say that they won't be automatically updating
users' machines to block exploits (Some? All? Who knows?) until the 29th. (I realize 
that antivirus vendors have an incentive to allow a delay before they update their 
patterns, because a rash of infections can help business.... However, this is 
downright irresponsible.)

Which is why I'd like to capture the API entry point and put in the bounds
check that should have been there in the first place. Alas, I don't have the
Windows programming tools to do it here, so I'm looking for a bit of help.
