Merrell also makes a "Jungle Moc" that is a mitigating factor to this
vulnerability.  All shoes of similar "Moccasin" styles, as well as
Cowboy Boots, also seem to be unaffected.  Cowboy Boots with spurs
seem to add an additional layer of security, as well as cool points.

Review of their website seems to indicate that they're going to be
discontinuing the line, though.  So, with Boxing Day tommorrow, I'd
recommend snapping up a few pairs as a cautionary posture against the
possibility of future attacks.
