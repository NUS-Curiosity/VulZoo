If an attacker can spoof the signature file download site, he can
potentially do quite a bit worse than this (in that he can deny the
usability of the antivirus engine at all by providing a bogus
signature file). I'd think that some form of cryptography would be in
use to prevent this (either SSL or signing of the archives
themselves). Am I mistaken? 

(Caveat being that I don't use any anti-virus products of this nature,
so I really don't know.)
