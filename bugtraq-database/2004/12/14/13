The patch for this issue has been checked in to Citadel CVS and a
release will be forthcoming shortly. Please do not run a production
system from Citadel CVS as code may not always be stable.

Sites which are unable to patch or upgrade may work around the issue
by disabling system logging, and logging to a separate text file. To
perform this action, remove the -l option from the citadel command
line in /etc/inittab and replace it with a -t option specifying the
text file to log to. Once complete, signal init to re-read the inittab
(e.g. init q) and then restart the Citadel server.
 
Example:
cit1:2345:respawn:/usr/local/citadel/citserver -h/usr/local/citadel
-x3 -t/var/log/citadel.log
