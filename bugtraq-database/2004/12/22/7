Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.21.04: Hewlett Packard HP-UX ftpd Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Hewlett Packard HP-UX ftpd Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.21.04
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=175&type=vulnerabilities
December 21, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

HP-UX FTP Daemon is a service included in HP-UX that implements the File

Transfer Protocol.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the file 
transfer protocol (FTP) daemon included in multiple versions of Hewlett-
Packard Development Co.'s (HP) HP-UX allows attackers to gain remote 
root access in certain configurations. 

The problem specifically exists when the FTP daemon is configured via 
/etc/inetd.conf to log debug information using -v switch. This is a not 
a default configuration option. When parsing a long command request, an 
exploitable stack overflow will occur. The overflow occurs before 
authentication, thus eliminating the need for a local or anonymous FTP 
account.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote 
attackers to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the FTP 
daemon server, usually root. The severity of this issue is mitigated by 
the fact that in most production environments, administrators will not 
be using the debug-logging feature of FTP daemon.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in HP-UX 
11.11i. It is suspected that previous versions are also vulnerable.

To determine if a specific configuration is vulnerable, check 
/etc/inetd.conf for the ftpd line and see if the debug switch is 
enabled: 

grep 'ftpd' /etc/inetd.conf | grep -- -v 

If the above command returns text, then the FTP daemon is running in 
debug mode.

V. WORKAROUND

Do not use the -v flag in the FTP daemon entry line in /etc/inetd.conf. 
If debug-logging is necessary, consider allowing only trusted hosts 
access to the service using firewall rules or TCP wrappers.
