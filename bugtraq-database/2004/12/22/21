I'm not so sure about this.  In the nasm case, a local use must run nasm 
therefore requireing a local account.  In my opinion, remote exploits are 
holes that I can attack from the network without waiting for a local user 
to execute something, i.e. services that are running or exposed protocols.

As for the other comments in this thread about telling the vendor early, I 
personally feel it helps users if the vendor has a few days to look at the 
hole and devise a patch BEFORE everyone on the planet knows about it.  You 
punish users of software in addition to vendors.  All software has a 
security problem of one kind or another, and its silly to think that a 
perfect application will every be written.
