That's nonsense.  If you have /bin/sh installed, I can send you a shell
script FROM THE NETWORK that will give me root access if you run it.
Therefore, every UNIX system on Earth has a remote hole, according to

Could you have?  How, pray tell, would you compromise a machine with
the NASM exploit?  Even if you have a local account, the NASM exploit
lets you run arbitrary code as... yourself.  Big deal.
