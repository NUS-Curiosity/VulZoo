This isn't at all surprising.
There are numerous industries which run "old" software like this. There
are several reasons not to upgrade:
  1) The software is currently "good enough"
  2) It would cost too much to upgrade
  3) The original designers are long long gone and no-one knows
		 everything about the application any more (although this is also a
     reason TO upgrade).

There are several money-lending organizations which run "old" software
like this too quite happily.
