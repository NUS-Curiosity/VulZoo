  Not quite true.   Although an old version of Win98 had an overflow, this
overflow was in the application, not the OS.

 ..."But it's a software glitch that makes the reboot procedure necessary in
the first place, says Riggs. And that glitch resides in an auxiliary
system-the VSCS Control Subsystem Upgrade (VCSU)."

 "Inside the control system unit is a countdown timer that ticks off time in
milliseconds. The VCSU uses the timer as a pulse to send out periodic
queries to the VSCS. "
