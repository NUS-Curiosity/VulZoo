Subject: Again: zone transfers, a spammer's dream?


Hello all,
after Lode Vermeiren having published on the 7th of December that many
tlds are transferable I did further research on this. Much to my
surprise this wasn't just a problem of little states. i did a complete
scan on all tlds (http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt)
including every soa and ns server. i got results from 141 out of the
258 checked tlds. i din't check every single output, but there are not
more than 10 false-positives within these. while the ca zone is secure
now, i was really surprised that be (~ 42 MB, ~ 900.000 records) and
fi (~ 11 MB, ~ 235.000 records) are transferable.
all in all, i found that the following tlds are transferable (also
there might be some false-positives):
