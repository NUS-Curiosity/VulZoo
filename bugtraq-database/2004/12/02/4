The wording in ms04-040 is so vague, I am not entirely sure that this
patch is a fix for the IFRAME bug(s)?

Just so I am clear, after automatic updates applied the "critical
patch" on W2KSP4 and rebooted, the IFRAME exploit still worked, but
manually downloading the executable given in the Microsoft alert and
running it results in a system on which the IFRAME exploit no longer
works?

This would be confirmation that ms04-040 actually does address the
IFRAME exploit.
