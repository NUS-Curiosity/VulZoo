Original Release Date: 2004-12-20

1. Systems affected:

        All versions of KDE up to KDE 3.3.1 inclusive. KDE 3.3.2 is not
        affected.


2. Overview:

        Two flaws in the Konqueror webbrowser make it possible to by pass
        the sandbox environment which is used to run Java-applets.
        One flaw allows access to restricted Java classes via JavaScript,
        making it possible to escalate the privileges of the Java-applet.
        The other problem is that Konqueror fails to correctly restrict
        access to certain Java classes from the Java-applet itself.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2004-1145 to this issue.


3. Impact:

        When a user has Java enabled in Konqueror and visits a malicious
        website, the website can run a Java-applet and obtain escalated
        privileges allowing reading and writing of arbitrary files with
        the privileges of the user.


4. Solution:

        Upgrade to KDE 3.3.2

        A backport has been made available for older versions which fixes
        this vulnerability. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.


5. Patch:

	For KDE 3.2.3 a backport of the new Java handling is available from
	ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :
