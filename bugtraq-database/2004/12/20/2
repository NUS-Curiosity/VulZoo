Actually, I sent all of these notifications to the public securesoftware
mailing list (http://securesoftware.list.cr.yp.to) at the same time that
I sent them to the authors. It certainly wasn't my intention to give the
authors an extra day of self-delusion.

If you had bothered to look at the slides on the course web page, you
would have seen a half day dedicated to the topic, plus some examples on
subsequent days of how people react to full disclosure when they're
trying to protect their shoddy security practices.

The reason that the 16 students sent their 91 reports to me privately is
so that they wouldn't have to deal with people like you. It was entirely
my decision to send out these 44 public notices.
