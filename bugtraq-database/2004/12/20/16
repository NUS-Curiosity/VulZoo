Hello,
  I'm a little bit confused as to why you would classify this as a "vulnerability" -- or even relate it to internet explorer at all... I think you have confused the simple html parsing of Active Desktop with microsoft internet explorer... however, what you have listed as an "avoid/overrun/bypass" to the "new protection(?)" on "IE (winxp sp2)", is neither an avoid, overrun, or bypass. When the html with js code is executed from within ie, sp2 still performs its magic. I'm afraid this was a weak attempt to get your name on the board.
