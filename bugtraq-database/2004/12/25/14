	BGTQ)

Hey all, DJB,

>> Is the class on responsible disclosure next semester perhaps?

Responsible disclosure is a euphemism creating by industry lobby groups
like OIS, which never had much support in the security scene in the first 
place.

If I am allowed to suggest something for a possible re-run of the same 
course:
It would probably be more interesting to set a lower bar on the number of
vulnerabilities but to restrict the focus a bit more -- e.g. asking for 1 
remotely
exploitable bug in a list of widely used software (Bind/OpenSSH/ProFTPd (or 
even QMail :-)
would focus students on larger pieces of software that are a bit more 
critical than
e.g. nasm. This would lead to the students searching for less "standardized" 
problems,
as well.

Then again, it sounds like a really fun course :)

Cheers,
Thomas Dullien
