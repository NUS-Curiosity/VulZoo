In generation 9 of the worm, there is the following code after what you
include:

        for my $l ('A' .. 'Z') {
                push(@dirs, $l . ':');
        }

What I get out of this is that the worm should try iterating down every
available drive on a Windows server.  I haven't tested this on a Windows
machine running ActivePerl yet though.
