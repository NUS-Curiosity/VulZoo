Subject: Suggested filters against PHP Attacking Worms


With the whole Santy and Phpinclude worms running around lately, I ran 
some stats and put up some filter suggestions in the below article link.  

As a highlight, in a 55 hour period my site received just under 300,000 
verified attacks.  Some GET examples have been shown, and filters false 
positives are analyzed.

Filter examples are provided for:

- modsecurity
- php
- modrewrite

A couple hardening suggestions are also included.
