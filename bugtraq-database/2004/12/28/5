Subject: error in latest realplayer advisory

http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/realra3.txt says that RealPlayer 10.5
(6.0.12.1056) is affected by the bug, but this is the latest (and 
supposedly fixed) version.

or am i missing something?

see http://service.real.com/help/faq/security/041026_player/EN/
