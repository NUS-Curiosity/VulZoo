Subject: Oracle wrapped procedure overflow (#NISR2122004J)



NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle 10g/9i wrapped procedure buffer overflow
Systems Affected: Oracle 10g/9i on all operating systems	
Severity: High risk
Vendor URL: http://www.oracle.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl at ngssoftware.com ]
Relates to: http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oracle-01.txt
Date of Public Advisory: 23rd December 2004
Advisory number: #NISR2122004J
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/oracle23122004J.txt

Description
***********
The code for PL/SQL procedures can be encrypted or "wrapped" to use the
Oracle term. When a wrapped procedure is created a buffer overflow
vulnerability can be triggered.


Details
*******
By placing an overly token in the text of a procedure that has been wrapped
with version 9 and stack based buffer is overflowed in the Oracle server
when the procedure is created. Exploitation of this allows an attacker to
run code as the Oracle user.



Fix Information
***************
A patch (#68) was released for this problem by Oracle. See
http://metalink.oracle.com/ for more details. NGSSQuirreL for Oracle
(http://www.nextgenss.com/squirrelora.htm), can be used to assess whether
your Oracle servers are vulnerable to this.
