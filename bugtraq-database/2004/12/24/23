Subject: Plesk 7 Cross-Site Scripting


Vendor: SW-Soft

URL: http://www.sw-soft.com/

Version: Plesk 7.0.0

Risk: Cross-Site Scripting

Description: Plesk is comprehensive server management software
developed specifically for the Hosting Service Industry with the
assistance of Web hosting professionals. Time tested tough in real
world hosting environments this award winning "control panel" software
has proven itself for years to be simply the best.
Cross Site Scripting:
There's a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the login page for
Plesk 7, another case of improperly secured POST data.
An attacker can inject data into the page through the login_name
variable on the login page ("login_up.php3").
An example can be found here: http://www.wheresthebeef.co.uk/XSS/plesk.7.html
The CSS isn't done through a GET request, it is done through POST and
can be exploited in the form of a form.

Solution:
The vendor hasn't replied to any of my e-mails but they do appear to
have fixed this problem.
*Hello SW-Soft, if you're watching!*
