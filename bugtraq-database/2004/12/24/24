Subject: Re: Shoe 1.0 - Remote Lace Overflow


Hello.
I understand the concept of Funn-Disclosure, but did you conact all
the affected vendors and wait at least one week for initial response?

a0o>  A remote shoe vulnerability exists that could allow for remote tripping and

a0o>  Severity:

a0o>  Hyper-Critical. This needs no explanation.

a0o>  Vulnerability:

a0o>  Failure to properly tie your shoe could result in tripping and a possible

a0o>  Vulnerable Sizes:

a0o>  -------------
a0o>  You have a 100% secure walking system - you do not fall down, or trip over

a0o>  Do not wear untrusted shoes sent to you. Other possible workarounds include
a0o>  sandals (aka. flip-flops). These are a good work-around and are widely

a0o>  vulnerable shoes to the public.
