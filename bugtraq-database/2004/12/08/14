Correct, it sounds as though the attacks are not a first preimage
attack.  However, first preimage resistance is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for security.  I have not read the paper yet, but I
imagine most of these results would imply either second preimage, or
collision insecurity.

Yes, collisions are a fact of life with message digests.  However, being
able to efficiently *predict* how to create a collision between two
messages is very bad for the security of a hash.  Suppose you and I
agree to a contract, and I have you digitially sign a hash of it.
Unbeknownst to you, I had earlier created a second contract with
different wording, but which also hashes to the same value.  Due to the
slowness of public key, most digital signatures are performed on a
digest of the original document.

I have both sources at my disposal from the beginning in this attack,
and am able to tweak each before giving you one (eg add whitespace,
comments in markup language used...).

good day,
