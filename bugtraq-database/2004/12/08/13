As the author of rp-pppoe, I take exception to this being reported as
a "vulnerability".  pppoe is NOT designed to run setuid-root.  You may
as well claim that a setuid "cat" has a vulnerability that lets it read
arbitrary files.

Any Linux distro that installs pppoe setuid root is just plain dangerous.
