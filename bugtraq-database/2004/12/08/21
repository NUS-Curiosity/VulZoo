Greetings and Salutations:

In my first e-mail I meant to congratulate Dan Kaminsky for the fine work
and write-up he did.  Excellent.

That is the worry that I have for MD5 hashed passwords.  It doesn't matter
that you get the *correct* password, just that you have input that will hash
(collide) to the correct MD5 hash.

What I am worried about is the integrity of MD5 hashed passwords.  This
concern is for both Cisco and *NIX passwords.  Lets say that I have a
password:
"ThisIsMySecretPassphrase" MD5 = $1$Vjuf$t5QYnzXL0Sy4tThvqKDGa1

Lets say that I am very smart and I can use software that is able to
generate a collision in the passwords such that the MD5 hashes are the same,
say for example:
"AshEr37WesW28Er4E2" MD5 = $1$Vjuf$t5QYnzXL0Sy4tThvqKDGa1

It does not matter that I don't know the correct password, I have a password
that collides into the correct hash.  I can log into the system with my
generated password.

I just want to make sure that the MD5 hash passwords don't end up being as
easy to compute as the Cisco 7 passwords or the NTLM passwords.  It actually
is beginning to sound like there might be enough of a hole in MD5 that "we"
(collectively) had better start working on SHA-2 hashed passwords ...
