There's a general problem with applications that go through the
file system to destroy the contents of a file.  Unless one uses
very simplistic disk harware and file systems, there is no guarantee
that overwrite requests will actually overwrite the intended bits.
For a example, Solaris 10 ZFS uses copy-on-write, to avoid corruption
when the system crashes in the middle of an update; many disk drives
have write caches built-in so only the last overwrite request takes
effect; and non-volatile memory "disks" have a limited number of
write cycles and try to avoid hot spots.
