Subject: Re: Linux kernel IGMP vulnerabilities


Greetings Paul and Stephen and List...

Paul thanks for clearing that up.  SuSE 9.0 Pro (at least the way two
boxes I take care of are set up) have
/proc/net/igmp
/proc/net/mcfilter
but 'mcfilter' is empty.  
No local users other than myself...  At least that I can tell...  :)

You are not vulnerable to the remote attack described under (3),
however 
your kernel may be still buggy. Note that you need a running process
that 
has manipulated its multicast socket filters. If your kernel is buggy
and 
you have local users such an application can always appear, at a time
you 
don't expect it.
