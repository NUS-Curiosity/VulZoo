This is caused by the usage of the default configuration for the wrong purpose. If you look into the configuration examples in the installation package, there's a configuration file Internet.pi3 (I think the name is self-explaining), which uses plain html error pages and not the more talkative SSI pages, as in the default configuration.
The default configuration has rather been made for web development and feature demonstration so this IMO has never been a security problem. Nevertheless I provided a checkbox in the administration client in order to switch on verbose error messages explicitely in Pi3Web 2.0.1.

This has (afaik) never been reproduced until today. I retested it multiple times using older and recent versions and always got a 404 status code in the response as expected in that case.
