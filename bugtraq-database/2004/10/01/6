Try scanning the Ip address with nmap -A 10.0.0.1

My IR2200 didn't have port 25 open, but it still printed 15-20 sheets of
paper.

The Canon iR85 does not seem to have this "feature".  Doing "telnet
10.0.0.1 25" to either of my iR85 printers returns "Could not open
connection to the host, on port 25: Connect failed".
