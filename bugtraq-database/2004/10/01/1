You have simply changed the subject; this is quite different from your
previous statement that it is possible to create a single canonical version
by selecting a field from multiple choices.

*May* be ambiguous, not *must* be ambiguous. The safe action is to detect
and discard the ambiguous ones.

It does no such thing. The security product has no control over the client
at all, so cannot force it to do anything. This model can only work if the
client interprets the mailbody in the same way as the security agent, and
more importantly does *not* interpret anything else.

In the real world, this simply isn't the case.
