You've really answered your own question...  It is not if "Windows is up to 
snuff," it's "Are the companies deploying solutions up to snuff?"

PG Grade hardware is fine for this kind of application, but default, 
user-grade applications are not (if that is in fact what they are using--  
the images are not clear enough to read.)  And I'm not sure why you are 
saying "Windows failed" in a dedicated system... Their application failed. 
Two very different things... If you can't fathom why Delta would do this, 
why are you saying that it is a Windows problem?

If you ever fly out of E concourse in Salt Lake City, you'll certainly see 
similar problems on their gate arrival/departure status software... They 
simply reboot, you see the pretty Windows 95 (Yes, 95) clouds, and the 
system logs on to the network with a blank password and starts up the 
software again.

Similar operational/security problems would exist if they deployed 
half-baked solutions on any operating system... Calling this a "Windows 
failure" is not accurate or even helpful.
