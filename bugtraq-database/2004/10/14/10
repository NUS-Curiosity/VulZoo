Subject: Format String Vulnerability in Valve's CS-Source




Hi,

if u type '%n' (without ') to in-game-console, your game crashes instantly.

So far, i was not able, to do this remotely with rcon %n e.g., but this does not mean, it is not possible.

Valve also got informed.


P.S. i want the old CS-betas back, where you needed skill instead of luck to hit the enemys head
