Synopsis
========

The gettext utility is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially
allowing a local user to overwrite or change permissions on arbitrary
files with the rights of the user running gettext, which could be the
root user.

Background
==========

gettext is a set of utilities for the GNU Translation Project which
provides a set of tools and documentation to help produce multi-lingual
messages in programs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-devel/gettext      < 0.12.1-r2                   >= 0.12.1-r2

Description
===========

gettext insecurely creates temporary files in world-writeable
directories with predictable names.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
gettext is called, this would result in file access with the rights of
the user running the utility, which could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gettext users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=sys-devel/gettext-0.12.1-r2"
    # emerge ">=sys-devel/gettext-0.12.1.-r2"
