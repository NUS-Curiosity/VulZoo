               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated httpd packages fix a mod_proxy security
                   vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1737
Issue date:        2004-10-13
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1737
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0492
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages that fix a security issue in the Apache Web
server are now available.

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod_proxy, which
can be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order
to exploit this issue, an attacker would need an Apache installation
that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. This
would cause the Apache child processing the request to crash. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0492 to this issue.

All users of the Apache HTTP Server are advised to upgrade to these
erratum packages, which contain a backported fix and are not vulnerable
to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
