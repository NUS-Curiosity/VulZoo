Vulnerability update:
=====================
There is no buffer overflow condition. Device reset is triggered by a watchdog timer
that times out when a long message is being stored in flash memory. Since reset
is triggered in the middle of write process, it may cause unpredictable results,
but in most cases the data does not get corrupted. HexView confirms that there was
a data corruption issue during tests, but it was not possible to reproduce it.

Vendor Status:
==============
Vendor has produced a fix for the vulnerability.

HexView Disclosure Policy:
==========================
HexView notifies vendors that have publicly available contact e-mail
24 hours before disclosing any information to the public. If we are unable
to find vendor's e-mail address or if no reply is received within 24 hours,
HexView will publish vulnerability notification including all technical
details unless the issue is rated as "critical". If vendor does not reply
within 72 hours, HexView may disclose all details for critical vulnerabilities
as well.

If vendor replies within the above mentioned time period, HexView will
announce the vulnerability, but will not disclose the details required to
reproduce it. HexView will also specify the date when full disclosure
containing all the details will be published. The time period between
announcement and full disclosure is 30 days unless there is an agreement
with vendor and appropriate justification for extension. If vendor resolves
the issue earlier than 30 days after announcement, HexView will publish full
disclosure as soon as the fix is available to the public.

at any time.
