-----------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mod_python resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1325
Issue date:        2004-10-03
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1325
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0973
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated mod_python packages that fix a security vulnerability are now
available.

mod_python embeds the Python language interpreter within the Apache httpd
server.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

A bug has been found in mod_python versions 3.0.3 and earlier that can
lead to a denial of service vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0973 to
this issue.

mod_python users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,
which contain a backported patch that corrects this bug.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/ for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
