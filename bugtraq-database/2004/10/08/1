Cannonicalization issue in ASP.NET


Microsoft is currently investigating a reported
vulnerability in Microsoft ASP.NET. An attacker
can send specially crafted requests to the server
and view secured content without providing the
proper credentials. This reported vulnerability
exists in ASP.NET and does not affect ASP.

Their interim "fix" is to add an event handler to
force real path validation for all requests:

Which is certainly not a bad idea but methinks
another performance/security tradeoff at hand.

Thanks for the heads-up Daniel...
