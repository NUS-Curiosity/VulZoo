Subject: Patch available for high risk flaws in the AtHoc Toolbar


Mark Litchfield and John Heasman of NGSSoftware have discovered two high
risk vulnerabilities in the AtHoc Toolbar. The AtHoc toolbar is a plugin for
Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The toolbar is redistributed to users of 

eBay
Accenture
ThomasRegister
ThomasRegional
Juniper Networks
WiredNews
CarFax
Agile PLM

The flaws, that include a remotely exploitable buffer overflow and a format
string bug, have been fixed by AtHoc and an updated toolbar has been
distributed to the affected companies. Clients of any of the companies
listed above that have installed the toolbar should ensure that they
download the updated version.

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about these flaws for three
months. Full details will be published on the 6th of January 2005. This
three month window will allow users of the toolbar the time needed to obtain
the updated version before the details are released to the general public.
This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible disclosure.
