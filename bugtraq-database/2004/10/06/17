Advisory URL:

http://www.gosecure.ca/SecInfo/gosecure-2004-10.txt 

 

Affected System:

 

Neoteris Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) OS, Version 3.x Netories Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) OS, Version 4.x  

 

Description:

 

Neoteris Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) is a well known "clientless" SSL VPN solution for internal network remote access via a standard web browser. It is widely used as an extranet portal for corporate networks.

 

While doing an ethical hacking assessment of a Juniper customer, GoSecure discovered a vulnerability regarding Neoteris IVE password management.

 

When a valid user tries to authenticate via the IVE and the password is expired, the user will be asked to change their password and be directly forwarded to the "changepassword.cgi" without asking for any form of authentication. 

 

The username, authentication server and type will be appended to the �changepassword.cgi� URL.  Since the "changepassword.cgi" allows the user to try the old password as many times as they want, the unit effectively allows a brute force password attack. 

 

If an attacker were to obtain a username through various public information gathering techniques, they could attempt to find an account with a password that has expired and brute force that account to eventually gain unauthorized access.

 

This vulnerability only affects IVE products that are configured with LDAP or an NT domain authentication server. Other type of authentication servers are  not  affected.

 

Solution:

 

The vendor has released a patch and an advisory to address this issue.
