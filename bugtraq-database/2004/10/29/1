New URL spoofing bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer

There is a security bug in Internet Explorer 6.0.2800.1106 (fully patched),
which allowes to show any faked target-address in the status bar of the
window.

The example below will display a faked URL ("http://www.microsoft.com/") in
the status bar of the window, if you move your mouse over the link. Click
on the link and IE will go to "http://www.google.com/" and NOT to
"http://www.microsoft.com/" .

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/"><table><tr><td><a
href="http://www.google.com/">Click here</td></tr></table></a>

Description: Microsoft Internet Explorer can't handle links surrounded by a
table and an other link correct.

The bug can be exploited using HTML mail message too.

Affected software: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Outlook Express,
...

Workaround: Don't click on non-trusted links. Or right-click on links to
see the real target. Or use Copy-and-Paste.
