Indeed (note that ^@ stands for character 0x00). This happens to be a
carbon copy of one of the test cases I posted a while ago in the "Web
browsers - a mini farce" thread. This very problem is already fixed in
nightly builds of Mozilla for quite a while.

You probably should either attribute it properly, or refrain from
re-posting problems reported just days ago altogether...
