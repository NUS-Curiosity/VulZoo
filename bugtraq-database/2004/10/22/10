        CESA-2004-002 - rev 1
        CESA-2004-007 - rev 1


1. Systems affected:

        All KDE 3.2.x releases, KDE 3.3.0 and KDE 3.3.1.


2. Overview:

        Chris Evans notified the KDE security team about multiple
        integer overflow and integer arithmetic flaws in xpdf 3.0.

        These flaws, if exploited, can cause xpdf (and therefore kpdf)
        to hang using 100% CPU, crash the viewer or corrupt the
        program heap. It might be possible to execute arbitrary code.
        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned
        CAN-2004-0889 to this issue.

        kpdf, the KDE pdf viewer, shares code with xpdf 2.02. This
        code is significantly different from the xpdf 3.0 codebase,
        but is also affected by similiar issues. Sebastian Krahmer
        from the SUSE security team developed a patch that corrects
        integer overflows in the XRef code. This patch is made
        available below for kpdf as shipped in the KDE 3.2.x
        releases. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
        assigned CAN-2004-0888 to this issue.

        KDE 3.3.1 contains a kpdf based on xpdf 3.0. We're providing
        a patch to fix the remaining integer overflows in this code
        base.


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied pdf files can be used to execute arbitrary
        code on the client machine.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.


5. Patch:

        Patch for KDE 3.2.3 is available from 
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :

        Patch for KDE 3.3.1 is available from

        01/09/2004 KDE Security Team alerted by Chris Evans
        08/09/2004 Chris Evans finds similiar issues in the xpdf 2.02 
                   codebase which is used by all released kpdf versions.
        24/09/2004 Patch to fix the found issues in xpdf 2.02 developed
                   by Sebastian Krahmer of SUSE security.
        12/10/2004 KDE 3.3.1 release upgrading kpdf to xpdf 3.0 codebase
