Subject: Re: cPanel check only the first 8 characters of webmail password



i had noticed the same thing with the normal login procedure
at my old isp. i don't know if it has been fixed in newer versions
of cpanel but i had set my password to <sitename>_666 so it was
easy to remember... but since my sitename was 8 chars long
my site was easily taken over by some-one :)

can some-one check if that has been fixed allready? i had noticed it
maybe a year ago.
