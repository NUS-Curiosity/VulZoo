Subject: [HV-LOW] Unsafe WAV header handling can cause DoS on Windows


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Unsafe WAV header handling can cause DoS on Windows

Classification:
===============
Level: [LOW]-med-high-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2004*10*21*1
URL: http://www.hexview.com/docs/20041021-1.txt

Overview:
=========
A specially crafted WAV file can cause WAV file property handler
to consume all available CPU resources on Windows XP

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed on the up-to-date version of Windows XP SP1
with all the latest patches and Windows Media Player 10 installed.

Cause and Effect:
=================
Insufficient data validation for WAV file headers causes explorer to enter
an endless loop where it infinitely reads the WAV file.

Demonstration:
==============
Below is an invalid WAV file header. Length of the "fmt " chunk is set to
0xFFFFFFFF (offset 0x10) The usual length of "fmt " chunk is 0x12 bytes.
Windows Explorer property handler thread will enter endless loop trying
to read the file.
