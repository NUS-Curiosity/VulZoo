Can you verify if you have any connections making it out to that
212.175.149.149 address?  It appears to be a host located in Turkey.
I may have already pulled the whois info on this host from ripe.net
From looking at the contact info for the host is looks like possibly a
broadband provider in Turkey.  http://www.telekom.gov.tr/

I'd verify you don't have an active connection to an outside host and
get that windows host off your network so you do some more research.
