Subject: python does mangleme (with IE bugs!)


i've made a port of mangleme:
http://felinemenace.org/~nd/htmler.py
with a few extra quirks (such as file extentions/url types)

it finds IE bugs after roughly 2.5 -> 3 hours and they are at:
http://felinemenace.org/~nd/crash_ie/

They are not the null pointer dereference that Michal found (which 
curiously seems to not own my 6.0.2800.1106.xpsp1?) but some other 
probably non-exploitable problems!

htmler.py doesn't use CGI like mangleme but generates webpages in the 
directory 'html1' numbered 0.html to n.html. 0.html then uses a refresh to 
load 1.html and so on with little user interaction required!

anyway, if you find bugs with it, don't sell to anyone/notify vendors!
