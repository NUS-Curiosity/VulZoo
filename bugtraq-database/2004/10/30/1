Then you end up shifting the problem to the person to write it.

Writing a spec with *that* detail level is nothing else but
programming in pseudocode.

The net result is that at some level people who do the job loose
control over the situation -- either due to the "plain" problem
being just overly broad, or due to the *neccessary* depth of
non-abstraction (as an effect of code coupling) to overflow
finite-sized human mind.  Even though "they should/must".

So you are both right -- maybe it's worth a step off the opposite
corners of the very same soapbox?

Just my UAH.02
