Subject: [HV-HIGH] RIM Blackberry buffer overflow, DoS, data loss


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

RIM Blackberry buffer overflow, DoS, data loss

Classification:
===============
Level: low-med-[HIGH]-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2004*10*12*1

Overview:
=========
RIM Blackberry is a Java-based wireless connectivity solution providing
phone, e-mail, and other services on a variety of handheld devices.

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed on a RIM Blackberry 7230 with RIM Blackberry
Operating System software version 3.7.1.41. The Blackberry was synchronized
with Microsoft Exchange server using Blackberry Enterprise Server for
Microsoft Exchange.

Cause and Effect:
=================
Insufficient data validation for incoming calendar data makes possible
to cause buffer overflow condition leading to stack corruption. As a result,
it is possible to reboot the device (all stored messages will be lost since
RAM storage will be reinitialized). It is also possible to execute code
embedded by the attacker. It should be mentioned that Blackberry developers
tools are freely available.

Demonstration:
==============
The issue can easily be reproduced by sending a standard Microsoft Outlook
meeting request message with very long string (over 128K) in the "Location:"
field. To force immediate user notification, set meeting date/time to the
past. The Blackberry reboots when it tries to notify the user. No user action
is required. It is possible to render Blackberry device completely useless by
queuing a number of such messages into user's mailbox.

==============
At the time of release vendor was not aware of the vulnerability.
