This is far from the first time that MS has "fixed" a vulnerability by 
addressing the specific form presented in a PoC or used in some "in the 
wild" exploit, rather than by looking into the true underlying problem. 
I'd be very surprised if many more such regressions are not present in 
IE, but it's be a rather dull job testing for them all.

Of course, one of the reasons folk pay the "Windows tax" is for MS to 
do that dull, largely thankless and unseen (if done properly) work, on 
their behalf...
