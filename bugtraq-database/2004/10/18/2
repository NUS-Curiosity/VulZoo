1. Topic:

Updated kernel packages that fix security vulnerabilities which may 
allow local users to gain root privileges are now available. These 
packages also resolve other minor issues.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386, i586, i686, athlon
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386, i586, i686, athlon

3. Problem description:

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

iDefense reported a buffer overflow flaw in the ISO9660 filesystem code.
An attacker could create a malicious filesystem in such a way that they
could gain root privileges if that filesystem is mounted. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0109 to this issue. This issue is addressed in the Red Hat 7.3
packages referenced in this advisory, having been previously fixed for Red
Hat 9.

These packages also contain an updated fix with additional checks for
issues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0003 to this issue. This issue was addressed in the Red Hat 7.3
packages referenced in this advisory, having been previously fixed for Red
Hat 9.

A bug in the SoundBlaster 16 code which did not properly handle certain
sample sizes has been fixed. This flaw could be used by local users to
crash a system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0178 to this issue.

Paul Starzetz discovered flaws in the Linux kernel when handling file
offset pointers. These consist of invalid conversions of 64 to 32-bit file
offset pointers and possible race conditions. A local unprivileged user
could make use of these flaws to access large portions of kernel memory.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0415 to this issue.

During an audit of the Linux kernel, SUSE discovered a flaw that allowed
a user to make unauthorized changes to the group ID of files in certain
circumstances. In the 2.4 kernel, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, the only way this could happen is through the kernel nfs server. A
user on a system that mounted a remote file system from a vulnerable
machine may be able to make unauthorized changes to the group ID of
exported files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0497 to this issue.

A flaw was found in Linux kernel versions 2.4 and 2.6 for x86 and x86_64
that allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by
triggering a signal handler with a certain sequence of fsave and frstor
instructions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0554 to this issue.

Enhancements were committed to the 2.6 kernel by Al Viro which enabled the
Sparse source code checking tool to check for a certain class of kernel
bugs. A subset of these fixes also applies to various drivers in the 2.4
kernel. These flaws could lead to privilege escalation or access to kernel
memory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0495 to these issues.

Integer overflow in the Linux Broadcom 5820 cryptonet driver allows local
users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0619 to this issue. This driver has been removed
from this release.

Integer overflow in the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) driver allows local users to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0658 to this issue.

The do_fork function in Linux 2.4.x before 2.4.26 had a bug which could
trigger a memory leak leading to a denial of service. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0427 to this issue.

An integer signedness error in the cpufreq proc handle allowed local users
to gain privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0228 to this issue.

The JFS file system code in Linux 2.4.x had an information leak in which
in-memory data is written to the device for the JFS file system, which
allowed local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the raw
device. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0181 to this issue.

The XFS file system code in Linux 2.4.x had an information leak in which
in-memory data is written to the device for the XFS file system, which
allowed local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the raw
device. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0133 to this issue.

In addition, these packages correct further minor issues:

An bug in the e1000 network driver. This bug could be used by local users
to leak small amounts of kernel memory (CAN-2004-0535).

Inappropriate permissions on /proc/scsi/qla2300/HbaApiNode (CAN-2004-0587).

Potential buffer overflow in the panic() function (CAN-2004-0394).

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain
backported security patches that correct these issues.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank all those who reported the various
issues discussed here.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh <package>" and
modify system settings to boot the kernel you have installed. To
do this, edit /boot/grub/grub.conf and change the default entry to
"default=0" (or, if you have chosen to use LILO as your boot loader,
edit /etc/lilo.conf and run lilo)

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the 
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you 
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. 
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/download for directions on how 
to configure yum and apt-get.

Note that this may not automatically pull the new kernel in if you have
configured apt/yum to ignore kernels. If so, follow the manual instructions
above.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>

10. Special Notes:

If you use lilo, you will have to edit your lilo.conf file and shorten 
the label of this kernel.  The label is too long for lilo, but not for 
grub.

This update removes support for the Broadcom 5820 cryptonet hardware. If
you need support for this device, you will need to make special
arrangements before applying this update.
