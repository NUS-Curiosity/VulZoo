    Security Vulnerabilitys in asycpict.dll 1.0 Advisory


Hi John
I have done a check for the asycpict.dll in 4 different XP system and i did not found it.
A search done at the Microsoft web site shows that this dll is installed only with Frontpage 97 and 98.
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;144190
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;161780
How you can say that all XP system are affected by this vulnerability ?

Thanks
Marco
