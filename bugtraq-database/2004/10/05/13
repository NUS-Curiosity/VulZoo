Hi.

This is only because PHP is configured to display errors, on this server, to the web browser, instead of to a log file or syslog.  This is not a particular vulnerability with this software, although if they are including based on ?show=<..> it could have many fopen()-based include vulnerabilities, providing they're not running safe mode.
