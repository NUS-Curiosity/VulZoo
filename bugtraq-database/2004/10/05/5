Subject: Patch available for critical IBM DB2 Universal Database flaws


Researchers at NGSSoftware have discovered multiple critical/high risk
vulnerabilities in IBM's DB2 Universal Database. Versions affected include

DB2 8.1 Fixpak 7 and earlier

IBM has updated Fixpak 6 and 7 to 6a and 7a to include fixes for these
flaws. In all, 20 vulnerabilities, mostly remotely exploitable buffer
overflows, have been addressed by the updates. The updated Fixpaks have just
been released and can be downloaded from

http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/downloadv8.html

The flaws fixed in these Fixpaks equate to NGSS BUGID 102, 103, 104, 105,
106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121
and 122 from the Vendor Notification Alerts -

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about these flaws for three
months. Full details will be published on the 5th of January 2005. This 
three month window will allow DB2 database administrators the time needed to
test and apply the Fixpak before the details are released to the general
public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible disclosure.

NGSSQuirreL for DB2, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment scanner
and security manager for IBM DB2, has been updated to check for and
positively identify these flaws in DB2 database servers on the network. More
information about NGSSQuirreL for DB2 can be found at
