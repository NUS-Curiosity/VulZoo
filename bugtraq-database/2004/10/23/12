Subject: windows 2000 server terminal server denial of service




Open thousands of connections from a terminal server (windows 2000 server) to the clients causes a denial of service of the server itself with most connections being dropped or reset,
It is to create a VB/VBA macro that open several connections to ports open on the client machines and this will exhaust the terminal server bandwidth.
Quite successful where the clients are running windows 95 or windows 98 since opening several connections to port 139 on the clients will also cause a denial of service on the file and printer sharing service running in the client effectively preventing people from printing to the printer connected to their local machine from the terminal server.
