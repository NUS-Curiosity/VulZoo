1. Topic:

An updated gaim package that fixes several security issues is now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Issues fixed with this gaim release include:

Multiple buffer overflows that affect versions of Gaim 0.75 and earlier.
1) When parsing cookies in a Yahoo web connection, 2) YMSG protocol
overflows parsing the Yahoo login webpage, 3) a YMSG packet overflow, 4)
flaws in the URL parser, and 5) flaws in HTTP Proxy connect. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0006 to these issues.

A buffer overflow in Gaim 0.74 and earlier in the Extract Info Field
Function used for MSN and YMSG protocol handlers. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0007 to this issue.

An integer overflow in Gaim 0.74 and earlier, when allocating memory for
a directIM packet results in heap overflow. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0008 to this issue.

Buffer overflow bugs were found in the Gaim MSN protocol handler. In
order to exploit these bugs, an attacker would have to perform a man in
the middle attack between the MSN server and the vulnerable Gaim client.
Such an attack could allow arbitrary code execution. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0500 to this issue.

An integer overflow bug has been found in the Gaim Groupware message
receiver. It is possible that if a user connects to a malicious server,
an attacker could send carefully crafted data which could lead to
arbitrary code execution on the victims machine. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0754 to this issue.

A shell escape bug has been found in the Gaim smiley theme file
installation. When a user installs a smiley theme, which is contained
within a tar file, the unarchiving of the data is done in an unsafe
manner. An attacker could create a malicious smiley theme that would
execute arbitrary commands if the theme was installed by the victim. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0784 to this issue.

Buffer overflow bugs have been found in the Gaim URL decoder, local
hostname resolver, and the RTF message parser. It is possible that a
remote attacker could send carefully crafted data to a vulnerable client
and lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0785 to this issue.

Users of Gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package which
contains Gaim version 0.82.1 and is not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
