1. Topic:

Updated squirrelmail packages that fix a security vulnerability are now
available.

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

An SQL injection flaw was found in SquirrelMail version 1.4.2 and earlier.
If SquirrelMail is configured to store user addressbooks in the database, a
remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary SQL statements.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0521 to this issue.

A number of cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws in SquirrelMail version 1.4.2
and earlier could allow remote attackers to execute script as other web
users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CAN-2004-0519 and CAN-2004-0520 to these issues.

Users of squirrelmail should upgrade to this updated package which
contains a new version of the software and is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/ for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
