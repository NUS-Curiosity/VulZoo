If this is the same bug I reported over one year ago
http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/hlclientfs-adv.txt probably Valve has not
patched it yet or something similar (I don't play with Half-Life from
years).

About exploitation, the only method I found was versus the connected clients
using the "Unknown command" reply sent by the server directly to them.
