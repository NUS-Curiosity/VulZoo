Subject: Gaucho v1.4 Build 145 Buffer Overflow




Gaucho version 1.4 Build 145 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when receiving malformed emails from a POP3 server. This vulnerability is triggered if Gaucho receives from the POP3 server, a specially crafted email that has an abnormally long string in the Content-Type field of the email header. This string will overwrite EIP via SEH, and can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
