In fact, you are even more right than you seem to think. Sf.net's
pserver access is actually anonymous and read-only. Project data in
the SF repository is considered public, and open to anonymous read
access anyway. Their pserver access doesn't add anything to that.

That is so, and SSH access, with a system identity that is a member
of the project's development team, is required for committing changes
to a project repository.

Indeed. The registration form asks you to enter a real name, and
a valid E-mail address which is verified by a confirmation E-mail,
but there is no verification beyond that.
