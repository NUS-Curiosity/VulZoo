Vendor : typepad.com
URL : http://typepad.com
Risk : Cross site scripting

Description: TypePad is a powerful, hosted weblogging service that gives
users the richest set of features to immediately share and publish
information -- like travel logs, journals and digital scrapbooks -- on
the Web. TypePad lets people communicate, publicly or privately, with
the audience of their choosing.



Cross site scripting: The filtering script for the name form doesnt
filter " if preceeded by a ?. The cross site scripting works because the
<a href=" tag can be closed by a target url with " which then permits
the user to use such oneventhandles as onmouseover.

Solution: The easiest way would be to just replace all characters with
their &#xx; equivilant.

Credits: Credits goto my loving fiance, you push me todo things i never
thought possible.

Exploit: This is exploited by passing a url with malicious javascript to
the name variable.
