Looks like rfa.org uses Speedera (see the log of finding and querying
the authoritative name servers below).  To quote from their web site at
http://www.speedera.com/primary/Tech/Over.htm : "Speedera's highly
distributed, robust network relies on a worldwide set of probes and
global traffic managers to make real-time decisions to intelligently
route users' requests to the best location and best server."

It sounds like this is just part of Speedera's attempt to route users to
the appropriate server.


$ whois rfa.org
 ...
Name Server:DNSAUTH1.SYS.GTEI.NET
Name Server:DNSAUTH2.SYS.GTEI.NET
Name Server:DNSAUTH3.SYS.GTEI.NET

$ host www.rfa.org DNSAUTH1.SYS.GTEI.NET
 ...
www.rfa.org is an alias for www.rfaweb.org.

$ whois rfaweb.org
 ...
Name Server:DNS31.REGISTER.COM
Name Server:DNS32.REGISTER.COM

$ host www.rfaweb.org DNS31.REGISTER.COM
 ...
www.rfaweb.org is an alias for rfa.speedera.net.

$ whois speedera.net
