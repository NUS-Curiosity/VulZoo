Caching DNS (i.e. doing transparent proxying for DNS) means 
that the ISP intercepts all DNS traffic. The caching you refer
to only applies when users are using the ISP's name servers.

I don't know of any ISP who would be intercepting DNS queries.

When you use nslookup and specify a server, the query is sent directly
to the server you specify, not the name server of your ISP.

Cheers,
