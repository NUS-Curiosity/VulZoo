You can change options, but cannot save them or install software. It 
will fail silently, or with dubious error messages.

I experienced this after upgrading, when I suddenly was not able to 
change network settings or install new packages when starting the yast 
modules from the K-menu. I first thought that graphical yast was broken 
until I realized that it never asked me for a root password.

So it's not so much a security bug as just a normal usability bug. It's 
just useless to start yast without root privileges.
