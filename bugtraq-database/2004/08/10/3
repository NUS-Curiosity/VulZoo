I think we are in agreement - witout necessarily having started out that
way!

The admin, training and back office costs associated with any authentication
mechanism have to be part of the TCO.
Secure and partable as smartcard are, their TCO is often prohibitive.
Among my customers, OTP devices like SecureID can also be cost prohibitive -
but more affordable than Smartcards.  Biometrics appear to be somewhere
between those two cost levels, and password regimes are the lowest TCO.

For these reasons, I suspect, many choose to rely on ID/password regimes,
since the admin cost of password regimes is only partially replaced by the
equivalent function's overheads in OTP and smartcard regimes - lets not
forget permission changes, revocations, and other user maintenance costs.
When the cost of password support is added up along side those aspects, then
passwords are very cost effective.   

As we've just discussed the cost of better authentication tools like
biometrics and OTP, then a risk/value judgment will occur inevitably
depending on each site's perception of risk.  
I deliberately exclude PKI from the preceding since imho, PKI is merely a
tool that verifies after the fact, that the correct password was entered at
some time.

Why yes Lyal, it is...

Mea culpa...but:

TCO is not as simple as you lay it out for your smartcard either.  We were 
apples-to-apples there for a bit...but, let's drive into your purported 
TCO costs on the smartcard there, shall we?  First, you seem to have no 
back-end administration (this is a self-maintained model you have? please 
explain how that works) to deal with lost cards, forgotten PINs, 
failed/trashed hardware, etc.  Additionally, in any reasonably sized 
enterprise, you'll need resources allocated to handle new hires, machine 
moves, upgrades, etc.  If you intend to cost-burden the existing staff 
that's fine...but it's still there.  System integration? You're telling me 
your smartcard system has none?  Unless you just have your system doing 
authentications at boot, you most certainly do have intergration.  If you 
intend to secure some environments more than others, like, at the 
application level, you have the same integration issues with either system 
(and probably worse with yours, as RSA has been banging around at this a 
long time, and the list of apps that RSA can bolt onto is extensive)...so 
let's call that a wash too.

So let's jack your per-seat price up accordingly, ok?  But you know, tell 
you what, let's leave your TCO where it is and bear in mind that I was 
responding to a $1000/seat number from you, not the $210 + consultant you 
just tossed back. (Sorry if this sounds sarcastic, but you've changed the 
parameters and ommited factors as important to the TCO as I did, and then 
lowered your number just to sound more cost-effective...not cricket, old 
boy)

Now, let's take a look at a typical RSA solution, street prices, for 250 
users, and remember that the cost scales down from here:

server software (w/24x7 support), about $20,000 US
server hardware (trivial, but let's toss a couple of blades at it just for 
fun) $10,000 US
Cards (generous here, very) @ $70.00 US X 250 = $17,500 US

I'm going to burden my existing staff with back-end support and admin, 
just like you did.  So, we have a per-seat, fully burdened TCO of 
$190/seat

In a mobile workforce there are additional benefits as well, Lyal...like 
not having laptop users lug around a card reader that they have to a) 
remember, and b) plug in every time they want to use the PC.  You may well 
respond by saying that's trivial...but then, you aren't the user, he won't 
say that.  The easier we can make his use of secure products and systems 
the more likely he is to use them, would you agree?
