Subject: A word of caution on the use of suphp

Hi,

I've sent this "advisory" to the suphp author over 2 weeks ago and to
the suphp mailinglist more than 1 week ago.
Until now, I didn't get a reply so I'm assuming noone could care less.

This information is intended for people who plan to use suphp as a
replacement for the standard PHP module in apache.

greets,
-- Steven
