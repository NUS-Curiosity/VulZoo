Subject: Re: Netscape Navigator 7.2  failure to isolate browser tabs (was Re: Computer Network Defence Vulnerability Alert State)


This is a known issue with Apples Java plugin ... not netscape or 
mozilla.
See: http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162134

It has to due with the plugin ignoring clipRect and NPWindow
