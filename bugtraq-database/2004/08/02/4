You are specifically told that the information included in the report
contains confidential information, if you are concerned with privacy,
zip it and add a password or use another more secure method of
transferring the file such as the TSR upload feature of mysonicwall.com,
this has been this way for years.

Subject: Sonicwall diag tool includes VPN credentlials



Our Sonicwall Pro 300 firewall appliance includes a diagnostic tool
called "Tech Support Report", which dumps the current configuration info
to a plain text file. I have been asked by Sonicwall personnel to email
this file as an attachment during several tech. support calls, without
any additional warning or explanation. One of the items included in the
report is a plain-text copy of the Shared Secret used for authenticating
VPN users. Unless everything I've read about protecting this kind of
information is suddenly not true, sending unprotected shared secrets to
anyone via email is very bad idea. I also doubt that tech. support
personnel need this in most cases and, if they do, the customer should
be notified and asked for it explicitly.
