There  is a difference between inability to create good protection (both
strong  and  convenient)  and  inability to protect. Of cause, there are
ways  to  implement  protection:  you can check file after each 100KB of
data  (anyway  only first X KB of files are usually checked by antiviral
software)  you  can  send  one  byte  per minute, you can send fake HTML
headers  one  in a minute (they will be ignored), or you can simply show
HTML  page with your own progress bar for large files, you can recognize
file  type and act depending on it. Any of this is "hack", because there
is no standardised way.
