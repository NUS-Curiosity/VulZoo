Subject: RE: Sonicwall diag tool includes VPN credentlials


Hello,

Yes, I have also ran into this several times with the SonicWall tech
support.  They ALWAYS ask me to send the TSR, with all the options checked,
via regular email.  I did not realize just how sensitive these were until I
actually read one.  I immediately changed my shared secret password and had
all my VPN clients updated after that.  I refuse to send these reports via
email now, but they still always ask.  I now attach them to my https
mysonicwall page.  I am just amazed how supposed "security professionals "
always advocate sending this report via email.

Jody

Before downloading there is a Warning "You are about to export sensitive
information in plaintext format. Continue?". So the firmware tells you,
what you are doing.

The shared secret is not included in the standard report. You have to tag
"VPN Keys" before generating the report.
But sure, the Tech Support Report includes other sensitive information (IP
networks connected, routing tables, mail addresses etc).

I would not send this report by plain mail. Normally the TechSupport
Report should be added to a https protected customer portal site at
sonicwall. I had never been asked by sonicwall tech support to send a
report by mail.
