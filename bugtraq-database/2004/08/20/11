Time  synchronisation  doesn't require authentication, at least it looks
like  packets  are  only signed with computer key. That's why it's still
possible  to  change time across all forest with a single packet, if one
of the forest's reliable time sources or PDC emulator in root domain use
external SNTP server.

Before  Windows  2000 SP4 it was possible to set date far in future (for
example  to  2038). Locked accounts, expired certificates in addition to
"problem  2038"  (Jan,  19  2038 is maximum date value for 32 bit time_t
timestamp used in many C compilers). But setting date 12 hours in future
or 12 hours in past still can produce a lot of harm.
