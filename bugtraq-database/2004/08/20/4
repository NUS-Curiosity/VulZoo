Libdisassembly is simply a python library for disassembling x86 opcodes. 
It has been made for Immunity's PDB Project (a vulnerability development 
focused debugger), and is partially based on mammon's libdisasm opcode 
list (http://www.eccentrix.com/members/mammon/). There is still a lot of 
work to do with the Metadata, but the library tries to return as much 
information it can get off of an opcode.

USAGE:

ie:
  $ objdump -x /bin/cat | grep .text
    11 .text         00001e48  08048b00  08048b00  00000b00  2**4
  $ ./disassemble.py /bin/cat 0xb00 0x1e48

Disassembling file /bin/cat at offset: 0x2816
00002816:   mov           0x8(%ebp),%edx
00002819:   mov           0xc(%ebp),%eax
0000281C:   mov           %edx,(%esp,1)
