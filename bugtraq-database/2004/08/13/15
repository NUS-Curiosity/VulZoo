Nicholas,

 Thanks for the insight.  I've received several replies telling me to look
at McAfee (yadda-yadda) and other sites.  I am well aware of the Zerolin
VBS script as I researched it before posting.  You've provided what
insight I was looking for on the java script side.

Mark, I think this is what we're looking for.  Also, keep us updated as to
what else you see as this could very well be a new version and they are
indeed 'testing'.



Thanks again,
