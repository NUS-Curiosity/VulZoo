Subject: NGSEC's response to Idefense overflow protections whitepaper. (PART II)



Mr Johnson,

We have made available a paper conatining several (unpublished by
iDefense's paper) tests agains PAX-like solutions in WIN32. Only 
tests not deep information on how this products works. 

Grab it at: [264 KB]

http://www.ngsec.com/docs/whitepapers/NGSEC-Windows_overflow_protection_comparison.pdf

With this paper will try be more accurate than Idefense's one in their
windows testing. We will also try to clarify some reader 
mis-interpretations such as StackDefender not protecting .data sections
in avtp.c testbed (see log below).

If we succeed with our purposes is up to the reader. We encourage the
readers to perform these tests (NGSEC sd_tester.c and Idefense avtp.c)
and get their own conclusions. Not just reading states and claims from 
both parties as they may be in-accurated.

Mr Johnson, we respect your wish to defend your company reputation too.
But disclosing PRIVATE mails, partial contents on your INTERESTED parts
is definetively not the way and a very bad idea. 

We could disclose some too for the readers but it is against our policy.

NGSEC is no longer feeding this threat. Reader make your own conclusions.

Best regards,
