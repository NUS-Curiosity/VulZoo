I can confirm this is also a problem on windows NT SP6a with the
latest patched version of IE. On this machine no scrolling is needed
it simply locks up the screen and the BIOS emitts an angry beep,

A hard power cycle  is needed to get going again.

Upon restart windows throws me into VGA mode and brings up a dialog
indicating an invalid screen resolution was choosen.
