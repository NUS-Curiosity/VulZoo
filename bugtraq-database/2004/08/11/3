Pentest Limited Security Advisory

WIDCOMM Bluetooth Connectivity Software Buffer Overflows

Advisory Details
----------------
Title: WIDCOMM Bluetooth Connectivity Software Buffer Overflows
Announcement date: 11 August 2004
Advisory Reference: ptl-2004-03
CVE Name: CAN-2004-0775
Products: WIDCOMM Bluetooth Connectivity Software
Vulnerability Type : Buffer Overflow
Vendor-URL: http://www.widcomm.com
Vendor-Status: Fixed in release 3.0
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: N/A
Advisory URL: http://www.pentest.co.uk/documents/ptl-2004-03.html

Vulnerability Description
--------------------------
WIDCOMM's products provides a full range of Bluetooth connectivity
solutions for PCs, PDAs, mobile phones, headsets, digital cameras,
access points, and various output devices.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can submit various malformed service
requests via Bluetooth, triggering a buffer overflow and executing
arbitrary code on the vulnerable device.

On Windows platforms this allows arbitrary code execution under the
context of the currently logged on user account.


Vulnerable Versions
--------------------

WIDCOMM supply their Bluetooth Communications software to other
companies to allow them to integrate Bluetooth technology into their
devices. They also supply Bluetooth SDK's to enable developers to create
applications that use Bluetooth. Therefore it may not be immediately
apparent that you are using the WIDCOMM Bluetooth software and version
numbers may vary.

Pentest Limited have tested for the reported vulnerabilities against
BTStackServer version 1.3.2.7 and 1.4.2.10  on both Windows XP and
Windows 98 which ships with MSI Bluetooth Dongles. We have also tested
this against an HP IPAQ 5450 running WinCE 3.0 with Bluetooth software
version 1.4.1.03.

Pentest Limited have also written a proof of concept exploit for Windows
XP.

Whilst the above platforms are the only platforms tested and confirmed
to be exploitable by Pentest Limited, discussions with the vendor lead
us to believe that are all versions prior to version BTW & BT-CE/PPC 3.0
are affected by this vulnerability.

WIDCOMM has not confirmed whether BT-PPC/Phone Edition, BT-Smartphone,
BTE-Mobile or BTE are vulnerable.

Fix
---

Until version 3 of the WIDCOMM software becomes available from WIDCOMM
or their customers/partners Pentest Limited recommend that end users
stop using the vulnerable WIDCOMM Bluetooth software or set their
Bluetooth device configuration to be non-discoverable or hidden. This
will not stop the device from being vulnerable but it may limit the
exposure.
