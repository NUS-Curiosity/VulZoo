Subject: Driver for display goes to a infinite loop by viewing a html!




Hello everybody,

View this page:

Try scrolling the picture for few seconds...[ don't kill the process] I have tested it on several machines with intel vga. it reboots Winxp with a fetal error because The driver for the display device got stuck in an infinite loop.

ps: I've tested with firefox and IE browser... The exploit isn't triggered via a opera browser. There have been reports, Matrox G400 video card, driver (version 5.82.18.0.) on windows 2000 (sp4) also crashes.

The image itself is not big but the html resizing of it is big.
