This is just crazy!!! :-)

> Try scrolling the picture for few seconds...[ don't kill the process] I have tested it on several machines with intel vga. it reboots Winxp with a fetal error because The driver for the display device got stuck in an infinite loop.

I tried this on a Dell Optiplex GX270 (It's got a builtin Intel 82865G Graphics
Controller). Windows XP with SP2 is installed. Accessing this page with IE
causes the system to crash as you desribe. If I use Netscape 7.1 on this
machine it just shows the page quite quickly and nothing further happens.
Mozilla 1.4.2 on Fedora Core 1 is similarly unaffected by this page.
