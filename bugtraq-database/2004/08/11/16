On a Dell GX260 with an "Intel Extreme" controller using IE 6.0.2 and Win2000, it loads a black image then closes and re-opens the page in a continuous loop. It doesn't allow access to the application until the graphic is done loading. The CPU is pegged, but it doesn't crash the system.

Mozilla 1.7.2 on RedHat 9 / XFree86 4.4 / P2-400mhz opened a big, black 
image. Scrolled around, no noticeable effect. Still running.
