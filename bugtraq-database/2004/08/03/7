- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It has been reported that there are two vulnerabilities in Common Desktop
Environment (CDE) which can be used to obtain root user privileges:

* 902695: libDtHelp has a buffer overflow
  http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/575804
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0834

* 913116: dtlogin double-free vulnerability
  http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/179804
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0368

A new CDE package has been released to address these vulnerabilities.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
resolving this issue.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

CDE is an optional product and is not installed by default.

To determine if CDE is installed, execute the following
command:

  # /usr/sbin/versions -b CDE

This will return a result similar to the following:

     Name                 Date        Description
  I  CDE                  5/11/03     Common Desktop Environment, 5.3.3


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a new CDE 5.3.4 inst package to address these security issues.
The new CDE 5.3.4 inst package is available on the IRIX 6.5.25 Applications
CD or ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/patches/6.5.25/

         Version                      Vulnerable?   Other Actions
