Subject: RE: Clear text password exposure in Datakey's	tokens and
 smartcards



Guys...

RSA has been doing PIN cards for ages...I don't get the hangup on 
SmartCards vs "plain old" something you have/something you know two factor

http://www.rsasecurity.com/node.asp?id=1311

Cost of entry/ownership is nothing remotely close to the $1000 you mention 
Lyal...in fact, it's under 1/10 of that on a per seat basis...

Why get hung up on it being a smartcard, when you can do two factor with a 
much lower entry cost and do it, frankly, easier?
