Anonymous Surfing Via Gmail Login Window - Poor
Sanitization

User can do anonymous surfing (apart form other cool
tricks) from Gmail login window. The window is small,
still checking your mails via google is phun. :)
1. Open
https://gmail.google.com/?dest=http%3A%2F%2Fblablabla.
2. The login window will display an error page.
3. Click on it.
4. Now user is directed to google.com
5. Rest you can log in anonymously via google search
engine. You can browse this window using Arrow Keys.

Regards
Punjabi MC

Je kade na Ranjah kan padvonda, 
                        je Heer khavandi churi na.
Mirze ne fer marna ki si, 
                        je hundi majboori na.
