Subject: Dynix Webpac Input Validation


Package: Epixtech / Dynix Webpac
Date: 23/08/2004
Problem Class: Input validation
Advisory: Wil Allsopp
Email: straylight@...hnophreaks.co.uk
Vendor status: Informed but unresponsive

Description
-----------
Webpac is a widely deployed library solutions system
(search google for webpac) that allows catalogue
services to be provided through a web interface.

The Epixtech / Dynix range of library solutions
software, most notably Webpac, contain numerous SQL
injection flaws. 

Why is this a problem?
----------------------

Login bypass, command execution via stored procedures
and denial of service attacks against back end
databases. Both early and recent versions are
vulnerable.
