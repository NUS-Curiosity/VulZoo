               remote buffer overflow

 NOTICE:
 There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
 provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
 as soon as possible.

 INITIAL RELEASE:    23 August 2004


 POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:  Remote buffer overflow and
 arbitrary code execution

 SOURCE:  HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
               HP Software Security Response Team


 REFERENCES:    http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/180


 VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
 A potential security vulnerability has been identified with
 Network Security Services (NSS) library suite using SSLv2 ciphers
 running on HP-UX.  A buffer overflow could be exploited remotely
 to execute arbitrary code or create a Denial of Service against
 products or services that implement vulnerable versions of the
 NSS library.


 SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions
 are listed.

 Any application or product that integrates the NSS library suite
 and which implements SSLv2 ciphers may be affected.
 Netscape - Directory Server (NDS) - currently supported versions,
 Netscape - Administration Server (AS) - currently supported
 versions.

 BACKGROUND:
 Internet Security Systems, Inc. (ISS) has reported buffer
 overflow vulnerabilities in all known releases of the Network
 Security Services (NSS) library suite.

    http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/180

 AFFECTED VERSIONS

 Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
      search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
      for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
      recommended patch or update is installed.

 HP-UX B.11.23
 HP-UX B.11.11
 HP-UX B.11.00
 =============
 For versions NDS  6.02, and 6.11 with AS 6.01 and 6.1
 NetscapeDirSvr6.NDS-SLAPD
 NetscapeDirSvr6.NDS-ADM
 action: follow procedure described in the Resolution section.

 For version NDS 4.16 with AS 4.2
 NscapeDir40SrvUS.DirectoryServer
 NscapeDir40SrvUS.AdminServer
 action: upgrade to NDS 6.11.

 END AFFECTED VERSIONS


 NOTE: If still using NDS version 4.16 HP recommends upgrading
      to version 6.11 or subsequent and following the
      recommendations herein.

 This bulletin will be updated when a new NDS release is
available.


 RESOLUTION:
 Disabling all SSLv2 cipher suites effectively mitigates these
vulnerabilities.

 NOTE: Simply disabling SSLv2 does not fully protect against
      attack.  All SSLv2 cipher suites must be disabled explicitly
      in order to perform this mitigation.

 Instructions for disabling the SSLv2 cipher suites for Netscape
 Directory Server (NDS) and Administration Server (AS) are
 provided below.

 A. Netscape Directory Server (NDS)

 These changes apply to Netscape Directory Server versions
 6.02 and 6.11.

 1. Stop NDS.
 2. Open the
    /var/opt/netscape/servers/slapd-{instance}/config/dse.ldif
    file in an editor.
 3. DisablealloftheSSLv2ciphersinthe"dn:cn=encryption,cn=config"
    entry.
    To accomplish this, add the following to the comma separated
    list of ciphers in the "nsSSL3ciphers" attribute:
                -rc4
                -rc4export
                -rc2
                -rc2export
                -des
                -desede3

 It is important to include the minus sign before each cipher when
 modifying the "nsSSL3ciphers" to negate the attribute in order to
 tell Netscape Directory Server not to support those ciphers.

 For example, the nsSSL3ciphers attribute with the correct
 ciphers disabled:

 nsSSL3Ciphers:
 -rsa_null_md5,+rsa_rc4_128_md5,+rsa_rc4_40_md5,+rsa_rc2_40_md5,
 +rsa_des_sha,+rsa_fips_des_sha,+rsa_3des_sha,+rsa_fips_3des_sha,
 +fortezza,+fortezza_rc4_128_sha,+fortezza_null,
 +tls_rsa_export1024_with_rc4_56_sha,
 +tls_rsa_export1024_with_des_cbc_sha,
 -rc4,-rc4export,-rc2,-rc2export,-des,-desede3

 3. Start NDS.

 NOTE: If modification of cipher preferences is performed through
       the Directory Server Console, any previous entries added
       manually will be lost, and the process of modifying the
       dse.ldif file will be required again.

 B. Administration Server (AS)

 To disable SSLv2 via the admin server console:
 1.  Login to admin server console
 2.  Select the Administration Server
 3.  Select the Configuration tab
 4.  Select the Encryption Tab
 5.  Click the Cipher Settings button
 6.  Uncheck all ciphers in the SSL 2.0 tab
 7.  Click Ok, then Save
 8.  Restart the server

 To disable SSLv2 manually via the configuration files:
 1. Stop the server.

 2. Edit /var/opt/netscape/servers/admin-serv/config/server.xml
    a. In the SSLPARAMS element there is an SSLv2 attribute.
       Set this to "off".
    b. To also disable all of the SSLv2 ciphers, replace "+" with
       "-" in the ssl2ciphers attribute for all of the ciphers
       listed.

 An example follows:
  ssl2ciphers="-rc4,-rc4export,-rc2,-rc2export,
  -des,-desede3" ssl3="on"
  ssl3tlsciphers="+rsa_rc4_128_md5,+rsa_3des_sha,+rsa_des_sha,
  +rsa_rc4_40_md5,+rsa_rc2_40_md5,-rsa_null_md5"

 3. Edit /var/opt/netscape/servers/admin-serv/config/local.conf
    a. In the configuration.encryption.nsSSL2 attribute,
       set the value to "off".
    b. To also disable all of the SSLv2 ciphers, replace "+" with
      "-" in the configuration.encryption.nsSSL2Ciphers attribute
      for all of the ciphers listed.

 An example follows:
  configuration.encryption.nsSSL2: off
  configuration.encryption.nsSSL3: on
  configuration.encryption.nsSSL2Ciphers: -desede3,-des,-rc4,-rc2,
  -rc4export,-rc2export
  configuration.encryption.nsSSL3Ciphers: +fips_3des_sha,
  +rsa_des_sha,-rsa_null_md5,+rsa_rc4_128_md5,+rsa_rc2_40_md5,
  +fips_des_sha,+rsa_rc4_40_md5,+rsa_3des_sha

 4. Start the server


 MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - NonUpdate

 follow the procedure in the Resolution section of this bulletin.

 For Netscape Directory Server (NDS) 6.02 and 6.11 follow the

   docId=hpuxSecurityMatrix
 Or via anonymous ftp:
   ftp://ftp.itrc.hp.com/export/patches/hp-ux_patch_matrix/

 The HP-UX Security Patch Matrix, updated daily, categorizes
 security patches by platform/OS release, and by Bulletin topic.
 The Security Patch Check tool completely automates the process of
 reviewing the Security Patch Matrix for HP-UX 11.XX Versions.

 NOTE: Installing patches listed in the Security Patch Matrix will
 completely implement the RESOLUTION in the Security Bulletin
 _only_ if there are no MANUAL ACTIONS included.

 The Security Patch Check tool can also verify that a Security
