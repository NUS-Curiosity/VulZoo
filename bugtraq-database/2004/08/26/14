Re: New google's top query?

this "hack" (really a numrange search) was covered at DEFCON12 
(http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-12/dc-12-index.html) and widely known 
before it was publicized by Johnny Long (http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/) 
during his talk at the conference (to his credit, he did NOT release the 
exact syntax BTW). following that search now will yield little sensitive 
info, as most of the affected sites have removed the pages that 
demonstrated this security breach. Google is well aware of the malicious 
activity that can be aided with their search engine....but they are in a 
bit of a predicament between notions of security and freedom; a common 
juxtaposition in politics, social order, and network security.

this forum at Johnny's site has plenty more search "hacks":

for further investigation and vulnerability testing, check out 
Foundstone's SiteDigger: 
http://www.foundstone.com/index.htm?subnav=resources/navigation.htm&subcontent=/resources/s3i_tools.htm

Athena is another powerful Google digging tool that can expose search 
vulnerabilities; although i can't seem to find a working download site 
right now. you can grab the entire DEFCON12 iso (457MB) at:
http://130.212.20.4/admin/defcon/defcon12.iso
Athena can be found in the directory "Long".

happy Google hunting...oh yeah, don't be an idiot and use this info for 
evil.

A new Google hack has come to my attention that brings back some information that is a bit troubling. I must say that it is also good for the more you know about something the better you are to act upon it. The hack is this:
