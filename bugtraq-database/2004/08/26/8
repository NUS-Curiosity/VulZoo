Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't this just an exhaustion of resources and
not a "vulnerability" at all? You could have it write text to the page
instead of iframes and you get the same results because the JavaScript goes
into an infinite loop.

Does having your 486 freeze up when you attempt to open a 700mb DivX file
constitute as a vulnerability of the media software or operating system? I
think not. Here is a "one liner" I wrote that does the same thing, but I do
not in ANY way consider this a vulnerabity.

<script> var i = 1; while (i) </script>

Tested this in Mozilla 1.7.2 and Epiphany 1.2.6 in Linux (kernel 2.6.8,
Gentoo, Gnome 2.6.2).

Each browser comes up with a warning about running the script.  The user
can chose to run it or not.  Either way, a dialog box reloads over and
over until the main window is forced closed with xkill.
