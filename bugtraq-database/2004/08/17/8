Cacti 0.8.5a does not ship with this set Off*, so this must be a Debian 
packaging error.
The install instructions at 
http://www.raxnet.net/products/cacti/documentation.php?action=view&id=6
make no mention off having to disable the magic quote feature.

I am running this version of Cacti with magic quotes On fine, this is the PHP 
default, afaik.

*Cacti does not have a .htacess in its www root and the install instructions 
(above) do not mention any special PHP settings that need applying.
