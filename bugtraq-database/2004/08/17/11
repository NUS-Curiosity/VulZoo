Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0042

Package name:      rsync
Summary:           path sanitizing issue
Date:              2004-08-17
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 1.5
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Rsync uses a quick and reliable algorithm to very quickly bring remote
  and host files into sync.  Rsync is fast because it just sends the
  differences in the files over the network (instead of sending the
  complete files).

Problem description:
  From the official rsync advisory:

  There is a security problem in all versions prior to 2.6.1 that
  affects only people running a read/write daemon WITHOUT using chroot.
  If the user privs that such an rsync daemon is using is anything above
  "nobody", you are at risk of someone crafting an attack that could
  write a file outside of the module's "path" setting (where all its
  files should be stored). Please either enable chroot or upgrade to
  2.6.1. People not running a daemon, running a read-only daemon, or
  running a chrooted daemon are totally unaffected.


Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
