SpecificMAIL Outlook Spam Filter Technical Brief

July 22, 2004; August 10, 2004

SpecificMAIL (www.specificmail.com) is a free Outlook / Outlook
Express spam filter that utilizes a proprietary online spam database
to help keep your inbox clean of spam. SpecificMAIL is much more
than a spam filter; initial tests show that SpecificMAIL should be
classified as spyware/adware. SpecificMAIL’s EULA and privacy policy
are accurate.  SpecificMAIL collects web surfing habits, sites
visited, time of visit, duration of visit, full URL, etc. When first
installed, SpecificMAIL also collects a large amount of personal
information such as name, email address, age, income, etc. One of
the major issues with SpecificMAIL is that it also collects the
headers and body text of received email.

In the following email, a message was sent to the user of
SpecificMAIL (customer@) from the mock address onlinebank@. The
message is a typical example of an auto-response from an online bill
payment system. Upon training SpecificMAIL to whitelist the sender,
all email from that sender is rightfully placed in the usual Inbox
folder. On the surface this appears to be a useful application. What
happens behind the scenes is a different story.

------------------------------------------------
From: onlinebank@
Subject: Bank Details: #27779000
Date: Thu, July 22, 2004 10:33 pm
To: customer@

Your account has been credited $679.08 from NEC.
------------------------------------------------

At the time the email from onlinebank@ is received, the SpecificMAIL
spam blocker grabs the message body and uploads it to the
rawcheck.php script at www.specificmail.com  This activity happens
before and after onlinebank@ is white listed via SpecificMAIL’s
challenge/response system.

The following raw packet dump illustrates:

Initial testing indicates about 160 characters of message text can
be uploaded to the PHP script.

Other SpecificMAIL functionality:

- Tracks web site usage including the full URL of each site the user
   visits.

- Sends hourly updates indicating the user's online status.

- Directs popup and popunder advertisements onto the user's desktop.

- Has the ability to install additional software on the user's
   computer automatically.

The SpecificMAIL EULA and privacy policy should be enough to stop
someone from installing the software, but who really reads those
documents before clicking “yes” anyhow? Here are a few excerpts from
their EULA and privacy policy:

"SOME INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE SPECIFICMEDIA SOFTWARE IS
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE, SUCH AS YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, BUT ALL
INFORMATION WE COLLECT, EVEN NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION, CAN BE LINKED TO YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION."

"SpecificMAIL may communicate with the central SpecificMAIL
database. This allows SpecificMAIL to improve its spam detection
performance, and confirm the identity of those who send email to
you. As part of this process, we may become aware of header
information and the contents of emails you receive or scan."


In summary, SpecificMAIL is passively collecting most of, if not all
of, the user's web browsing habits and email communications. It
should be noted this is only the tip of the SpecificMAIL iceberg.
SpecificMAIL appears to be affiliated with SpecificPop,
SpecificClick, and Advertisingbanners.com.
