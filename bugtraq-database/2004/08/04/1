Subject: Re: New possible scam method : forged websites using XUL (Firefox)


Along the same lines I took a look at the spoof using my customized firefox 
and it was an obvious fake -

1.  The font is wrong
2.  The window size is wrong (it is twice the width of my browser window and
     almost 50% longer)
3.  The fake toolbar was below my toolbar so both were viable
4.  The address bar was also in the wrong place so I had two.
5.  I also had two status bars

Isn't a possible solution to disable any overlaying of existing elements 
(toolbar, status bar, address bar, etc.) once they are loaded from the 
browser's and user's on disk config?  Lock them even before opening a socket 
to connect to a site.

Of course if there is an exploit to modify the on disk files then this won't 
work.
