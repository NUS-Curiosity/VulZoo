Subject: Linux OpenExchange - cleartext rootpw in swap

problem: cleartext rootpw in swap caused by fergotten "mlock" or wiping out memory


hi,

i have noticed my root password flying around on my swap in cleartext.
an attacker who has successfully rooted a box can get the cleartext password from the swap device.  

i dont know if this is caused by some SuSE mistake at the web login- maybe its a fault in openldap.
i dont know exactly where this is caused.



root:~ # strings swap -5 | grep GroupwareDBport -A 2|  grep -A 2 loginDestination
loginDestination
MYROOTCLEARTEXT_PASSWORD
--
--
loginDestination
MYROOTCLEARTEXT_PASSWORD
--
--
loginDestination
MYROOTCLEARTEXT_PASSWORD
[...]


i also had success in getting my cleartext password with

root:~ # strings swap -5 | grep /etc/postfix/main.cf -A 2
/etc/postfix/main.cf
MYROOTCLEARTEXT_PASSWORD
erfolgreich
--
/etc/postfix/main.cf
MYROOTCLEARTEXT_PASSWORD
SIEVEpor
[...]


however- such things can be prevented with wiping out the memory where the
password was stored or with using mlock.
