Subject: Security Center and Windows XP clients in domain




 
From the Symantec site:

Q: Which Symantec products will the product update apply to? 
A: The product update applies to customers who use Symantec Client Security, Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition, and Symantec AntiVirus Enterprise Edition if their client systems are not members of a Windows domain. This is because Windows XP Service Pack 2 does not enable the Windows Security Center or the Windows Firewall if it detects that the computer is a member of a Windows domain. It also applies to administrators who choose to enable the Windows Security Client in a domain. Product updates for other Symantec products may be released in the future but none are scheduled at this time. 
  
As stated in the answer if a windows XP client is joining a Domain SP2 won't enable neither the Security Center and Firewall. Does somebody have any mor information about this?
