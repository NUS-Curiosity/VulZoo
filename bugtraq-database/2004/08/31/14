Subject: Axis Network Camera and Video Server Security Advisory


1. Topic

Security issues have been identified that allows an attacker to
compromise Axis Network Cameras, Video Servers, Serial Servers and
Network Digital Video Recorders.

2. Description

The first issue allows arbitrary shell command execution via HTTP
requests due to erroneous shell command and parameter expansion.

The second issue allows circumvention of HTTP authentication when
accessing the ServerManager.srv administrative resource. This allows a
remote attacker to modify configuration settings nominally requiring
administrative privileges.
