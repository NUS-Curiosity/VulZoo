Subject: Possible root compromose with bsdmainutils 6.0.x < 6.0.15 (Debian testing/unstable)

Hi,

this advisory was sent to the maintainers of the bsdmainutils package in
Debian testing/unstable.
With their agreement, I have waited to send it to bugtraq untill now.

To fix the vulnerability, upgrade your bsdmainutils package to version
6.0.15. This package is already in the unstable branch and should find
its way into the testing branch very soon.

(Sorry for the first mail, it's monday morning ;) This time I actually
attached the advisory)

greets,
