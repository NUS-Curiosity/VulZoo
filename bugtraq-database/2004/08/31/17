Well, if the server is "rooted", as you like to put it, there's little
point in gaining the root-password anyway, isn't it ?
You can do pretty much everything, except login as the administrator-user
via the web-interface. Being able to scratch the root-pw out of swap is
just a bonus, if you ask me.

It would be bad, if a non-priviledged user had access to the swap-partition.
On the two SLOXs I have access to, the swap-partition is only
group-readable by the "disk" group.
Or is there some other way of reading the swap-partition ?

If not, this is not a big concern to me (and we run and support some of
these for various customers).

If, OTOH, you had talked about the empty password for the SLOX'
postgres-database.... that would be something completely different (TM).
