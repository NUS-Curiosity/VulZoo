This basically tells the user to open CMD and then execute the attachment 
in command line. Now, someone has to be really, really dumb to do that.

The good point here is that people don't know what CMD is and might be 
reluctant to do something they do not understand. I wouldn't say this is 
SP2 vulnerability, it might just be that noone tought about such an 
exploit. However, I think it doesn't have to do with Microsoft, but with 
less than average IQ of some users. There's no company, not Microsoft, not 
IBM, not Linux nor BSD, that can make a 100% foolproof system. 

This might be SP2 bug only if the same bug can't be repeated on pre-SP2 
machine. Didn't test, but I think this is an old trick. Anyone care to 
test it?
