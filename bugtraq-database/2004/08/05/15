What's not possible ? Using IPSEC ?!

I'm not sure what You mean by "human user". The users in cvs doesn't have
to be mapped to system users(CVSROOT/passwd).

You're right CVS is not a security tool. It's a version control system.
In fact, what You are talking about ? Do You remember what the subject
of the post You're replying to was ?

There's a site outhere. It's sf.net . They demonstrate, with the number
of projects being hosted there (with pserver access), You're not right
again.

The cvs server doesn't have to be run as root. IMHO it's pretty bad
idea to run it as root. Furthermore cvs provides several hooks, which
could be utilized if you need control at certain points and over
certain operations. E.g. commiters could be controlled by module and
branch.

About the password scrambling. It's well documented why it's like
that. The scrambling algorithm is also described. And it's all there.
In the manual. 
S.O. said that fake security is worse than no security. Password 
encryption in .cvspass should be considered "no security".


On the other side, people's stupidity is endless. I won't be surprised
to see private keys posted in a public forum. This, ofcourse, could
be nothing but a reason for admiration.
