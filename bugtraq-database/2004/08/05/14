Subject: CVStrac Remote Arbitrary Code Execution exploit


Hi, Im Richard Ngo, this is the first time i report an
exploit and found a remote exploit that could allow
arbitrary code execution in CVStrac.

sample exploit

filediff?f=CVSROOT/rcsinfo&v1=1.1&v2=1.2;w;

All versions vulnerable. I have not contacted
cvstrac.org since i cant find their email address.
Please give me credit for the exploit and *please dont
release the exploit code to the public* for other
websites security. Maybe just create an advisory.
Thank you.
