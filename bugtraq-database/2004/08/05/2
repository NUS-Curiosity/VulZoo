  According to Computer Associates:

"cmd
bat
com
exe
pif
scr

The attachment name may also be the e-mail address of the  recipient.

The attachment could also be in a ZIP archive, and can have a "double 
extension", with "doc", "txt", "htm" or "html" followed by many spaces, 
then the real extension."
