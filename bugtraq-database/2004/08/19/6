Heck, this isn't even news. It was posted to Bugtraq a while back. Like 
1999. This URL details Imail's password scheme for Imail 5.0:

http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1999/Dec/0255.html

About a year ago, I found that article, and used it to "decrypt" a few 
lost email passwords on my Imail 7.15 installation.

Given the fact that Imail tries to do just about everything (it does POP3, 
SMTP, IMAP, LDAP, includes a Web server and makes crispy French fries), 
this sort of thing is probably bound to stay around for a while.

One of the neat things about Imail (other than that it does practically 
everything) is that it's backwards-compatible. If my Imail 8.1x 
installation does something weird, I can roll it back to Imail 7.x with 
maybe fifteen minutes' work. This level of backwards compatibility does 
lead to weird problems and security issues (q.v. every version of DOS and 
Windows for about fifteen years).
