FWIW, the Mike D said that he would have preferred that there were no DRM on
the album, but that it's a standard practice for all EMI releases. Check out
this post from BoingBoing:

(Besides, DRM is standard issue nowadays and quite easy to bypass for the
average bugtraq reader :-)

Well I truly regret actually purchasing a copy of the new Beastie Boys album
to support them.

It seems that Capitol Records has some sort of new copy protection system,
that automatically, silently, installs "helpful" copy protection software on
MacOS and Windows as soon as you insert the CD into default systems.
I'm not sure exactly what it does yet, but I am sure regreting actually
purchasing said media now... they don't deserve my money if they choose to
pull stupid stunts like this. Installing software without your permission
sounds like viral malware behaviour to me. I certainly hope the AV companies
put signatures into their products for this crap.

They include some sort of uninstaller buried on there for Windows, but I see
no such thing for MacOS. If anyone has disassembled the aforementioned
malware already and can save us some time with instructions on how to remove
it... thanks in advance.

caveat emptor,
