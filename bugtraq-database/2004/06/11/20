<a href="http://www.malware.com%2F redir=www.e-gold.com">test</a>

"i guess that this issue is not e-gold's BUG,
IE6 and Opera7.51 is vulnerable.

Some server's DNS allow magic number subdomainname.
the server allow ,
www.site.tld
wwwww.site.tld
wwwwwwwwwwww.site.tld
www   www.site.tld
wwwURLEncodecharcterswww.site.tld
when the server allows URLEncodecharacters 
evil attackers can fake victim users who use Opera and IE .

the attacker will make their DNS
*.evilsite.tld IN A 333.333.333.333

using this DNS,
victim's IE can shows victim
http://w.evilsite.tld
http://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.evilsite.tld

and then,
attacker makes an evil link as 
http://www.microsoft.com [malicious falke char$]  evilsite.tld

and then, attacker set tricks
Bugtraq: Stupid Phishing Tricks (you find it)

victim user will input his userID and password.

I guess many server's DNS allow 
*.evilsite.tld IN A 333.333.333.333
because they use magicnumber SSL cert.
Attacker can use this method."
