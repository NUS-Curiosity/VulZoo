That's a good way of doing it. I think it would be better to shorten the 
period of time from 1-9 months to 1-5. When you're reporting a 
vulnerability, you should try and report the fix for it too. In my opinion, 
exploit code should be posted a few weeks after the vulnerability has been 
reported to ensure that the company works on a fix.
