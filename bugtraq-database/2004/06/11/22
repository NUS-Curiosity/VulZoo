I guss, you are reffering this line in the SQL Statment...
WHERE t.forum_id IN ($sql_fields)
I downloaded IPB 1.3.1 F and digiid for a fwe seconds, if you look a bit up in the code u'll see:

$f = intval($f);
	if ( $f )
		{
			$forums[] = $f;
		}
...........
...........
$sql_fields = implode( ",", $forums );

intval, means that u can't enter string in the f field...
