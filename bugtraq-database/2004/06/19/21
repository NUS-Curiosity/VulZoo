Subject: Re: Re: USB risks (continued)


Hi All, this isn't a subject I claim to know anything about, but has 
anyone previously looked at using the partition table, and it's various 
codes for the filesystems? A USB or PCMCIA drive for that matter has 
it's own partition table (I believe). The OS then reads the table, and 
loads the approprate filesystem driver to attempt mounting the 
filesystem. fastfat.sys ntfs.sys and possibly even cdfs.sys

If there's a bug or a buffer overflow that can be accessed via the 
filesystem driver itself then it may be exploitable. I believe the 
filesystem drivers are probably a Ring0 driver aswell, so if it was 
exploited it's straight into the bottom level of the OS.

If 2k or XP will install the device while the workstation is still 
locked it leads that you might be able to gain admin even on a locked 
workstation (or server). Although I don't have a usb drive so can't test 
if it installs or not.

Just an idea.
