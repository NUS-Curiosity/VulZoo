Client-side spam filters that silently drop e-mail are broken.  They
should generate a non-delivery notification.

Of course, that leads to all kinds of other nasty problems, so I've
concluded that client-side spam filters in general are broken, and the
only proper way to do it is on the server, and only by failing the
SMTP transaction.

No; B would get the failure message, because B is the envelope sender.
