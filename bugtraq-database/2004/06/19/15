email addresses.

filtering in general a vulnerability that could be used as a hoax
device? Since most users reply to an email citing the complete
source email, including filter-offending words, it should be
possible to keep a reply, forward, or even a whole thread, under the
radar of specific recipients. If used in combination with forged
replies from addresses predictably dropping emails, I think this may
be a dangerous tool for social engineering.

for "the secret plans" and says "if you are unsure, forward my
request to your boss and ask if this is okay". 'B' forwards the
email to his boss 'C' and asks "Is this okay?". However, 'C':s spam
filter silently drops the email. 'A' forges a reply from 'C' saying:
"Sure, no problem, go ahead."

Interesting idea.

That might be problematic if the originator doesn't intercept the
letter to boss as it may contain some important data for
faking the boss's answer
