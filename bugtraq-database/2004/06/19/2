Yes, this was a bug, 11 months ago, all distros have had this fixed in
their latest kernels for a long time now.  There was previous
discussions about this on the linux-kernel mailing list, so you weren't
the first to find it by a long shot.

Also, distros ship their /dev/i2c* nodes as accessable only as root, so
again, this isn't really a problem.
