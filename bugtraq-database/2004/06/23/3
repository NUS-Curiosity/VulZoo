Subject: ArbitroWeb v0.6 Javascript injection vulnerability




vendor: ArbitroWeb
about: An anonymous web surfing proxy written in PHP. ArbitroWeb will redirect all web requests thru it's set of scripts, all URL's contained will be adjusted/mangled to it's own scripts.
date: june 22nd, 2004
vendor status: ?
problem: javascript can be injected into the /?rawURL= field...

ex: www.server.com/?rawURL=&lt;script&gt;javascript:alert();&lt;/script&gt;
popups up a javascript alert...

could be hazardous.... example (alert pops up 100 times):
www.server.com/?rawURL=&lt;script&gt;javascript:for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) alert();&lt;/script&gt;

it filters out the character " by making it \" so having it do various things that you can usually do with javascript injection is a problem... yet this should be fixed nonetheless, and its a possibility the character " has a workaround...

thanks to wehack.com, as i was looking thrugh their site at advisories and came upon this product....

Thanks,
Josh Gilmour
