Subject: MAGIC XSS INTO THE DNS: coelacanth




Tuesday, June 12, 2004

The following courtesy of 'bitlance winter' adds an entirely new 
dimension to the matter and also suggest some additional 
peculiarities at play:

<a href='http://&quot;&gt;&lt;plaintext&gt;.e-gold.com'>foo</a>

<a href='http://&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert()&lt;%
2Fscript&gt;.e-gold.com'>foo</a>

these will inject arbitrary html and script into the site in the 
context of the 'intranet zone', which means one no longer needs 
to go out and setup a site with the dns issue, all one needs to 
do is locate a functioning site, include their code into a 
suitable url, either direct the target via that or place an 
iframe elsewhere pointing to it.

Still unclear how or why this can be interpreted into the site 
or through the browser.
