Package:             cvs
Vulnerability:       multiple remote compromises
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= cvs-1.12.8-20040607      >= cvs-1.12.9-20040609
OpenPKG 2.0          <= cvs-1.12.5-2.0.2         >= cvs-1.12.5-2.0.3
OpenPKG 1.3          <= cvs-1.12.1-1.3.5         >= cvs-1.12.1-1.3.6

Affected Releases:   Dependent Packages: none

Description:
  According to an e-matters Security Advisory [0] multiple
  vulnerabilities exist in the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) [1].
  Derek Price, Stefan Esser and Sebastian Krahmer discovered and fixed
  several security issues. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the ids CAN-2004-0414 [2], CAN-2004-0416 [3],
  CAN-2004-0417 [4] and CAN-2004-0418 [5] to the problems.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  cvs". If you have the "cvs" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade
  it (see Solution). [6][7]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [8][9], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [10][11] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [12], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [6] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [7]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get cvs-1.12.5-2.0.3.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig cvs-1.12.5-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild cvs-1.12.5-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/cvs-1.12.5-2.0.3.*.rpm
