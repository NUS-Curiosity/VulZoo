Subject: Troubles with Wireless pentest


A little help would be appreciated on this.

 

       A few problems occurred during a wireless pentest I am presently undertaking. First a foundation,

1) The pentest was a zero knowledge kind,  no information was given, in fact we were forbidden to ask for help from any of the staffs

These I found during the first day.

2) The network had a weak point = its wireless network.

3) The wireless network was encrypted but with the weak wep and for a large corporation the data captured was enough to get the key

4) The network in focus is quite large with multiple subnets and lots of �firewalls�

These I did.

5) Using kismet I sniffed a whole lot of packets. And decoded them with the found wep key

6) Then using my conventional ettercap and ethereal I looked through the packets.

Now The Problem.

7) I tried to connect to the net work 

8) I used a nice ip to match those on the network

9) Then I used ettercap to try and passively find the gateway but could not

10) I used etterape to watch the packet flow but I could not figure out the gateway from all that traffic 

HELP

HOW CAN I GET THE GATEWAY FOR THE WIRELESS NETWORK  AND IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD ROUTE PACKETS TO / CONNECT TO/ SCAN THE REST OF THE MACHINES ON THE NETWORK WITH OUT THE GATEWAYS ADDRESS.

 

OR IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO DO THE WHOLE PENTEST?

Pls help would be gladly appreciated.

Any ideas are welcome. THANKS�
