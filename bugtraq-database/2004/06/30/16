Thomas Kessler was kind enough to inform that this is not new, 
but in fact on old "issue" with Internet Explorer which by all 
accounts was supposed to be "patched" back in 1998[?]:

Microsoft Security Program: Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS98-
020) Patch Available for 'Frame Spoof' Vulnerability

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms98-020.mspx

Quite clearly this contraption known as Internet Explorer is 
just broken. It's oozing pus from every pore at this stage.

If indeed the issues are the exact same. 

You'd better wipe hands of it anyway.

We give up.
