Synopsis
========

There is a vulnerability in the Gallery photo album software which may
allow an attacker to gain administrator privileges within Gallery.

Background
==========

Gallery is a web application written in PHP which is used to organize
and publish photo albums. It allows multiple users to build and
maintain their own albums. It also supports the mirroring of images on
other servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-misc/gallery      <= 1.4.3_p1                     >= 1.4.3_p2

Description
===========

There is a vulnerability in the Gallery photo album software which may
allow an attacker to gain administrator privileges within Gallery. A
Gallery administrator has full access to all albums and photos on the
server, thus attackers may add or delete photos at will.

Impact
======

Attackers may gain full access to all Gallery albums. There is no risk
to the webserver itself, or the server on which it runs.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version.

Resolution
==========

All users should upgrade to the latest available version of Gallery.

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-misc/gallery-1.4.3_p2"
    # emerge ">=app-misc/gallery-1.4.3_p2"
