This is all incorrect.

1. Any unusual characters in a file name will automatically be 
converted to random digits. This has been tested and 
demonstrated since 2001.

2. 'Save target' and an invoked download whether automatic or 
manually cannot be the same. Simple logic right click on a 
15MB .mp3 and 'save target' and  you don't wait hours for this 
to occur. Neither does forcing the download which only downloads 
the html or php or script or whatever trick is used initially to 
auto download nor does directly invoking the download [clicking 
on the file. Regardless of the way nothing is written.

3. Clearly what's being 'confused' here is with a frame which 
does write the file and which cannot be combined with this 
scenario for all the reasons above.

4.  document.execCommand('SaveAs',false,'::%7b') also doesn't do 
anything.

We may actually have to roll up our sleeves and get our soft 
little hands dirty to solve this one what.
