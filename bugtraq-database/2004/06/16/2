----------------------------------------------------------------------
SNS Advisory No.75
Webmin/Usermin Account Lockout Bypass Vulnerability

Problem first discovered on: Sun, 11 Apr 2004
Published on: Fri, 11 Jun 2004
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
  A vulnerability that could result in account lockout bypassing exists 
  in both Webmin and Usermin.


Problem Description:
--------------------
  Webmin is a web-based system administration tool for Unix.  Usermin 
  is a web interface that allows all users on a Unix system to easily
  receive mails and to perform SSH and mail forwarding configuration.

  Both Webmin and Usermin ship with an account lockout functionality,
  which fails to parse certain character strings.  By bypassing this
  functionality, attackers can attempt to guess IDs and passwords
  continuously, prevent legitimate users from logging on, etc.


Tested Versions:
----------------
  Webmin Version 1.140
  Usermin Version 1.070


Solution:
---------
  This problem can be eliminated by upgrading to Webmin version 1.150
  and to Usermin version 1.080, which are available at:

    http://www.webmin.com/
