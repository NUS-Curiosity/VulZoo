Package description:
  Apache is a full featured web server that is freely available,
  and also happens to be the most widely used. Built with loadable modules
  (all standard modules enabled). This verion is intended as a replacement
  for a standard apache, the configuration files provided with apache and
  apache-ssl are unchanged.

Problem description:
  Stack-based buffer overflow in the ssl_util_uuencode_binary function
  in ssl_util.c for Apache mod_ssl when mod_ssl is configured to trust
  the issuing CA, may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
  via a client certificate with a long subject DN.
