Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0032

Package name:      kerberos5
Summary:           buffer overflows in krb5_aname_to_localname
Date:              2004-06-02
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  (MIT) Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
  provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using
  secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is
  available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is
  available in many commercial products as well.

Problem description:
  The krb5_aname_to_localname() library function contains multiple
  buffer overflows which could be exploited to gain unauthorized root
  access.  Exploitation of these flaws requires an unusual combination
  of factors, including successful authentication to a vulnerable
  service and a non-default configuration on the target service.  (See
  MITIGATING FACTORS below.)  No exploits are known to exist yet.


Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
