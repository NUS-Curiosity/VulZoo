Subject: RE: MS web designers -- "What Security Initiative?"



logging into hotmail.com via the web i am now presented with "When-u-save" 
offer to install this worthless SPYWARE.
ref: http://www.pestpatrol.com/PestInfo/w/whenusave.asp

this is nearly as bad as malware deposited by browser bugs in IE that M$ is 
going after with such force as detailed in 
http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-5229707.html

wtf MS??? you allow this behavior from your own webpage, but yet are going 
after others who are using ( nearly the same without a conformation dialog ) 
this technique????????
