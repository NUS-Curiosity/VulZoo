Subject: Administrivia: Technical difficulties


Hey all,

We have been having some technical issues with the servers 
hosting the list.  Please bear with us, the messages
are being delivered.  My apologies for the late approvals,
many messages have not come through until late yesterday
and today.  Please contact me if your post didn't make it.

I will also take this opportunity to send OTOO subscribers
who reply to this message on free a vacation from the list.

Cheers,
