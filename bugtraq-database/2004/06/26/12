This is intentional - the logo is a trademark owned by Philips, which doesn't allow
its use on anything that doesn't follow all the appropriate format standards
for the CD format.

Several copy protection schemes rely on intentionally breaking said standards with
the hope that the average "audio" CD player won't notice the breakage - Philips
has, and will, sue companies that do that and still label it a CD.

The benefit to the consumer is that if it *doesn't* have the CD logo on it, you
should *immediately* suspect that the disk has major issues......
