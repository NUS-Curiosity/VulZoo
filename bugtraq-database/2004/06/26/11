This is what I do.  Spam is tagged by a statistical filter, then tagged
messages are filtered into a "Junk Mail" folder by the user's email client.

In a corporate environment, where silently dropping mail from a customer is
totally unacceptable, this is a good compromise.  The user can skim their
junk mail folder now and then and pick out anything that looks like it's
important.  (I do this about once a day; only takes a few seconds.  A
non-spam message in a folder full of spam tends to be surprisingly obvious.)

If I did this earlier, I'm sorry.  I correspond with a lot of people who
prefer to get carbon copies of list replies, especially on moderated lists.
I'm also not in the habit of reading signatures because they tend to be a
waste of time.  After seeing several dozen with bogus disclaimers and the
like in them you lose interest...

To me that seems *totally* broken.  A 5xx response means you didn't deliver
the mail, and the failure was permanent.  Terminating with a 5xx and then
delivering the mail somewhere isn't kosher; in fact, it's the worst of both
worlds.  You've still accepted the spam, *and* you've potentially created a
DSN.
