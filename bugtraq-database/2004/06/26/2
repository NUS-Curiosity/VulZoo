Subject: artmedic_links5 PHP Script (include path) vuln




There's a possilbity of looking at files (with apache priviliges) using artmedic_links5 (php script).
(http://www.artmedic-phpscripts.de/artmedic_links.php).

Vulnerability (include path) is in index.php, standard use:

hostname/artmedic_links5/index.php?id=[file] or index.php?id=[url]

I noticed there's a lot of .de boxes comming around with artmedic_links5 thingie.
