Considering the harse tone of your email, my initial reaction is to treat it
as hostile.  If I react incorrectly, please let me know.

Turn off your firewall.  Test again.  And make sure that your ISP does not
block http and https between your testing point and your router.

Probably.  Since LinkSys posted an updated firmware which specifically
addresses it, it was more than likely a all a bad dream.

Read my follow-up posts.  To my dismay, my original post was jumped on by
several security lists and Internet news outlets, COMPLETELY ignoring the
discussion which followed said post, and completely ignoring my additional
information.  Oh, and how many of these Internet news outlets contacted me
before running their stories?  NONE.  Only Maggie Reardon of C|Net made the
effort to spend time on the phone with me to confirm and straighten out the
finer details.

I did what so many others have done on BugTraq: I reported my findings on a
product based upon, admittedly dated, results of my own testing.  As has
many times before, answers came and discussions ensued.  Then I took
additional effort to produce additional data using personal funds to
purchase new products for more recent testing.

I will admit that I underestimated the impact of that post.  I never
expected that the post would be spread as it did, taken at face-value
without confirmation.  I do not recall any BugTraq post in the past three
years I have been on the list making it to the media so quickly.  The speed
at which it hit the air made me look like an absolute ass, and indeed gave
the impression that the "sky was falling;" completely not my decision.

Just because no one else ever reports a problem does not mean it does not
exist.

Right.

Yes.  How many times have "basic basic basic" aspects of security gone
untested, or flaws gone unnoticed?  How long was port 1900 open on my SMC
Barricade?  How many "basic basic basic" aspects of security has Microsoft,
various Linux distros, Sun, and even MacOS X violated?

See my comment above.  I emailed Ryan after I found his article, after it
was Slashdotted.  His response is that he was inundated with emails linking
to my amendments and that he planned a follow-up to clarify.  My last email
from him pointed to the firmware page which now has the v2.02.8_BETA which
addresses the issue.  To my knowledge, however, said update to his article
has yet to be released.

> Please, prove me wrong on all points.  Can anyone reproduce this?

I have received a couple of dozen reponses, many which said they could not
right out of the box.  Some which said they could.  Dammit, I am not crazy,
I *know* what I saw on the original units, but like I told Maggie, just one
person saying a unit exactly as I tested did not show my described behavior
sent me out for more units.  Only one of my original units is still in
service, and it has been flashed, re-configured, and just mangled beyond
being a reliable data source for OTS/OOB behavior.

LinkSys never responded to my first email about this; I even sent screen
shots.  No one else with whom I spoke locally was installing these.  I had
the results of testing on two units right out of the box.  I made my report.
And that, as they say, is that.

I do not have results of the new v2.02.8_BETA firmware available, and I am
now in communication with the WRT54G product manager at LinkSys/Cisco.
