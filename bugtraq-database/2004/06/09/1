 <!-- 

The headers of your example Email message quite 
clearly claim the message is multipart/alternative and the first 
part (with the "incomplete" OBJECT tag) is text/html.  Thus, 
although the body of that MIME component is not a properly 
formed, complete HTML  document, the MIME Content-Type: headers 
provide a fairly strong basis for the MUA treating that message 
component as HTML and displaying it  accordingly.  

-->

and the Outlook Express unique ability to still do the 
impossible unpatched after three years:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain;
charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
