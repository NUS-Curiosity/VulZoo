A far more plausible vulnerability would be for the attacker, if they had 
exploited the mail and/or DNS hosts used by user B to intercept or redirect 
mail.  This would significantly increase the workability of further 
socially engineered exploits.

FTR, the proposed failing wouldn't be possible if such decisions were 
digitally signed (PGP/GNUPG, etc) - the "forged" email would fail to be 
verified.

The success of the supposed mail vulnerability relies upon the gullibility 
of user B, not upon an automated system.  There are other factors to 
consider in there as well, such as SPF filtering at the mailhost of user B 
(which could reject the forged mail because the originating mailserver 
isn't correct for the sending address), or of user B sending a response to 
the forged authorization, and THAT message going unresponded to, or at 
least of user A (attacker) not RECEIVING that message to know to respond to 
it.  For that matter, it relies upon the message from user B to user C not 
including other details which user A would fail to address when sending the 
forged reply, and that user B doesn't simply pick up the phone and call 
user C, which renders the whole matter moot.
