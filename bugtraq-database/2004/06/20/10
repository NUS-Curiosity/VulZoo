You can't load the LKM unless securelevel <= 0.  Therefore, if securelevel
> 0 (the default securelevel for multi-user operation is 1) you can't
load your evil LKM & thus can't lower the securelevel.  Essentially this
means that if the securelevel is 0 or lower, you can lower it even further,
 but if this is the case there are no protections effected by securelevel
anyway.  In other words, there is absolutely no threat presented by the
attack you describe.
