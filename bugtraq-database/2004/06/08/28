lha is not part of Debian proper (part of the "non-free" archive), and so is
not supported directly by the Debian security team.  We do, however, release
updates for non-free which are provided by the Debian package maintainer, as
was done in this case.

I'm copying GOTO Masanori <gotom@...ian.org>, who prepared the patch.
