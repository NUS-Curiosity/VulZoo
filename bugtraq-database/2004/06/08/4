APPLE-SA-2004-06-07 Security Update 2004-06-07

Description

Security Update 2004-06-07 delivers a number of security enhancements
and is recommended for all Macintosh users.  The purpose of this
update is to increase security by alerting you when opening an
application for the first time via document mappings or a web address
(URL).  For more details, including a description of the new alert
dialog box, please see:
http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25785

Versions:  Security Update 2004-06-07 is available for the following
system versions:
*  Mac OS X v10.3.4 "Panther"
*  Mac OS X Server v10.3.4 "Panther"
*  Mac OS X v10.2.8 "Jaguar"
*  Mac OS X Server v10.2.8 "Jaguar"

The following components are updated:

Component:   LaunchServices
CVE-ID:      CAN-2004-0538
Impact:      LaunchServices automatically registers applications,
which could be used to cause the system to run unexpected
applications.
Discussion:  LaunchServices is a system component that discovers and
opens applications.  This system component has been modified to only
open applications that have previously been explicitly run on the
system.  Attempts to run an application that has not previously been
explicitly run will result in a user alert.  Further information is
available in http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25785

Component:   DiskImageMounter
CVE-ID:      No CVE ID has been reserved as this is only an
additional preventative measure.
Impact:      The disk:// URI type mounts an anonymous remote file
system using the http protocol.
Discussion:  The registration of the disk:// URI type is removed
from the system as a preventative measure against attempts to
automatically mount remote disk image file systems.

Component:   Safari
CVE-ID:      CAN-2004-0539
Impact:      The "Show in Finder" button would open certain
downloaded
files, in some cases executing downloaded applications.
Discussion:  The "Show in Finder" button will now reveal files in a
Finder window and will no longer attempt to open them.  This
modification is only available for Mac OS X v10.3.4 "Panther" and Mac
OS X Server v10.3.4 "Panther" systems as the issue does not apply to
Mac OS X v10.2.8 "Jaguar" or Mac OS X Server v10.2.8 "Jaguar".

Component:   Terminal
CVE-ID:      Not applicable
Impact:      Attempts to use a telnet:// URI with an alternate port
number fail.
Discussion:  A modification has been made to allow the specification
of an alternate port number in a telnet:// URI.  This restores
functionality that was removed with the recent fix for CAN-2004-0485.
