 <!-- 

I hope I provided you with information to re-think your claims.

Is that so?

You and your friend provide nothing. Never have. Never will.  
You and he ought remain in the peanut gallery and let doer's do. 
Sit back keep your mouth shut and learn from people who do.

Or create yet another mailing list and 'hope' that you can be 
seen as  a doer.

What you see is a 100% zero day. I'll personally guarantee 
that !  And you'll never know it. Even 
if it was explained to you in crystal detail like Jelmer just 
did.

You should be on your knees thanking Jelmer for explaining it, 
no one else can and no one else has. Because its not so easy.
