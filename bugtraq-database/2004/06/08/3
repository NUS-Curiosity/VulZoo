yes - this is right (though it took me a while to find out how to get 
this gzip compressed part out of the img).

Whats new in this image:
"[...] Fixed illegal user access the WEB configuration utility. [...]"

;-)

Would it be possible to change the firmware image by hand - e.g. usa a 
hex editor and set this username / password to sth else?

Harald
