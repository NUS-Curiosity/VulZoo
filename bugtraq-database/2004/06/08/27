Who exactly are you? 

You come barreling into FD several months ago, long after it was 
created. Pissing in your pants to have found a unmoderated new 
mailing list. You run around on a spree posting every piece 
drivel at every possible opportunity. You then latch onto 
bugtraq riding the coat-tails of other peoples message in order 
to get yours approved. Now I see you have insinuated yourself 
into the Risks Digest 23.41 with perhaps a record 3 messages in 
one go.

Somebody spends there time and effort analysing a zero day, you 
then have the fucking nerve to complain about that:

<!--  
Also, please try and keep your grudges to yourself where 50K 
plus busy people  need to sift through vital information?
-->

and then you further demonstrate your cockeyed thought process 
by thinking Jelmer has given you a moments thought and has 
also 'dragged personal issues and flames into "the thread"'

<!--  
Where Jelmer and I disagree is on dragging  personal issues and 
flames into the thread.
-->

"the thread" being his analysis of the zero day that you stuck 
your fat face into in the first place.

Like I said go start yet 'another' mailing list if you are so 
desparate for attention. You can be the moderator, the only 
poster, the king of the hill, everything you want to be.
