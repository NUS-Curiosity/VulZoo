Subject: RE: Internet explorer 6 execution of arbitrary code (An analysis of the 180 Solutions Trojan)


>>Finally I also attached the source files to this message

My McAfee-based gateway scanner blocks the attachment and labels it as "VBS/Psyme",
which has this description
(http://us.mcafee.com/virusInfo/default.asp?id=description&virus_k=100749): 

"This trojan exploits an unpatched (at the time of this writing) vulnerability in
Internet Explorer.  The vulnerability allows for the writing, and overwriting, of local
files by exploiting the ADODB.Stream object.  There are several variants of this trojan.
Therefore this description is design to give an overview of how the trojan works.

The trojan exists as VBScript.  This script contains instructions to download a remote
executable, save it to a specified location on the local disk, and then execute it."
