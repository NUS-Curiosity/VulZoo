Subject: ISC DHCP overflows


Hi,
for those interested to reproduce the recent DOS attacks against ISC 
DHCPD 3.0.1 rc12 and rc13
as described in:
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/317350
, i'm forwarding the first email i sent to ISC describing several stack 
based buffer overflows occuring during the creation
of log messages and triggered by sending several DHCP HOSTNAME options 
within a single request.
This mail also includes a trace of such DHCP REQUEST.

Other .bss overflows related to vsnprintf and identified later during 
our investigations as described in:
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/654390
can be triggered the exact same way.
Note that the home made tool i am referencing in this email will be made 
available very soon and already includes ISC, INFOBLOX and DLINK dhcp 
vulnerabilities
I will drop a note here when it is finally released.
cheers,
Gregory

Special thanks to Solar Designer and David W.Hankins (ISC)


--- Original email ------

Summary:

i have discovered several stack based overflow in your dhcp-3.0.1rc12 
and rc13 (may be others, have not checked)
these vulnerabilities can be easily triggered by crafting a dhcp 
discover or request packet which carries several  hostname dhcp options that
,once reassembled by the daemon (as explained in rfc 3396), overflow a 
stack based variable causing the daemon to crash.
I believe than one might execute code remotely on the server with the 
same user account dhcpd is running with, root in most cases.
I have been able at some points during the tests, to control eip' 4 
bytes (intel 32bits arch), it was during the ddns forward update operation.
Note that all tests have been made on a linux 2.4.20-24.9 using a home 
made tool to generate custom dhcp traffic

Now an example:

see dhcpd.conf in attachment if you need it.

Note that the daemon may actually crash at a different location 
depending of the first corrupted structure it meets and therefore,
of the size of the malicious option sent, along with the context (type 
of packet, leases in use etc...)


Problems in the source:
I have spent quite some time to find out where the overflow actually 
takes its roots, here are my findings:

file server/dhcp.c:
function dhcprequest :

        char msgbuf [1024]; /* XXX */
        char *s;

....

  if (lease && lease -> client_hostname &&
            db_printable (lease -> client_hostname))
                s = lease -> client_hostname;
        else
                s = (char *)0;


......

  sprintf (msgbuf, "DHCPREQUEST for %s%s from %s %s%s%svia %s",
                 piaddr (cip), smbuf,
                 (packet -> raw -> htype
                  ? print_hw_addr (packet -> raw -> htype,
                                   packet -> raw -> hlen,
                                   packet -> raw -> chaddr)
                  : (lease
                     ? print_hex_1 (lease -> uid_len, lease -> uid,
                                    lease -> uid_len)
                     : "<no identifier>")),
                 s ? "(" : "", s ? s : "", s ? ") " : "",
                  packet -> raw -> giaddr.s_addr
                  ? inet_ntoa (packet -> raw -> giaddr)
                  : packet -> interface -> name);


To summarize, s is referencing the reassembled hostname option passed to 
the daemon, afterwhat it is used as is in sprintf and stored in msgbuf 
(fixed size) without any length checking.
local msgbuf can obviously be overrun, corrupting various structures in 
stack and eventually causing the server to crash
Note that the call to db_printable( ), filtering hostname,  may render 
the task harder to root a server but likely not impossible.
Also being able to corrupt structures like *lease or *oc may have 
interesting side effects from an attacker perspective.

void dhcprequest (packet, ms_nulltp, ip_lease)
        struct packet *packet;
        int ms_nulltp;
        struct lease *ip_lease;
{
        struct lease *lease;
        struct iaddr cip;
        struct iaddr sip;
        struct subnet *subnet;
        int ours = 0;
        struct option_cache *oc;
        struct data_string data;
        int status;
        char msgbuf [1024]; /* XXX */
        char *s;
        char smbuf [19];

....

the very same problem is present in dhcpdiscover( ),  dhcpdecline( ),  
dhcprequest(  ) , dhcprelease( ), ...
please look at the diff in unified format, attached to this email, for a 
detailed list.
