Subject: Java applet crashing with native assertion


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

this is a Java One special:

Three months ago I informed Sun Microsystems
about an applet alerting with a native win32 assertion
(Expression: offset < fFileSize

For information on how your program can cause an
assertion failure, see the Visual C++ documentation
on asserts...) .

If the users opts for cancel, it is crashing the browser
which started the applet.

The applet can be tried at the following URL:
http://www.illegalaccess.org/cms/?q=node/view/9

[How] does it crash on other platforms ? Please mail me
your experiences with it ...

Marc
