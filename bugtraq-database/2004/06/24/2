SNS Advisory No.76
Printing from Internet Explorer Lets Users to Cause DoS

Problem first discovered on: Fri, 28 May 2004
Published on: Wed, 23 Jun 2004
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity Level:
---------------
  Low


Overview:
---------
  System CPU usage could reach 100% and an extremely large number of
  paper sheets, more than the HTML content's actual page number, could
  be consumed when a certain HTML page is printed from Microsoft
  Internet Explorer.


Problem Description:
--------------------
  System CPU usage could reach 100% and an extremely large number of
  paper sheets, more than the HTML contents's actual page number, could
  be consumed when a certain HTML page is printed from Microsoft
  Internet Explorer.

  This problem is attributed to some contents described in the TABLE
  element.  Several Web pages present the same flaw, which causes the
  printer to consume over 500 sheets of paper.
 
  CPU usage hits 100% when the user previews the page with the "Print
  Preview" feature, however, it was confirmed that this condition was
  not a hindrance to normal system operation.


Workaround:
-----------
  If the "Print Preview" feature shows that the number of pages to be
  printed overly exceeds the actual number of the HTML pages, print the
  contents by using another application (Web browser).

  It is not known whether a patch will be released soon.
