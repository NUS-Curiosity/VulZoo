Only if the sending host is running a real MTA.  If it's ratware
talking to you, it won't do anything of the sort.  _That_ is the real
gain of an SMTP-layer rejection over accept-and-bounce: it doesn't
generate DSNs when talking to ratware.

But in that respect it's no worse than generating a DSN yourself.
Better sometimes and no worse the other times - sounds like a win.
