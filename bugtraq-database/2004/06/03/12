Subject: Netgear WG602 Accesspoint vulnerability




KHAMSIN Security News
KSN Reference: 2004-06-03 0001 TIP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title
-----
        The Netgear WG602 Accesspoint contains an undocumented
        administrative account.

Date
----
        2004-06-03


Description
-----------

The webinterface which is reachable from both interfaces (LAN/WLAN)
contains an undocumented administrative account which cannot be disabled.

Any user logging in with the username "super" and the password "5777364"
is in complete control of the device.

This vulnerability can be exploited by any person which is able to reach
the webinterface of the device with a webbrowser.

A search on Google revealed that "5777364" is actually the phonenumber
of z-com Taiwan which develops and offers WLAN equipment for its OEM
customers.

Currently it is unknown whether other Vendors are shipping products
based on z-com OEM designs.


Systems Affected
----------------

        Vulnerable (verified)
                WG602 with Firmware Version 1.04.0

        Possibly vulnerable (not verified)
                WG602 with other Firmware Versions
                WG602v2
                All other z-com derived WLAN Accesspoints


Proof of concept
----------------

        Download the WG602 Version 1.5.67 firmware from Netgear
        ( http://kbserver.netgear.com/support_details.asp?dnldID=366 )
        and run the following shell commands on a UNIX box:

        $ dd if=wg602_1.5.67_firmware.img bs=1 skip=425716 > rd.img.gz
        $ zcat rd.img.gz | strings | grep -A5 -B5 5777364

        Which results in the following output:

                %08lx:%08lx:%s
                %08lx%08lx%08lx%08lx
                Authorization
                BASIC
                super 			<---- Username
                5777364 		<---- Password
                %02x
                Content-length
                HTTP_USER_AGENT
                HTTP_ACCEPT
                SERVER_PROTOCOL
