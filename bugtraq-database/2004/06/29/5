Subject: RE: Microsoft and Security


On the subject of IE bugs, I am running SP2 RC2, IE6.0.2900.2149 today I
opened a window 
http://www.asus.com/products/server/srv-mb/ncch-dl/overview.htm
In another IE window I had www.ingrammicro.com/uk open

Whe I click on the picture of the motherboard in the first page to enlarge
it, it changes the ingrammicro page to have the picture of the motherboard
in it but still displays the ingrammicro page title in the browser bar, and
the top "frame" of the ingrammicro page....

Weird one, I donâ€™t know if it is restricted to this build of IE though
HTH
Mark
