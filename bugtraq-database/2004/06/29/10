This is unbelieveable. Super Spoof DeLuxe ! Simply knowing the 
frame name of the target site we can modify the asus.com crazy 
code and inject whatever we want into the target site.

Here's a quick and dirty demo injecting malware.com into 
windowsupdate.microsoft.com :)

http://www.malware.com/targutted.html

- using window.open most popup blockers will block it, disable 
for the demo or recode with just open() or something else which 
can defeat them

- this demo hinges on the site code frame name being in english 
for the demo url of windowsupdate.com

-you need to time the loading of the target site before injecting

- quick testing from google frame + bank, yields banking sites 
using frames where it too works

exact reason or code in asus.com not examined at this time.

Well done Mark. A recording setting lunker.
