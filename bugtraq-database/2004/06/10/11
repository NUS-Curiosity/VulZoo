IE flaws used to spread pop-up toolbar
by Robert Lemos, CNET News, 09 June 2004

"The possibility that a group or company has apparently used the 
vulnerabilities as a way to sneak unwanted advertising software, 
or adware, onto a user's computer could be grounds for criminal 
charges, said Stephen Toulouse, security program manager for 
Microsoft. 

"We consider that any use of an exploit to run a program is a 
criminal use," he said. "We are going to work aggressively with 
law enforcement to prosecute individuals or companies that do 
so."

All the while conveniently omitting the fact that the so-
called  'vulnerability' that does the actual 'sneaking' is a 
time tested  in both demonstration and in the wild 'feature' of 
Microsoft. The adodb.stream object. Repeatedly proven to be the 
core and still not addressed for 10 months now. 

Microsoft needs to decide whether THAT is in fact a 
vulnerability or a feature because without it [and a few others] 
you have nothing. An unremarkable "cross zones," capability as 
the author of the little news snippet so aptly puts it and who 
failed to query the manufacturer of this remarkable feature.
