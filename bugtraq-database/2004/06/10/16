Vendor: Edimax
Type: 7205APL
Firmware: 2.40a-00
Kind of bug: Security
Description: Normally a user called addmin, has to create a password on the Accesspoint.
When you create a back-up of the settings of your Accesspoint, it will result in a config.bin file.
Opening the file in Notepad gave the next result:

�������������������� 71331234..,.��..��� ..   default.domain��..��.d��.�admin XXXXX guest 
1234 Wireless..XXXXXX,.  ��.��yy  ��..��..��.d��.domain..��Uo� Lg C�. ��Uo�
Lg C�..�

You can see the password of the admin XXXXX (for security reasons, I have changed the original one in XXXXX) and the password of a user called guest, 1234.
When you log in to the accesspoint with guest and 1234, you can make a backup. With the same content like above of the admin. 
It is not possible to remove the user, because it is inside the firmware. So only a new one can solve this security problem.
