ASPDOTNETSTOREFRONT Improper Upload Validation

Release Date:
June 9, 2004

HIGH

Vendor:
AspDotNetStorefront.com A Division of Discovery Productions, Inc.

Software:
Tested on AspDotNetStorefront 3.3  
Previous versions may also be affected.

Remote:

Technical Details:
If a malicious user brute forces the password for the admin area, he will
have the ability to upload and execute any Trojan or malicious code. This
can be done because /aspdotnetcart/admin/images.aspx fails to validate what
extensions and/or mime types are allowed to be uploaded.


 Status:
Updates are available for customers to download.
Vendor was provided a list of vulnerabilities on June 5th.
Application was fixed by June 6th.
