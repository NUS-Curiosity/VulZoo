 long share name buffer overflow.


I would say they lied myself... I have all patches from Windows update 
installed including all the optional ones... still crashes for me and 
still tears up the EIP and EBP. My IE advertises itself as: 
6.0.2800.1106 SP1; Q837009;Q8832894:Q831167 , The OS is Win2k Server 
5.00.2195 SP4.

Thus far I have been unable to locate a good unicode return address... 
but thats not to say there is not one there. =] . For those of you 
wondering smb.conf DOES allow for characters like \x90 and other things 
of that nature.

enjoy.
