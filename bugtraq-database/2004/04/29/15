Without any more details, like traffic captures, I can only assume it is
one of the new Lsass worms looking for MS04-011 vulnerable machines.

Subject: New Worm??? - High level of activity on port 445

Since late yesterday 4/28/04 afternoon around 4pm our firewall started
throwing alarms on netprobes. We are seeing a large amount of probes
coming from one machine that is probing random IPs on port 445. The
source port is random as well. We traced it back to a Japanese Win2K
machine w/SP4 installed. No idea if it's fully patched or not, I have no
desire to put it back on my network to patch it until I get this figured
out. I scanned the machine in safe mode as well as booting normally
using SAV 8.1 with 4/28/04 Rev 38 defs and came up with nothing.

Is anyone else seeing anything like this?
