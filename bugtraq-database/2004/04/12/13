Adobe Acrobat Reader PDF file DoS vulnerability
===============================================
Title:     Adobe Acrobat Reader PDF file DoS vulnerability
HappyName: Too hunger for memory?
Date:      Sunday, April 11, 2004
Software:  Adobe Acrobat Reader v4.0-v5.0
Vendor:    Adobe Corporation
Patch:     Vendor notified, Look at "Vendor Status" section
Author:    Arman Nayyeri, arman-n[at]phreaker.net, http://www.4rman.com
Severity:  Low


Description:
============
I found this vulnerability by hex editing a pdf file and changing a value
to a large number. after executing the pdf file, the adobe acrobat reader
displays a messagebox saying that the file is damaged and being repaired.
But it takes too long to pdf to be repaired and it will allocate a large
amount of memory to itself, so it will cause a DoS in memory.
In most cases windows will freez, because there is no memory for loading
any program, a messageboxes telling virtual memory too low will be displayed.
I don't have any info about the value in the pdf, what it will do, or anything
else! this code in pdf will cause dos in acrobat reader: 
"/UseOutlines ?>> ?endobj?[big number]"
in the exploit I use : "/UseOutlines ?>> ?endobj?9999999".
As the pdf files can be automatically loaded by web pages this vulnerability
becomes more dangerous.


Exploit:
========
I provide a page that loads pdf file by embed tag, it will cause the memory
to fills up.

WARNING!!!!!
This DoS will cause serious system instability, please save your work before
loading this page, you may need to restart your computer!
