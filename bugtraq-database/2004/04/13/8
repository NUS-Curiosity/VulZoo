Subject: Microsoft Internet Explorer BMP file memory DoS vulnerability




Microsoft Internet Explorer BMP file memory DoS vulnerability
=============================================================
Title:     Microsoft Internet Explorer BMP file memory DoS vulnerability
Vuln Name: 58 bytes BMP vs 51,539,607,528 GB memory
Date:      Sunday, April 11, 2004
Software:  Internet Explorer v5.0-v6.0 
           (i guess perior versions are vulnerable)
Vendor:    Microsoft Corporation
Patch:     N/A (Look at "Vendor Status" section)
Author:    Arman Nayyeri, arman[at]4rman.com, http://www.4rman.com
Severity:  Low


Description:
============
When a BMP file loaded into the Internet Explorer (for exmaple 'IMG' tag)
the internet explorer check the BMP image size written in BMP file, and then allocate the necessary memory to itself for placing bmp image into 
the memory.
And it does not check the actual size of the file, so we can write a large
number in the bmp file and cause the IE to fill the memory up.
But we can't use a very large number because IE will check to see if there is
enough memory available, if not, it doesn't load it at all.
The max size of the bitmap is FFFFFFFF^2 (large number ;) ).
so the tiny (58 bytes) bitmap can take up to 51,539,607,528 GB memory.

Exploit:
========
The exploit that I provided is an html page with many IMG tags that loading
several BMP files with different sizes. So the memory fills up completely.
