Synopsis
========

There are two vulnerabilities in CVS; one in the server and one in the
client. These vulnerabilities allow the reading and writing of
arbitrary files on both client and server.

Background
==========

CVS, which stands for Concurrent Versions System, is a client/server
application which tracks changes to sets of files. It allows multiple
users to work concurrently on files, and then merge their changes back
into the main tree (which can be on a remote system). It also allows
branching, or maintaining separate versions for files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     dev-util/cvs      <= 1.11.14                           >= 1.11.15

Description
===========

There are two vulnerabilities in CVS; one in the server and one in the
client. The server vulnerability allows a malicious client to request
the contents of any RCS file to which the server has permission, even
those not located under $CVSROOT. The client vulnerability allows a
malicious server to overwrite files on the client machine anywhere the
client has permissions.

Impact
======

Arbitrary files may be read or written on CVS clients and servers by
anybody with access to the CVS tree.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest stable version of CVS.

Resolution
==========

All CVS users should upgrade to the latest stable version.

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-util/cvs-1.11.15"
    # emerge ">=dev-util/cvs-1.11.15"
