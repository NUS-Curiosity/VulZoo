Subject: Multi stage attacks on networks?



Hi
	I am a Ph.D. student studying network security at Princeton
University.  I am trying to see if attacker can use a series of
vulnerabilities to take over a particular resource.  Has there been prior
work on this topic earlier? Can someone give me a real example where the
adversary actually uses  a series of vulnerabilities to break into a
resource?

	May be he uses the webserver in DMZ and then uses it to get access
to fileserver and then uses it to compromise something else?


thanks for your time,
Sudhakar.
