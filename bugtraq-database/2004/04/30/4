                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated httpd packages fix mod_ssl security issue
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:182-01
Issue date:        2004-04-30
Updated on:        2004-04-30
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Apache httpd DoS SSL
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0113
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages are now available that fix a denial of service
vulnerability in mod_ssl and include various other bug fixes.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

A memory leak in mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.0.49
allows a remote denial of service attack against an SSL-enabled server. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2004-0113 to this issue.

Users of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches that address these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

78224 - Apache will not list/send files mounted from a NetWare volume.
115280 - deflate module is not working properly
116576 - Apache2 fails to start with more than 1024 FDs

6. RPMs required:
