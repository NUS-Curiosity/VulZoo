Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0025

Package name:      libpng proftpd
Summary:           Potential security holes
Date:              2004-04-30
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:

  libpng:
  A library of functions for creating and manipulating PNG
  (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

  proftpd:
  An enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
  and ease of configuration.  It features a very Apache-like configuration
  syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including
  support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and
  permission-based directory visibility.

Problem description:

  libpng:
  Steve Grubb discovered that libpng would access memory that is out of
  bounds when creating an error message. The impact of this bug is not
  clear, but it could lead to a core dump in a program using libpng, or
  could result in a DoS (Denial of Service) condition in a daemon that
  uses libpng to process PNG images.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0421 to this issue.

  proftpd:
  A portability workaround was applied in version 1.2.9 of the FTP
  server ProFTPD. As a side-effect, CIDR based (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/NN)
  ACL entries in "Allow" and "Deny" directives act like a "AllowAll"
  directive and so FTP clients are granted access to files and
  directories although the server configuration explicitly deny this
  access.

  This issue only affects proftpd 1.2.9, which is shipped with Trustix
  Secure Linux 2.1 and Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2.  Trustix Secure
  Linux 2.0 uses proftpd 1.2.8, and is NOT affected by this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
