Updated on:        2004-04-30
Product:           Red Hat Linux

1. Topic:

An updated X-Chat package fixes a vulnerability which could be exploited by
a malicious Socks-5 proxy is now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

X-Chat is a graphical IRC chat client for the X Window System.

A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the X-Chat's Socks-5 proxy code.
An attacker could create a malicious Socks-5 proxy server in such a way
that X-Chat would execute arbitrary code if a victim configured X-Chat to
use the proxy.

Users of X-Chat should upgrade to this updated package which contains a
backported security patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/xchat-1.8.11-9.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/xchat-1.8.11-9.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/team/key.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
