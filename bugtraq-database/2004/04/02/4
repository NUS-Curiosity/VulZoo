Immunity is proud to announce the release of a new paper by Dave
Aitel, which concentrates on the specific problems of large enterprise
application security.

Available in PDF:
http://www.immunitysec.com/papers/enterprise_specific_security.sxw.pdf
Or the original OpenOffice:
http://www.immunitysec.com/papers/enterprise_specific_security.sxw

Large enterprises use a different class of software than small
companies. This software and the environment it is purchased in is
subject to particular constraints that often require a different
strategy. This paper presents the problems with concrete and current
examples and suggests some solutions.

Thanks,
Dave Aitel
