Subject: RE: MS04-011 Break SSL support in IE 6.0.3790.0 with Windows 2003


This is a functionality regression that has been around for some time.
The weird part of the MS04-011 patch is that it only occurs on Windows
2003.

with Windows 2003


Hello everyone,

A warning to all Windows 2003 user, this happened on two machine who had
the exact same software configuration but different hardware.

After installing the latest set of patches from microsoft, I was unable
to access sites using SSL, after some investigation it turned out that
my IE Cipher strength was set to 0bit ... After lot of troubleshooting
and tryout with the different solutions offered by Microsoft I decided
to take a guess and uninstall the MS04-011 patch... Well, the problem
solved itself, the IE Cipher Strength is now at 128 like it was before,
I can now access sites using SSL, windowsupdate, msn, etc

Weird ...

Anyone experienced something similar, or its just me ?
