I have experienced this issue, eventually I was able to uninstall the
patch, the specific one that caused it was KB835732.  According to some
information I found using Google it makes a difference if the Secondary
IDE Channel's Device 1 is set to use DMA if available as a transfer mode
instead of PIO Only.  I'm not sure just how valid this is because I have
not tried, but I would be interested to know if anyone managed to get
this fixed after installing the patch.  I'm not happy about having to
leave my system vunerable right now.
