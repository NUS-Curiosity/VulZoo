Subject: [BUG-CORRECTION] IISShield "Server" header costumization


Hi all,

A new version (v1.0.4) of IISShield was released concerning a bug correction
regarding the parsing of the "Server" header costumization. The problem
concerned the interpretation of the "Server" header costumization. When the
objective was to leave the "Server" header with its default value, IISShield
would wrongly remove the "Server" header from the HTTP Response.

Download of the new version (v1.0.4) is available at
http://www.kodeit.org/products/iisshield/download.htm

If anyone finds any other problems, please feel free to report them to me or
to the IISShield mailing list available at:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/IISShield/

As always, thank you for the given support,
Tiago Halm
