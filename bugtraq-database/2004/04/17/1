Subject: Office XP Update: March 23, 2004


I guess Microsoft is getting in to the habit of releasing security 
updates without a security bulletin. That should help them in their 
public relations, oops I mean security, campaign.

This update won't show up on Windows Update. If you do a scan on Office 
Update you'll be offered the patch. How many people do that on a regular 
basis?
