Subject: IETF Draft on Transmission Control Protocol security considerations


>From the Abstract:

   TCP (RFC793 [1]) is widely deployed and one of the most often used
   reliable end to end protocols for data communication. Yet when it was
   defined over 20 years ago the internet, as we know it, was a
   different place lacking many of the threats that are now common.
   Recently several rather serious threats have been detailed that can
   pose new methods for both denial of service and possibly data
   injection by blind attackers. This document details those threats and
   also proposes some small changes to the way TCP handles inbound
   segments that either eliminate the threats or at least minimize them
   to a more acceptable level.
