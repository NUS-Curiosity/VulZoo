Synopsis:          Updated kernel packages resolve security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:166-01
Issue date:        2004-04-21
Updated on:        2004-04-21
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2004:065
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0003 CAN-2004-0109 CAN-2004-0177
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated kernel packages that fix several minor security vulnerabilities are
now available

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - athlon, i386, i586, i686

3. Problem description:

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

iDefense reported a buffer overflow flaw in the ISO9660 filesystem code. 
An attacker could create a malicious filesystem in such a way that they
could gain root privileges if that filesystem is mounted.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0109 to this issue.

Solar Designer from OpenWall discovered a minor information leak in the
ext3 filesystem code due to the lack of initialization of journal
descriptor blocks.  This flaw has only minor security implications and
exploitation requires privileged access to the raw device.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0177 to this issue.

These packages also contain an updated fix with additional checks for
issues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0003 to this issue.

Additionally, hardening of the mremap function was applied to
prevent a potential local denial of service attack.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain
backported security patches that correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt
