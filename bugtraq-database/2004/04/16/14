I played around a bit to find out whether my own computer (with 
ZoneAlarm Pro) was vulnerable and, accidentally, found a similar 
behaviour from my ISPs mailserver, apparently being Exim 4.24.

When attaching any 'normally' named .EXE, my email is returned to me by 
Exim, with a note saying: "This kind of attachment is not good for 
you.....".
If I rename the same .EXE to, say, (c).exe, it gets delivered and 
ZoneAlarm lets it in without quarantining it.

Two bugs for the price of one!
