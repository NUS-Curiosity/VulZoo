Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0020

Package name:      kernel
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2004-04-15
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of
  your Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the
  basic functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process
  allocation, device input and output, etc.

Problem description:

  CAN-2004-0109:
  zen-parse discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
  ISO9660 filesystem component of Linux kernel which could be abused
  by an attacker to gain unauthorised root access.  Sebastian
  Krahmer and Ernie Petrides developed a correction for this.

  CAN-2004-0133:
  Usage of not properly initialized memory in the XFS code was
  discovered.  This lead to an information leakage where some blocks
  in the file system would contain old data from the system memory.

  CAN-2004-0177:
  Usage of not properly initialized memory in the ext3 code was
  discovered by Solar Designer of the Openwall project.  This lead to
  an information leakage where some blocks in the file system would
  contain old data from the system memory.  This was the first such 
  vulnerability discovered, and directly lead to XFS and JFS being
  checked for this.

  CAN-2004-0181:
  Usage of not properly initialized memory in the JFS code was
  discovered.  This lead to an information leakage where some blocks
  in the file system would contain old data from the system memory.
