Subject: Hi! Antiviruses Comparison - A Little Research Results


Hi everyone!
Just wanted to say to all of you that Mcafee(Pro 8) seems to be the best 
antivirus around.
Mcafee auto updates itself without asking(norton asks). And displays
It is the only one(from norton 2004,panda and mcafee) who identifies the 
following as viruses/backdoors:

1. VBS/Inor.B
2. VBS/Psyme
3. Exploit -CodeBase.Gen
4. JS/Exploit-FileProxy
5. JV/ShinWow
6. X-Wreck(my own - unpublished backdoor - identified by the huristic 
engine)
7. http://www.realtime-spy.com keylogger
8. Cain & Abel(which is a trijan) - as possibly evil tool
9. Nmap - as possibly evil tool

As the facts proove mcafee is the best for now, though i saw a research 
claiming BitDefender
as the best. BitDefender is great, but comparing it with mcafee is a little 
hard task to do.
