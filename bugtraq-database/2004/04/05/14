Subject: Macromedia Dreamweaver Remote Database Scripts (#NISR05042004B)


NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Macromedia Dreamweaver Remote Database Scripts
Systems Affected: IIS/Dreamweaver MX and UltraDev 4
Severity: Critical
Vendor URL: http://www.macromedia.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ david@...software.com ]
Date Vendor Notified:    10th March 2004
Date of Public Advisory: 5th April 2004
Advisory number: #NISR05042004B
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/dreamweaver.txt

Description
***********
Macromedia's Dreamweaver is used to develop web sites and applications. To
aid in the development of web applications that require database
connectivity certain test scripts are created and uploaded to the website.
These scripts help to test database connectivity. If left these scripts can
allow an attacker to gain access to the backend database server, without the
attacker having to supply a user ID and password.

Details
*******
To help test database connectivity when a web application is being developed
an ASP script, mmhttpdb.asp, is upload to the website. This script can be
accessed without and user ID or password and contains numerous operations.
One of these operations allows users to list all Datasource Names defined on
the web server. A second operation allows users to run arbitrary SQL
queries. Using a combination of these two operations an attacker can
compromise the backend database server. The vulnerable ASP script is usually
uploaded to a "_mmServerScripts" directory if using Dreamweaver MX or
"_mmDBScripts" directory if using Dreamweaver Ultradev. These directories
should be deleted on production systems.

Macromedia was alerted to this problem on the 10th of March, 2004 and has
