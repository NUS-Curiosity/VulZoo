This is an update to SGI Security Advisory 20030601-01-A:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20030601-01-A

AtStake and CERT reported a network device driver vulnerability
called EtherLeak:

 http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/atstake_etherleak_report.pdf
 http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/412115
 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0001

The gXX and tgXX gigabit network interfaces, and efXX network interface on
SGI systems are not vulnerable to this issue.

However, older SGI network interfaces are potentially vulnerable, but
they are in legacy support mode with no new fixes/patches provided.

To find out which network interfaces you have installed, run:
 % hinv -c network
 Fast Ethernet: ef1, version 1, module 2, slot io1, pci 2
 Integral Fast Ethernet: ef0, version 1, module 1, slot io1, pci 2

In the above example, both interfaces are efXX NICs and are not
vulnerable to the EtherLeak security issue.
