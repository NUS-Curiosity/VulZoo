MPSB 04-05 Potential Risk in Dreamweaver Remote Database 
Connectivity 

Originally posted: April 1, 2004 
Last updated: April 1, 2004 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  


Summary:  

Dreamweaver's remote database connectivity for testing 
dynamic database-driven websites installs scripts that 
may reveal DSNs to outside attackers. A sophisticated 
attacker may also be able to use these scripts to send 
SQL commands to the server and gain control of the 
database server. 

~~~~~~~ 

Solution: 

Customers should not define a database connection using 
the driver on a testing server accessible to the public. 
To prevent unauthorized access to the database, password- 
protect the database. If a database connection has been 
defined, use Dreamweaver's Remove Connection Scripts 
menu command to remove the files that expose the database. 
This issue is described in greater detail in Security 
implications of remote database connectivity (TechNote 
19214).

~~~~~~~ 

Severity Rating: 
 
Macromedia categorizes this issue as a critical update 
and recommends affected users immediately remove the 
connection scripts from publicly accessible servers. 

http://www.macromedia.com/go/DMJL_AACF 

~~~~~~~ 

Affected Software Versions: 

Dreamweaver MX 2004 (all versions) 
Dreamweaver MX (all versions) 
Dreamweaver UltraDev 4 (all versions) 

~~~~~~~ 

Details: 

When you specify "Using Driver On Testing Server" or 
"Using DSN on Testing Server" in the database connections 
dialog box, Dreamweaver automatically uploads a script 
file to the testing server that allows Dreamweaver to 
manipulate the remote database driver via the HTTP 
protocol. This allows Dreamweaver to get the database 
information it needs in order to help the user create 
their site. However, this file does make it possible to 
see the data source names (DSNs) defined on the system. 
If the DSNs and databases are not password protected, 
the script also enables an attacker to issue SQL commands 
to the database.

Generation Security Software Limited for reporting this 
vulnerability and for working with us to help protect
