well ! this story is just a beta version of the new french liberticide law wich will come into effect very soon (next week).

France became a pseudo-monarchical-democracy, where the laws are made without requiring the opinion of the concerned people.

The article 323-3-1 of this "Law" will prohibit publication of any vuln. technical details, any proof of concept and any exploit. 

We can see that "searching & finding vulnerabilties" is/and will be a crime !

The legislators forgot that finding vulnerabilties and publishing exploits is not the cause of the problem, it's just a consequence of the insecurity.

They want to show reality as they wish it, and not as it exists ...

God bless (in)security and god bless (in)liberty !
