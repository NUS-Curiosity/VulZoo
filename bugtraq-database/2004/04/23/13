Symantec Security Advisory

SYM04-007

20 April, 2004 
Symantec Client Firewall Denial of Service Vulnerability 

Revision History
none

Risk Impact
High

Overview
eEye Digital Security notified Symantec Corporation of a severe Denial of 
Service vulnerability they discovered in the Symantec Client Firewall 
products for Windows. By properly exploiting this issue, an attacker could 
render the targeted system inoperable.

Affected Components
Retail:
Symantec Norton Internet Security and Professional 2003, 2004
Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2003, 2004

Corporate:
Symantec Client Firewall 5.01, 5.1.1
Symantec Client Security 1.0 and 1.1

Details
eEye Digital Security notified Symantec of a Denial of Service 
vulnerability they found during product testing against Symantecâ€™s client 
firewall applications.  By directing a specifically formatted TCP attack 
against a target system running a vulnerable Symantec application, an 
attacker can cause a complete system halt.  As a result, the targeted 
system would require a system reboot to clear the problem.

Symantec Response
Symantec confirmed the vulnerability reported by eEye Digital Security. 
Symantec product engineers have developed fixes for the issue and released 
patches for all impacted products through Symantec LiveUpdate and 
technical support channels. 

Clients using retail versions of Symantec Norton Internet Security and 
Symantec Norton Personal Firewall who regularly run Symantec LiveUpdate 
should already be protected against this issue.  However, to be sure they 
are fully protected, customers should run Symantec LiveUpdate manually to 
ensure all available updates are installed.
Open any installed Symantec product
Click on LiveUpdate in the toolbar
Run LiveUpdate until Symantec LiveUpdate indicated that all installed 
Symantec products are up-to-date

Clients running corporate versions of Symantec Client Firewall or Symantec 
Client Security should download and apply patches obtained through their 
appropriate support channels.

Symantec is not aware of any active attempts against or customer impact 
from this issue. 

CVE
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) initiative has assigned 
Candidate CAN-2004-0375 to this issue. 
This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org),
