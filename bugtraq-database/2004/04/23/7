Crisco is a marketting machine and nothing more. We spent 12 years supporting
them and at every turn were told lies about the product, new product
and their vaporware. But management was getting huge perks for doing
business with them.

Do a comparison of Crisco and other network vendors on S-Focus for bugs,
 vulns and otherwise lame stuff.

Then, armed with this info, take it to your manager whose getting the
free golf trip to barbados and say, I can't work with this stuff; it's
to buggy.
