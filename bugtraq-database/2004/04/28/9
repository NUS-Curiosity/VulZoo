If you read the horde_src/docs/INSTALL file there is a section when you 
configure it that says

   Be sure to change the default password, "horde", to something
   else before creating the tables! (Remember to use this password
   when you configure Horde in the next step.)

Also the script that creates the mysql database located at 
horde_src/scripts/db/mysql_create.sql has the following items.  Again a 
warning about changing the password...

USE mysql;

REPLACE INTO user (host, user, password)
    VALUES (
        'localhost',
        'horde',
  -- IMPORTANT: Change this password!
        PASSWORD('horde')
    );

Obviously, this was overlooked in whatever installation you were looking 
at.  In fact, it looks like your administrator removed the default horde 
password and replaced it with nothing...even worse than using the default 
password.
