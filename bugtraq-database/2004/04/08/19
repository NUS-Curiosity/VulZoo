Is there any real point in testing Windows 9*, still ?
Does anyone care, including Microsoft, enough to want it fixed rather
than get people to upgrade to something that is better when it comes
to security, overall ?

This is approaching 6 years plus in age and has surely got to be in
the "so what" category by now.  Similarly, IE4 has dropped off the
things to check and you didn't test with Linux 2.2 or 2.0 or whatever
else is of similar same vintage (not that I would expect any difference in
terms of results).
