I know that it is bad form to reply to your own post, but here it goes anyway:

There is an accompanying file called nwiz.exe in the \Winnt folder.

The worm/virus writes the following to an infected machines hosts file

127.0.0.1	www.symantec.com
127.0.0.1	securityresponse.symantec.com
127.0.0.1	symantec.com

127.0.0.1	rads.mcafee.com
127.0.0.1	trendmicro.com
127.0.0.1	www.trendmicro.com

I also noticed that the fully patched and av protected machines that were infected had lame administrator passwords (and the account "Administrator" had not been renamed), which is the most likely point of compromise.

All in all not something to worry about unless you dont have MS03-039 or use 123456 as your admin password :)

Mail from "Polazzo Justin" <Justin.Polazzo@...ilities.gatech.edu>

Concerning the new worm type infection spreading around today (6:15am EST)

the file is called ndemon.exe (.99k) and it puts itself into c:\winnt and c:winnt\system32. Registry entries HKLM\Software|Microsoft|CurrentVersion\Run and HKLM\Software|Microsoft|CurrentVersion\RunServices (Think it creates that one). 

At first look:
it then tries to propagate itself via MS ports 135, and 139 VIA known flaws and password guessing. It also listens for other infected machines on port 1025 and scans for MS IIS boxes on port 80 (to try known exploits as well)

The infected machines were win2k SP4 (fully Patched) Running Symantec AV v8.6

Just a heads up
