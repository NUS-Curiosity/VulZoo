Subject: RE: After Ms patches last Wed ...


I couldn't do anything on the system.  If I hit CTRL+ALT+DEL to get into 
the task manager, it literally took about 20 minutes.  Everything was very 
unresponsive.  I ended up having to use the "repair" feature off the win2k 
CD.  It replaced a few files and then the system was fine until I went 
back and re-updated, then the PC crashed after about 15 minutes and upon 
reboot the system was 100% again.  I repeated the "repair" option to get 
everything back to normal again.  And yes, it was the "system" process 
that was 99-100%, not the system idle process.
