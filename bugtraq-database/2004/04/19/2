Synopsis
========

XChat is vulnerable to a stack overflow that may allow a remote
attacker to run arbitrary code.

Background
==========

XChat is a multiplatform IRC client.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     net-irc/xchat      < 2.0.8-r1                         >= 2.0.8-r1

Description
===========

The SOCKS 5 proxy code in XChat is vulnerable to a remote exploit.
Users would have to be using XChat through a SOCKS 5 server, enable
SOCKS 5 traversal which is disabled by default and also connect to an
attacker's custom proxy server.

Impact
======

This vulnerability may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code within
the context of the user ID of the XChat client.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

All XChat users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-irc/xchat-2.0.8-r1"
    # emerge ">=net-irc/xchat-2.0.8-r1"

Note that users of the gtk1 version of xchat (1.8.*) should upgrade to
xchat-1.8.11-r1:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "=net-irc/xchat-1.8.11-r1"
    # emerge "=net-irc/xchat-1.8.11-r1"
