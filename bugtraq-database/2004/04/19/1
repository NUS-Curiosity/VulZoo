Synopsis
========

Two new vulnerabilities have been found in the HTTP interface of monit,
possibly leading to denial of service or execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Monit is a system administration utility that allows management and
monitoring of processes, files, directories and devices on a Unix
system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     app-admin/monit        <= 4.2                            >= 4.2.1

Description
===========

Monit has several vulnerabilities in its HTTP interface : a buffer
overflow vulnerability in the authentication handling code and a
off-by-one error in the POST method handling code.

Impact
======

An attacker may exploit the off-by-one error to crash the Monit daemon
and create a denial of service condition, or cause a buffer overflow
that would allow arbitrary code to be executed with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

Monit users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 or later:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/monit-4.2.1"
    # emerge ">=app-admin/monit-4.2.1"
