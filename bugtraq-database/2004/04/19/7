Check out the news groups at Microsoft:

http://communities.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.asp

In this case, I suggest the "windowsupdate" newsgroup

These news groups are peer-peer support, although MVP's lurk.
If MSDN customer, MS guarantees an answer in 3 days or they will pick it 
up.

You can search such newsgroups for answers by going to Google Groups 
search.
