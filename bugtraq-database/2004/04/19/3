Synopsis
========

There are multiple format string vulnerabilities in the neon library
used in cadaver, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code when
connected to a malicious server.

Background
==========

According to http://www.webdav.org/cadaver, cadaver is a command-line
WebDAV client for Unix. It supports file upload, download, on-screen
display, namespace operations (move/copy), collection creation and
deletion, and locking operations.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     net-misc/cadaver       < 0.22.1                         >= 0.22.1

Description
===========

Cadaver code includes the neon library, which in versions 0.24.4 and
previous is vulnerable to multiple format string attacks. The latest
version of cadaver uses version 0.24.5 of the neon library, which makes
it immune to this vulnerability.

Impact
======

When using cadaver to connect to an untrusted WebDAV server, this
vulnerability can allow a malicious remote server to execute arbitrary
code on the client with the rights of the user using cadaver.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

cadaver users should upgrade to version 0.22.1 or later:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-misc/cadaver-0.22.1"
    # emerge ">=net-misc/cadaver-0.22.1"
