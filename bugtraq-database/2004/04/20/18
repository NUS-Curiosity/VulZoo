I assume by hashing you mean scribbling over the password value in
ARGV? That still leaves a race condition where the password is visible
between the execve and the overwriting; There is no secure way of
passing secrets on the commandline on a multiuser unix system. Use a
file descriptor or a file (either of which can ofcourse be referenced
on the command line).
