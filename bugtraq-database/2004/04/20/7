The Knowledge Base article is no longer available on

Isn't the "Resolution" in this Knowledge Base article a little, uh,
ill-advised:

<http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;820673>

Isn't this the same company that says things like this under "Mitigating

Factors" in their security bulletins:

"Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations
can help protect networks from remote attacks originating outside of the
enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend blocking all ports that
are not actually being used. For this reason, most systems attached to
the Internet should have a minimal number of the affected ports
exposed."

Unless you want to use Outlook, I guess.

I don't even want to think about the implications of Microsoft
*encouraging* 
Outlook users to uninstall anti-virus software...
