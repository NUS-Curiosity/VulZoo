The problem is present in SUSE Linux 8.2 and 9.0. SUSE Linux releases
before 8.2 are not affected. 
Update packages for YOU will be released within the following days. They
fix the vulnerability by using the user's home directory for storing the
information about possibly pending updates. It should be noted that YOU
(Yast Online Update) needs (of course) to be run as root to be able to not
only check for updates, but to be able to actually install them.
