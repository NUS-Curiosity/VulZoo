Cisco Security Advisory: A Default Username and Password in WLSE and HSE
Devices

Revision 1.1

Last Updated

For Public Release 2004 April 07 1600 UTC (GMT)

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
=======
A default username/password pair is present in all releases of the
Wireless LAN Solution Engine (WLSE) and Hosting Solution Engine (HSE)
software. A user who logs in using this username has complete control of
the device. This username cannot be disabled. There is no workaround.

This advisory is available at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040407-username.shtml.

Affected Products
=================
  * The affected software releases for WLSE are 2.0, 2.0.2 and 2.5.
   
  * The affected software releases for HSE are 1.7, 1.7.1, 1.7.2 and
    1.7.3.
   

Details
=======
A hardcoded username and password pair is present in all software
releases for all models of WLSE and HSE devices.

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID 
CSCsa11583 (registered customers only) for the WLSE and CSCsa11584  
(registered customers only) for the HSE.

CiscoWorks WLSE provides centralized management for the Cisco Wireless
LAN infrastructure. It unifies the other components in the solution and
actively employs them to provide continual "Air/RF" monitoring, network
security, and optimization. The CiscoWorks WLSE also assists network
managers by automating and simplifying mass configuration deployment,
fault monitoring and alerting.

Cisco Hosting Solution Engine is a hardware-based solution to monitor and
activate a variety of e-business services in Cisco powered data centers.
It provides fault and performance information about the Layer 2-3 hosting
infrastructure and Layer 4-7 hosted services.

Impact
======
Any user who logs in using this username has complete control of the
device. One can add new users or modify details of the existing users,
and change the device's configuration. Here are some more concrete
examples of possible actions:
   
   
  * For WLSE this means that an adversary can hide the presence of a
    rogue Access Point or change the Radio Frequency plan, potentially
    causing system-wide outages. The first action may cause long term
    loss of information confidentiality and integrity. The second action
    can yield Denial-of-Service (DOS).
   
  * For HSE this may lead up to illegal re-directing of a Web site with
    the ultimate loss of revenue.
   
  * In both cases the device itself may be used as a launching platform
    for further attacks. Such attacks could be directed at your
    organization, or towards a third party.
   

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================
For WLSE, users need to install the WLSE-2.x-CSCsa11583-K9.zip patch. The
patch can be downloaded from 
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/wlan-sol-eng (registered 
customers only) This patch is applicable to WLSE 1130 software releases
2.0, 2.0.2 and 2.5.

For HSE, users need to install the HSE-1.7.x-CSCsa11584.zip patch. The
patch can be downloaded from 
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/1105-host-sol (registered
customers only). This patch is applicable to HSE 1105 for versions
1.7, 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.7.3.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================
Customers with Service Contracts

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's Worldwide
Web site at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third-party Support Organizations

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact
that support organization for assistance with the upgrade, which should
be free of charge.

Customers without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.
   
   
  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
   
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
   
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com
   

Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades
for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
"security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

If you need assistance with the implementation of the workarounds, or
have questions on the workarounds, please contact the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC).
