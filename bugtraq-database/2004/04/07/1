Subject: Papers: The Invisible Catalog


Just letting you all know ISECOM has released the December 2003
version of the TIC to the public.  We now have three of the TICs
freely available to the public on-line.

For those of you unfamiliar with the TIC, it's not your typical
security newsletter.  It's a small catalog of ideas, prospects,
business, ethics, and consultations within the security industry.
It's also a little sarcastic.

See the current one at https://www.isecom.org/tic/TIC_dec2003.htm.
You can find the others at https://www.isecom.org/tic/

Sincerely,
-pete.
