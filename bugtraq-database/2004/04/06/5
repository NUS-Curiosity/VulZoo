Subject: Paper:  Comparing binaries with graph isomorphisms



I'm pleased to announce the availability of a new paper:

Comparing binaries with graph isomorphisms.
http://razor.bindview.com/publish/papers/comparing-binaries.html

The paper presents a method and algorithms for finding differences
between two versions of a binary executable file, based on graph
isomorphisms.  One possible application is to discover the differences
in a security patch, and a couple examples in that vein are shown.  A
brief comparison is also made to Halvar Flake's function signatures
approach (as I understand it).

The tool implementing the technique is not being made available at
this time, but will likely be released later this year.
