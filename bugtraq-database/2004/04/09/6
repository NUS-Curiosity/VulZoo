Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilites have been found in pwlib that may lead to a
remote denial of service or buffer overflow attack.

Background
==========

pwlib is a multi-platform library designed for OpenH323.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package         /    Vulnerable    /                     Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      dev-libs/pwlib       <= 1.5.2-r2                        >= 1.5.2-r3

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the implimentation of
protocol H.323 contained in pwlib. Most of the vulnerabilies are in the
parsing of ASN.1 elements which would allow an attacker to use a
maliciously crafted ASN.1 element to cause unpredictable behavior in
pwlib.

Impact
======

An attacker may cause a denial of service condition or cause a buffer
overflow that would allow arbitrary code to be executed with root
privileges.

Workaround
==========

Blocking ports 1719 and 1720 may reduce the likelihood of an attack.
All users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected
package.

Resolution
==========

All pwlib users are advised to upgrade to version 1.5.2-r3 or later:

     # emerge sync

     # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/pwlib-1.5.2-r3"
     # emerge ">=dev-libs/pwlib-1.5.2-r3"
