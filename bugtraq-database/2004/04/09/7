Subject: Full-Disclosure is now ILLEGAL in France ! (Vulnerabilties,
    Technical details, Exploits ...)




A new anti-security law was voted yesterday in France, this law called LEN (loi pour la confiance dans l'�conomie num�rique), the article 34 with his 323-3-1 says :

"The fact, without legitimate reason, of holding, of offering, of
yielding or of placing at the disposal equipment, instrument, a
data-processing or program conceived or especially adapted to
make the facts envisaged by articles 323-1 to 323-3 is punished sorrows
planned respectively for the infringement itself or the infringement
most severely repressed."

Translation :

- having or distributing exploit code and/or detailed vulnerability
information and/or information about hacking techniques, is ILLEGAL.
- having or distributing hacking/security tools, scanners, pen testers, or technical white papers is ILLEGAL.
- magazines and websites distributing security information about vulnerabilities or exploits are ILLEGAL.

pathetic !

the term "hold...without legitimate reason" replaced the the presumption of innocence by the "presumption of culpability", it means : "Any person handling exploits/viruses (researcher,consultant,hacker or kiddie) is guilty, and is in an illegal situation which could lead him to be charged - And if you are charged, YOU have to prove that you are
innocent"

Send us our "green cards" - thanks !
