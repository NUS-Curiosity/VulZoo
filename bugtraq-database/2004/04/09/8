 Package name:           ipsec-tools
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2004:027
 Date:                   April 8th, 2004

 Affected versions:	 10.0
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A very serious security flaw was discovered by Ralf Spenneberg in 
 racoon, the IKE daemon of the KAME-tools.  Racoon does not very the RSA
 signature during phase one of a connection using either main or
 aggressive mode.  Only the certificate of the client is verified, the
 certificate is not used to verify the client's signature.
 
 All versions of ipsec-tools prior to 0.2.5 and 0.3rc5 are vulnerable
 to this issue.  The provided package updates ipsec-tools to 0.2.5.
