And if so, surely any place where you see "Windows 9*/ME" should bring a
"you need to start planning on upgrading/replacing these with 2K/XP, if

If the time an entry stays in the queue is less than the time required
for reassembly to occur then even a FIFO will not suffice as an adequate
algorithmic countermeasure.  There are solutions to this too, but this
is just to say that it's more complex than "throw this data structure
in to fix."
