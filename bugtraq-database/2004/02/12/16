Right. On Unix "WEB-INF" and "WEB-INF.." are two different, legal file
names. On Windows, trailing dots seem to be ignored, so "WEB-INF" and
"WEB-INF.." are just two names for the same file. This also works if the
filename already has an extension, so for example "foo.html" and
"foo.html....." are the same file, too. I wonder whether that can be
exploited, too: Get the contents of a CGI script by requesting
"foo.cgi."?
