Not only do a lot of MyDoom's go to nonexistent recipients, they go to 
nonexistent recipients *by design*. These are intentional bounces where 
the worm is putting a simple but typically nonexistent email address in 
the "To:" and putting it's intended target address in the "From:". Then it 
uses the 5xx failures to deliver the worm via the bounce mechanism, so 
that the recipient gets an actual non-delivery report, not a faked one.

It is a subtle distinction, but I don't recall this method of delivery 
being used previously. All those bounces/rejections you see in your 
mail-server logs for "bill@...rdomain.com", "jane@...rdomain.com", 
"john@...rdomain.com", and "sam@...rdomain.com", etc. are NOT really 
attempts to deliver the worm to those made-up addresses (though I doubt 
the worm author would mind if the addresses did exist...). They are meant 
to bounce to the *actual* intended recipient, who is listed in the "From:"

I agree that the 5xx failures correctly bounce the complete message. But 
it is that predictable process that is being exploited by the worm author.
