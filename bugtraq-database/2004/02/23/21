Vendor's Description:

"Avirt Voice acts as an H.323 gateway between IP networks. It allows
users to operate H.323 applications, like Microsoft NetMeeting, Intel
Video Phone, or Netspeak Webphone, from behind a firewall.
Because Voice is a software solution, it is more easily scalable and
much less expensive than hardware alternatives."
