Subject: Re: Windows XP explorer.exe heap overflow.


This could actually be much worse since it looks like Internet Explorer
and Outlook will happily display WMF files with no questions asked.

Has anyone crafted a test WMF file we can use to check whether this
could be exploited via an email worm through Outlook?
