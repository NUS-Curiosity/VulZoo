Subject: SNMP community string disclosure in Linksys WAP55AG




Linksys WAP55AG does not properly secure SNMP community strings. In particular, it is possible to obtain all community strings, including read/write, by querying OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.3955.2.1.13.1.2.

1.3.6.1.4.1.3955.2.1.13.1.2.1 = STRING: "public"
1.3.6.1.4.1.3955.2.1.13.1.2.2 = STRING: "private"

Verified on WAP55AG, firmware 1.07

Vendor notified 1/16/04 and 1/20/04, no response.
