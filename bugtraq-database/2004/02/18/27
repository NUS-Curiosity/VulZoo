Could you please elaborate how you were able to cause this behaviour
with OpenSSH's sshd?  (ssh -vvv and matching sshd -ddd would be very 
helpful, feel free to send those to me directly or post to the OpenSSH 
devel list: openssh-unix-dev at mindrot.org.)

An account with rlogin=false will cause the loginrestrictions test (in
getpwnamallow() in auth.c) to fail.  The remainder of the
authentications will consider the user "illegal" but should not give any
external indication of this.  You will see "3004-306 Remote logins are
not allowed for this account" on the server side if you have debugging
enabled, but this is (well, should) not sent to the user.

I tested "openssh361p2_51_patch.tar.Z" from the IBM site on 5.1 ML4 and 
was not able to reproduce the described behaviour with the default 
config.  The only way I could cause it was with the root account with 
PermitRootLogin=yes and UseLogin=yes.  PermitRootLogin=no prevented it, 
and UseLogin is not on by default (at least in the vanilla OpenSSH 
distribution).

     Good judgement comes with experience. Unfortunately, the experience
usually comes from bad judgement.
