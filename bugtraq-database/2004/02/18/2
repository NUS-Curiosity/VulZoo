	Then contact FIRST.

	Forum of Incident Reaction Security Teams.

	Many, if not most, CERTs are members.

	This I seriously doubt.  We have no indicators leading in that
direction.

	No.  ASN.1 (not ASN) may be used in VoIP, but it's not what it's
"based on".  I won't rehash what other have refuted, here.  If it's
possible, it's likely we'll see other indicators pointing in that
direction.

	Better to be informed than alarmist.
