S-Quadra was given specific information about available fixes and other comments related to the alleged security vulnerabilities. Yet they decided not to post any of them. This behavior seems highly unprofessional.

The following is Early Impact's official response to the alleged vulnerabilities concerning the company's ProductCart ecommerce software.


-- Vulnerability 1: Incorrect use of cryptography

Early Impact official response: Vulnerability 1 cannot be exploited since vulnerability 2 and 3 have been addressed. Nevertheless, Early Impact is further investigating the issue and will look at alternative uses of cryptography for future versions of ProductCart.
