	Sqwebmail reads the filesystem directly, so will be doing this 
itself.  It doesn't depend on the qmail setup.  Sqwebmail is part of the 
Courier suite.  While I am using all the other software in the courier 
suite, I'm using SquirrelMail instead of sqwebmail.  Sqwebmail accesses 
the filesystem directly for performance reasons.  But I prefer to keep my 
web server and mail servers separate.

	So, I place the blame squarely on sqwebmail.  However, I know the 
Courier folks are quite responsive to security issues, so I've included 
MrSam on this message.
