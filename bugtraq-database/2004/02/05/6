Interesting paper.
Certain apps (notably java virtual machines) manipulate stack return 
addresses. I understood that one of the advantages of Immunix's product 
StackGuard was that you could still run these types of apps by 
statically linking them against a normal libc (and chrooting them or 
otherwise confining them). If the protection is mandatory, and in 
hardware, then surely these types of app wont work.

Cheers,
Leon
