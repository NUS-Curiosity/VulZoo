Microsoft contains multiple vulnerabilities within their vulnerabilities
the most serious of which could allow another vulnerability to execute
another vulnerability and open a Pandora's box of vulnerabilities which
can lead to a Denial of Service attack on an administrator's inbox.

Microsoft Security Bulletins describe vulnerabilities. When issuing these
vulnerability bulletins, Microsoft has been creating localhost based
Denial of Service attacks on administrator mailboxes worldwide. The
problem arises by various security organizations releasing too many
Microsoft vulnerability alerts for programs which have security flaws.
