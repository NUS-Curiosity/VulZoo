They have these items for parents to track their children.   It clips on
the child's clothing.  Once it's set, if the child goes more than 30 ft
away, both parts start chirping.  After 15 seconds of chirping, both
parts go into alarm.  If someone removes the clip, it immediately goes
into alarm.  You have to connect the two parts in order to disable the
alarm.

No GPS required.

Of course, people have to remember to turn it on and use it.

I think this may interest some people here.

I always say, whenever laptops are mentioned: "Forget everything else, I

have nightmares already!".

The loss of information due to laptop thefts is extremely high, here is 
an innovation that may possibly be as useless as car theft alarms 
(unless you are nearby and didn't leave the laptop in the car), but it's

a good start. This may actually be useful.

What I'd like to see is a GPS device with wireless communication to my 
cell phone. It can be a quiet indicator, or perhaps ring when it is 
being moved.. or even when I move too far away from it.
