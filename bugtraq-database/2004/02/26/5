                 Mandrakelinux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           kernel
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2004:015-1
 Date:                   February 25th, 2004
 Original Advisory Date: February 24th, 2004
 Affected versions:	 Corporate Server 2.1
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Paul Staretz discovered a flaw in return value checking in the
 mremap() function in the Linux kernel, versions 2.4.24 and previous
 that could allow a local user to obtain root privileges.
 
 A vulnerability was found in the R128 DRI driver by Alan Cox.  This
 could allow local privilege escalation.
 
 A flaw in the ncp_lookup() function in the ncpfs code (which is used
 to mount NetWare volumes or print to NetWare printers) was found by
 Arjen van de Ven that could allow local privilege escalation.
 
 The Vicam USB driver in Linux kernel versions prior to 2.4.25 does
 not use the copy_from_user function to access userspace, which crosses
 security boundaries.  This problem does not affect the Mandrake Linux
 9.2 kernel.
 
 Additionally, a ptrace hole that only affects the amd64/x86_64
 platform has been corrected.
 
 The provided packages are patched to fix these vulnerabilities.  All
 users are encouraged to upgrade to these updated kernels.
 
 To update your kernel, please follow the directions located at:
 
   http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/kernelupdate.php
  
Update:

 Kernels for Corporate Server 2.1/x86_64 are now available.
