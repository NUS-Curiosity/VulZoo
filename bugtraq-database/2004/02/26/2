Synopsis:          Updated mod_python packages fix denial of service vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:063-01
Issue date:        2004-02-26
Updated on:        2004-02-26
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          mod_python DoS
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0973
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated mod_python packages that fix a denial of service vulnerability are
now available for Red Hat Linux.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

mod_python embeds the Python language interpreter within the Apache httpd
server.

A bug has been found in mod_python versions 3.0.3 and earlier that can
lead to a denial of service vulnerability.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0973 to
this issue.

Although Red Hat Linux 9 shipped with a version of mod_python
that contains this bug, our testing was unable to trigger the denial of
service vulnerability.  mod_python users are, however, advised to upgrade
to these errata packages, which contain a backported patch that corrects
this bug.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/mod_python-3.0.1-4.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/mod_python-3.0.1-4.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

b7b838c6152fa51ccdc376a788fcd799 9/en/os/SRPMS/mod_python-3.0.1-4.src.rpm
bba40347ca46775a0f4545c08776b149 9/en/os/i386/mod_python-3.0.1-4.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
