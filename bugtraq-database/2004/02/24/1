Subject: Web Crossing 4.x/5.x Denial of Service Vulnerability (FIX)


Dear All,

I have recently received notification from the WebCrossing Inc. company
informing me that the Denial of Service bug which I recently provided
information on is now completely fixed, as can be seen from the 'bug fixes'
section on the updates section of their web-site.

http://wci.webcrossing.com/cgi-bin/webx.cgi?50@113.bOo7aXzZgMn.2@.f6f3987

Versions dating 5.0 09FEB04 and later are completely immune to this flaw.

I would like to thank WebCrossing Inc. for working with me to provide a
fix for these issues.

The latest version may be downloaded from:

Kindest Regards,
-Peter Winter-Smith
