I don't know of a browser setting to enable/disable it. But you can use 
something like Proxomitron to do it (http://www.proxomitron.info/). The 
gzip setting is one of the "Headers" settings and is called "
Accept-encoding: Allow webpage encoding (out)". Disable this to prevent 
gzip encoding from being used. I've done so in the past, and it does 
indeed work as advertised.

Proxomitron does *MUCH* more than this, if you are not yet familiar with 
it.
