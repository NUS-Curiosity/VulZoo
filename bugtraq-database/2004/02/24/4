Subject: Is a precise spec better?


Hi lists,

I am seeking some advise. I am currently writing a what-is-to-become RFC
on the syslog protocol (http://www.syslog.cc/ietf/protocol.html). My
work is currently in draft status, which essentially means it can be
used for discussion but nothing is really fixed yet.

I have written quite precise guidelines on what a syslog implementation
should do. There are good arguments that this is too precise. I am now
trying to get more feedback on the overall design decision. As such, I
have summarized things on a web page:

http://www.syslog.cc/ietf/why-indepth.html

I would appreciate all comments on this topic. As I am posting to
security lists, I would especially welcome a discussion if a precise
specification can eventually safe us some security trouble - and if the
effort is worth it.

Many thanks,
Rainer
