Personally I believe you've answered you're curiousities, questions, ^*,
for yourself, and for everyone else. While I don't intend on knocking
'Neowin', but I'm sure if something held substantially here, news agencies
all over the world would have covered this situation forming. Outside of
the posts on 'forums' there is nothing more than talk. Think digital Elvis
sightings here: I've seen, I've heard, someone who knows someone who knows
someone /$/*, ...

I wrote a doc a while back on the dangers of forging information called
Breaking Point, and although it was not PhD type material, this is an
exact situation I described here. What's say I wanted to make money on the
stock market, say shorting Microsoft. Get the picture? Unless some
CONCRETE information comes of it, anyone who pays attention to these
rumors are doing nothing more than adding fuel to the fire.
