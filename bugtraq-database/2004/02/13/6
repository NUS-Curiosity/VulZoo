This assumption reveals a lot about the merits of open source, doesn't
it.

Why should any of this be surprising to anyone? Haven't we all seen how
screeners make it onto the net, even screeners sent to eighty something
old Oscar judges? So, of course someone leaked this. It would have
happened sooner or later.

As for your comments on zero day, I have some strong opinions on that:

First, I recall two massive zero day exploits being used last year. One
in IE being used by spammers and one in IIS.

We should expect this trend to advance exponentially, I would think,
just considering the amount of people coming online, the natural
progression of security, the infiltration time required for the market
to meet the demand and such other natural factors. 

Read: organized crime, corrupt governments and corporations and such...
have yet to really understand the unorthodox ways of bugfinding or the
power of the field. But that they will... That is simply a force of
nature. It is inevitable. 

We should prepare for this now.

But, like most events similar to this in history, we won't. Or, we won't
do a very good job of it. Maybe others are more optimistic.
