Cute, so the security problems of NFS are being reinvented with SMBFS.
I hope that traditional mount options such as "nosuid" will work ?

Also, can you create character/block device files on an smbfs partition
that you have root locally (and not remotel) to get you access to things
like /dev/kmem, etc ?
