This is the CNET article going up.

Again, I don't know/care if this is true of MS' source code being posted,
and I too smell something fishy in the air with this whole 'story' coming
out. Considering there is supposedly 600mb's or so of alleged code, but
unless MS says something, I wouldn't know what to think of it.
