I can assure you 0-days do and have existed for a long time. In the past the
true l33t h4x0rs would turn their creations over to the kiddies when they
came up with something better to use.  Today they do it when a patch has
been released or is immanent.  In fact today, they are often nicely
pre-compiled.

I had a copy of dcom.exe several days prior to MS releasing the RPC patch.
Within a day of the release, it was all over irc and even some lists.  I
don't think many people realize how many tens or even hundreds of thousands
of zombies were created by all the kiddies typeing dcom.exe as fast as their
little fingers could go.  MSBlast was likely the best thing that could have
happened to force patching before the boxes were hijacked and patched by an
intruder.
