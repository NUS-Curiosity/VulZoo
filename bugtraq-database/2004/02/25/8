You can turn this off in Mozilla by changing the pref 
"network.http.accept-encoding", whose default value is "gzip,deflate".

You can set this in "about:config" in recent Mozilla builds, or by 
editing prefs.js or user.js in your profile using instructions available 
on the web.

This has been in Mozilla since May 2001, and should therefore be 
available in Netscape 7.x, Camino, Firefox et al. also.
