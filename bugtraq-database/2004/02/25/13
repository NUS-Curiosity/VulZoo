Subject: Alcatel Omniswitch 7000 series




Running Nessus 2.0.9 against Alcatel 7000 series causing a swith to reboot  via buffer overflow(?).

Alcatel has multiple services running on the background, with no option to shut them down. Vulnerable ports:  80, 260, 261, 443. Disabling a service via qos policy (suggested by  Alcatel) does just a minor relief, since many other possible vulnerabilities cause the same outcome. 

Systems affected: 7700, 7800, possibly 8800 (have not tested due to the critical switch location)

Tested System info:
--------------------
FPGA : 38
BootROM Version: 5.1.4.67.R01
OS: 5.1.4.27.R03

Test configuration:
-------------------
ports 1-1024
no safe-checks (NOTE: safe-checks occasionally crash the switch as well)
1870 plugins enable
all scans enable
