I would prefer to use "X-" Extension Fields in the Mail header for
this.  This could be made more flexible and without messing with the
Subject line, which might be localized or used to provide more
speific Information like "mail-worm badthing.C found".

I think this wouldn't work, and it wouldn't be a good idea in general.
Thirst of all, most privat customers use dynamic IPs, so the address
wouldn't belong to one specific user.  Furthermore these addresses
would be easy to guess (in most cases even _known_) and a great target
for spamers and worms, and finaly the average customer isn't captable
of distinguishing a false virus-warning from a real one -- there are
many hoax out there, and some worms already spread using faked
virus-warnings, so I think sending Virus-Warnings via eMail to
end-users isn't a good idea at all.

Hard measurements like that may be usefull in some cases, but the reasons
must be verified very carefully -- otherwise it would be a easy to
abuse bases for DOS attacs, just by sending complains to the ISP.
