According to PHP documentation
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.registerglobals.php) the
register_globals variable now defaults to off because of security reasons.

I can't understand, why, instead of fixing scripts not to use that feature
and thus to be more secure, should anyone try to emulate that unsafe
option by script (and possibly make it even more insecure, as it was
exactly done). That seems absurd and non-sense to me:

"Argh! They removed a thing it because it's unsecure. Let's get it back..."

I hope that PHP coders will have their lesson now.
