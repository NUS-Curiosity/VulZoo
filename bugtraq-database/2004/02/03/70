Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer

   Original issue date: February 02, 2004
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT

Systems Affected

   Microsoft Windows systems running

     * Internet Explorer 5.01
     * Internet Explorer 5.50
     * Internet Explorer 6

   Previous, unsupported, versions of Internet Explorer may also be
   affected.

Overview

   Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) contains multiple vulnerabilities,
   the most serious of which could allow a remote attacker to execute
   arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE.

Description

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-004 describes three vulnerabilities
   in Internet Explorer. These vulnerabilities are listed below. More
   detailed information is available in the individual vulnerability
   notes. Note that in addition to IE, any applications that use the IE
   HTML rendering engine to interpret HTML documents may present
   additional attack vectors for these vulnerabilities.

   VU#784102 - Microsoft Internet Explorer Travel Log Cross Domain
   Vulnerability

   A cross-domain scripting vulnerability exists in the Travel Log
   functionality of Internet Explorer. This vulnerability could allow a
   remote attacker to execute arbitrary script in a different domain,
   including the Local Machine Zone.
   (Other resources: CAN-2003-01026)

   VU#413886 - Microsoft Internet Explorer Drag-and-Drop Operation
   Vulnerability 

   Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to direct drag and drop
   behaviors and other mouse click actions by using method caching
   (SaveRef) to access the window.moveBy method.
   (Other resources: CAN-2003-01027)

   VU#652278 - Microsoft Internet Explorer does not properly display URLs

   Microsoft Internet Explorer does not properly display the location of
   HTML documents. An attacker could exploit this behavior to mislead
   users into revealing sensitive information.
   (Other resources: CAN-2003-01025)

Impact

   These vulnerabilities have different impacts, ranging from disguising
   the true location of a URL to executing arbitrary commands or code.
   Please see the individual vulnerability notes for specific
   information. The most serious of these vulnerabilities (VU#784102)
   could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
   privileges of the user running IE. The attacker could exploit this
   vulnerability by convincing the user to access a specially crafted
   HTML document, such as a web page or HTML email message. No user
   intervention is required beyond viewing the attacker's HTML document
   with IE.

Solutions

   Note: The fix included in MS04-004 for VU#652278 may cause sites that
   use URLs of the form "username:password@....example.com" to break.
   This change, along with workarounds for users and administrators of
   such sites, is covered in Microsoft KB Article 834489.
