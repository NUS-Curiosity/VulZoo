I would add:

"If anti-virus filtering software sends notifications to non-local
 recipients, then the sender address of the notifications MUST be an
 address that can be replied to, and this reply MUST reach a human
 being."

Rationale:  When my filtering software bounces all these stupid notifications,
I want a person to get stuck with all the bounce messages, thereby encouraging
him/her to turn off non-local notifications.
