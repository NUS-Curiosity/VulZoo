This would vastly simplify dictionary-attack spamming.

Better, but still might be easily abused by scripting.

Grace, shmace!  Viri can do their dirty work in a matter of seconds.  
How about the ISP *immediately* blocks just the port(s) in question?  
(Recognizing that that could be *all* ports.)  It could unblock after 
some time period with no outbound virus infection (or phone home for 
orders, etc.) attempts, and of course reblock when any new such 
activity is detected.
