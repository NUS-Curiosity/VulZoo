======================

1) sure, go ahead and use it. of course, you'd have to decompile it and do
some re-writing to send sniffed passwords to you, instead of it's intended
recipient.

2) living in both an M$-free home & office, i have no relationship at all
with any of the anti-virus companies. so....

3) i looked on their web sites for a place to submit a new virus, but
couldn't find that link. maybe you can tell me where to send it to, so
i'll know for next time.

4) i correctly guessed that [someone on] this list would figure out what
the payload is, and i'm sure someone here knows where to send it, so the
anti-virus companies are aware of it... more likely is that people in R&D
at the anti-virus companies follow the list themselves.

5) i think most people here are (or should be!) capable of safely handling
and studying a virus without getting themselves infected. anyone who can't
handle it safely should be discouraged from playing with it by the file
name.

6) maybe i should just contact the virus' author, and tell that that
they've been discovered. isn't that they proper first step when one
discovers a flaw in software (or it's distribution)?

7) a better vector would be a post on a list that is *NOT* full of
computer security professionals. the link could claim to have something to
do with the topic of the list, and probably not be called "live-virus.tgz"
