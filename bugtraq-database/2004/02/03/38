I think that virus scanners SHOULD provide some sort of information on
the reliability of headers and SMTP envelope of the virus e-mail and act
accordingly.

I use amavisd-new which has support for listing viruses/worms that fake
the sender's email address. Unfortunatelly the list is external to the
actual virus scanner and has to be updated manually.

This is a major problem, since the administrators are often (an with
good reason) not responsive enought with the rapid floods like the one
we saw recently.

I would say that a virus scanner SHOULD NOT send notifications unless it
has informations on the reliability of the sender's e-mail address.

They could be formatted with a message/delivery-status part but the
problem wouldn't exist at all if all the notifications are sent to the
real infected recipient.
