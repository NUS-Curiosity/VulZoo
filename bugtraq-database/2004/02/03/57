Summary
=======

A layer 2 frame (as defined in the Open System Interconnection Reference Model)
that is encapsulating a layer 3 packet (IP, IPX, etc.) may cause Cisco 6000/
6500/7600 series systems with Multilayer Switch Feature Card 2 (MSFC2) that
have a FlexWAN or Optical Services Module (OSM) or that run 12.1(8b)E14 to
freeze or reset, if the actual length of this frame is inconsistent with the
length of the encapsulated layer 3 packet.

This vulnerability may be exploited repeatedly causing a denial of service.

This vulnerability has been addressed by the Cisco Bug IDs CSCdy15598 and
CSCeb56052.

There is no workaround available. A software upgrade is needed to address the
vulnerability.

This advisory will be posted on the Cisco worldwide website at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040203-cat6k.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series systems with MSFC2 and a FlexWAN or OSM module are
affected.

Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series systems with MSFC2 that are running 12.1(8b)E14 are
affected even if they do not have a FlexWAN or OSM module.

Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series systems with a Supervisor 720 are not affected by
this vulnerability.

The affected systems may be running native or hybrid code.

The show module command can be used to determine if there is a FlexWAN or OSM
module on the system. A FlexWAN module will have the part number WS-X6182-2PA.
The OSM modules will have OSM in the part number.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/473/96.html for more information
about determining the type of the the MSFC used on the system.

This vulnerability only affects Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series systems with the
specified hardware or software configuration. All other systems are not
affected by this vulnerability even though they may run affected versions of
IOS.

To determine the software running on a Cisco product, log in to the device and
issue the show version command to display the system banner. Cisco IOS software
will identify itself as "Internetwork Operating System Software" or simply "IOS
^�". On the next line of output, the image name will be displayed between
parentheses, followed by "Version" and the IOS release name. Other Cisco
devices will not have the show version command or will give different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product running IOS release 12.1(11b)
E1 with an installed image name of C6MSFC2-JSV-M:

Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software IOS (tm)

MSFC2 Software (C6MSFC2-JSV-M), Version 12.1(11b)E1, EARLY DEPLOYMENT RELEASE
SOFTWARE (fc1)

Details
=======

A layer 2 frame that is encapsulating a protocol independent layer 3 packet
(IP, IPX, etc.) may cause Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series systems with an MSFC2 to
freeze or reset. The actual length of the layer 2 frame needs to be
inconsistent with the length of the encapsulated layer 3 packet.

A layer 3 packet that is routed by the Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series systems may
trigger this vulnerability if the packet is encapsulated in a specifically
crafted layer 2 frame. Crafted packets must be software switched on the
vulnerable systems to trigger this vulnerability. The packets that are switched
in hardware will not trigger this vulnerability.

Although such frames can only be sent from the local network segment, there
might be some cases where it is possible to trigger this vulnerability
remotely. For remote exploitation, the crafted layer 2 frames need to pass
through all the intermediate layer 3 devices between the source and the
destination without being clipped. Remote exploitation will not be possible
even if only a single layer 3 device on the path from source to destination
clips the crafted layer 2 frame. To the best of our knowledge, only Cisco 6000/
6500/7600 series will forward such crafted frames without being corrected.

This vulnerability has been addressed by the Cisco Bug IDs CSCdy15598 and
CSCeb56052.

  * CSCdy15598 - Affects Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series with an MSFC2 and a
    FlexWAN or OSM module. The systems that do not have a FlexWAN or OSM will
    not be affected by this bug.
   
  * CSCeb56052 - Affects Cisco 6000/6500/7600 series with an MSFC2 module. Only
    12.1(8b)E14 is affected by this bug, other software versions are not
    affected. The systems without a FlexWAN or OSM will still be affected by
    this bug if they are running 12.1(8b)E14.
   
You can use the Bug Toolkit ( registered customers only) to look up the details
of these bugs.

Impact
======

The exploitation of this vulnerability can result in freeze or the reset of the
system. A system that is frozen due to this vulnerability can be recovered by a
system reset.

Repeated exploitation may lead to a denial of service until a fixed version of
software has been loaded.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Cisco IOS Software

Each row of the table below describes a release train and the platforms or
products for which it is intended. If a given release train is vulnerable, then
the earliest possible releases that contain the fix and the anticipated date of
availability for each are listed in the Rebuild, Interim, and Maintenance
columns. A device running any release in the given train that is earlier than
the release in a specific column (less than the earliest fixed release) is
known to be vulnerable, and it should be upgraded at least to the indicated
release or a later version (greater than the earliest fixed release label).

When selecting a release, keep in mind the following definitions:

  * Rebuild-Constructed from the previous maintenance or major release in the
    same train, it contains the fix for a specific vulnerability. Although it
    receives less testing, it contains only the minimal changes necessary to
    effect the repair. Cisco has made available several rebuilds of mainline
    trains to address this vulnerability, but strongly recommends running only
    the latest maintenance release on mainline trains.
   
  * Interim-Built at regular intervals between maintenance releases and
    receives less testing. Interims should be selected only if there is no
    other suitable release that addresses the vulnerability, and interim images
    should be upgraded to the next available maintenance release as soon as
    possible. Interim releases are not available through manufacturing, and
    usually they are not available for customer download from CCO without prior
    arrangement with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
   
  * Maintenance-Most heavily tested and highly recommended release of any label
    in a given row of the table.
   
In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be
upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software
configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If
the information is not clear, contact the Cisco TAC for assistance, as shown in
the section following this table.
