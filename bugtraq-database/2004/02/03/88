Perhaps something with more limited functionality, then?

Consider a provider who offers the e-mail address of
virusalert@...vider.com (name it what you will), to which can be fed an
e-mail consisting of a single line -- that line is the IP address and a
one-word 'name' for the problem. 

Thus, if I find I'm getting MyDoom.A from 127.2.2.1, I can send a message
that will alert _someone_ (who is presumeably not asleep at the controls).

It also means that general e-mail cannot be sent via this interface -- no
spamming.  The provider can take this information, look it up (with the
timestamp the e-mail came in at, if necessary for large dynamic pools), and
take action (the least of which, I hope, would be to notify the end-user).

This could even be done without e-mail at all.  A quick HTTP GET/POST could
carry this information.  Heck, this could run much like ident/auth
services to a designated machine (i.e. virusalert.provider.com).
