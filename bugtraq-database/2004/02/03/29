Subject: Re: Oracle toplink mapping workbench password algorithm


Hi Everyone,

Martin (broadcast@...l.ptraced.net) has written a perl script to decrypt
the passwords and has kindly allowed me to host his script on my Oracle
security tools page so if anyone would like to bookmark it for future
reference its on http://www.petefinnigan.com/tools.htm or directly a
link to the file is http://www.petefinnigan.com/oracletest.perl

Kind regards

Pete
