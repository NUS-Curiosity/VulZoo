I have to agree with Simon here. Hackers don't deal in "real world"
scenarios but rather specialize in creating exceptional conditions that
wouldn't ever occur under normal operational circumstances. The fact remains
that, regardless of how remote the possibility of a hacker creating the
"right" circumstances on your network/system for an exploit to work, it's
unlikeness doesn't really sooth the nerves of the system admin having to
deal with a breach and recover vital data.
