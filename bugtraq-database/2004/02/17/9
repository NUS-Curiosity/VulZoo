Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in ShopCartCGI 2.3. There is a vulnerability in the current version of ShopCartCGI that allows an attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the webserver with its priviledges.
"ShopCartCGI is a set of scripts written in Perl to make it easy for you to design and maintain your own WEB Shopping Cart system. The major advantages of this software is that you design your WEB pages based on a simple template. The template provides the mechanisms of form data entry using CGI."
