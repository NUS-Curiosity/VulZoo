Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in phpMyAdmin which was not properly verifying user
generated input could lead to a directory traversal attack.

Description
===========

A component of the phpMyAdmin software package (export.php) does not
properly verify input that is passed to it from a remote user. Since the
input is used to include other files, it is possible to launch a
directory traversal attack.

Impact
======

Sensitive information could be gleaned from the server if an
attacker uses a malformed URL such as
http://phpmyadmin.example.com/export.php?what=../../../[existing_file]

In this scenario, the script does not sanitize the "what" argument
passed to it, allowing directory traversal attacks to take place, and
disclosing the contents of files if the file is readable as the
web-server user.

Workaround
==========

The workaround is to either patch the export.php file using the
referenced CVS patch [ 1 ] or upgrade the software via Portage.

Resolution
==========

Users are encouraged to upgrade to phpMyAdmin-2.5.6_rc1:

~    # emerge sync
~    # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.6_rc1"
~    # emerge ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.6_rc1"
~    # emerge clean

References
==========

[ 1 ] CVS Patch export.php of phpMyAdmin:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/phpmyadmin/phpMyAdmin/export.php?r1=2.3&amp;r2=2.3.2.1
