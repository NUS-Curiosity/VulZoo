Subject: ASN.1 vulnerability -is- on Win98



As per Microsoft there is now a Windows 98 security patch for MS04-007. It
was completed today and is not available o­n Windows Update at this time. If
you have a support contract with Microsoft be sure to ask your TAM for the
patch. Perhaps by the time anyone reads this the patch will be available o­n
the advisory page. I suspected this would happen.
