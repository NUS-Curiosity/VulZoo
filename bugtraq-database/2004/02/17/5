Subject: ASN.1 telephony critical infrastructure warning - VOIP


I apologize, but I am using these mailing lists to try and contact the 
different */CERT teams for different countries.

As we all know, ASN.1 is a new very easy to exploit vulnerability. It 
attacks both the server and the end user (IIS and IE).

We expect a new massive worm to come out exploiting this vulnerability 
in the next few days.

Why should this all interest you beyond it being the next blaster?

ASN is what VOIP is based on, and thus the critical infrastructure for 
telephony which is based on VOIP.

This may be a false alarm, but you know how worms find their way into 
every network, private or public. It could (maybe) potentially bring the 
system down.

I am raising the red flag, better safe than sorry.

The two email messages below are from Zak Dechovich and myself on this 
subject, to TH-Research (The Trojan Horses Research Mailing List). The 
original red flag as you can see below, was raised by Zak. Skip to his 
message if you like.

Subject: [TH-research] */CERT people: Critical Infrastructure and ASN.1 
- VOIP [WAS: Re:
  [TH-research] OT: naming the fast approaching ASN.1 worm]

Mail from Gadi Evron <ge@...uxbox.org>

All the */CERT people on the list:
If you haven't read the post below, please do.

Anyone checked into the critical infrastructure survivability of an ASN
worm hitting? phone systems could possibly go down. We all know how
worms find their way into any network, private or otherwise. and VOIP
systems (which phone systems are based on nowadays) could go down.

Heads-up! Finds them contingency plans..  :o)

Any information would be appreciated, or if you need more information 
from us: +972-50-428610.
