I guess when some one writes an exploit/POC based on the source they
reviewed and the POC actully works you can rest assured that the source
is true. If in fact the source did include some sort of trojan device
that matters not; according to various sources, large pieces of the code
are missing which make the remaining code impossible to compile.

|
|
| Just a thought:
|
| Has anyone given any consideration that maybe this source is trojanized?
|
| It's obviously pirated, since MS probably did not release it to the
general
| public.
| (At least they have not made a public announcement to that effect,
unless I
| am mistaken
| and that is always a possibility)
|
| Not to mention, how are you going to guarantee it's validity?  I can bet
| there are no
| official MS MD5 checksums to verify against what is contained in the
| package.
|
| Maybe we should step back for a second and take a closer look, apply some
| rational reasoning,  rather then getting caught up in the hype.
