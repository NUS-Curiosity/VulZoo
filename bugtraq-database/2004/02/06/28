Most of the time, I'd expect that a copycat virus is going to be
much smaller than the original, since that trick-space is now
going to be saturated.If there's nothing different in the
distribution of the virus, then I'd say they were silly to
presume it was going to be anywhere near as big as MyDoom A.
