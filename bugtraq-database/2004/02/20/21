For simple, good QA practice... you want to have each bug written up
seperately. This may mean they are all moderate or low severity.
Security bugs, however, have a special classification under a good QA
system. A "low severity" security bug is much more important then a
normal "high severity" non-security bug.

As for security classification systems that are pure classifications...
They each can pick and choose as they want, of course. There is no
board. I would think a note added to these low or moderate issues with
proper credit would suffice. (Which is actually securityfocus style).
