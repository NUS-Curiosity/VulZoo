Subject: fix for recently disclosed Oracle interval conversion
  overflows?


on 2/5, cesar cerrudo sent an advisory about some buffer overflows in 
interval conversion funcions in Oracle Database 9ir2 to the ntbugtraq 
mailing list [1].

the advisory says:
==
Vendor Fix:
Go to Oracle Metalink site, 
<http://metalink.oracle.com>http://metalink.oracle.com

Vendor Contact:
Oracle was contacted and they released a fix without telling me nor the 
public anything and without issuing an alert
==
i went to metalink to look for a fix, but it was anything but obvious which 
patch contains the fix.

anybody know which one does?
