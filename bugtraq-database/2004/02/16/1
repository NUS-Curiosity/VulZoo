Here's a translated summary of the story so far:

Sonera (http://www.sonera.fi/) - Finland's biggest ISP's customers
have recently started receiving e-mails that have bounced back from
echelon@...era.inet.fi address, with an error message that the e-mail
quota of that address is full.

Apparently, the automated error message indicates that all e-mails sent
via Sonera's e-mail servers are also directed to echelon@...era.inet.fi
address, for reasons unknown.

Sonera has been recently in court due to communications privacy
violations and it is inconceivable why the company would use an
e-mail address with such a notorious name for any purpose.
