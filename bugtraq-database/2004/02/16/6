============================================================
 Symantec FireWall/VPN Appliance model 200 leak of security
============================================================ 

Davide Del Vecchio Adv#9 

Discovered in: 15/01/2004
Date: 15/02/2004
Tested on FireWall/VPN Applicance model 200
Vendor notified. 

Description of the Appliance: 

 The FireWall/VPN Appliance 200 is an integrated security and
 networking device that provides easy secure, and cost-effective
 Internet connectivity between locations. With its all-in-one
 functionality, small businesses and remote offices can create
 a high-speed local network that enables secure access and
 interaction via the Internet with remote locations, business
 partners, and corporate networks. 

The problem: 

 Editing the password administration page, the password is in
 clear text. To access the administration page, you have to
 insert the admin psw, but your password will be cached in your
 pc and in every proxy server. It makes the Appliance NOT usefull
 to be managed remotely. 

Solution: 

 Contacted the Symantec Enterprise Support, they told me the "feature"
 is "by design", because of the HTTP connection instead of HTTPS, so
 it was NOT a bug (even if they did not know about it).
 My only statement was "adding vulns to vulns.. what about a java script?" 

Credits: 

 Davide Del Vecchio would like to thank all the people supporting him
 and his research, Diego Fuggetta, Gianluca Bellantuono, Filippo Sismondo,
 Carlo Martini, Giorgio Vitelli, Davide Zanella, his special sad friend
 Marcello Barnaba, finally but in primis his love that never leaves him 
alone. 

Happy Birthday to me.
