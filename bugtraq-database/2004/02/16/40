I can verify that the attached Proof of Concept bitmap produced a DoS on
several IE versions, including

IE5.01 SP1 5.00.2614.3500 on Windows 2000 Pro SP2
IE5.01 SP1 5.00.2920.0000 on Windows 2000 Pro SP2
IE5.01 SP2 5.00.3315.1000 on Windows 2000 Pro SP2

The latter configuration is still supported by Microsoft and gave a blue
screen.

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5Bln%5D;LifeWin

The Product Life Cycle Dates lists IE5.01SP2 on Windows 2000 SP2 as
being supported until June 30, 2004.

Microsoft Internet Explorer Integer Overflow in Processing Bitmap Files
Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code 
 
SecurityTracker Alert ID:  1009067  
CVE Reference:  GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH   (Links to External Site)  
Date:  Feb 15 2004 
 
Impact:  Execution of arbitrary code via network, User access via
network
 
Exploit Included:  Yes   
 
Version(s): 5 (6 is reportedly not vulnerable) 
 
Description:  A vulnerability was reported in Microsoft Internet
Explorer (IE) version 5. A remote user can execute arbitrary code on the
target system. 

It is reported that a remote user can create a specially crafted bitmap
file that, when loaded by IE, will trigger an integer overflow and
execute arbitrary code.

The author states that this flaw was found by reviewing the recently
leaked Microsoft Windows source code. The flaw reportedly resides in
'win2k/private/inet/mshtml/src/site/download/imgbmp.cxx'.

The report indicates that IE 5 is affected but that IE 6 is not
affected.

A demonstration exploit is provided in the Source Message [it is Base64
encoded]. 
 
Impact:  A remote user can cause arbitrary code to be executed on the
target user's computer when the target user's browser loads a specially
crafted bitmap file. The code will run with the privileges of the target
user.
 
Solution:  No solution was available at the time of this entry.
