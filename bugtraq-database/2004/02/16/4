I have read a good number of the posts here regarding this vulnerability and
have seen references to NTLM etc. as a pathway for attack. What about SNMP?,
it certainly uses ASN.1. Does MS's SNMP stack not use this DLL? - Must
check.

Like the others, SNMP should never pass the perimeter defences, but we are
talking about the same internet that got hit by blaster, SQL-Slammer etc.
I'm still occasionally finding it difficult to get some admins to operate a
'default deny' stance on inbound ports, let alone outbound.
