Most earlier estimates of the Win2K source were about 45M lines of code (I think
the "40 gig" being tossed around is the size of the source-control-system database).
And I've seen the number 12.5M lines of code escaped.  That's closer to 1/3 than
to 1/100.

And remember that there's a synergistic effect - when you have THAT big of a chunk
of the source, you can start making a lot more educated guesses about what the
other 2/3 are...
