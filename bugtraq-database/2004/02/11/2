Ok. I understand now :) (And I'm able to reproduce it).

It works only on kernel 2.6.
Doing the same in a 2.4 kernel results in the share mounted with the
correct uid,gid and masks:

smbmount //machine/share /tmp/foo -o
username=test,fmask=1755,dmask=755,uid=0,gid=0,debug=0,workgroup=test

Even trying to set uid=0 and gid=0 and the fmask to 1755 the share is
mounted in a safe way, without setuids bins and set with the user uid.

The kernel 2.6 does not honour the uid/gid and mounts the share with the
original uids and permisions, whatever the masks is set at mounting.
