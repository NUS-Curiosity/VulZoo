Subject: Mutt-1.4.2 fixes buffer overflow.

Mutt-1.4.2 has just been released; this version fixes a buffer
overflow that can be triggered by incoming messages.  There are
reports about spam that has actually triggered this problem and
crashed mutt.

It is recommended that users of mutt versions prior to 1.4.2 upgrade
to this version, or apply the patch included below.

Users of "unstable" mutt versions after 1.3.28 (including 1.5.*) do
not need to upgrade, as this problem had been fixed in the unstable
branch in February 2002; unfortunately, the fix was not backported
before 1.4 was released.


mutt-1.4.2 can be found at ftp://ftp.mutt.org/mutt/.

Linux distributors are expected to release updated mutt packages
shortly.


Credits:  The problem in the stable mutt code base was originally
reported to Red Hat, and was brought to my attention by Mark Cox.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0078 to this issue.
