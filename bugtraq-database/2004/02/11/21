Given the number of cases we see of somebody posting an actual PoC for
a vulnerability that *doesn't* *work* on some machines, I'd really hate
to bet my security on "Oh, the exploit we tried didn't work, we must be
safe".

Remember - if the exploit works, you have a problem.  Failure of the
exploit to work does NOT mean you don't have a problem - somebody with
a different version that has a critical offset set to 4 more or less
may make swiss cheese of your network.
