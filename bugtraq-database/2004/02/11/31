I would describe the MyDoom virus as hitting the main stream media several
days prior [01.27.03] to CERT's email. Most people [non-tech] that I talked 
to, after 01.27ish had already heard of it and were extremely wary of
opening 
anything.

Albeit their e-mail was a catapult to further media coverage, their report
was misrepresentative of the malware...which should be the bottom line.
