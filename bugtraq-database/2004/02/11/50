Not all patches require a reboot. This has never been the case with this
system's upgrades. 

If the process is inusage, if the dlls and/or executable are in usage --
a reboot is required.

If the process is in some other way locked -- a reboot is required.

Some low level operations may only be performed outside of the OS.

I upgrade software all the time without rebooting. So does anyone else
that uses a lot of software and likes to keep everything up to date. No
way would I reboot because my trillian or ultraedit was just patched --
or my outlook or media player. Not usually, anyway.
