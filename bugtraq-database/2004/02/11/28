I also tried reproducing the problem using the release version, but 
could not duplicate the results (clamd crash).
I'm interested though in finding out if others can in fact duplicate 
this behaviour, and if you can, what the end effect is if you're passing 
requests to clamd from amavisd-new 
(http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/). Thx!
