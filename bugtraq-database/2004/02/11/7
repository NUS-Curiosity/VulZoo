Actually, it's not Vesser either. Gadi is referring to Doomjuice, a.k.a.
MyDoom.C.

See:

and for its impact on Microsoft, see:

In-Reply-To: <4027B328.4050305@...tistical.reprehensible.net>

it's not mydoom.c - his name is Vesser (W32.HLLW.Deadhat) :

Vesser mainly targets computers that have previously been infected with the
Mydoom.A or Mydoom.B worms. Vesser scans for the backdoors in those worms on
IP addresses. While doing that it connects to TCP ports 1080. 3127 and 3128
and tries to copy itself there in a specially-crafted package.
