Correction 1:  In the past the vast majority of attacks didn't
spread as far and as fast as MyDoom.  That's no cause for complacency.
I think we can expect a lot more rapid-spreading viruses in the future.

Correction 2:  Antivirus vendors weren't that fast in getting updates out
for MyDoom.A.  Times below are in GMT, based on information posted on the
ClamAV Users mailing list by Diego d'Ambra, which cited PC-Welt as the
source.

ClamAv detected our first incoming MyDoom.A at 00:20 GMT on January 27th,
well before some the main Antivirus vendors had patterns available for
autoupdate.  Consider also that some vendors still work on a weekly update
cycle (e.g. McAfee) with updates more frequently only when a virus is
detected in some numbers in the wild.  Bolting stable doors...

Cheers,

Phil
