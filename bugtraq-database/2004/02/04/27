Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in PhotoPost PHP Pro. There is a vulnerability in the current version (and also in prior versions) of PhotoPost PHP Pro that allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information that could be used to gain unauthorized access.
"Your community of users represents a wealth of knowledge. Now your users can help build and maintain your site by writing reviews of any product imaginable. With ReviewPost, you will quickly amass a valuable collection of user opinions about products that relate to your site."

The problems exist due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. A remote attacker may exploit these issues to influence SQL query logic to disclose sensitive information that could be used to gain unauthorized access.

For example try this:

http://address/directory/showproduct.php?product=[query]

http://address/directory/showcat.php?cat=[query]
