Internet Security Systems Security Brief February 11, 2004

Microsoft ASN.1 Integer Manipulation Vulnerabilities

Synopsis:

Microsoft has release Security Bulletin MS04-007 to address vulnerabilities
in the ASN.1 parsing component of the Windows Operating Systems. This
component is used by several applications for transmission of data across
the network. Some examples of applications which make use of ASN.1 include
Internet Explorer and IIS for certificate parsing, NTLMv2 authentication,
 Kerberos authentication, ISAKMP, LDAP and Exchange.

Impact:

The vulnerability could be exploited by remote attackers to cause a Denial
of Service (DoS) or potentially gain access to a vulnerable machine with
the privileges of the services being exploited. This vulnerability may
be exploited in many default configurations if vulnerable services are
remotely accessible.

There are currently no known exploits in the wild for this issue. Due
to the nature of this vulnerability, reliable and successful remote exploitation
is considered difficult
