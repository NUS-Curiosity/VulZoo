Think back to the beginning.  Before viruses emailed themselves out, back
when viruses attached themselves to otherwise legitimate EXEs, DOCs(macro
viruses), etc.  In those days when I implemented a virus scanner, I didn't
notify people initially (long story, it was a hacked together solution), I
started getting complaints that email with attachments wasn't making it
through.

In this context, virus notifications were a positive thing.

Next in the evolution we had viruses that emailed themselves out, wasn't
Melissa one of the first?

At any rate, in the beginning, viruses emailed out with a legitimate "MAIL
FROM" address, so even then, notifications typically went to the correct
sender, although in this case notifying the recipient wasn't very effective.
