Just 1 minor quibble.

http://www.sco.com website didn't actually get taken down with the DoS. SCO 
removed the A records so that there is no dns record to use to target the 
website. So nice to see the worm foiled so easily. btw http://sco.com still 
works and points to their website, and all of there sub systems seem to be 
still up, so they effectively rendered the DoS null and void. All the mail 
traffic still being generated is a pain though.
