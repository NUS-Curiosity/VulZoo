***********************
"The credit belongs to the man who is
actually in the arena, whose face is
marred by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly; who errs and
comes short again and again, who knows
the great enthusiasms, the great
devotions, and spends himself in a
worthy cause; who at best, knows the
triumph of high achievement;
and who, at the worst, if he fails,
at least fails while daring greatly,
so that his place shall never be
with those cold and timid souls
who know neither victory nor defeat."
             - Theodore Roosevelt
