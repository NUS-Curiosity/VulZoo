Law enforcement agencies use some kind of algorithm to convert 
fingerprints to a numeric value, so that they can be easily compared.  
This resulting value could of course be hashed.  Question is, is this 
something that (so far) a human must do, or is it automatable in real 
time by a reasonably small and low-priced system?
