Subject: RE: Outbreak warning: possibly Mydoom.C (Now Deadhat/Vesser)


All the AV companies are calling this new outbreak "Doomjuice"

Symantec: http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.hllw.doomjuice.html
McAfee: http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_101002.htm
Sophos: http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/w32doomjuicea.html
Trend: http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_DOOMJUICE.A
Etc.

They all have it as a low-incidence in the wild. What I don't understand is that if it
hasn't spread, what caused the attack against Microsoft this morning?
