Product Description:
  Red-Alert is a wireless (802.11b/Bluetooth) probe that monitors and
  reports on wireless security threats.
 
 
Overview:
  1) Any unauthenticated user can remotely reboot the Red-Alert probe, and
     all locally logged events are lost.
  2) The user authentication is bound to the source IP address
     of the user authenticating, hence any other user behind the same address
     will not be asked for authentication.
  3) The probe will not correctly identify SSID strings that contain multiple
     space (0x20) characters.
 
 
Details:
  1) Any unauthenticated user can remotely reboot the Red-Alert
     appliance through the webserver.
     When a browser request is longer than aproximately 1230 bytes, the
     appliance simply reboots. Consequently, all information is lost.
     *Anything* sent to the device's tcp port 80 longer than aprox.
     1230 bytes reboots it, whether it's a valid request or not.
    
     This can be tested, for example, using perl and netcat:
     $ perl -e 'print "a"x1230 . "\r\n\r\n"| nc <device ip> 80
 
     The device reboots, and all locally logged information is lost.
 
  2) The authentication of the probe administrator is bound to the user's
     IP address. If multiple users are behind a nat or proxy, any of
     those users can access the gui without restrictions after authentication.
     The authentication does, in fact, expire after a few minutes of
     inactivity, however, since the events popup page auto-refreshes itself
     the session will potentially never expire.
 
  3) If there are wireless networks detected by the probe with an SSID
     with multiple space (0x20) characters, the probe fails to correctly
     identify them. For example, if a network has the SSID "       ",
     the probe will detect it as " "(single space character). Any sequence
     of multiple space characters in any substring of the SSID are
     represented as one single space character.
      
 
Solution:
  Contact Red-M or your local partner for a firmware update.
