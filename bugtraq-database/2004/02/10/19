Oh rubbish.

Signed applications and signed DLLs and signed drivers.
Well all of those aren't there yet (only drivers for Windows),
but it's coming to a Unix near you SOONER rather than later.

Or is that the kind of thing you disable upon installation
because it gets in the way of you being able to install whatever
