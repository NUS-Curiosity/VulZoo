Yes, I am not sure what Microsoft did with the wording there that seems
to be misleading to at least a few people so far.

There is just as much, if not more, chance of people using this
vulnerability on server side applications as there is on client-side
applications.

For example we setup a totally IPSEC secured network and we broke into
that network via our ASN bug which is called by the Kerberos. We also
have written exploits that take advantage of ASN via NTLMv2
authentication. And the list goes on... How about evil ASN SSL CERTs?
Client or server? There is a menu a mile long for the avenues of attacks
that this thing can be used for.

If your running, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows
2003, you are 99.9999% positive to be vulnerable, regardless of what
your configuration might be. Don't try to guess if you have any of the
affected protocols or applications (lets not forget third party apps
using the MS ASN library), just install the patch. 

Client side, server side, world wide.
