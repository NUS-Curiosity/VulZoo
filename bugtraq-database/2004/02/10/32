Retina has the same potential functionality as MBSA. We can also do
registry and file checks. And, sometimes we do. But, we try to do remote
checks that are non-intrusive and that do not use these. A big reason
for this is that remote registry and file checks are very unreliable.
(Far beyond just the fact that someone could fake out the scanner by
putting a dummy file or registry entry up there intentionally).

I don't know anyone that uses MBSA only for their network. It is an
interesting toy, but it surely isn't capable of replacing a true
vulnerability assessment solution.
