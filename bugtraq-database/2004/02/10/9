Is this all just back to fail open/fail closed?  I have a file that
will cause XXX virus scanner to crash.  Does the SMTP agent view that
as a reason to reject the email or does it pass it through?

If it does a temporary rejection message because of some internal
failure, the infection rateof these messages becomes very low. Not
sure how virus scanners + SMTP servers interact with regards to
tradition SMTP errors. 

It would be an effective anti-cleanup method though.
