Yeah, but won't this break a lot of programs that install their DLL's in
their own directories by design, so that they may be installed by users
without administrative privileges on older versions of Windows?  I know
that Windows XP "shadows" %WINDIR% under "Documents and
Settings\username", but this is a recent development, and there are
still an awful lot of programs which rely on the 'program directory
first' search order.

G'luck,
Peter
