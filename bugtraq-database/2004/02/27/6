Subject: New version of ike-scan (IPsec IKE scanner) available - v1.6


ike-scan v1.6 has been released.  The key changes from v1.5.1 are:

a) The ISAKMP payloads in the returned packet are now decoded;
b) New options --quiet (-q) to prevent payload decoding, and --multiline 
(-M) to
    split the decode across multiple lines to make it easier to read;
c) Added support for Vendor ID fingerprinting using new ike-vendor-ids file;
d) Allow targets to be specified as network/mask or ipstart-ipend to simplify
    scanning of multiple hosts;
e) Added support for GSS IDs using --gssid (-G) option.  This is needed for
   Windows-2000 and Windows-2003 hosts using Kerberos authentication;
f) New --lifesize option allows the lifetime in Kilobytes to be specified; and
g) Multiple Vendor ID payloads are now correctly decoded.  Previously, only
    the first one was decoded.

For details of the changes, please read the ChangeLog and NEWS files in the 
tarball.
For usage notes, please read the README and README-WIN32 files in the tarball.
