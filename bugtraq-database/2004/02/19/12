 MORE PROBLEMS


The fix is already released.  I'm testing it on a 9211 Masterswitch with a
AP9606 web management card.  So far so good.

http://www.apcc.com/tools/download/

I went to "Update patch for APC MasterSwitch" on that page.  Then I
grabbed both files.

First, you ftp into your Masterswitch.  Using binary transfer, I upload
the AOS file.  After the transfer completed, the unit rebooted on its
own.  After about 10 or 15 seconds, I ftp'ed into the Masterswitch again,
and uploaded the APP file using binary transfer.  This has to be done in
order according to APC's tech's.

This information doesn't appear to be anywhere on apc.com.  I had to get
this information from an APC tech rep by calling their 800 number.
