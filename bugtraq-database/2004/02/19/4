Subject: article: Theft of Client Information at a Major Israeli Bank's "Information
 Fortress".


According to reports, a break-in occurred at the Israeli Bank Leumi's 
"Information Fortress". The perpetrators accessed the perimeter 
physically and proceeded to steal and delete critical client information 
from the "main server", using a laptop computer they allegedly hooked 
into the network.

You can find an article I put together, holding known facts on the story 
at: http://www.math.org.il/leumi-breakin.html.
