Subject: RE: APC 9606 SmartSlot Web/SNMP management card "backdoor" - Telnet can't be disabled.


The device appears to need a "restart for this change to take effect"
(to quote a phrase from another OS).  We have a 9604 (which,
incidentally, appears to have the same default password, although the
details once logged in are different), and telnet wasn't disabled until
I had logged in via telnet and logged out again.  The device warmstarted
when I logged out, and telnet was subsequently truly disabled.

HTH,

Craig Miskell
