Just an update. Microsoft is not going to post the patch on Windows Update.
You have to call in to Microsoft to get the patch or get it from your TAM if
you have a corporate account. I have been deploying the update since
yesterday because we use the AD client in 98 on our remaining machines so I
can't rename the vulnerable DLLs without killing the AD client. (As far as I
know.)
