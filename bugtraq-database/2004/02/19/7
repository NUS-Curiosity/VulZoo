The latest firmware which fixes this vulnerability for v1 hardware
(AP9606) is AOS v3.2.6.b and for v2 hardware (AP9616) is AOS v2.1.2.a. 
You can find it on the APC site.  You may have to go digging for it
though.  Note that the upgrade to AOS v2.1.2.a requires first
upgrading to AOS v2.0.1 or you will have problems.
