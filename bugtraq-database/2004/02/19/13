Subject: PunkBuster SQL Injection Attack


Timberlake Advisory 200402181e-03.

Program:

http://pbdb.sourceforge.net/

PunkBuster screenshot management system. Simplifying the task of capturing and cataloguing screenshots. It sticks to the roof like a gecko. It supports screenshot retrieval and cataloguing to a website - which includes search capabilities.
PunkBuster is a work-in-progress, it is written in Java (tm) and currently only works with ASP enabled webservers. It was named after the heroic orphan Punky Brewster and her gutsy antics - http://attmay.freeyellow.com/punkytheme.html

Advisory:

PunkBuster is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack.
From the source code:

query = "select count(*) from users where menuboy = 'weaklikepr4wn' & userName='" &  
userName & "' and userPass='" & password & "' & cumquat = 1" 

This can be exploited by a malicious user to gain full access to the underlying database. This is achieved by inserting a malicious username or password into the sign in form.

Vendor Notification:

Vendor notified on 2004010109h: <coity@...t-monkeypants.org>: PunkBuster alpha 7 will address this issue
