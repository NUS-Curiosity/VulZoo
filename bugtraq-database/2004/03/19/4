Description
***********

Symantec's Norton AntiSpamT 2004 filters unwanted email out of your inbox.
Working with any POP3 email program, it filters incoming mail on multiple
levels, detecting and flagging unsolicited messages while promptly
delivering valid mail. To make your online time more enjoyable, Norton
AntiSpam also blocks intrusive pop-up and banner ads.
It is worth mentioning here, that Norton AntiSpamT is also packaged within
Norton Internet Security 2004 and Norton Internet Security 2004
Professional.

Details
*******

Installed with Norton AntiSpam is an ActiveX component that is marked safe
for scripting, namely SymSpamHelper Class (c:\program files\common
files\symantec shared\antispam\symspam.dll).
Using the method LaunchCustomRuleWizard with an overly long parameter, an
attacker can cause a stack based overflow allowing the ability to remotley
run arbitrary code on the target.  This can be achieved either by
encouraging the 'victim' to visit a malicious web page or placing a script
within the content of an (html) email.


Fix Information
***************

Shipped with all Symantecs products is the LiveUpdate feature. Open Norton
AntiSpam or Norton Internet Security / Professional and select the
LiveUpdate feature which will retrieve the lastest patch.  Also worth
mentioning is Symantec's quick response to this issue in ensuring their
clients remain protected.
