There seem to be many self-contradictory reports on the payload size and
destination ports used by the worm.

Both the payload length and destination port are a function of the
destination address.

A specific target will only observe a specific length and a specific
destination port (for the most widespread variant of the worm, at least),
but two different targets will observe different parameters.

Cheers,
