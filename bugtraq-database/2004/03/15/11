Subject: spamblocker turns into mail denial of service


At some point in the last 24 hours the dns-based blackhole list
proxies.relays.monkies.com turned into a deny-all-mail: the A record
for the blackhole list is now 127.0.0.2 which means all mail is rejected.
Anyone who knows anyone who was using this should immediately remove
it. I do not know why the folks at infinite monkeys would do this nasty
thing, perhaps it was done by a spammer hacking in.

Certainly it points out that all such services should be using DNSSEC
and that perhaps that's not enough if the name server is hacked.
