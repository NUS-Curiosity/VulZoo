So - explain to me again why the fact that some users enable auto-update (which
actually is probably a good thing if the auto-updates don't break your system)
is justification for requiring poor security practices in order to read the
security bulletin?

If Microsoft *REALLY* cared about security, it would be possible to do this:

% (echo "GET url.of.bulletin HTTP/0.9"; echo) | telnet www.microsoft.com 80

and it would Just Work, and the results should be at least somewhat readable.
For those who don't think this is possible, go look at http://www.cert.org/
advisories/CA-2001-04.html and look at the HTML source - no scripting, and the
body text is quite clean and readable.

Instead, we have the same sort of "glitz and function rather than security"
mindset which *caused* the whole mess in the first place.
