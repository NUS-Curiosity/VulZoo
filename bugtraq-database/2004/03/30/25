This is fantastic. A truly useful effort for the benefit of the 
so-called "security community". And free. And from security 
expert who actually finds new and imaginative full and complete 
remote compromises and other goodies against the ubiquitous mass 
produced products from 'Microsoft'.  Perhaps others out there 
can contribute to Liu Die Yu's most generous efforts and develop 
this free utility even further for the good of the so-
called "security community". There really is no need for anyone 
to spend a nickel to achieve any of this. For example, securing 
the 'My Computer' zone requires nothing more than a .reg entry 
to allow the same security settings in Internet Explorer to be 
revealed, there's even a 'Microsoft' KB article showing how to 
do that. For free !:
