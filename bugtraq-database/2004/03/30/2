Subject: RE: new internet explorer exploit  (was new worm)


Drew Copley already mentioned how this is the CHM exploit that the Ibiza
exploit relied on.

K-OTiK posted about this in
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/354447 and we posted details of
the Ibiza CHM exploit a few weeks before then on the Unpatched mailing
list ( http://unpatched.pivxlabs.com ).

The Bizex worm also used Unpatched IE vulnerabilities as was detailed in

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/355149/2004-02-24/2004-03-01/0

Implementing proactive security measures such as locking down the My
Computer zone prevents this from having an effect. Both of these issues
were mitigated against months in advance with Qwik-Fix, which has just
been released as Qwik-Fix Pro at the Gartner Symposium/Itxpo 2004
.

Just wanted to add that Norton Anti-Virus 2004 will detect this exploit
and 
pop up a warning, but also fails to halt its execution or protect the
user 
in any way.

Here is what it thinks it is:

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/bloodhound.explo
it.6.html

So there is some measure of warning, but no real protection.
