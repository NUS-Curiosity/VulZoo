Subject: security enforcement - new monitor for winnt




i want to stop ie:
writing EXE/CAB/LNK ... files,
calling MSHTA.EXE to parse remote web pages,
accessing files outside "favorites" and cache("content.ie5").

i want to stop WSCRIPT.EXE from parsing files inside TEMP and cache.

i want to stop the system running executable files located in TEMP and cache.

afaik, i can stop ie 0day exploits by doing these things.

so, i made this:

of course, free. and you can define your own rules easily(assuming you guys know a bit about regular expression).

it's totally a new idea(afaik). so, not for operational uses.
