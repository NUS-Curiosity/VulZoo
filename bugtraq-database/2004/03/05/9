Subject: Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps (Haegemonia bug)



Yesterday has been released the multiplayer demo 1.18 of the game Desert
Rats vs. Afrika Korps (http://www.desertratsgame.com).

Also this game as Haegemonia (created by the same developers) is vulnerable
to the same server crash bug.

I have updated the advisory and proof-of-concept I released ten days ago:

  http://aluigi.altervista.org/poc/hgmcrash.zip

The cool and funny thing is that the game is so new (will be available at
the end of March 2004) that has not been released yet but is already
vulnerable 8-)
