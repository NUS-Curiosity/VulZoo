Description:
  A flaw in the HTTP and FTP client sub-library of libxml2 [0]
  found by Yuuichi Teranishi can be exploited to cause a buffer
  overflow if passed a very long URL [1]. This could be used by
  an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host computer. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0110 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  libxml". If you have the "libxml" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see solution) and any dependent packages (see above). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6] or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [7], build a corresponding binary RPM from it [3]
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [4].
  For the affected release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/libxml-2.5.8-1.3.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too. [3][4]
