Any local storage of passwords is only as secure as the security of the 
key store.  The lack of sophistication in the password store in many 
AFP clients is well documented; in fact, the AFP server can advise the 
client to not allow storing the password.

An AFP client /may/ transmit authentication information in the clear, 
but for at least ten years, the standard method used was a 
DES-encrypted challenge-response protocol.  I believe a 
challenge-response protocol was the preferred authentication protocol 
from the very start of AFP.

Is that so?  Google didn't seem to find much...
