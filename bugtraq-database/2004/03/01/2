Dear Bill <bill@...ln4.qge.sd23.bc.ca>, please desist in reposting old
advisories. 

For everyone else, this is what I saw in the headers of this email:

Resent-To: <redhat-watch-list@...hat.com>
Resent-From: Bill <bill@...ln4.qge.sd23.bc.ca>
Resent-Date: Sun, 29 Feb 2004 22:05:22 -0800

The headers also show that this came from the above FQDN, so it isn't a
virus fake.

Thank you.
