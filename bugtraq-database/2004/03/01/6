Nice stuff, but any GPS device does not -prevent- laptop thefts. Its just
kind of alarm system for laptops. 
Its a minute job to take out hdd from any laptop even it is protected with
GPS device. If we're talking about 
loss of information due to laptop thefts and we want to prevent it we have
to assure that 
data on the disk are encrypted.
