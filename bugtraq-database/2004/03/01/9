Subject: [Full-Disclosure] Scary Question

Securityfocus,

This question might not be suiteable for this mailing
lists but I will ask it anyway.

I heard that it was possible to cause irrepareable
damage to any electronic circuit through
certain waves or radio emissions ( I'm not qualified
in this subject ).
And I'm afraid I have even found some ready made
gadgets being sold on the internet.

My questions are : Can anyone qualified in this matter

                              please explain to me if
this is really possible ? 

                              Are there any reading
material available relating to this gender 
                              Denial of Service ?

Thank you very much Securityfocus.

Uday K. Moorjani
