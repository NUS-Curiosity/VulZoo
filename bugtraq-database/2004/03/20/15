Hmm i noticed this before with .pls and .m3u files winamp will open when a .m3u or .pls link is clicked via internet explorer but winamp doesn't seem to crash. Also if winamp is opened in cmd.exe like winamp.exe [long file name] it will also crash take a look at  http://www.rosiello.org/archivio/winamp-exploit.c
