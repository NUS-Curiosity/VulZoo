 Administrative Access Vulnerability


Borland Interbase admin.ib Administrative Access Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.19.04
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=80&type=vulnerabilities
March 19, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

Borland Interbase is a small, high performance commercial database for
Linux, Solaris, and Windows operating systems. More information about
Borland Interbase is available at http://www.borland.com/interbase/.

II. DESCRIPTION

Exploitation of default file permissions in Borland Interbase can allow
local attackers to gain database administrative privileges.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to insecure permissions on the
admin.ib user database file. Local attackers can add or modify existing
accounts to gain administrative privileges.

The default file permissions are shown below:

    [root@...s interbase]# ls -l /opt/interbase/admin.ib

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 616497 Dec 30 11:17 /opt/interbase/admin.ib

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation yields administrative privileges over the
database to local attackers. This can lead to further compromise as any
information stored within the database is now available to the attacker.
This may include: authentication information, financial information and
personal information.

Exploit code for this issue is unnecessary.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Borland
Interbase 7.1 for Linux. It is suspected that previous versions of
Borland Interbase for Linux are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUNDS

Remove global write permissions from the admin.ib user database file.

    [root@...s interbase]# chmod 664 /opt/interbase/admin.ib

    [root@...s interbase]# ls -l /opt/interbase/admin.ib

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 616497 Dec 30 11:17 /opt/interbase/admin.ib
