Subject: Any dissasemblies of the Witty worm yet?



	Has anyone done a dissassembly of the "Witty" worm yet?

	using the 
http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2004/Mar/0181.html
	recent bug in BlackICE/RealSecure?

	We are seeing a lot of activity from this worm, although even
a small infection would generate a LOT of traffic (a side-effect of
bandwidth-limited worms, such as single-packet UDP worms).

	Thanks.
