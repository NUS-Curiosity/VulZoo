Subject: Immunity Advisory: dtlogin remote root


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Technical Summary: A double-free weakness in the XDMCP parser of
dtlogin (CDE) results in remote code execution against popular server
operating systems, such as Solaris. Linux is not vulnerable, to
Immunity's knowledge. This attack is performed over UDP port 177.

dtlogin is also the program that displays the login screen, so killing
it blindly is not recommended.

The full advisory in pdf form is available at:
http://www.immunitysec.com/downloads/dtlogin.sxw.pdf

This is one of the new vulnerabilities in the Shellcoder's Handbook.

Thanks,
Dave Aitel
