"TrendMacro" does not make anti-virus products.  Did you try visiting
their website (www.trendmacro.com)?  The only place you got their domain
right was in the HOMEPAGE: section.  Everywhere else in your "advisory"
you misspelled the name of the company/domain.

That's because you didn't send the message to the correct domain.  It
should have been sent to "trendmicro.com".  No wonder they didn't
respond to you.
