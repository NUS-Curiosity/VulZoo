Subject: Announcing full functional adore-ng rootkit for 2.6 Kernel


Hi,

At http://stealth.7350.org/rootkits/adore-ng-0.41.tgz you find
the complete port of adore-ng for the Linux kernel 2.6. All
of the stuff you know from earlier kernel 2.4 versions such
as socket-, process- and file-hiding, syslog- and [uw]tmp filtering
has been ported. Additionally since version 0.32 a buffer overflow has
been fixed (doh!) which could lead to crashes when a lot of network
connections exist.

regards,
stealth-
