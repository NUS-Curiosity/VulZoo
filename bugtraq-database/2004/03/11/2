-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Does anyone know if this is true. Apparently the war is between mydoom,
  creators vs netsky. According to inforworld magazine and few other
credible sources this variant of netsky is due to strike on March 11th.


Does anyone know any additional details or cited sources that have any
additional details regarding this possible attack. What are the chances
that its a hoax?

Here are the sources:

Any additional details, netsky.k encounters, or suggestions would greatly
be appreciated.


Thanks
