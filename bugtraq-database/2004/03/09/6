Subject: Establishing contact with Nullsoft


Hi Guys,

Would anyone happen to know of an email address which I can use to get
directly in contact with any of the developers of Nullsoft's Winamp media
player?

I have tried both 'support@...amp.com' and 'jonathan@...amp.com', neither
of which have given me a response so far (aside from the auto-response
mailer from support), to date I have been waiting 19 days for a reply :-/

Has anyone ever successfully been able to get in contact with any of the
staff at Nullsoft before?

Best Regards,
-Peter
