Synopsis
========

A denial of service and a buffer overflow vulnerability have been found
in Monit.

Background
==========

Monit is a system administration utility that allows management and
monitoring of processes, files, directories and devices on a Unix
system.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      app-admin/monit        <= 4.1                              >= 4.2

Description
===========

A denial of service may occur due to Monit not sanitizing remotely
supplied HTTP parameters before passing them to memory allocation
functions. This could allow an attacker to cause an unexpected
condition that could lead to the Monit daemon crashing.

An overly long http request method may cause a buffer overflow due to
Monit performing insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP
requests.

Impact
======

An attacker may crash the Monit daemon to create a denial of service
condition or cause a buffer overflow that would allow arbitrary code to
be executed with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

Monit users should upgrade to version 4.2 or later:

     # emerge sync

     # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/monit-4.2"
     # emerge ">=app-admin/monit-4.2"
