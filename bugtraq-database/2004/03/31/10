Synopsis
========

MPlayer contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the HTTP
parser that may allow attackers to run arbitrary code on a user's
computer.

Background
==========

Quote from http://mplayerhq.hu

"MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices, and
non-x86 CPUs, see the documentation). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI,
OGG/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG,
FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL
codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and even WMV
movies, too."

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package/        Vulnerable        /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     mplayer           <= 0.92                             >= 0.92-r1
     mplayer     <= mplayer-1.0_pre2           >= mplayer-1.0_pre2-r1
     mplayer     <= mplayer-1.0_pre3           >= mplayer-1.0_pre3-r3

Description
===========

A vulnerability exists in the MPlayer HTTP parser which may allow an
attacker to craft a special HTTP header ("Location:") which will trick
MPlayer into executing arbitrary code on the user's computer.

Impact
======

An attacker without privileges may exploit this vulnerability remotely,
allowing arbitrary code to be executed in order to gain unauthorized
access.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

MPlayer may be upgraded as follows:

x86 and sparc:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-0.92-r1"
    # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-0.92-r1"

amd64:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre2-r1"
    # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre2-r1"

ppc:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre3-r2"
    # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre3-r2"
