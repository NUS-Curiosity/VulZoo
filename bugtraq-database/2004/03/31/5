                 Mandrakelinux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           ethereal
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2004:024
 Date:                   March 30th, 2004

 Affected versions:	 9.1, 9.2
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A number of serious issues have been discovered in versions of Ethereal
 prior to 0.10.2.  Stefan Esser discovered thirteen buffer overflows in
 the NetFlow, IGAP, EIGRP, PGM, IrDA, BGP, ISUP, and TCAP dissectors.
 Jonathan Heusser discovered that a carefully-crafted RADIUS packet
 could cause Ethereal to crash.  It was also found that a zero-length
 Presentation protocol selector could make Ethereal crash.  Finally, a
 corrupt color filter file could cause a segmentation fault.  It is
 possible, through the exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities, to
 cause Ethereal to crash or run arbitrary code by injecting a malicious,
 malformed packet onto the wire, by convincing someone to read a
 malformed packet trace file, or by creating a malformed color filter
 file.
 
 The updated packages bring Ethereal to version 0.10.3 which is not
 vulnerable to these issues.
