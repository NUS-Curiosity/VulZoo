Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:137-01
Issue date:        2004-03-31
Updated on:        2004-03-31
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated Ethereal packages that fix various security vulnerabilities are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

Stefan Esser reported that Ethereal versions 0.10.1 and earlier contain
stack overflows in the IGRP, PGM, Metflow, ISUP, TCAP, or IGAP dissectors.
 On a system where Ethereal is being run a remote attacker could send
malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash or execute arbitrary
code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0176 to this issue.

Jonathan Heussser discovered that a carefully-crafted RADIUS packet could
cause a crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0365 to this issue.

Ethereal 0.8.13 to 0.10.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) via a zero-length Presentation protocol selector.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2004-0367 to this issue.

Users of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
a version of Ethereal that is not vulnerable to these issues.
