Honestly, most [95%+-] "beta" or "alpha" programs do "cause more
problems then they fix". 

Liu Die Yu is relatively new at development, but he is relatively new at
finding bugs -- and he has succeeded substantially at that. I do not
doubt that he will succeed substantially at this. 

And, all of this is yet another great reason to immediately put code
opensource at an excellent hosting spot like sourceforge... even from
the design phase, but especially from the alpha release stage.

Then you have the ability to have others to help out... and you have
such neat, modern resources such as bug databases and submission forms. 

I do not think Liu Die Yu will take half a year or more to fix his bugs.
