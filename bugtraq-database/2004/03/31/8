Synopsis
========

A failed password operation can cause the OpenLDAP slapd server, if it
is using the back-ldbm backend, to free memory that was never
allocated.

Background
==========

OpenLDAP is a suite of LDAP-related application and development tools.
It includes slapd (the standalone LDAP server), slurpd (the standalone
LDAP replication server), and various LDAP libraries, utilities and
example clients.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     net-nds/openldap       <= 2.1.12                        >= 2.1.13

Description
===========

A password extended operation (password EXOP) which fails will cause
the slapd server to free() an uninitialized pointer, possibly resulting
in a segfault. This only affects servers using the back-ldbm backend.

Such a crash is not guaranteed with every failed operation, however, it
is possible.

Impact
======

An attacker (or indeed, a normal user) may crash the OpenLDAP server,
creating a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

OpenLDAP users should upgrade to version 2.1.13 or later:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-nds/openldap-2.1.13"
    # emerge ">=net-nds/openldap-2.1.13"
