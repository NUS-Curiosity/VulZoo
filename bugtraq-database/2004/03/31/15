Subject: Re: security enforcement - new monitor for winnt


i've downloaded iecontroller and checked the app.

no, they do not do the same thing:
iecontroller can monitor ie's network activities(the "Internet" tab), but winblox can't.
iecontroller can monitor ie's activex(the "ActiveX" tab), but winblox cannot. 
iecontroller is designed for protecting ie(*ie*controller), but winblox is not.
(winblox can monitor all applications which load USER32.DLL)
iecontroller cannot monitor commandline, but winblox can.

of course, i don't expect a single monitor to monitor all things :-P

most importantly, i believe a monitor must have:
console-mode config tool,
text config file,
and log file,
just like all linux daemons(for flexiblity), but iecontroller does not have such features yet.

btw, source code will be published soon.

best wishes,
