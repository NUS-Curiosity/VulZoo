DESCRIPTION:

The cell phone Nokia 3410 have a phone book. In Spain the mobile telephone
numbers have 9 digits and begin with '6'. E.g: 6?? ??? ??? When you save a
number in the phone book you introduce a name for the contact entry and
his number.

BUG:

If the phone receive a call from a unknown terminal whose number looks
like another that you've saved in the phone book in the nokia, with the
only difference in the second digit from left to right, the phone will
display the name of the other number. E.g: we've saved
David: 64A BCD EFG  (letters are digits)
and we receive a call from 6?A BCD EFG , and the '?' is any digit
different of '4' the phone will display: "David".


I don't know if this 'work' with phone numbers of less or more digits.
