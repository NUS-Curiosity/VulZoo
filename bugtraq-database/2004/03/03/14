Hello List,

As I was informed in a voice mail from SonicWall this afternoon, there
currently is NO publically available patch.
It seems there was some mis understanding on my part as to the availability
of a public patch.
As for this being a hoax, that is something it is not. This was reported
to SonicWall and confirmed to be an existing issue by them.
