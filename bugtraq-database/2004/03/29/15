Description:
--------------------
WebCT Campus Edition is a course management system which allows the  
delivery of course material and assessments online. It is used by many  
colleges and universities world-wide.

This version of WebCT allows HTML tags to be inserted when posting new  
messages on a forum. Although WebCT filters dangerous tags insertion,  
it is possible to bypass this security, resulting in a cross-site  
scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Problem:
--------------------
Microsoft Internet Explorer allows execution of JavaScript code inside  
the CSS @import url() parameter. A user could post a specially crafted  
message using the @import method to insert malicious JavaScript code in  
a forum thread. The inserted code could potentially steal session  
cookies from users accessing the given thread.

In most circumstances, this problem would result in the user’s session  
hijacking (ex.: stealing the session id). But unfortunately, WebCT  
Campus Edition stores sensitive information, such as login name and  
password, directly in user’s cookies.

Furthermore, the file upload module, which allows students to upload  
files directly through WebCT, seems to be vulnerable to the same issue.
	
Example:
--------------------
A user could post the following code through a forum thread:

<style type="text/css">
@import url(javascript:alert(document.cookie));
</style>
