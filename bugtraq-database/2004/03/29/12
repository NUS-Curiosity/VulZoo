This is brilliant. Simplicity at it's best. While the original 
is not particularly robust the above container should remedy 
that. In typical fashion Internet Explorer and it's 'masters' 
can simply be fooled into thinking they are in the 'local zone' 
via a non-existent file on the drive. Quite trivial to achieve 
and at the same time absolutely brilliant. This is all quite 
reminiscent of the Ibiza Trojan from beginning February 2004 
which would make this unpatched problem well over one month now.

Fully functional working demo, harmless .exe which over-writes 
notepad.exe, the 'guts' of this particular demo which will be 
flagged by any competent anti-virus suite should not be 
considered the solution. The manufacturer of this particular 
product that allows for all of this should be the one to address 
it - once and for all - at the core level:
