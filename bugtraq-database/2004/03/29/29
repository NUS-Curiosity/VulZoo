I've had similar situations between former Brooks Telecom (now
WorldComm/MCI) and SBC for pri and DS3 circuit issues. Once I was able to
get both NOC's on the line, they couldn't point the blame at anyone else.
When one side would try, the other would say, well, no it can't be that
because of ... and they started working together to get the problem
resolved. When you're on the line with only one party, it's easy for them to
point to the distant end as a problem.
