Synopsis
========

Remote buffer overflow vulnerabilites have been found in Courier-IMAP
and Courier MTA. These exploits may allow the execution of abritrary
code, allowing unauthorized access to a vulnerable system.

Background
==========

Courier MTA is a multiprotocol mail server suite that provides webmail,
mailing lists, IMAP, and POP3 services. Courier-IMAP is a standalone
server that gives IMAP access to local mailboxes.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     net-mail/courier-imap        < 3.0.0                     >= 3.0.0
     net-mail/courier             < 0.45                       >= 0.45

Description
===========

The vulnerabilities have been found in the 'SHIFT_JIS' converter in
'shiftjis.c' and 'ISO2022JP' converter in 'so2022jp.c'. An attacker may
supply Unicode characters that exceed BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane)
range, causing an overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker without privileges may exploit this vulnerability remotely,
allowing arbitrary code to be executed in order to gain unauthorized
access.

Workaround
==========

While a workaround is not currently known for this issue, all users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected packages.

Resolution
==========

All users should upgrade to the current version of the affected
packages:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/courier-imap-3.0.0"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/courier-imap-3.0.0"

    # ** Or; depending on your installation... **

    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/courier-0.45"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/courier-0.45"
