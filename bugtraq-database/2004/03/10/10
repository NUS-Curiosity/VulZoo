                 Mandrakelinux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           kdelibs
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2004:022
 Date:                   March 10th, 2004

 Affected versions:	 9.1
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Corsaire discovered that a number of HTTP user agents contained a flaw
 in how they handle cookies.  This flaw could allow an attacker to 
 avoid the path restrictions specified by a cookie's originator.
 According to their advisory:
 
 "The cookie specifications detail a path argument that can be used to
 restrict the areas of a host that will be exposed to a cookie.  By
 using standard traversal techniques this functionality can be
 subverted, potentially exposing the cookie to scrutiny and use in
 further attacks."
 
 This issue was fixed in KDE 3.1.3; the updated packages are patched to
 protect against this vulnerability.
