As a followup to the thread below, a bunch more information on this just
came out yesterday in the Associated Press story "World Banks Working to
Stop Counterfeiting":

    http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/aptech_story.asp?category=1700&slug=Banks%20Anticounterfeit

Apparently the "Group of Ten" central banks started work four years ago on
their "counterfeit deterrence system", which "Several leading personal
computer hardware and software manufacturers have voluntarily adopted".
This reportedly includes ~90% of printer drivers, and soon will include
scanner firmware as well, so at that point it will be insufficient to just
use open source image editing software, as was suggested below.

The software is said to key off of "special coding on bank notes, which
currently is included only on major currencies", so the workaround suggested
below of scanning currency in multiple sections would likely be ineffective.
