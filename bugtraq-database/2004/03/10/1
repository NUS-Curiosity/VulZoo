Synopsis:          Updated kdelibs packages resolve cookie security issue
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:075-01
Issue date:        2004-03-10
Updated on:        2004-03-10
Product:           Red Hat Linux

CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0592
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated kdelibs packages that fix a flaw in cookie path handling are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Konqueror is a file manager and Web browser for the K Desktop Environment
(KDE).

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers.  The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies.  Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset.

KDE version 3.1.3 and later include a patch to Konquerer that disables the
sending of cookies to the server if the URL contains such encoded
traversals.  Red Hat Linux 9 shipped with KDE 3.1 and is therefore
vulnerable to this issue.

Users of Konquerer are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a backported patch for this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/kdelibs-3.1-13.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/kdelibs-3.1-13.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/kdelibs-devel-3.1-13.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

c6160cfd6b412cd60c8a55abfdeac022 9/en/os/SRPMS/kdelibs-3.1-13.src.rpm
b54a0acde508064c10e87eb735b95543 9/en/os/i386/kdelibs-3.1-13.i386.rpm
dfee8cfc2b14117fb3d00908198849f3 9/en/os/i386/kdelibs-devel-3.1-13.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
