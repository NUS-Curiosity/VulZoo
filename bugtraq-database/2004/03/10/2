                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated sysstat packages fix security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:093-01
Issue date:        2004-03-10
Updated on:        2004-03-10
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0107
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated sysstat packages that fix various bugs and a minor security issue
are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Sysstat is a tool for gathering system statistics. 

A bug was found in the Red Hat sysstat package post and trigger scripts,
which used insecure temporary file names. A local attacker could overwrite
system files using carefully-crafted symbolic links in the /tmp directory.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0107 to this issue.

Other issues addressed in this advisory include:

* iostat -x should return all partitions on the system (up to a maximum of
1024)

* sar should handle network device names with more than 8 characters properly

Users of sysstat should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/sysstat-4.0.7-4.rhl9.1.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/sysstat-4.0.7-4.rhl9.1.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

53b2bdd79619a4407478ef9cae8fdd22 9/en/os/SRPMS/sysstat-4.0.7-4.rhl9.1.src.rpm
3cc21e61f4aec6c820dc496cb476f834 9/en/os/i386/sysstat-4.0.7-4.rhl9.1.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
