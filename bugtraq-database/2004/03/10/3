                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated gdk-pixbuf packages fix denial of service vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:102-01
Issue date:        2004-03-10
Updated on:        2004-03-10
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          DoS
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0111
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated gdk-pixbuf packages that fix a denial of service vulnerability that
could affect applications such as Evolution are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The gdk-pixbuf package contains an image loading library used with the 
GNOME GUI desktop environment.  In Red Hat Linux 9 this library is used by
applications, such as Evolution, to load images.

Thomas Kristensen discovered a bitmap file that would cause the Evolution
mail reader to crash.  This issue was caused by a flaw that affects
versions of the gdk-pixbuf package prior to 0.20.  To exploit this flaw, a
remote attacker could send (via email) a carefully-crafted BMP file, which
would cause Evolution to crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0111
to this issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages containing
gdk-pixbuf version 0.22, which is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/gdk-pixbuf-0.22.0-6.1.0.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/gdk-pixbuf-0.22.0-6.1.0.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/gdk-pixbuf-devel-0.22.0-6.1.0.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/gdk-pixbuf-gnome-0.22.0-6.1.0.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
