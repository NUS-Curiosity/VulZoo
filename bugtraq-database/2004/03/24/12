Subject: TrendMacro Interscan Viruswall Directory Traversal




   TrendMacro Interscan Viruswall Directory Traversal
   =================================================

   PROGRAM: TrendMacro Interscan Viruswall
   HOMEPAGE: http://www.trendmicro.com
   VULNERABLE VERSIONS: - 3.5x (Windows)
                                                  - Unix/Solaris version is
not tested but possibly
                                                     vulnerable

  DESCRIPTION
   =================================================

  InterScan VirusWall provides intelligent content scanning
  to prevent virus outbreaks. It blocks spam, non-business
  related messages, and attachments to protect enterprise
  network and business integrity.

   DETAILS
   =================================================

   Interscan Web Viruswall, a part of Interscan Viruswall package, is a web
   proxy/gateway service that has a responsibility to scan virus
  "on-the-fly" before it reach the user browser. In Interscan
   Web Viruswall, there is a builtin mechanism that
   allows anybody to read files at the /ishttp/localweb directory by using
   such an URL: http://victimIP:8080/ishttpd/localweb/filename. Other URLs
point to
  different directories (except sub-directories of "localweb")  won't
trigger the
   mechanism and will be forwarded to the proxy which the service
   is set up to. The reason there such a "feature" is because Interscan
   Web Viruswall  has another feature (not turned on by default) called
   TeleWindow which uses an applet (/ishttpd/localweb/java/telewind.zip)
   to allow user to see the scanning process. Unfortunately, that built-in
mini
   webserver has a directory traversal problem. By using such an URL like
this,
   an evil genius ;-) can access to files outside the
   localweb directory:
http://victimIP:8080/ishttpd/localweb/java/?/../../../ishttpd.exe
   will download the service executable file or

http://24.128.159.50:8080/ishttpd/localweb/java/?/../../../../../../../../autoexec.bat
   will download the autoexec.bat file in the root directory.

   WORKAROUND
   =================================================
   Administrators should be aware that even the TeleWindow feature is not
   turned on, the vulnerability can sill be exploited since the
   mini-webserver is hardcoded and it can't be turned off by using the
configuration
   interface.

  Apply the patch from TrendMacro or temporarily stop using the Interscan
  Web Viruswall until the patch is issued.

  Update: The technical support email  virus_doctor@...ndmacro.com was
  sent an email concern about this problem. However, it has been 6 days
  and we haven't received any reponses yet.
