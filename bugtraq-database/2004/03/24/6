You say this is old news. Can you tell me where this WS_FTP server 
vulnerability has been published before? I always search google and BugTraq 
before posting anything to make sure nothing is old news.

Perhaps you mean that some FTP servers have been known to be vulnerable to 
easy creation of arbitrary sized files using REST? So what? How many 
programs have been vulnerable to buffer overflows? I don't hear people 
complaining about buffer overflow vulnerabilities being old news.

Also, I don't think you fully read my advisory. It says that a user who has 
a max total file size limit can create arbitrary sized files. That is, the 
user can create a file much larger than the user is allowed to create.
