Hi,
Developers were never contacted regarding this vulnerability.

Currently the solution would be for users to upgrade to SMF version 
1.0 Public Beta 4.  YaBB SE development has ended and a fix will not be 
released.  We consider SMF a logical upgrade path and the vulnerability 
is not reproducible in it.  While SMF is technically beta software it is 
considered very stable in terms of how beta software goes.
