OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

Package:             uudeview
Vulnerability:       insecure temp file handling, buffer overflow
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= uudeview-0.5.20-20040302 >= uudeview-0.5.20-20040312
OpenPKG 2.0          <= uudeview-0.5.19-2.0.0    >= uudeview-0.5.19-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= uudeview-0.5.18-1.3.0    >= uudeview-0.5.18-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Alerted by a posting on Bugtraq [1] the UUDeview [2] package was
  reviewed. It was found that 0.5.19 and later contains a bug which
  leads to failure retrieving the filename during decode. All versions
  suffered from insecure temporary file handling. Version 0.5.20
  contains bug fixes for the parsing of header lines, exact handling of
  maximum line length and fixes for two buffer overflows which needed
  backporting. The corected packages listed above remedy all of these
  problems.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q uudeview". If you have the "uudeview" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get uudeview-0.5.19-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig uudeview-0.5.19-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild uudeview-0.5.19-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/uudeview-0.5.19-2.0.1.*.rpm
