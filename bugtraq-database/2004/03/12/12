Subject: Re: MS Security Response is a bunch of half-witted morons


MS is not alone. More and more web sites don't work without scripting 
and/or cookies. I guess cookies are a lesser evil. I'm constantly faced 
with the decision whether or not a particular content means enough to me 
that I'll turn on the script. In fact, I now run two browsers, Mozilla with 
scripting and Firebird without, because I found I'd sometimes forget to 
turn the scripting back off. I wonder if anything can be done. It would 
probably take an organized movement that could convince businesses they 
were going to lose a lot of sales. I don't know what would convince MS. A 
LOT of bad press might do it, but the again, it might not. Too many people 
probably don't even understand the risk.
