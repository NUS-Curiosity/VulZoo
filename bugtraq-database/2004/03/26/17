Hey,

The below patch fixes the sql injection vulnerability
reported by Janek Vind "waraxe", in privmsg.php.

Also available from:
http://www.nettwerked.co.uk/code/privmsg-sqlinj.patch

It should be noted that, as Janek stated, this serious
SQL injection vulnerability exists in ALL versions of
phpBB2 - even the latest.

The patch is written for the latest version of phpBB2,
2.0.8, and it prevents the issue successfully.



Thank you for your time.
Shaun.
