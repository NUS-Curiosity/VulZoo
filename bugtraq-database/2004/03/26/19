Netwosix Linux Security Advisory #2004-0006 <http://www.netwosix.org>
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package name:      apache
Summary:              Multiple security vulnerabilities in Apache 2.x
Date:                    2004-03-25
Affected versions:  Netwosix 1.0
                           Netwosix 1.1
************************************************************************************

- -> Package description:
- ------------------------
The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an 
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and 
Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and 
extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP 
standards.

- -> Problem description:
- ------------------------

Apache before 2.0.49, when using multiple listening sockets on certain 
platforms, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (blocked new 
connections) via a "short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed listening 
socket."

Apache does not filter terminal escape sequences from its error logs, which 
could make it easier for attackers to insert those sequences into terminal 
emulators containing vulnerabilities related to escape sequences.

Memory leak in ssl_engine_io.c for mod_ssl in Apache 2 before 2.0.49 allows 
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via plain 
HTTP requests to the SSL port of an SSL-enabled server.

- -> Action:
- ------------------------
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
