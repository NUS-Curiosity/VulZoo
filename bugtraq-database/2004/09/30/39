Yes, indeed.  Works very well where I live (the paper isn't blank, though;
it's a pre-printed ballot.)

That's not necessary.  I trust the ballot and pen given to me by
Elections Canada.

I demand that it can be voter-verified by any "average" voter.  That means
that anyone capable of voting must be capable of fully understanding and
verifying the voting system, which pretty much eliminates electronic
voting machines.

If you already have a hard copy audit trail, then why not *just* use the
hard-copy and dispense with electonic voting machines altogether?
