You are underestimating the compexity of the system.

Surely a touch screen is involved or some other device and
an operating systems.

Surely it's just a minor matter of programming of either the

	touchscreen
	window system
	OS

to recognize a voting screen and redirect the input
events to different buttons.

A touch screen can do this by sending wrong coordinates
and then fake output.

A window system can do this by sending the even to the
wrong button and doing some I/O substitution.

All a minor matter of programming.

And as other have said; as an ordinary voter you have to
trust people who verified the voting system unless you
get a paper copy of your ballot which you can put in the backup
bin.
