It comes from the basic misconception almost all people have.  Because 
if something is "closed", "not known", "secret", than how anybody can go 
into it and break it (or change votes in this case)?  We call it 
"security by obscurity".  And we know that system that is based on 
"security by obscurity" is inherently less secure than an open system 
with well published security principles.  But general public doesn't 
know that, and general public do not want to find it out.  General 
public likes "black boxes", and it likes to trust someone with a nice 
big smile telling how the black box is great thing.  It also likes when 
"a man with nice big smile" is proven to be a liar on prime time news. 
And the circle is complete (and ready for the new round).
