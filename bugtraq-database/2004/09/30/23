Secunia reports that this is PHP issue #28456, which has been fixed in
PHP 4.3.7.  Can you confirm whether these defects are distinct or the
same?  The other issue in the 4.3.9 announcement is called "GPC input
processing fixes", and it seems to be somewhat critical, too.

Is anybody aware of minimal patches relative to PHP 4.3.8 (or earlier
versions)?
