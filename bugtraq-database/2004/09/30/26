Subject: Re: Php RFC1867 Upload Vuln. POC Released


Maybe Secunia tought it was the same issue but they're wrong the issue
is different it applies to 4.3.8 and 5.0.1. I didn't released a poc so
they found that (wrong and old) one...instead of contacting me...

"GPC input processing fixes." i think it reassumes both vulns i found.
Yes it's almost critical. But just in some cases.

You can find diff files on 
http://cvs.php.net/php-src/main/php_variables.c  1.45.2.7
http://cvs.php.net/php-src/main/rfc1867.c        1.122.2.26
on php 4.3.x branch or 5.0.x branch

Regards,
Stefano
