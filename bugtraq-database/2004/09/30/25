-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated xchat packages that fix a security vulnerability are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

X-Chat is a graphical IRC chat client for the X Window System.

A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the X-Chat's Socks-5 proxy code.
An attacker could create a malicious Socks-5 proxy server in such a way
that X-Chat would execute arbitrary code if a victim configured X-Chat to
use the proxy.

Users of X-Chat should upgrade to this updated package which contains a
backported security patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/ for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
