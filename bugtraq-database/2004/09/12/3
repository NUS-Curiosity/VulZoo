Dear List,

I have to apologize.  I carelessly packed an old version of one of the Linux 
wipe scripts (wipefree1.sh) in the archive (LinuxWipeTools.tar.gz) that I 
posted.  I corrected it on Friday night.  If you've downloaded the archive 
already, I suggest you do so again from http://basicsec.org/tools.html

Thanks to Jake Appelbaum <jacob@...elbaum.net>, who made some good criticisms 
here on the list, I also included more caveats and disclaimers in the README 
file so that users won't expect too much of the scripts.  

chrz,

I've created a few simple shell scripts that use /dev/urandom to wipe data
from the swap partition, wipe unused disk space on the root partition, or
wipe an entire disk.  You'll find them at http://basicsec.org/tools.html.

Data hygiene is generally easier on *nix because there are fewer hiding
places than on a Windows system, but there are no free wipe tools that i'm
aware of. So I got busy.

This is not a perfect solution, but it's a step.  I'd be delighted to knows
from fellow list members what I might do to improve them.  The scripts are
freely available and freely modifyable (is "modifyable" a legitimate word?)

PS: See the README file for cautions, exceptions, and caveats.

thanks,
--tcg
