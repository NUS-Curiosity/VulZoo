How does that help in practice? A user fooled by a link to ebay-support.com
is just as likely to accept signed mail from foo@...y-support.com. Not to
mention that the potential profits from phishing could easily finance the
purchase of a forged cert if someone at one of the built-in CA's was
corruptible. Given the several that are based in 3rd world companies (not to
mention recent US corporate scandals) I have no confidence that won't
eventually happen.
