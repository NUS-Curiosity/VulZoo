I totally agree with what you (and others) wrote.  Most of the current 
registrars fall from the sky some time ago, telling us that they are 
"trusted" entities (yeah right).  Even without that incident you 
mentioned, would you trust company whose bussiness practices include 
hijacking of DNS name space (scandal with wildcard .com and .net 
entries) or sending deceptive domain renewals via mail?  Probably not.

My point was that currently corporations are not even attempting to use 
the tools they have available.  It is more important to them that 
message is nicely HTML formated, than putting even basic security 
precausins (such as signing with x509 certificate).
