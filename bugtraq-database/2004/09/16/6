In my experience, non-admin users cannot add or edit tasks on VirusScan
Enterprise 7.1 (on Win XP).  In fact they cannot change any settings.  They
can only start an existing scan or update task.  Perhaps you have relaxed
permissions on HKLM\Software\Network Associates\TVD?  Ours are set to Read
for the Users group (inherited from HKLM\Software).  Or maybe your users are
running as Power Users?  Also, you can set a password on the user interface
to prevent changing the settings of your choice.
