Hello!

>  Just to keep correctness.

... and 3APA3A was not the only one who has discovered a high number of 
vulnerabilities.


In 2002 we have started the so-called "Malformed Mail Project". You can 
find more information about this project at this website (look for "Virus 
Bulletin" papers):
<http://www.av-test.org/sites/references_papers.php3?lang=en>


*** Malformed Email Project, Virus Bulletin 11/2002
<http://www.virusbtn.com/magazine/archives/200211/malformed.xml>

-> This paper includes a short description of the project we've started 
back in 04/2002. Mark Ackermans has created a testset which contains 370 
different malformed mails which several anti-virus and content scanner 
products were not able to handle properly. (At the moment, we have more 
than 400 different ones in our testset, only about 10% of them are publicly 
known yet!)

NOTE: If you are a security company and do not have access to the testset 
yet, you can request a copy (at no charge). You can find more details in 
the article above (don't forget to read the NDA section included). Please 
use the mail addresses which are mentioned at <http://www.av-test.org> in 
the "About us" section only, do not reply to this address!
