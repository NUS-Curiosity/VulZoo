Subject: Re: cdrecord local root exploit


I think that the reason the author states that it must be installed
setuid root is so that it can be run by a normal user to burn cd images
(versus having to su to root). Try using sudo, or set up something to
modify the permissions on your cd device to allow it to access them.
