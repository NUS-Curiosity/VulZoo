Subject: RE: Vulnerability in IBM Windows XP: default hidden Administrator account allows local Administrator access


yes, my two biggest complaints:

1) they bypassed telling you there was one
2) if you knew about it, and wanted to change it, they told you that you would lose data if you did!

(xp manual install recommends that you put a password on it!)
