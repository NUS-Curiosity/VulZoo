I guess that means "If you call IBM support and you have changed your local
administrator password to anything other than blank, then we may not be able
to help you out of the bind you have gotten yourself into (data loss)".

IBM had decided that the average user (of their systems) cannot be trusted
with even knowing about their systems administrative access, much less the
password.

yes, my two biggest complaints:

1) they bypassed telling you there was one
2) if you knew about it, and wanted to change it, they told you that you
would lose data if you did!

(xp manual install recommends that you put a password on it!)
