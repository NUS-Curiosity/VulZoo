Package description:

  (MIT) Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
  provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using
  secret-key cryptography.  A free implementation of this protocol is
  available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos
  is available in many commercial products as well.

  vulnerabilities in the MIT Kerberos Version 5 software.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
  vulnerabilities:

  CAN-2004-0642

    A double-free error may allow unauthenticated remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on KDC or clients.

  CAN-2004-0643

    Several double-free errors may allow authenticated attackers to
    execute arbitrary code on Kerberos application servers.

  CAN-2004-0644

    A remotely eploitable denial of service vulnerability has been
    found in the KDC and libraries.

  CAN-2004-0772

    Several double-free errors may allow remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code on the server.
