WinZip reported discovering some vulnerabilities, including potential buffer 
overflows, during an internal review of the WinZip code.  In addition, a WinZip
user discovered a buffer overflow, where a local user can supply a specially crafted
WinZip command line to trigger the overflow.
 
A fix (9.0 SR-1) is available at:
