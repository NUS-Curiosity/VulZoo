But how can you trust the _COUNTERS_?  

The problem is - there is always a weak link.  There's always some part
of the process we cannot trust, what we have to decide is how much
mistrust we can tolerate, and where.
In the pen and paper system, it's sufficiently minimised through
accountability (if the boss catches you counting a 'Bob' paper, and
marking it down for 'Hank' - he'll fire you on the spot. He SAW YOU do
it), and dispersal (if there a 100,000 counters, and one is corrupt,
it's only 0.001% of the total votes at risk).

Walk into the booth, push the button for your candidate.  The machine
prints a receipt which is visible behind a glass window.  You look at
the receipt, and touch the 'Yes - thats correct' button.  It then dumps
the receipt in a big box marked 'Audit' (or 'Plan "B"'), and you leave
the booth feeling happy.  No garuntees about the software, but if a
recount based on paper eventuates - it's trustworthy.

In terms of the software though - how does this sound:  Have the
machines run a cut down OS that distributes pre-compiled binary files of
open source packages (Ie RPM) - include on the system the python binary,
and associated libraries.  Write all the code in python.  You can now
pull the ACTUAL source code off of a voting machine after the election,
and audit it.  You know its the software that was used, because, well,
you just used it.   :-)  
You can then run a checksum on the binaries used, to ensure they are
the same as the pre-compiled binaries distributed around the globe. 
This only leaves the hardware still corruptable (and the BIOS, esp) -
perhaps have every booth supply an old 486+ touchscreen to install the
software on...
