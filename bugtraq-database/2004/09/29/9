Dear Hidenobu Seki,

I  have  same  question.  I  had discussion on this topic with Microsoft
security  team  again  just few weeks ago (and 2 more discussions during
last  4  years).  They accepted this problem and have re-opened the case
(MSRC  5468lw)  but  gave  no timelines for solution. I think MS doesn't
understand  problem  completely.  For  example,  they  still believe SMB
signing prevents NTLM relaying attacks while SMB signing doesn't prevent
even  simplest  port  redirection,  because  IP  address  is not signed.

Currently  there  is  no  way  to mitigate this problem except filtering
outgoing  NetBIOS  and  CIFS  requests  by  implementing  domain wide IP
Security  policy  to  allow  SMB  and  CIFS communication only with file
servers/domain  controllers  (if  somebody  is  interested I can publish
step-by-step instructions, but I believe MS should publish KB article to
describe this configuration).

I  don't  think  problem  reported  by you is different issue, it's just
another exploit scenario for the same problem. I know few more tricks to
redirect user to UNC share.
