Thank you. This is the most rational post I've seen. 

if(VoteForBush) { bush++; }
elseif(VoteForKerry) { kerry++; }
elseif(VoteForNader) { nader++; }

Is not tough. Diebold's refusal to allow the world to see that is highly
suspicious. I suppose I'll get sued under the DMCA for posting their
intellectual property now... Or maybe I have to change line 2 to:
elseif(VoteForKerry) { bush++; } first... There, let the lawsuits rain
in.
