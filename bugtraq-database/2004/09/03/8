Subject: Finger Google v1.0 released


Hi,

  Finger Google v1.0 is a very simple tools, but as many of my friends
ask me to post it, so I've done it.
  This tool searchs recursively in google for mail account and gives
you them in user list format.
  This is somekind usefull when pen-testing and you want to get
account names passively.
  I hope you enjoy it.

  Cheers.
