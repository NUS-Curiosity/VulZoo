You can never help the users who can't help themselves.  What you can do
is help the users who know a little bit about phishing but do not care
to learn the methods de jour of URL forgery and other arcane knowledge. 
In other words you can simply tell them, "if it says it's from @ebay.com
and has a valid signature, it's probably legit.  Otherwise delete and
ignore."  Whereas today you have to tell them to hover over links,
explain all the ways URLs can be obfuscated, check email headers, and so
on.  Sure, the phishers will just start signing their messages as well,
but at least you have more options at hand to check the authenticity.

This is why all software should be shipped with the option to check
certificate revocation lists enabled by default.
