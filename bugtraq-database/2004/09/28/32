I would suggest that you read some of Schneier's more recent writing.

http://www.schneier.com

Is a good start.  Also, it's not such a great idea reading "Applied
Cryptography" without also reading "Secrets and Lies" (also by
Schneier).  I think his views and writing matured a fair bit after
Applied Crypto, and he started to consider the application of
cryptography inside the context in which it is used.  In particular,
Schneier tends to look a lot more at the social impacts and
restrictions inherent in the application of cryptographic technology.

Specifically relating to e-voting, Schneier has recently come out
opposed to e-voting without a voter-verified paper ballot (/audit
trail) a la Mercuri method.  He's been published in the Communications
of the ACM and in Cryptogram, talking about the hazards of e-voting.

Note also that in Applied crypto, the schemes presented all share the
common problem that they assume that a computing device is a faithful
agent of its user.  The assumption is that a user acts through his
computer, and that no other entity can interfere in that
relationship.  In practice, so much responsibility and authority
is delegated from the user to the computer that this assumption may
not be valid.  In most environments, this is not problematic - because
there is usually an independant auditing capability that can tie
parties to a transaction to that transaction.

Schneier now acknowledges that the problem is not a "solved problem"
and moreover that it may not be a "solveable problem."

He also points out that there is a theoretical limit to the level to which all of these can be satisfied. That is, we can never guarantee all of them with 100% confidence. This limit seems to extended to all voting systems whether they are electronic, paper based, clay-shards-in-an-amphora, or raised hands.

Mr. Scneier also presented an open protocol using public key cryptography which does just that. It doesn't involve hidden code, it doesn't require an actual physical paper trail and, as far as I know, noone has ever pointed out any flaws in it.
