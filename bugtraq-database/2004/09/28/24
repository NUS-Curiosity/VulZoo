Let me add one more social dynamic.  The public will want to see instantaneous vote results, so eventually these computers will be networked to send the results back to a central voting computer ... And we are all familiar with how easily networked computer can be compromised if they aren't locked down.  Now we are also discussing Man In The Middle attacks, etc.

(Which to me adds yet another social dynamic, if people see one person is winning that might change or sway their vote)

The OSes had *better* be locked down and secure.  The only way to verify that is to either blindly attacked the box or have a open box that is inspected by real independent observers.
