Hello!

Yes, it's true that there is another JPEG vulnerability. Anyway, it looks 
like a crash bug only (nul pointer reference) which is not exploitable. 
There are many ways to crash IE using this problem (with malformed JPEGs). 
Microsoft (secure@...rosoft.com) is aware of this issue for some months and 
according to them, it will be fixed with the next Windows Service Packs 
(yes, this means Windows 2000 SP5 and Windows XP SP3).

No, do not hype it!

Exactly. It is "only" a crash bug -- and many more of these crash bugs 
exist in Windows and other operating systems. No need for any kind of hype.

For this list, we have tested 29 different products. "Partly detected" 
means that only some files out of our testbed are detected right now, but 
not all, like some self-generated JPEGs with this exploit. Last update: 
Sunday, 26.09.2004, 12:00 h GMT.

etc. can be found here in German language:
