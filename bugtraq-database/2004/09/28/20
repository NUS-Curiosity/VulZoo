This is very true...
At a recent family gathering I spent about an hour trying to explain to 
various people why "open source" voting machines are more secure.
Everyone perceived "open" as being able to go in and change votes...
The fact that I was trying to explain the open source model for the 
first time did not help...
I simply don't understand why a company doesn't do open source voting 
machines... you could sell the hardware and the software.. and get the 
open source community to write the software for you.... It seems like a 
perfect arrangement.

"They [conservatives] don't get it. We [liberals] love America just as 
much as they do. But in a different way. You see, they love America the 
way a four-year-old loves her mommy. Liberals love America like 
grown-ups. To a four-year-old, everything Mommy does is wonderful and 
anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad. Grown-up love means actually 
understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad, and actually 
helping your loved one grow."
