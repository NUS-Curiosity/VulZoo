Description
***********

It has been discovered that the Microsoft WordPerfect 5.x document
converter is vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow which could allow
a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

This would require at least a default install of the affected products and
a certain amount of user interaction, such a visiting a malicious website
or opening a malicious document. The risk may change as a result of
individual user settings.


Details
*******

A WordPerfect 5 document can be manipulated in such a way as to cause a
heap based buffer overflow within the Microsoft WordPerfect 5.x Converter.

If the heap management structures have been overwritten, when the process
attempts to modify the structure of the heap, values which have been
overwritten are used for potentially dangerous operations which can be
made to overwrite execution-critical information and potentially cause the
application to execute arbitrary attacker supplied code.


Fix Information
