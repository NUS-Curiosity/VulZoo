Subject: Re: GoogleToolbar:About -- Allows Script Injection


hi,

agreed, but still its possible to conduct remote
attacks on unpatched IE i suppose. Also, if a new flaw
pops up using which we are able to access "res:"
protocol from the internet-zone, well, this is one way
of injecting code into the mycomputer-zone.

well, all i wanted to point out was that there was no
filtering on part of software, to disallow any such
attacks.

rgds,
Viper
