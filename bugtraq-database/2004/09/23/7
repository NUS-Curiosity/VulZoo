Macromedia Products Not Affected by Microsoft JPEG/GDIPlus 
Vulnerability

Summary: 

On September 14, 2004, Microsoft released a security 
bulletin warning that there may be wide-ranging effects on 
software that handles JPEG images. Macromedia has reviewed 
its products and found none of them to be at risk from this 
issue. 

~~~~~~~ 

Details: 

For more technical details, please visit Microsoft's 
security bulletin: 

http://www.macromedia.com/go/ms_security_MS04-028 

For users of Macromedia products, the relevant portion of 
the bulletin states: �not every program that installs this 
file is vulnerable to this issue because it may not use the 
Gdiplus.dll file to process JPEG images. However, only the 
manufacturer of that program can make that determination.� 

Although some Macromedia products do install a vulnerable 
version of gdiplus.dll, no Macromedia product uses this 
Microsoft graphics library to process JPEG images, therefore 
there is no security risk. 

In some configurations, the following Macromedia products 
may install a gdiplus.dll file; however, because these 
products do not invoke the affected JPEG routines, there 
is no security risk: 

* Contribute
* Dreamweaver
* Fireworks
* Flash
* FlashPaper
* FreeHand
* RoboSource Control
* Studio MX

Revisions: 

September 15, 2004, bulletin first created.
