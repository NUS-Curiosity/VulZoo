These inaccurate allegations appear to stem from those not familiar with the product, misunderstanding the purpose of legitimate structures in the database.  These structures are well documented and have been reviewed (including at a source code level) by independent testing authorities as required by federal election regulations.

The results from each individual machine are then tabulated, and thoroughly audited during the standard election canvass process. Once the audit is complete, the official winners are announced.  Any alleged changes to a vote count in the election management software would be immediately discovered during this audit process, as this total would not match the true official total tabulated from each machine.

You might have a little credibility if the back door hadn't been 
demonstrated already on "Topic A With Tina Brown" (Howard Dean as guest 
host).  Maybe in your mind being able to rig a vote count qualifies as 
"legitimate structures"?  From your CEO:

"...[I am] committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the 
president."

But, I guess I'm just a paranoid, tin foil hat wearing conspiracy 
theorist...
