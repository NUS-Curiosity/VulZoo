How does this give anonymity?  When sending to the server, I must
use the servers address as a source address.  When the server replies
to me, it must use my address as a source address.  Maybe the two
addresses dont appear in the same packet at the same time, but they're
there.  This might fool a few people when used a few times, but it
will hardly fool everyone when it is in widespread use.
