Subject: Apple, Apple Remote Desktop client


In Software Update, I see:
> The Apple Remote Desktop Client version 1.2.4 update delivers

> Remote Desktop 1.2 client software running on Mac OS X versions

However, the knowledge base article makes no mention of the word
"security."

Does anyone know what the issue is?

I must say that I'm very disappointed in Apple's ongoing failure to
explain their security issues, their failure to resolve either
B-r00t's 25 July Internet connect promotion or Matt Johnson's 25 June
passwords stored in swap issue are causing me to feel increasing
disappointment.  Nice OS, but I need security, and that includes
security with regards to some of the other users of my system, not
just random internet script kiddies.
