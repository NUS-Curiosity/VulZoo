Subject: Re: Vulnerability in IBM Windows XP: default hidden Administrator account allows local Administrator access


Michael,

Windows XP home edition hides the administrator account and disables access
to it entirely even from a manual login unless you are in safe mode.  This
seems to be the most likely explaination of this "hidden" admin account.

Regards,
Larry
