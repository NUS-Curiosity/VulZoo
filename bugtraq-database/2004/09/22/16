My question is, why would Diebold attempt to enact the DMCA if they 
didn't have something to hide?  I completely agree that propaganda 
should not be listened to from either side, something smells very fishy 
here.

Also agreed on the server authentication, but what happens if I happen 
to get a copy of that Access DB and throw it on another computer?  If an 
electronic trail isn't there, a paper trail should be.

For a more mainstream article on this subject, you can also check out 
the NYT:

As far as a POC and a local tech school auditing the code, I'm all for 
it, but the campaign contributions aren't.
