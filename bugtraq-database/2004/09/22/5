1. Impact 
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Netscape Network Security Services (NSS) library suite that is a security component used by most of the Sun Java Enterprise System (JES) components such as Web Server, App Server and Portal Server. This vulnerability may allow a remote unprivileged user to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems during SSLv2 connection negotiation. This issue is described in the Internet Security Systems Advisory at http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/180. 

Additional information about JES 2004Q2 can be found at http://wwws.sun.com/software/javaenterprisesystem/.
