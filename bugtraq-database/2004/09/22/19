	And the reason that something this critical isn't open source so that
*everyone* that wants to audit it can is? There is no way I will use one
of those to process my vote till it has been proven to not have back
doors. Independent testers are nice, but not enough to prove beyond a
doubt that there are no hidden entries, and that 1 + 1 still = 2 in your
calculations. Especially with the way this election year is going, I
don't trust *anyone*. Just my 2 cents worth.
