Package: 		CA UniCenter Management Portal

Versions:	        UniCenter Management Portal 2.0 and 3.1
Platform:	        Windows

Advisory Author:        Thomas Adams (tgadams@...lsouth.net)


Background:
From www.ca.com: "Unicenter Management Portal provides intuitive access to enterprise management information,offering a personalized web interface for various Unicenter management solutions. Security and administrative control are provided through pre-defined workplaces. Filtered event notifications can be customized to suit individual roles and responsibilities, for personalized views tailored to your users' unique needs."
The portal provides a forgot password link, that does not give a proper response for an invalid user. Using a script, an attacker can quickly find users that have access to the web interface using the technique below. This will help facilitate brute force attacks 
against the server.



Exploit:
Connect to the management portal(default 8080). Choose the 'Forgot your Password?' option. Enter a username, such as test. If the test account does not exists, the following will be displayed: "User not found: test" A legit account will produce a "Password has been sent" or "Email address not Found" message. 



Vendor Response:
CAs recommendation was to disable the 'Forgot Password' feature. To isable this option in the Portal, add the following line to the [PORTAL_INSTALL]\properties\local.properties file.
 
show.passwords.in.api=false
 
You will need to restart the portal after manually editing the file.
