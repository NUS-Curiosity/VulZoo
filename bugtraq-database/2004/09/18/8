Subject: Re: Vulnerability in IBM Windows XP: default hidden Administrator account allows local Administrator access


Let me clear up what I ment to say:
The blank administrator account is not all IBM's fault.
If IBM is to add that screen, Which has been there since
XP came out. How many people would set a password?
Talking about the general home user. I would say about 60%
of XP installs on a home computer do not have an administrator
password and the local login administrator/blank has been known
about for some time. The reseting the password message is indeed
not from IBM but in Microsoft XP itself. I just went to change my
administrator password and indeed I got this warning.
