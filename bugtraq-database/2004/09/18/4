I integrate tons of these PC and personally have always looked to it as a
back door in. My client aren't smart enough to figure this out. I realize
that is no excuse.

Looks like I am just going to have to image one of these before IBM patches
it :)

hidden Administrator account allows local Administrator access

This "hidden" Administrator account is part of Windows XP and NOT IBM's
porblem.
Every Windows XP system ships and installs with the Administrator and blank
password.
This "hidden" account has been known about for some time, just like Windows
2000
Administrator account is the same way. There are ways to disable or change
the
Administrator name and password or to disable the account completely.
