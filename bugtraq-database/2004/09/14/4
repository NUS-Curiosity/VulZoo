Subject: New Security paper released


Hi,

  I've just released 'Win32 Stack BufferOverFlow Real Life Vuln-Dev
Process' paper.
  Which covers the hole process of vuln-dev, from discovering the bug
till exploiting it.
  You can download it from: http://hack3rs.org/~shadown/Twister/
  I hope you'll enjoy it.
  Cheers,
