Obviously the moderator though it was appropriate, however, you did
reply to more than bugtraq and at least one non-moderated list. Please
be more careful where you direct your insults.

The guy released a tool he though was useful, if you don't think it is,
a more polite response with some background as to your opinion would
have been more well received.
Calling someone a "lame kiddie" whether it is true or not, doesn't serve
any real purpose, and should also be removed from moderated lists. I
would have much preferred to read your opinion on it backed up by some
example or evidence, rather than a flame of someone who is in my opinion
actually hacking and freely passing on his findings.

Alpt, I for one hope you continue along any research path you see fit,
ignoring flames for the useless noise they are.
