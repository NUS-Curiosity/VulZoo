Subject: Short Paper on "the warez scene"


Hi,
I wrote a short paper/article on "the warez scene" for 2600 magazine
(www.2600.com)
It contains some valuable information about "who is hacking you and
why", thought this may interest some of you (especiall the many i've
seen on here who have found an unknown FTP server on their computer).
A scan from 2600 magazine is availiable here:
