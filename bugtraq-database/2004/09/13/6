Subject: Correction to latest Colsaire advisories



 Just to keep correctness.

 Colsaire  could  provide  better  service  to  it's customers by better
 researching available information on researched topic.

 Most  of  reported  content  filtering bypassing techniques are already
 known and described in [1] with credentials believed to be valid.

 MIME RFC2231 encoding issue - David F. Skoll
 MIME RFC2047 encoding issue - different authors (different problems were
 discovered, information from Colsaire advisory is not enough).
 Content-Transfer-Encoding mechanism issue - different authors
 MIME field multiple occurrence issue - 3APA3A
 MIME separator issue - 3APA3A
 MIME field whitespace issue - 3APA3A
 MIME RFC822 comment issue (at least partially) - 3APA3A

 There is also a _lot_ of different bypass techniques Colsaire failed to
 discover.
