Overview:

- From the User Guide:
"Lexar Safe Guard(tm) is an application that allows you to password
protect private files on your Lexar Jump Drive. Safe Guard allows
you to divide your JumpDrive into two different areas, or zones.
The public zone, which comes up automatically when you insert your
Jump Drive into a USB port on your computer, is accessible by any
one using your drive. The private zone is password-protected and no
one can open, copy, or write files to it without entering the
password first."

There is a method of accessing the private zone on the JumpDrive
Secure device without knowing the password beforehand.  The
password can be observed in memory or read directly from the
device, without evidence of tampering.  All data thought to be
secure in the private zone can be accessed, altered, or deleted
arbitrarily by an attacker with physical access to the device.


Details:

The password is located on the JumpDrive device. It can be read
directly from the device without any authentication. It is stored
in an XOR encrypted form and can be read directly from the device
without any authentication. 

It is also possible to attach a debugger to the Safe Guard
software and read the password from memory. The Safe Guard
software takes care of the decryption and the password can be
seen in plain text within memory when the software does a
compare between the stored password and the supplied password.

private partition if the device is not in their possession.
