Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow has been found in the libmms library shipped with
xine-lib, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine-lib is the core library of xine, a multimedia player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib     < 1.1.2-r2                    >= 1.1.2-r2

Description
===========

There is a stack based overflow in the libmms library included with
xine-lib which can be triggered by malicious use of the send_command,
string_utf16, get_data and get_media_packet functions.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could design a malicious media file that would
trigger the overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.2-r2"
