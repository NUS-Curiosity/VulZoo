Synopsis
========

libTIFF contains buffer overflows that could result in arbitrary code
execution.

Background
==========

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/tiff     < 3.8.2-r1                        >= 3.8.2-r1

Description
===========

A buffer overflow has been found in the t2p_write_pdf_string function
in tiff2pdf, which can been triggered with a TIFF file containing a
DocumentName tag with UTF-8 characters. An additional buffer overflow
has been found in the handling of the parameters in tiffsplit.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted TIFF
file, resulting in the possible execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.2-r1"
