This is incorrect, I tested this with a different password than the root
password.  It requires you to be logging into the domain that the account is
associated with.  For example, if abc.com and xyz.com are on the same
server, then you can login abc.com/cpanel with the abc password but not with
the xyz password.  If you enter the xyz username and password on the same
url, you will be logged into the xyz account.

Most likely the root password of the machine is 123456.  cPanel allows 
you to login to any cPanel regular user account using the root password.
