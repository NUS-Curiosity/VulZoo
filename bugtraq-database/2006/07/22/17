Subject: RE: XSS phpBB 2.0.21 in administration

Defenition from Google, on XSS.

Cross site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security exploit where
information from one context, where it is not trusted, can be inserted into
another context, where it is. From the trusted context, an attack can be
launched. Note that although cross site scripting is also sometimes
abbreviated "CSS", it has nothing to do with the Cascading Style Sheets
technology that is more commonly called CSS.

Example: 

A XSS attack is something that an attacker performs, not an admin. You can
use XSS to retrieve session information, cookies, md5 hashs, password hashes
all from within a web browser, no need to be an admin. 

Hope this helps.

I never quite get what the point of these reports are. Unless I'm
mistaken, in order to do *any* of those XSS attacks, you have to be an
admin already. At which point the attacks become pointless (as why XSS
when you can just nab a backup of their database?)

Are you going to go to, say, vB's style editor next and say "OMG you
can put XSS in it?!"

Here's a little secret, database restore options on any forum package
out there allows you to execute any SQL you wish! You just need to be
an admin to do it.

Pointless.
