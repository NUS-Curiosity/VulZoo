Subject: RE: $100 plus several of my books if you can crack my Windows password hashes.

You probably are who you say you are, and you probably own the accounts
these passwords are from, but could not someone post a bunch of NTLM
hashes and ask the world to crack them for him? Even if he dint' own the
accounts?

So, is this a social engineering test as well?
