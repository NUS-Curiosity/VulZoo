Subject: Low security hole affecting IPCalc's CGI wrapper

Hi,

I believe I've found a low level security hole relating to the way IPCalc's 
CGI wrapper sanitises input, which allows Javascript injection.

Hole is considered low since IPCalc's CGI wrapper has no privileged 
functionality, however of course it might be possible to use it as a vector 
to attack other applications hosted on the same web server.

I contacted the author (Krischan Jodies - <http://www.jodies.de/>) on the 7th, 
offering them 14 days to respond but have had no reply to acknowledge that 
the problem even exists, I've decided to publish this warning.

Tim
