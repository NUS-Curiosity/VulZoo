Subject: Phorum 5.1.15 security release (fixes "PHORUM 5 arbitrary local inclusion")


Today, Phorum 5.1.15 was released. This version of Phorum addresses a 
couple of security related issues:

* Some minor input validation issues were fixed. These were incorrectly
   flagged as SQL injection vulnerabilities by some websites, probably
   due to automatic vulnerability checking without looking at the
   underlying code. In fact, these issues resulted at most in SQL
   syntax errors. Nonetheless, they have of course been fixed.

* One XSS issue has been found and fixed.

* The register_globals related problem that was sent to bugtraq a
   short while ago ("PHORUM 5 arbitrary local inclusion") has been
   fixed. A similar problem like the one in pm.php was identified
   and fixed in control.php. Additionally, protective code has been
   added at a low level to prevent this type of problem in the future.

We urge all users of Phorum to disable register_globals on their 
webserver and to upgrade to Phorum 5.1.15. This version of Phorum can be 
downloaded from our website http://www.phorum.org/

With kind regards,

Maurice Makaay
Phorum.org developer
