Subject: Linux Kernel 2.6.x PRCTL Core Dump Handling -- Simple workaround


The most easy way to stop this vulnerability is this by sepcifying the core
dump location

echo /root/core > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

This specifies /root as core dump location which makes it unavailable for
the local user.

Kind regards,
