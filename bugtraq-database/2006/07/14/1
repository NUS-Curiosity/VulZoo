Subject: Looking for any vulnerabilities in GreenBorder
	Pro - Download please, and let me know

Hi guys,

I'm looking for vulnerabilities or other weaknesses in our GreenBorder
Pro (application virtualization and isolation) product.  I invite you to
download and hammer it.  Please tell me of any vulnerability you may
find. 

If you download and activate it, the email used for activation will be
responded to with a license key for a year.  The feedback we've gained
is invaluable, for example our Saturday build will include NOD32
compatibility and updated installer checks.  It requires XP or 2K Pro
and NTFS.  Please see Software compatibility in our knowledge base here:
http://supportcenteronline.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=4049. 

If you notice we're beyond 37,000 downloads and have read that free
licenses are only for the first 10,000, we've quietly extended the year
free license to anyone who downloads by July 28, 2006.  This is because
of both the valuable feedback, and a support load of less than 2%.  The
download can be found at www.greenborder.com.  

Thanks,
Bill Stout
