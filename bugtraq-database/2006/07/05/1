Subject: Cross Site Scripting in Google



Google is vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks.  I found a
function built off their add RSS feed function that returns HTML if a
valid feed is found.  It is intended as an AJAXy (dynamic JavaScript
anyway) call from an inline function and the page is intended to do
sanitation of the function.  However, that's too late, and it returns
the HTML as a query string, that is rendered, regardless of the fact
that it is simply a JavaScript snippet.

Here is the post that explains the whole thing:
