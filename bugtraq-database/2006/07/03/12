July 3, 2006

A number of issues have been discovered in version 3.0.5 of the application that present a risk to the integrity and availability of stored user data.

Business Impact:
Successful exploitation of the issues discovered could lead to system unavailability, the overwriting of sensitive data, and unrestricted access to sensitive data. Attacks against the application require limited technical knowledge.

Affected products:
TK8 Safe v.3.0.5 Standard and Pro Editions.

----

Description:
TK8 Safe v.3.0.5 allows users to set encrypted data repositories with weak or null passwords.

Remediation:
Assign a strong password to working folders. The vendor is addressing this issue in a forthcoming release (expected delivery date October 2006).

Description:
It is possible for a malicious attacker to brute force the password(s) for protected folder(s). No timeout functionality is instigated, meaning that although it is impossible for a legitimate user to 'lock out' their account, it is possible for a malicious attacker (or an automated agent) to have repeated attempts at directory access. 

Remediation:

Description: 
It is possible for a malicious attacker to overwrite a legitimate directory. 

Remdiation:
