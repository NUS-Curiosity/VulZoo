Subject: Sport-slo.net Guestbook v1.0


Advanced Guestbook v1.0

Homepage:
http://www.sport-slo.net/

Affected files:
guestbook.php

-----------------------------------------------

XSS vuln on guestbook.php:

Data isn't sanatized before being submit to guestbook.txt and displayed onscreen. The code:

if($_POST['action'])
{
  if($_POST['name'] && $_POST['form'])
  {
    $action = $_POST['name'] . "@" . $_POST['form'] . "@" . $ip . "@" . $date . "\n";
    
    $handler = fopen("guestbook.txt", "a");
    fputs($handler, $action);
    fclose($handler);
    
    print "Thank you!";

For a PoC as your name or opinion put:
<script>alert('xss')</script>

It should also be noted that this script comes with the dir /guestbook/and inside that is the cjGuestbook v1.2. v1.3 (which is a newer version) of cj'sguestbook has XSS vulns which i've submitted before.
