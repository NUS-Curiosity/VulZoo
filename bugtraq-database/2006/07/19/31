Subject: Security point-of-contact for Ameritrade?

Good day.  Does anyone happen to know of a security-specific contact
point-of-contact for Ameritrade?  I have an infosec concern I'd like to
raise with someone there, but I'd like to try to avoid the front-end
call center gauntlet.  Unfortunately, whois, abuse.net, this list's
archives, and a Google search have come up as dry holes for this kind of
contact.

Thanks.
