Subject: Escalation of privileges in Outpost and Lavasoft Firewalls
 -Unusual ShellExecute behavior

Vulnerable Products:

Outpost Firewall Pro ver. 3.51.759.6511 (462)

And Lavasoft Personal Firewall ver. 1.0.543.5722 (433)

 

Summary of problem: The firewall runs its windows under a SYSTEM context.

A user with lower privileges than SYSTEM could locate the (open folder) control on some

of these windows, terminate the explorer.exe process and then click on the (open folder) control

to open a SYSTEM owned explorer shell logging in right over the top of the previous user!
