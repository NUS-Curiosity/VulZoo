I think that is rather inaccurate. I know companies like ISS claim on
internal presentations that they do a lot of code auditing for companies
like Microsoft. These audits are never publicly available and may contain
significant numbers you can not see with closed-source products. The same
procedure simply is not availble to open-source products which are
developed in a completely different way.

So I think that unless one can get these indoor figures out on the street
there is no way you can compare figures.
