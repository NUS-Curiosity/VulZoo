	No, I'm not confusing it at all, I'm saying it's a non-issue.  Any
Von Neuman type of architecture is "secure" - it does exactly what you
tell it to do. If you don't tell it to do insecure things. it does
not. If it's not deterministic, then fine, you have an issue.

	I disagree. I think most modern computing platforms start
out as "secure" within their limitations if you understand them.
It's code written for them that is the problem, plain and simple. 

	The more complexity you add what you implement on top of a platform,
the more bugs you add in the implementation, and the more opportunity
for people not to understand the side effects. But I expect to see a
great market for people reinventing the wheel for people who don't
understand that life is pain, and anyone who says otherwise is selling
something. 

	Oh, and since you mention it, I doubt anyone the OpenBSD mob would
disagree with what I'm saying, or that I would care if they did.
Unlike the corporate world there are still some free projects that
allow for participants to speak their mind freely and not toe the
party line. Of course, I haven't yet asked what you're selling. Sounds
to me like it's another effort to convince the unwitting that life
isn't pain and blow SuNshine up their posteriors.
