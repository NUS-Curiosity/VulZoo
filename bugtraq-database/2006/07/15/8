Hello,

Recently a critical vulnerability/behavioural flaw has been discovered
in sys_prctl() in kernel/sys.c in Linux kernel.

Exploitation of this bug may lead a local attacker to gain root
privileges on systems running a vulnerable version of the linux kernel.

Original advisory from RedHat Security Team:

Attached is a LKM based hotfix which should prevent exploitation of
this bug using the publicly used techniques.

This hotfix is not sufficiently tested for production level
deployment. So please use at your own risk although trusted sources
has confirmed that this hotfix does work without any problem.
