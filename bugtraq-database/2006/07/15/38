Description:
  According to a vendor security update based on hints from TAKAHASHI
  Tamotsu, a stack-based buffer overflow exists in the Mutt [1] mail
  user agent. The problem is in the browse_get_namespace() function in
  "imap/browse.c" which allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of
  Service (DoS) or execute arbitrary code via long namespaces received
  from the IMAP server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the id CVE-2006-3242 [2] to the problem.
