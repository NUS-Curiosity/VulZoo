Subject: Re: Bybass HTTP ( extension files ) in ISA 2004

I cannot reproduce this on either ISA2004 or ISA2006.  Configuring the HTTP
filter to block file extensions functions as expected with or without the
"#".

You've probably misconfigured your firewall, or have some other issue.  Can
you please provide details on your configuration?
