The way I understand that help page, allowNetworking is part of the OBJECT/EMBED tag. Now,
keep in mind that in the attack vectors described in my paper, the victim user/browser
visits a malicious site (e.g. by clicking a malicious link), so the way Flash is invoked
is completely controlled by the attacker (either the attacker provides the Flash object 
directly, by a link ending with ".swf", or the attacker provides a link to an HTML page
containing an OBJECT/EMBED tag). And the attacker would surely not include the 
allowNetworking attribute in his/her page ;-)

That's a different story. MySpace faces a much more complex situation, wherein the attacker
may very well be a user in MySpace allowed to upload HTML pages and Flash objects/links to
MySpace. In MySpace's context, allowNetworking may be more relevant.
