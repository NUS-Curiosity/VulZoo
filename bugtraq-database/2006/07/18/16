This is truer than you know.  I've been writing code since 1974, and I
see the same mistakes being made over and over and over and over . . .
again.  Just as in wars, it seems that every generation is destined to
make the mistakes that their elders made.  There is no industry-wide
repository of "Lessons Learned."  Each generation is left to make the
same mistakes over and over.  If one were to do a root-cause analysis,
what would one find?  Programming courses teach grammar and syntax.
They do not teach "safe programming."  (Except Crispin and Dave, of
course . . .)  Programming managers are programmers who grew up and
decided they'd had enough of the 80-hour weeks and wanted to become
managers.  They don't know/care, either.  It's only when the "powers
that be" decide that it's better business to deliver bug-free, secure
code than shipping mostly-working code out the door that things will
change.  Wanna take a bet on how long that'll be?

Apologies.  Usually this rant appears on firewall wizards or dshield . .
. Just happened to be bugtraq this time
