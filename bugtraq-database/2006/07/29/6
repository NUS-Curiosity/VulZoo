Subject: RE: TSRT-06-04: eIQnetworks Enterprise Security Analyzer Topology Server Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Hi,

Hereby, we would like to notify that iPolicy Management devices are not
vulnerable to the vulnerabilities specified in the advisory below, as we
are not using the vulnerable version of the software. Instead the
iPolicy Security Reporting module uses an OEM version of eIQnetworks
Network Security Analyzer which is not vulnerable. This has been
verified by iPolicy Security Team and confirmed with eIQnetworks as
well.

iPolicy Security Advisory corresponding to this threat is available at
the following location:

Thanks + Regards,
Deepen Desai
