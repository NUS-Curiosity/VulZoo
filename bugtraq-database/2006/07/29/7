Subject: Re: Cisco VPN Concentrator IKE resource exhaustion DoS Advisory

Hello,

This is a Cisco PSIRT response to an advisory published on July 26, 2006
by an unaffiliated third party, Roy Hills, of NTA Monitor Ltd, entitled
"Cisco VPN Concentrator IKE resource exhaustion DoS", and available at:

http://www.nta-monitor.com/posts/2006/07/cisco-concentrator-dos.html

This issue is being tracked by the following Cisco Bug IDs:

* CSCse70811 (Cisco IOS software)

* CSCdt92467 (Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrators)

* CSCsb51032 (Cisco PIX firewalls)

We thank Roy Hills from NTA Monitor Ltd for reporting this issue to
Cisco. We greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with researchers
on security vulnerabilities, and welcome the opportunity to review and
assist in product reports.

The attack against the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol described
in the NTA Monitor advisory exploits the stateless nature of the IKE
version 1 protocol. The goal of such an attack is to deplete the
resources available on a device to negotiate IKE security associations,
and block legitimate users from establishing a new security association.

This vulnerability is not related to a specific vendor implementation,
but to underlying issues in the IKE protocol, and may affect any device
which implements IKE version 1. Cisco devices implementing IKE version 1
include the PIX and ASA security appliances, Cisco IOS software, and the
VPN 3000 Series Concentrators.

Customers running Cisco IOS software can mitigate this vulnerability by
implementing the feature "Call Admission Control for IKE". Additional
information on this feature can be found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/products_feature_guide09186a0080229125.html .

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability for other
affected devices.

Cisco will continue to investigate the possibility of implementing
software workarounds to minimize the impact of this vulnerability.

Cisco's statement and further information are available on the Cisco
public website at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20060726-ike.shtml

Please contact psirt@...co.com with any questions regarding this issue.

Cheers,
