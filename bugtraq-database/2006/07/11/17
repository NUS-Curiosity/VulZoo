Subject: Re: Google PR Mechanism Possible Vulnerability


Using Cross Site Scripting to perform blackhat SEO tricks is well known in the blackhat seo underground and documented
on sites such as seoblackhat.com.

This method is rather useful however easily traced back, and has the side effect of indexing the attack in google (making
it easy to find sites that 'url spammer A' has *attacked* with cross site scripting). While a spider indexing an XSS
attack isn't really an 'attack' per say, it does index the issue and can allow it to be discovered and utilized for other
purposes.
