Summary
=======

Cisco Unified CallManager (CUCM) 5.0 has Command Line Interface (CLI)
and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) related vulnerabilities. There
are potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the CLI which
may allow an authenticated administrator to access the base operating
system with root privileges. There is also a buffer overflow
vulnerability in the processing of hostnames contained in a SIP
request which may result in arbitrary code execution or cause a
denial of service. These vulnerabilities only affect Cisco Unified
CallManager 5.0.

Cisco has made free software available to address these
vulnerabilities for affected customers. There are no workarounds
available to mitigate the effects of these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20060712-cucm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Only Cisco Unified CallManager versions 5.0(1), 5.0(2), 5.0(3) and
5.0(3a) are affected.

The version of CallManager software running can be determined
navigating to Show > Software in the CUCM IPT Platform administration
interface or by running the command show version active in the CLI.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities, including all previous versions of Cisco Unified
CallManager.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified CallManager is the software-based call-processing
component of the Cisco IP telephony solution which extends enterprise
telephony features and functions to packet telephony network devices
such as IP phones, media processing devices, voice-over-IP (VoIP)
gateways, and multimedia applications.

The CallManager CLI provides a backup management interface to the
system in order to diagnose and troubleshoot the primary HTTPS-based
management interfaces. The CLI, which runs as the root user, contains
two vulnerabilities in the parsing of commands. The first
vulnerability may allow an authenticated CUCM administrator to
execute arbitrary operating system programs as the root user. The
second vulnerability may allow output redirection of a command to a
file or a folder specified on the command line.

Cisco Unified CallManager supports the coexistence of both SCCP and
SIP phones, allowing for migration to SIP while protecting
investments in existing devices. CUCM contains a buffer overflow
vulnerability in the processing of excessively long hostnames which
may be included in a SIP request.

These issues are documented by the following Cisco bug IDs:

  * CSCse11005 ( registered customers only) Certain CLI commands
    allow execution of arbitrary Linux commands
  * CSCse31704 ( registered customers only) User able to redirect
    command output to a file folder
  * CSCsd96542 ( registered customers only) SD-GA: CCM cores when SIP
    request line host name has ASCII overflow

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the CLI vulnerability documented in Cisco
bug ID CSCse11005 may allow authenticated CLI users to execute
arbitrary operating system commands with root privileges.
Exploitation of the CLI vulnerability documented in Cisco bug ID
CSCse31704 may allow an authenticated CLI user to modify or overwrite
any file on the filesystem as the root user.

Exploitation of the SIP vulnerability documented in Cisco bug ID
CSCsd96542 may result in arbitrary code execution or a denial of
service.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed
software becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers
should consult their maintenance provider or check the software for
feature set compatibility and known issues specific to their
environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by
the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html, or as
otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com"
for software upgrades.

+---------------------------------------+

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com .

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreement with third-party support organizations
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the
TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml
for additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.
