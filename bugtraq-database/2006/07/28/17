Interesting comment. So if I understand what you are
saying I should be able to create a user:

SQL> create user nottoosmart identified by
d0ntkn0wmuch;

User created.

SQL> grant create session to nottoosmart;

Grant succeeded.

SQL> connect nottoosmart/d0ntkn0wmuch
Connected.
SQL> alter session set events '10046 trace name
context forever level 16';
ERROR:
ORA-01031: insufficient privileges

Hmm - would you mind posting your EXACT test case? I
ran this against a 9.2.0.7, 10.2.0.1 and 10.2.0.2
database and seem to get different results then you
are seeing.  Just for the heck of it I went ahead and
granted the user alter session privileges:

SQL> conn / as sysdba
Connected.
SQL> grant alter session to nottoosmart;

Grant succeeded.

SQL> connect nottoosmart/d0ntkn0wmuch
Connected.
SQL> alter session set events '10046 trace name
context forever level 16';
ERROR:
ORA-02194: event specification syntax error 230 (minor
error 215) near 'LEVEL'

so even a user that I've purposely given privileges to
alter their own session doesn't seem to be able to do
anything with this command.

So far I have to call this myth: Busted

---Original message----
I can't believe it. Oracle releases new patches and
they have not been solved one of the main problems: A
user with only the SELECT privilege can do WHATEVER
(S)HE WANTS WITH THE ENTIRE DATABASE!!!!

I'm not sure if is time to full disclosure it but,
anyway, I will "full disclosure" one inocent issue, an
integer overflow:

Example:
--Connect with any user with only CREATE SESSION
SQL> alter session set events '10046 trace name
context forever, level 
SQL> 16';

Session altered.

SQL> alter session set events
'10046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004610046100461004

It's not even a crash but (be sure) that there are
other "combinations" that makes it vulnerable to
integer overflows allowing the execution of arbritrary
code.
