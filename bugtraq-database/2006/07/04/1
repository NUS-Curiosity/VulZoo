Kyberna AG ky2help various form fields SQL Injection

scip AG Vulnerability ID 2351 (07/04/2005)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2351

I. INTRODUCTION

Kyberna ky2help is a commercial solution for a web-based ticketing and 
support system. Users are able to send tickets and those are handled by 
the pool of registred support people.

More Information are available on the official Kyberna AG product web 
site at the following URLs:

     http://www.kyberna.com
     http://www.ky2help.com

II. DESCRIPTION

Marc Ruef found an SQL injection vulnerability in ky2help. Some 
textboxes are vulnerable to such a classical attack using a single hyphen.

As usual in SQL injection attacks manipulation of the data base is 
possible. Also further privilege escalation (e.g. setting up a new user 
with administrative privileges in the data base or reading files into 
accessable data fields) may be possible. [1]

III. EXPLOITATION

Authenticated users may be able to exploit this vulnerability by 
accessing the "Meine Links" (engl. "My Links") and using the single 
hyphen as input. So no further exploit is required for a simple 
proof-of-concept.

A plugin for our open-source exploiting framework "Attack Tool Kit" 
(ATK) will be published in the near future. [2]

IV. IMPACT

It is important to remark that just authenticated and legitimate users 
are able to launch the attack. The login screen and the provided user 
fields in there are not affected. Because just authenticated and 
legitimate users are able to access vulnerable parts of the solution, 
the impact is not on the highest level.

But it remains a serious problem for every company that tries to run a 
secure environment without the possibility of gaining elevated privileges.

V. DETECTION

Detection of web based attacks requires a specialiced web proxy and/or 
intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available 
and easy to implement.

VI. WORKAROUND

Companies running ky2help in high security environments are requested to 
restrict the access to vulnerable systems. Only trusted users should be 
able to login in such environments.

VII. VENDOR RESPONSE

Kyberna AG has been informed on an early stage on 11/01/2005 via email 
to info-at-kyberna.com
Kyberna AG released a fixed version of the software
