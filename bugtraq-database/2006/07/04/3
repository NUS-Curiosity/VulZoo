Subject: [scip_Advisory 2352] F5 FirePass 4100 prior 6.x
 multiple Cross Site Scripting


F5 FirePass 4100 prior 6.x multiple Cross Site Scripting

scip AG Vulnerability ID 2352 (07/04/2006)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2352

I. INTRODUCTION

F5 FirePass is an appliance which allows a remote communication between
SSL-VPN endpoints. This secure connectivity to corporate applications
and data is provided using a standard web browser.

More Information are available on the official FirePass product web site
at the following URL:

     http://www.f5.com/products/FirePass/

II. DESCRIPTION

Marc Ruef found several cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the F5
FirePass 4100 prior 6.x - Other versions might be affected too.

Some writable form fields and hidden fields can be tricked by using
hyphens to include and execute mobile script code. This flaw can be used
to pass the code into another users browser session. [1]

III. EXPLOITATION

Classic script injection techniques within a browser session can be used
to exploit this vulnerability.

A plugin for our open-source exploiting framework "Attack Tool Kit"
(ATK) will be published in the near future. [2]

IV. IMPACT

Because authentication frontends are affected too, this vulnerability is
serious for every secure environment. Non-authenticated users might be
able to exploit this flaw to gain elevated privileges (e.g. extracting
sensitive cookie information or launch a buffer overflow attack against
another web browser).

V. DETECTION

Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or
intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available
and easy to implement.

VI. SOLUTION

The vulnerabilities have been identified in version 5.x. The remaining
existence of them could not be verified in version 6.x.

VII. VENDOR RESPONSE

F5 has not been informed because it looks like they have already fixed
the problem in version 6.x.
