Subject: McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.0.0 Buffer Overflow


A local Buffer Overflow was discovered in McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.0.0.
The overflow can be triggered within the "Buffer OverFlow Protection Properties" by creating a buffer overflow exclusion. Then fill each field
with data, and click ok, and apply
Process name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......etc
Module name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......etc
API name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......etc

This will trigger various exceptions based on amount of data added to each field.

This will DoS the AV . McAfee AV will not run correctly again until Buffer Overflow Protection is disabled or the Buffer Overflow Exclusion is removed.
