I really wonder why in the recent past there is a tendence to declare 
such things as "denial of service" etc - while they are perfect root 
backdoors / vulns

*B000M* you are in one minut^K^K^Ke later...

Maybe this is just to hide the overall bad quality of the 2.6 kernel 
code? *just guessing*

Anyway CVE-2006-2451 is trivially exploitable so I don't attach any 
exploit code since it is obvious...
