Hello,

I would just like to add some corrections to disclosure below.

This information is incorrect. ObjectSecurity is not the vendor of the 
MICO ORB. MICO is a free software project licensed under LGPL/GPL 
licenses. ObjectSecurity is its long time user and contributor besides 
lots of other companies and supporters.

Side note: object ID is opaque value, so we do not distinguish any part of
it as orb-id or orb-creation time. Perhaps you get this knowledge from
other ORB, but this is strickly ORB dependent.

Unfortunately your email has not come to mico-devel@...o.org mailing list
yet. Also if you would like to contact directly ObjectSecurity with some
security issue, please consider using security@...ectsecurity.com email
address next time.

Patch is already available and the main MICO download page contains a link 
to it: http://mico.org/down.html

Side note: if you test fixed MICO together with your ping utility
running on top of JacORB, you will get COMM_FAILURE exception
too. That's because of a bug in JacORB which tries to use GIOP 1.2
although your corbaloc is defined in the way it should use GIOP
1.0. Also since MICO uses GIOP 1.0 by default it closes connection
immediately after receiving JacORB's GIOP 1.2 message. Anyway this
test runs well with patched MICO and either MICO server using GIOP 1.2
and JacORB or MICO server using default GIOP 1.0 and JDK ORB.

Cheers,
Karel
