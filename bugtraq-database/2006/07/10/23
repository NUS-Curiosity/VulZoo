Subject: Re: Invision Power Board v1.3 Final SQL Injection


At no point does the CODE parameter touch the database. The CODE parameter is used in a SWITCH statement to determine which function to run - it just directs traffic.

Secondly, IPB 1.3 is no longer officially supported by us (IPS) and is no longer available for purchase or download.
