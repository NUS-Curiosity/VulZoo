DB2 UDB - Unauthenticated Buffer Overflow and DoS (BID 18428)

Background:
DB2 Universal Database (UDB)� is a popular database software package from IBM available for legacy platforms as well as open systems (Unix and Windows). Clients use a protocol called DRDA to communicate with the DB2 UDB server. Protocol messages are used for session setup, authentication and data transfer

Scope:
Imperva�s Application Defense Center is conducting an extensive research of the DRDA protocol and its implementation. As part of the research the team has identified severe vulnerability in DB2 UDB�s connection establishment mechanism that allows an attacker to terminate the UDB service, effectively denying service from all database users.

Findings:
An attacker can send a specially crafted EXCSAT command during the handshake process with the server, causing the server process to crash. It seems that the command invokes a buffer overflow condition on the server possibly allowing execution of arbitrary code on the server.

Details:
The first message used by a client when establishing a connection to the database is the EXCSAT message (message code 0x1041). This message includes an object called MGRLVLLS (code 0x2114) which in term contains a vector of 4 byte entries (two bytes for the manager code and two byte for the compatibility level). When the size of the MGRLVLLS message is large enough a buffer overflow condition is invoked.
If the client terminates the connection immediately after sending this message the server process is terminated. 

Exploit:
Create an EXCSAT message with a very long (>1Kbytes) MGRLVLLS message. (see attached)
