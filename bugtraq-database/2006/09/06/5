By the way i'm using the progress control shatter exploit by brett mooore, but i'm having problem with 
the setHandler (critical address to overwrite) and shellcodeaddr (data space to inject the code). Probably they are windows dependent. Do you know if there is the possibility to write a portable version
of this exploit?
Thanks very much
