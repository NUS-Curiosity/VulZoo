HPSBUX02102 SSRT051078 rev.4 - HP-UX usermod(1M) Local Unauthorized Access.

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as soon as possible.

Release Date: 2006-09-05
Last Updated: 2006-09-05

Potential Security Impact: Local unauthorized access to user and system files and directories.

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A vulnerability has been identified with certain versions of the HP-UX usermod(1M) command. 
A certain combination of options can result in recursively changing the ownership of all directories 
and files under a user's new home directory. This may result in unauthorized access to these 
directories and files.

References: none

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.23

BACKGROUND

The behavior is present in HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, and B.11.23. For B.11.11, 
the affected version of usermod(1M) is present only in these patches: 
PHCO_29269, PHCO_30275, PHCO_32181.

The -d <dir> option of the command usermod(1M) specifies a new home 
directory for the login.

Executing a vulnerable version of usermod(1M) in the following manner

# usermod -d <dir> -u <new uid> -m <username>
or
# usermod -d <dir> -g <new or old gid> -m <username>

causes the ownership of all files and directories, including and beneath directory <dir> 
to be recursively changed to <username>.

If the directory <dir> is '/' the system will immediately become inoperable.
If directory <dir> is an existing directory other than '/' the change in ownership 
may not be an issue. If directories or files under directory <dir> were owned by 
an account other than <username>, the affected files or directories may be subject 
to unauthorized access.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

HP-UX B.11.00
============
OS-Core.SYS-ADMIN
action: install PHCO_34763 or subsequent

HP-UX B.11.11
============
OS-Core.SYS-ADMIN
action: install PHCO_33142 or subsequent

HP-UX B.11.23
============
OS-Core.SYS-ADMIN
OS-Core.SYS2-ADMIN
action: install PHCO_34764 or subsequent

END AFFECTED VERSIONS

RESOLUTION

HP has made the following patches available to resolve this issue.
The patches are available from http://itrc.hp.com

HP-UX B.11.00 - PHCO_34763 or subsequent.
HP-UX B.11.11 - PHCO_33142 or subsequent.
HP-UX B.11.23 - PHCO_34764 or subsequent.

All new patches only provide a version of usermod(1M) that does not exhibit the behavior. 
These patches will not detect any ownerships that may have been altered by the vulnerable 
version of usermod(1M). Customers should verify that file/directory ownerships have not 
been altered.

NOTE: The swverify option fix=true can restore altered ownerships for software 
installed by swinstall.

- ->MANUAL ACTIONS: No

B.11.00 - install PHCO_34763 or subsequent.
B.11.11 - install PHCO_33142 or subsequent.
B.11.23 - install PHCO_34764 or subsequent.
