-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

There's a XSS issue in the 'Indexed search' extension 2.9.0 for Typo3.
This extension is part of a default Typo3 4.0.x installlation.

Typo3 4.0.2 fixes it.

Credits go to Mr. Ekkehard GÃ¼mbel (discovery) and Mr. Ingmar Schlecht
(patch).

This is rather old, dating back to september 11th. Unfortunately Typo3
advisories rarely end up here.
