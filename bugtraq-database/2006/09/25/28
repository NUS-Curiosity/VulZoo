Subject: RE: [Full-disclosure] Yet another 0day for IE

Hi all,

If anyone finds a site where the 0day still lives, please let me know.
All the URLs I've found are off the air.

I did find a websense update not listed here:
http://www.websense.com/securitylabs/alerts/alert.php?AlertID=632   

There's another websense blog says the code has been posted (where?):
http://www.websense.com/securitylabs/blog/blog.php?BlogID=81
 
If you're intentionally digging in the Internet muck for this Trojan
(like I am), now is a good time to put our gloves around your browser.

http://www.download.com/GreenBorder-Pro-with-SafeFiles/3000-2092_4-10581
692.html (Wraps IE, FF, and other apps)

Here's the Microsoft Advisory:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/925568.mspx 

Securiteam has a blog on this as well
http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/624 
Many companies (e.g. software development) have users running as local
admins.  To quote from Securiteam:
"Also worth mentioning is that the current in-the-wild exploits attempt
system-wide software installations, as do most zero-day exploits for
such vulnerabilities. If your browser is not running under an account
with administrative privileges, this will not succeed."

Thanks,
Bill Stout

My opinions are my own, and my keyboard is often accompanied by glass of
wine or whiskey.

Webattacker is a hacker kit for preparing a website to exploit users,
infecting them. It has statistics on OS, browser type, etc. As well as
on
how many got infected by what exploit, etc.

Nick FitzGerald, Roger Thompson and now Dan Hubbard
(http://www.websense.com/securitylabs/blog/blog.php?BlogID=80) report
that sites seen exploiting this 0day in-the-wild have previously been
seen utilizing Webattacker. If Webattacker indeed uses this 0day... it
will be spread far and wide.

No patch in sight. Easy to exploit.
