Subject: [PLESK 7.5 Reload] & [PLESK 7.6 for MS Windows] path passing and
 disclosure vulnerability

/*--------------------------------------
[PLESK 7.5 Reload (and lower) & PLESK 7.6 for M$ Windows path passing and disclosure]

-| Description: |-

PLESK is a powerful web control panel, site builder... You can see more about it at: 

http://www.swsoft.com/en/products/plesk/switch/ .
So, i have found a security hole - path passing and disclosure - of this product (version 

[PLESK 7.5 Reload] and [PLESK 7.6 for M$ Windows]) in the file : filemanager.php


-| What an attacker can do? |-

The attacker can take advantage of this hole to access the parent folder (which he havent 

authorization).
Like this:

https://[stie]:8443/filemanager/filemanager.php?cmd=chdir&file=../

That URL will show him (attacker) the parent folder of his "web root" folder. Using more 

"/../" characters, he'll go to up, up, and up folder so he can gain lot of important info.

-| How to fix it? |-

Upgrade to the PLESK 8.0 :D.

- End -

P/S: Sorry about my English, its to bad.
