Has this really been patched? It doesn't appear to
be a bug and the discussion has it marked as Bogus.

The "POC" contains two fundamental security flaws:

1. Using untrusted input to mysql_select_db() without sanitising it
> mysql_select_db($db, $link);

2. Printing the result of a function directly to the browser without
ensuring that it is appropriately escaped.
> echo mysql_errno($link) . ": " . mysql_error($link). "\n";

It's up to the programmer to sanitise input and output as appropriate. 
You cannot blindly assume that input is safe to pass to functions, nor 
that a string returned from a function{*} is safe to output (or put into 
an SQL query, or use in any other way), without checking it.
{*} with obvious exceptions for functions whose job it is to make strings
safe for a particular use, such as htmlspecialchars(), addslashes() etc.
