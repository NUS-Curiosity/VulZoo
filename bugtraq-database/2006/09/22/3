Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0052

Package names:	   freetype, gnutls, gzip
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-09-22
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  freetype
  The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
  engine, developed to provide TrueType support for a variety of
  platforms and environments. FreeType is a library which can open and
  manages font files as well as efficiently load, hint and render
  individual glyphs. FreeType is not a font server or a complete
  text-rendering library.

  gnutls
  GnuTLS is a project that aims to develop a library which provides a
  secure layer, over a reliable transport layer. Currently the GnuTLS
  library implements the proposed standards by the IETF's TLS working
  group.

  gzip
  The gzip package contains the popular GNU gzip data compression
  program. Gzipped files have a .gz extension.

Problem description:
  freetype < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - Enable bytecode hinting, Bug #1933.
  - SECURITY FIX: Chris Evans discovered several integer underflow
    and overflow flaws in the FreeType font engine. If a specially
    crafted font file that, when loaded by the target user's system,
    will trigger an integer underflow or integer overflow and crash
    the application or execute arbitrary code on the target system.
                                                                                                                           
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-3467 to this issue.

  gnutls < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in GnuTLS, caused
    due to an error in the verification of certain signatures. If a 
    RSA key with exponent 3 is used, it may be possible to forge PKCS
    #1 v1.5 signatures signed with that key.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-4790 to this issue.

  gzip < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 > 
  - SECURITY Fix: Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team,  has reported
    some vulnerabilities in gzip, which can be exploited by malicious
    people to cause a DoS and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
  - Fix null pointer dereference that may lead to denial of service if
    gzip is used in an automated manner.
  - A boundary error within the "make_table()" function in unlzh.c can be
    used to modify certain stack data. This can be exploited to cause a
    DoS and potentially allows to execute arbitrary code.
  - A buffer underflow exists within the "build_tree()" function in
    unpack.c, which can be exploited to cause a DoS and potentially
    allows to execute arbitrary code.
  - A buffer overflow within the "make_table()" function of gzip's LZH
    support can be exploited to cause a DoS and potentially to compromise
    a vulnerable system by e.g. tricking a user or automated system into
    unpacking an archive containing a specially crafted decoding table.
  - unlzh.c in the LHZ component in gzip allows context-dependent 
    attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted
    GZIP archive.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-4334, CVE-2006-4335, CVE-2006-4336,
    CVE-2006-4337 and CVE-2006-4338 to these issues.
