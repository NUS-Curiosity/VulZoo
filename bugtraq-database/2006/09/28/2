Synopsis
========

Opera fails to correctly verify certain signatures.

Background
==========

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.0.2                           >= 9.0.2

Description
===========

Opera makes use of OpenSSL, which fails to correctly verify PKCS #1
v1.5 RSA signatures signed by a key with exponent 3. Some CAs in
Opera's list of trusted signers are using root certificates with
exponent 3.

Impact
======

An attacker could forge certificates which will appear valid and signed
by a trusted CA.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.0.2"
