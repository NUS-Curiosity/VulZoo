$REP_CLASS is initialized in conf/hitweb.conf, which is
included at the top of this script. After that there is
no manipulation possible, so there is no vulnerability.

Same for the other reported scripts.

Where did you tested this?
If you found vulnerable servers, the phpconfig() of these
could be helpful.
