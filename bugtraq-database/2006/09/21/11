Subject: Re: mysql_error() can lead to Cross Site Scripting attacks

Hello DarkFig

As in the PHP bug report written, too, the bug here is not in the
mysql_error() function but in the program that writes its output on a HTML
page without proper escaping with htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars().

mysql_error() is not limited to web programming, it is used in console
scripts, too, that do not output HTML at all so it would be wrong if
mysql_error() would escape its output. Apart from the fact that SQL layer
functions should never mix up with the presentation layer.

BTW,
 - you wrote "Vendor Status: Patched" although the bug was set to "Bogus"
   and did not seem to have got any patch
 - you wrote "No response from the PHP team" although there was a response
   on 2006-09-06

bye,

-christian-
