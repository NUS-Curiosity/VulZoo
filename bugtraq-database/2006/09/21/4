This leads to the download of
<http://noc.postnuke.com/frs/download.php/1089/PNphpBB2_1.2i.tar.gz>

It this the version where you found the vulnerable file?

In the includes/functions_admin.php I found in the 
downloaded archiv is no include_once()-call, no
use of $phpbb_root_path and if I looked right no
executeable code, since the script only consist of
function-declarations.

So in this script is no vulnerability.

Where did you find the vulnerable script/programm?
