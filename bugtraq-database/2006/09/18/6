Subject: Busy box httpd file traversal vulenrability

a file traversal attack is possible in busybox's http daemon when you send a url encoded slash like this http://attacked-host//%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd I have tested with busy box 1.01 and I dont know if other versions are vulenrable
