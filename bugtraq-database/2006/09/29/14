    http://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-613

Description:
    Previous versions of the openssl package are vulnerable to multiple
    attacks.  Three of the vulnerabilities are denials of service,
    but the other is a buffer overflow that is expected to create
    remote unauthorized access vulnerabilities in other applications.
    In particular, any connection that the mysql daemon will accept
    may be vulnerable.  In the default configuration of mysql, that
    would be a local unauthorized access vulnerability, but mysql can
    be configured to listen for network connections from remote hosts,
    which would then enable remote unauthorized access.  Any program
    that calls the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() function may be vulnerable.
    
    29 September 2006 Update: The initial fix for this vulnerability was
    incomplete, and the fault in the fix could enable a Denial of Service
    attack in some cases of the attack described in CVE-2006-2940.
