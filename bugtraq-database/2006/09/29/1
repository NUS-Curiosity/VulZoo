Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0054

Package names:	   openssh, openssl
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-09-29
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

Package description:
  openssh
  Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
  for executing commands in a remote machine.  It is intended to replace
  rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
  two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and
  arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

  openssl
  A C library that provides various crytographic algorithms and 
  protocols, including DES, RC4, RSA, and SSL. Includes shared libraries.

Problem description:
  openssh < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Tavis Ormandy of Google Security Team has reported a
    vulnerability in OpenSSH, which can be exploited by malicious people
    to cause a DoS. If ssh protocol 1 is enabled, this can be exploited
    to cause a DoS due to CPU consumption by sending specially crafted
    ssh packets.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-4924 to this issue.

  openssl < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Dr. S. N. Henson has discovered vulnerabilities in
    OpenSSL which could be exploited by attackers to cause denial of
    service.
  - During the parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures an error
    condition is mishandled. This can result in an infinite loop which
    consumes system memory.
  - Certain types of public key can take disproportionate amounts of
    time to process. This could be used by an attacker in a denial of
    service attack.
  - Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team has
    discovered the following two vulnerabilities in OpenSSL :
  - Fix buffer overflow in SSL_get_shared_ciphers() utility function
    which could allow an attacker to send a list of ciphers to an
    application that uses it and overrun a buffer.
  - A flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. When a client
    application used OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a
    malicious server, that server could cause the client to crash.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-2937, CVE-2006-2940, CVE-2006-3738
    and CVE-2006-4343 to these issues.
