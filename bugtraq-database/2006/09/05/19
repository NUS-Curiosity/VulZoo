RESOLUTION

HP has made the following patches and software updates available to resolve the issue.

Software updates for the Apache-based Web Server are available from:

http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/
displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE

HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11 and HP-UX B.11.23 require the Apache-based Web Server 
v.2.0.58.00 or subsequent.

Apache Update Procedure

Check for Apache Installation
- ----------------------------
To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on your system, 
use Software Distributor's swlist command. All three revisions of the product 
may co-exist on a single system.
For example, the results of the command
swlist -l product | grep -i apache
hpuxwsAPACHE B.2.0.55.00 HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

Stop Apache
- -------------
Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary. Otherwise, 
the previous binary will continue running, preventing the new one from starting,
although the installation would be successful. After determining which Apache is 
installed, stop Apache with the following commands:
for hpuxwsAPACHE: /opt/hpws/apache[32]/bin/apachectl stop

Download and Install Apache
- ---------------------------
Download Apache from Software Depot:

http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/
displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE

Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the value 
specified on the installation web page.

Use SD to swinstall the depot.
Installation of this new revision of HP Apache over an existing HP Apache 
installation is supported, while installation over a non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

Removing Apache Installation
- ----------------------------
If you prefer to remove Apache from your system instead of installing a newer revision 
to resolve the security problem, use both Software Distributor's "swremove" command 
and also "rm -rf" the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file "HOME" variables.
%ls /etc/rc.config.d | \ grep apache hpapache2conf hpws_apache[32]conf

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - Update plus other actions
Install the revision of the product.
