Subject: Symantec Norton Insufficient validation of 'SymEvent' driver input
 buffer

Hello,

I would like to inform you about a vulnerability in Norton Personal Firewall.


Description:

Norton insufficiently protects its driver '\Device\SymEvent' against a manipulation by malicious applications and it 
fails to validate its input buffer. It is possible to open this driver and send arbitrary data to it, which are 
implicitly believed to be valid. It is possible to assemble the data in the input buffer such that the driver performs 
an invalid memory operation and crashes the whole operating system. Further impacts of this bug were not examined.



Vulnerable software:

     * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.0.33
     * probably all versions of Norton Personal Firewall 2006 and Norton Internet Security 2006
     * possibly older versions of Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet Security



More details and a proof of concept including source code is available here:
