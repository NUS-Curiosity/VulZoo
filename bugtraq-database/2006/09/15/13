 Vulnerabilities

I Certainly sent a report about the presence of a security error ; they know 
from before ; but it's was working on all releases version 1.20 either No. 
issuing the new version, which has not been the bug security by No. 1.30 
patchwork and The owner's of this program knows where the error in the 
determination of the changing ; make sure by google it ; research on the 
issues which frequently broad that it had not been warned, but were 
satisfied by the issuance version of without a new security warning to their 
clients about it !!!!

HEre The Vedio Can be judge ....
