For web SSO in particular, accessing the token once is nearly as good
as accessing it constantly.  The token will be used for the initial
authentication, but normally a cookie will be used for session
tracking.  An attacker who can sniff the token code can certainly
steal the cookie as well.

Two-factor auth cannot be said to make accessing the network from a
compromised PC "safe".  That does not make two-factor auth useless.
With plain passwords, once the attacker has the password, they can
access the network at will.  With two-factor auth, they can access the
network for a much more limited time span.
