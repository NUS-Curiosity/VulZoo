Subject: Timesheet 1.2.1 Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability

About:

Timesheet.php is a PHP application designed to keep track of the hours worked by multiple people on multiple projects. It allows users to log in through their web browser and manage the times that they are clocked on or clocked off.

Description:

A vulnerability can be found on the file login.php on $_POST['username'] variable. When magic_quotes_gpc is set to Off an intruder can trigger a blind sql injection.

Escalation:

1. Disclosure of administrator username and password hash (MD5, PASSWORD) credentials.
2. Remote code execution in case the intruder knows where to save the output of the sql injection on the local path.

Solution:

Create addslashes function that will filter the $_POST and $_GET variables.
