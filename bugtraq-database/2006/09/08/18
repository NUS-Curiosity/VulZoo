Description:
    Previous versions of the mailman package are vulnerable to a
    cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack (CVE-2006-2941) that can allow
    one mailman user to subvert other mailman users' web browsers.
    (Those versions are not vulnerable to CVE-2006-3636, a remote
    Denial of Service attack.)
    
    The upstream mailman project has the relevant security fixes
    only in a new 2.1.9rc1 release that is officially deprecated
    for production use.  After the upstream project releases 2.1.9
    for production use, rPath will update this advisory and release
    the new upstream production version.
