    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-615

Description:
    Previous versions of the gzip package contain multiple vulnerabilities
    that enable user-complicit unauthorized access when a user attempts to
    gunzip intentionally malformed gzip files.  Some network services will
    automatically run the gunzip program in some contexts, which may then
    enable direct unauthorized access to the user account that provides
    the network service.
