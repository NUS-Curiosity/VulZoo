Subject: White paper release: Bypassing network access control (NAC) systems

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the availability of a new white paper  
"Bypassing network access control (NAC) systems".
The paper discusses weaknesses and ways to bypass existing NAC  
solutions.

 From the abstract:
The threat of viruses, worms, information theft and lack of control  
of the IT infrastructure leads companies to implement security  
solutions in order to control the access to their internal IT  
networks. A new breed of software and hardware solutions from a  
variety of vendors has recently emerged. All are tasked with one goal  
- controlling the access to a network using different methods and  
solutions. This paper will examine different strategies used to  
provide network access controls. Flaws associated with different NAC  
solutions will be presented. These flaws allow the complete bypass of  
each and every network access control mechanism currently offered on  
the market.
