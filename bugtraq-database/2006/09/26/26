Hi there,

we're proud to announce the official birth of 
http://www.freerainbowtables.com

this website is dedicated to offer free rainbow tables (based on 
rainbowcrack)
a complete set of MD5 tables alpha-numeric - lowercase - up to 8 
characters is available for free download

it's just the first project accomplished by various contributors

The FreeRainbowTables Team had developped a (win32) distributed 
precomputation tool so if you have some CPUs available, you're invited 
to help us in bigger projects!
Just contact the webmaster.

Mirrors are welcome and spreading the tables in bitorrent-like networks 
also.

Have a nice crack
/JA
