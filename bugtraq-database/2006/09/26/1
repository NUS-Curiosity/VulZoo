About Uninformed:

Uninformed is a non-commercial technical outlet for research in areas 
pertaining to security technologies, reverse engineering, and lowlevel 
programming. The goal, as the name implies, is to act as a medium for 
informing the uninformed. The research presented in each edition is 
simply an example of the evolutionary thought that affects all academic 
and professional disciplines.
