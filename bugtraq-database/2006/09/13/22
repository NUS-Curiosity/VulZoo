Synopsis
========

FFmpeg is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows that might be
exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

FFmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /      Vulnerable      /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/ffmpeg      < 0.4.9_p20060530      >= 0.4.9_p20060530

Description
===========

FFmpeg contains buffer overflows in the AVI processing code.

Impact
======

An attacker could trigger the buffer overflows by enticing a user to
load a specially crafted AVI file in an application using the FFmpeg
library. This might result in the execution of arbitrary code in the
context of the running application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FFmpeg users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20060530"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
