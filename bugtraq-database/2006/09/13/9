Synopsis
========

Some buffer overflows were discovered in the CID font parser,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with elevated
privileges.

Background
==========

libXfont is the X.Org Xfont library, some parts are based on the
FreeType code base.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/libXfont       < 1.2.1                          >= 1.2.1
  2  x11-base/xorg-x11        < 7.0                             >= 7.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Several integer overflows have been found in the CID font parser.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user
to load a malicious font file resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running the X server which
typically is the root user. A local user could exploit this
vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.

Workaround
==========

Disable CID-encoded Type 1 fonts by removing the "type1" module and
replacing it with the "freetype" module in xorg.conf.

Resolution
==========

All libXfont users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/libXfont-1.2.1"

All monolithic X.org users are advised to migrate to modular X.org.
