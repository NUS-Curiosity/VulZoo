This is incorrect. 0.10.0-full was the last release to ship with a
topics.php file. The file was part of "convert".

0.10.x-core is NOT affected unless they were updates from earlier
versions. The solution: delete "convert".

0.10.1-full and 0.10.2-full are NOT affected unless the site was an
update from an earlier version. The solution: delete "convert".

For all affected users: as "convert" is meant to be used ONCE to upgrade
from a previous version, the best solution is to delete "convert".

This is also a perfectly acceptable email address to use for vendor
notification (which we greatly appreciate). Parties that notify us still
receive due credit for finding the vulnerability.
