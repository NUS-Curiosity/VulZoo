-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Mozilla/Firefox web browser. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw is due to incorrect handling of the CSS
"letter-spacing" element. By specifying a large number, an attacker can
overflow an integer used during memory allocation. The under-allocated
buffer is later used to store user-supplied data leading to an
exploitable heap overflow.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. Details are
available at:
