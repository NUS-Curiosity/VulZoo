   Thanks for clearing that. But: If ISA is not able to filter IPv6 so
   why can it be bound to an interface anyway? Just to route things
   through? Blindly through a firewall?
   Another posting talks about limited filtering capabilities. Roman
   wrote, icmp went through. So where is the borderline? It still seems
   to me that in the moment for what ever reason ipv6 is enabled on ISA
   the network it should secure is exposed.
