Subject: Dokeos 1.6.4 SQL Injection Vulnerability


Dokeos 1.6.4 SQL Injection Vulnerability


Author: Alvaro Olavarria <aolavarria@...ure.cl>

Affected: Dokeos <= 1.6.4
Status: Notified hereby
Vendor url: http://www.dokeos.com


Background.

Dokeos is an Open Source elearning and course management web application
translated in 34 languages
and helping more than 1.000 organisations worldwide to manage learning and
collaboration activities.


Vulnerability.

Dokeos was built using Claroline's code; it inherited several of its
features including an old version
 of phpBB which is being used as the forum for the courses.   There is a
problem  in the viewtopic.php",
 where the $topic variable is not correctly sanitized and $forumview is
equal to threaded", that would
allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code to the application.


Impact

An attacker could use Blind SQL Injection to gain access to privileged
data like the password hashes
for the administrator user and so on.


Proof of Concept
