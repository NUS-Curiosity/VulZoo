I haven't heard anyone talk about requiring that users use their ISP's DNS 
server.  Just that they should not be able to use any random DNS server on 
the internet.

What is stopping you from running your own local DNS server?  My system at 
home runs named in a configuration that allows any systems on my local 
network to query from it.  That's what I use as my authoritative 
nameserver.
