The flaw is very exploitable, basically any search that includes a books 
result and contains script will trigger the flaw, the .com seems to only 
include the flaw in arabic, and sometime depending on the users location or 
some other thing (I can't identify).

Using a different search to trigger more book results allows you to much 
more easily exploit it.

http://jibbering.com/blog/?id=506 and http://jibbering.com/blog/?id=507 
show a phishing exploit and a gmail contacts stealing method using the above 
attack.

Google still appear to be unable to do the simple programming matter of 
encoding of user input before writing it back out.

Cheers,

Jim.
