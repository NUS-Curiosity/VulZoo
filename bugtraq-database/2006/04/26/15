Synopsis
========

xine-lib contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine-lib is the xine core engine. xine is a free multimedia player. It
plays CDs, DVDs, and VCDs, and can also decode other common multimedia
formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package   /        Vulnerable        /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  xine-lib     < 1.1.2_pre20060328-r1       >= 1.1.2_pre20060328-r1

Description
===========

Federico L. Bossi Bonin discovered that when handling MPEG streams
xine-lib fails to make a proper boundary check of the input data
supplied by the user before copying it to an insufficiently sized
memory buffer.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to play a specially-crafted MPEG
file, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.2_pre20060328-r1"
