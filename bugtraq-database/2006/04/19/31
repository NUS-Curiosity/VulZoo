 sabotagedhosts-file lookup


The XP DNS client has other problems as well.  It caches DNS failiures (arguably out of spec with the RFC, BTW), screwing up VPNs if you're VPNed into an internet network that has local domains which need to resolve to RFC1918 addresses.  The cached failed lookups get prefered to forced entries in the hosts file, if that is tried as a way of forcing the dns lookups to work.  Very frustrating.  So, this isn't much of a surprise.  Rotten, yes, surprising, no.
