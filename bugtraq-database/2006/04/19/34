Obnoxious, sure, but not hard to beat. (Assuming for some insane reason you are actually still using Windows for anything other than playing games)

You just add an entry in your DNS server with a zone matching the hostname that you want to override. And if they have the IP addresses of MSFT-controlled DNS servers hardcoded, you just add an iptables (or equivalent) entry in your firewall (note - this is a seperate device than your wintendo PC, not a peice of software running on your PC)
