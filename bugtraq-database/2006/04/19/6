Subject: Re: GMail, Google Groups XSS Vulnerability


So what's the deal here? I haven't seen any mention of
this XSS vulnerability anywhere else... but I just
tested it and it worked. 

Isn't this a big deal for Google? It seems to me the
cookies accessible through GMail are pretty important,
not just for GMail but for their other services too.
Or am I missing something?
