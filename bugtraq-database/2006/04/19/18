-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is Cisco PSIRT's response to the privilege escalation
vulnerability independently announced by Adam Pointon of
Assurance.com.au and Mathieu Pepin of Axen Consulting. We would like
to thank both Adam and Mathieu for bringing this issue to our
attention.

The following are affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco Wireless LAN Solution Engine (WLSE)
  * Cisco Hosting Solution Engine (HSE)
  * Cisco User Registration Tool (URT)
  * Cisco Ethernet Subscriber Solution Engine (ESSE)
  * CiscoWorks2000 Service Management Solution (SMS)

By exploiting this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker on the
command line interface may obtain shell access to the underlying
operating system by injecting specially crafted commands.

The following products are affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco WLSE - A separate Cisco Security Advisory has been
    published which addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the WLSE
    appliance, including this vulnerability. Refer to the security
    advisory at the following URL for more information on the impact
    and fixed software versions:
    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20060419-wlse.shtml.

  * This vulnerability is addressed by the Cisco bug ID CSCsd22861
    for the URT appliance. 2.5.5(A1) version of the URT software
    fixes this issue and can be downloaded from the following URL:
    http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/urt-3des.

  * Cisco HSE - This vulnerability is addressed by the Cisco bug ID
    CSCsd22859 for the HSE appliance.
    The HSE-PSIRT1 patch fixes this issue and can be downloaded from
    the following URL:
    http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/1105-host-sol.

  * Cisco ESSE - This product has reached End-of-Life therefore Cisco
    will not be providing fixed software for the ESSE product by
    default. Customers who require a fix for this should open a
    service request and request a fix through the Technical Support
    organization.

  * CiscoWorks SMS - This product has reached End-of-Life therefore
    Cisco will not be providing fixed software for the SMS product by
    default. Customers who require a fix for this should open a
    service request and request a fix through the Technical Support
    organization.

Thanks,

Ilker
