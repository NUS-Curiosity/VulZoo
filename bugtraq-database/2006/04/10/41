Subject: Re: Bios Information Leakage


hmm, apparently the code-breaker's site is undergoing  major works right now. The html version of the article [Award BIOS COde Injection] available at:
http://www.geocities.com/mamanzip/Articles/POST_jump_table_hacking.html


And the much improved version of the old CodeBreaker's Award BIOS Reverse Engineering Paper is available at:
http://www.geocities.com/mamanzip/Articles/Award_Bios_RE/Award_Bios_RE_guide.html


Just in case some people interested. Anyway, mirroring this article is OK, as long as I'm informed about it.
