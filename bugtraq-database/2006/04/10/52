Vulnerable Systems:
TUGZip 3.4.0.0 , TUGZip 3.3.0.0 , TUGZip 3.1.0.2

Detail :

The vulnerability is caused due to an input validation
error when extracting files compressed with GZ (*.gz),
JAR(*.jar), RAR(*.rar), ZIP(*.zip) .
This makes it possible to have files extracted to
arbitrary locations outside the specified directory
using the "../" directory traversal sequence.


Do not extract untrusted  RAR and JAR and ZIP and GZ
files.
To reduce the risk, never extract files as an
administrative user.

harmless exploit:
use HEAP [Hamid Evil Archive Pack]
