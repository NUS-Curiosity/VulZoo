this old culture city, in which we express our advancements and
personalities, exchange our technologies and experiences, and share our
achievements and excellences.

August is the season of harvest, as well as share. These security
professionals at the vanguard of leading information security technology
will share research and unique experience with zealots from all over the
world, and the speakers to be presented in the conference are among the
best, the most intelligent. These professionals have assembled unique
new material that they will present at this conference to help you
maintain your leadership in this severely competitive technological
field, and it must be the most memorable experience in your life journey.

This three-day conference will be held in a relaxed and cozy atmosphere,
which will provide an international communion platform for the
information security professionals&#65292;technicians&#65292;security supervisors&#65292;
managers, and hacker technology fans. They say their says and show
themselves as much as they like. It is not only a brilliant symposium,
