Subject: GeSWall 2.2 – Free Intrusion Prevention System for Windows


Hello Bugtraq,

we would like to announce the recent GeSWall update. GeSWall is an
intrusion prevention system for Windows. It applies a security policy
that effectively precludes damage from various attacks and malicious
software.

Instead of blocking particular attack techniques GeSWall focuses on
attack objectives such as taking control of a PC, stealing data,
breaking system integrity etc. This approach allows block unknown
attacks based on “zero-days” vectors, e.g. GeSWall has been stopped
Windows Metafile exploits.

GeSWall policy isolates web browsers, e-mail, chat, p2p, irc clients
and other applications that may serve as entry points for malicious
software or intrusions. Viruses, trojans, spyware, keyloggers and
exploits cannot pass through an isolation policy and so cannot cause damage.

In contrast with similar solutions, GeSWall is not limited by using
sandboxing or virtualization, because this leads to usability
problems. GeSWall is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible and
does not restrict a network access, files or process creation.
Instead, it tracks a potential threat (e.g. a file, process) down,
isolates this threat and prevents damage.
