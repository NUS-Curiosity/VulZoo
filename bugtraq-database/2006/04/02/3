Using 2.06 is a guaranteed ticket to your web site being hacked.  phpBB is at 2.19 at the moment and there have been major security flaws found in each previous version - including 2.06

Patch your 2.06 up to 2.19 or die... because there are bots out there that are looking for lazy web admins who didn't upgrade.  But then again maybe you don't care if your 2.06 gets wiped out, your user database gets 'oWn3d' or if your server is already under their command and control.

Stop wasting time asking silly questions and get on with the business of properly securing your phpBB.   Zoneh.org is full of phpBB web sites that were too lazy or slow to upgrade.
