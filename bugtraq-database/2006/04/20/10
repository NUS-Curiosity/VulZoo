   No, I'm suggesting that the application should enable the local
   administrator to configure that application. Configuring a firewall
   is a bit more than setting a domain name. It must contain some
   (preferebly reasonable) filtering mechanisms.
   From what is said so far this seems not to be possible. If that is
   true, ISA is broken by design. We are talking about a firewall. A
   firewall that cannot filter is not a firewall. Agreed?

   Do you think the same applies to ipv4? I said "for what ever reason ipv6
   in enabled on ISA" because I am definitely not in the position to guess
   all possible reasons for activating ipv6.

   You are speaking out of my deepest heart. Anyhow, you are aware that
   it is not always the incompentent admin; sometimes it is the incompetent
   superior and not every admin has the nerv and the backing to say no
   to idiotic orders by management.

   Definitely.

   I still fail to see why an unsupported protocol goes through anyway.
   The reason for implementing a firewall is to separate networks with
   different trust levels. Not to connect them wide open. For this any
   router will do.

   Sure. But even in a protected enviroment you may want some additional
   restrictions.

   Again: If that application is a firewall it's a must to be able to
   filter. Anything else is not logical.
   If the application is some funny network gaming tool, then I heartly
   agree.
