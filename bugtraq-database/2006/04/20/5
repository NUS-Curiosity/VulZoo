Subject: Re[3]: Bypassing ISA Server 2004 with IPv6

   Nice, that you do. If I manage by any means to see remotely
   that you have attached a mouse to your ISA and to (ab)use it,
   I'm much better that I thought - and you have much bigger problems
   than you thought.
   The nice thing about icmp is that I do not require much knowledge
   to get information remotely. Same true with ipv6. Unless something
   in between stops me. Which brings us back to the topic: a firewall
   allowing too much.

   So you state that it is perfectly well for a firewall to allow
   any traffic through. Per default? And that this firewall does not
   need to have the interface to configure what traffic is allowed?
   I disagree.
   If a firewall supports a protocol, that same firewall should also
   provide the proper means and interface to configure it. And not blow
   holes in networks.

   Cheers,
