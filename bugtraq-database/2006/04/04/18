That will depend on whether the state stored between calls to the PRNG 
is only 15-bits, or something larger.

If more state is stored than is enumerated in the result, then the 
generator should have more points on its sequence than 32768 .  In that 
case then, seeding with more than 15 bits would be worthwhile.

I have not looked at Bash myself, to see what it actually does
