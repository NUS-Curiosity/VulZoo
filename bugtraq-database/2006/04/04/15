Synopsis
========

MediaWiki is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack that could
allow arbitrary JavaScript code execution.

Background
==========

MediaWiki is a collaborative editing software, used by big projects
like Wikipedia.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/mediawiki      < 1.4.15                        >= 1.4.15

Description
===========

MediaWiki fails to decode certain encoded URLs correctly.

Impact
======

By supplying specially crafted links, a remote attacker could exploit
this vulnerability to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that
will be executed in a user's browser session in the context of the
vulnerable site.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MediaWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mediawiki-1.4.15"
