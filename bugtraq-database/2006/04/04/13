Advisory ID  : SYMSA-2006-002
Advisory Name: McAfee WebShield SMTP Format String Vulnerability
Release Date : 04-03-2005
Application  : McAfee WebShield SMTP 4.5 MR1a
Platform     : Microsoft Windows
Severity     : System access / remotely exploitable
Author       : Ollie Whitehouse / ollie_whitehouse@...antec.com
Vendor status: Vendor verified, patch available.
CVE Number   : CVE-2006-0559
Reference    : http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16742


Overview: 

        There exists a format string vulnerability within the 
        McAfee WebShield SMTP server which allows an attacker to execute 
        arbitrary code on the host computer via an unauthenticated 
        connection. With successful exploitation, an unauthenticated 
        attacker is able to obtain SYSTEM access.



Details: 

        A format string vulnerability exists in the function which handles 

        the construction of the bounce messages for non-existent domains. 

        On the way into the mail system this causes no problems (correct 
        usage of the printf() family of functions).  However, when the 
        file ‘(13digitfilename).rcp’ is picked up from the OUT directory 
        to construct the bounce message, a format string in the original 
        destination address for the mail will trigger the vulnerability. 

        Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution.
 

Vendor Response:

        The above vulnerability was addressed via a patch (P0803) that was 

        released in August 2003 for Webshield SMTP 4.5 MR1a.  This 
        vulnerability has also been fixed in the latest release of the 
        product, Webshield SMTP 4.5 MR2.
 
        Licensed and evaluation versions of Webshield SMTP 4.5 MR2 are 
        available for customer download from the McAfee website at 
        http://www.mcafeesecurity.com/us/downloads/default.asp
 
        If there are any further questions about this statement, please 
        contact McAfee support.
