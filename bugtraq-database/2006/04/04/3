I think essentially the problem of trojans, phishes and poisoned data is that of masquerading.

For trojans, the problem is e.g. lack of system-attention key; for Phish, lack of authentication
protocols etc; and for injection, the vulnerability is in the input data scrubbing.

Injection requires a bug in one place: the (web-)application code.

What follows is leveraged hijacking, with perhaps masquerading as an intermediate step.
