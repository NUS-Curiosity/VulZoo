The control point is there already, as has been demonstrated by several
attacks on DNS data. 

If we were to ignore the problem of open recursive servers, there would be
a rush to implement draconian, ineffective countermeasures like packet
filters. It would be a very bad thing, just like the stupid port 25 blocks
are. That must be avoided and the end-to-end capability of the Internet
must be preserved. (I think we are in agreement here.)

If you have these concerns, I suggest you work with the available,
standardised, implemented methods of verifying that DNS data is correct
(ie. DNSSEC and TSIG for various parts of the infrastructure.) instead of
pushing your head down in the sand even further believing TCP  or open
access to the rest of the net would make some difference in credibility for
DNS messages. At least one TLD (se) has DNSSEC in production, large amounts
of european IP address space have it, courtesy of RIPE.
