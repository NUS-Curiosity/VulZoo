Synopsis
========

ClamAV contains multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to remote
execution of arbitrary code or cause an application crash.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.88.1                      >= 0.88.1

Description
===========

ClamAV contains format string vulnerabilities in the logging code
(CVE-2006-1615). Furthermore Damian Put discovered an integer overflow
in ClamAV's PE header parser (CVE-2006-1614) and David Luyer discovered
that ClamAV can be tricked into performing an invalid memory access
(CVE-2006-1630).

Impact
======

By sending a malicious attachment to a mail server running ClamAV, a
remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service or the execution of
arbitrary code. Note that the overflow in the PE header parser is only
exploitable when the ArchiveMaxFileSize option is disabled.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88.1"
