Subject: Re[3]: Bypassing ISA Server 2004 with IPv6


Dear Christine Kronberg,

Microsoft  ISA  Server  can't  filter  events  from Microsoft Mouse, but
Microsoft Mouse can be bound to computer. It's security risk, but I know
how to secure mouse without ISA and I accept this risk.

IPv6  can  not  be  filtered  by  ISA,  but  it still can be filtered by
different  tools,  or  by  it's own means, as IPv6 support network-level
security.  Unlike IPv4, IPv6 supports authentication, integrity checking
and  encryption  natively.  See ipsec6.exe and descriptions for Security
Association Batabase and Security Policy Database.
