Subject: Scry Gallery XSS Vulnerability


Software : Scry Gallery v1.1
WebSite :http://scry.org/

ISSUE :
The software is prone to a XSS attack using the  following proof of concept :

http://anysiteusingscrygallery.com/[Path to scry gallery]/index.php?v=list&i=0&p=<script>var%20variable=111111111111111111;alert(variable);</script>

One can execute mailcious scripts using the above code in the web browser.
The above concept also aids a path disclosure to the remote attacker. This vulnerability has been tested and exits on Scry Gallery v1.1.
