What is stopping you from running your own SMTP server? A port 25 block?
Well if an ISP doesn't want to play whack-a-mole with unsecured dns servers
popping up every day do you not think it likely that they will resort to the
same techniques they used for smtp?

Granted a port 53 inbound block would make more sense for the current
example but just like bots started running their own SMTP engines I see the
dns flood model changing to fit the new landscape.
