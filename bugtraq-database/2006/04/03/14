Agreed. But why are they html_entity_decode in the first place? Users don't 
supply HTML. Databases don't contain HTML.

As Stefan Esser says, and your exploit demonstrates, it is really weird code 
which demonstrates the exploit. It seems like real-world applications 
demonstrating this exploits also are vulnerable to e.g. Cross Site Scripting 
(XSS) vulnerabilities.

This type of bugs are serious, but the attack vector is weird and shouldn't 
apply to any sanely coded script. But then again, we live in an insane world 
:-)
