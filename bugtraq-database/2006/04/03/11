Subject: Re: Mis-diagnosed XSS bugs hiding worse issues due to PHP feature


We have reported this xss (in php display_errors) 28 May 2005. 

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=33173&edit=1
Replay from php developers : ------------"Bogus". ------------
"...Show erros is only a convenience thing to aid you while developing. Thus 
no user will ever see such error messages. So in the end it is not usable for 
phishing and alike..."

Many functions in php are vulnerability of xss. It is no dangerous but can't 
exists. For example 
http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/18
or
gpg version: http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/18/1
function include() in postnuke.
