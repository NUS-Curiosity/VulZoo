Subject: PowerPoint Phishing Trojan


Hi all,

Just an FYI, there is a neat little PowerPoint Trojan that we received
from a helpful source yesterday. It appears to be exploiting this vuln:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-012.mspx

file as malicious:

I have the binary to available AV vendors by request.

I found the blind drop and have recovered all the stolen files.

Thanks.
