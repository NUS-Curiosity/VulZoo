   That's no excuse for letting IPv6 packets pass the firewall.
   If I understand correctly this means that the internal LAN
   is open for any attacks as long as they are IPv6 based. If that
   is right, this is an extremly nasty bug. If ISA Server 2004
   and Windows 2003 Basic Firewall cannot filter that stuff it
   should simply drop it.
