Subject: Linux Kernel Local DoS vulnerability.


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello.
I'd like to present one of Linux Kernel vulnerabilities. As far as I
know, this one affects 2.6.x kernels.

Problem
- --

The problem lies in sys_timer_create() in Linux/kernel/posix-timers.c.
Each time user creates a posix timer, some kernel memory is allocated.
Since count of timers that can be created by user is limited only by
sigqueue size (ex. 4294967295 in Debian) every local user can exhaust
all avaible memory which will trigger oom_killer (mm/oom_kill.c). If a
process itself uses a small amount of memory, it's oom_score will be
low, so all other processes would be killed.

        mov     eax,66 ;        is less than 'init' and others

Fix
- --
In my opinion the easiest way to defend is to enforce pending signals
queue size rlimit (ulimit -i).

Vendor notification status
- --
Vendor refused to fix this kind of bugs.
