No; the same problem occurs. This is the kind of general problem I'm 
speaking about. Most vendors that actually understand security will look for 
other bugs in the same functional area if you point out a bug. IMO, my job 
as a security vulnerability researcher is to highlight problem areas - i.e. 
areas of functionality that are rife with issues. How can Oracle fix one 
issue but miss the same flaw two lines later??? In this case though, we're 
not just talking about one flaw but several. Really, it is inconceivable, 
yet they, somehow, manage to do it.

God forbid that any of our critical national infrastructure runs on this 
product.... oops it does :(

And every version from 8 through 9 to 10 release 2 is vulnerable. That's 
every supported version of Oracle on every operating system.

Oracle customers: honestly - Oracle are not going to listen to the likes of 
me - but they will listen folks like you. If you're not happy with the 
response you're getting from Oracle then get on the 'phone - call them up 
and tell them that you're not happy. Please, demand improvements.

By the way, this is not an isolated incident. I have many examples to hand 
where Oracle have tried to fix problems in the same functional area but only 
whitewashed it. They should be proactively looking for similar issues in the 
same code just like Microsoft does.

The "champion of quality coding movement" 
(http://www.cio.com/archive/031505/security.html) , who "applauds ethical 
hacking", asks "Why isn't that standard development process?"

I don't know... but I don't think we'll find out in the two year time frame 
posited; we've got less than a year to go.

p.p.s.

Just to clarify the issues:

GET_DOMAIN_INDEX_TABLES
GET_DOMAIN_INDEX_METADATA
GET_V2_DOMAIN_INDEX_TABLES

are all vulnerable to the exploit.
