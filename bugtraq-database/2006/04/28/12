Subject: Re: Recent Oracle exploit is _actually_ an 0day with no patch


David is right, we also have reported hundreds of
vulnerabiities to Oracle and they only fix what you
report to them, they don't care to fix the same
vulnerability on different portions of code, one good
example is that Oracle should have eliminated SQL
injection bugs since long time ago but there are still
SQL injection bugs all around because they only fix
bugs reported by researchers. I remember Mary Ann
Davidson saying "Oracle finds more than 75 percent of
significant security vulnerabilities in-house"
(http://news.com.com/When+security+researchers+become+the+problem/2010-1071_3-5807074.html)
so WTF you don't fix them!!!!!

I really can't understand how customers don't demand
better security to Oracle or switch to other vendor, I
would like to have customers like that so you can sell
very unsecure products to them and them won't ever
complain so I can save billons not improving security
on products and make a lot of money$$$$.

PS: Look at this paper dated February 2002, amazing
how Oracle efforts are visible on 2006!
