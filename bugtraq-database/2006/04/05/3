You tell them whatever you like, they aren't going to switch just like they
didn't switch from exchange just because it installed as an open relay. The
whack-a-mole problem didn't go away with open relays until MS changed the
default to disable relay and it's not going to go away with open recursive
dns servers until they change the default there as well.
