Hey BugTraq readers,

This is just a quick note to let you know that Black Hat USA 2006 registration
and Call for Papers is now open.

We expect another outstanding program, and with the addition of more floor
space at Caesars Palace we are able to bring you more selection in training
classes as well as presentations during the Briefings. Good news all around! 

What is the Black Hat Briefings?
The Black Hat Briefings was created to fill the need for computer security
professionals to better understand the security risks and potential threats to
their information infrastructures and computer systems. Black Hat accomplishes
this by assembling a group of vendor-neutral security professionals and having
them speak candidly about the problems businesses face and their solutions to
those problems. No gimmicks -- just straight talk by people who make it their
business to explore the ever-changing security space.

Black Hat USA Briefings 2006 takes place at Caesars Palace Las Vegas, Nevada,
August 2-3. Register now to take advantage of our early bird rate.
