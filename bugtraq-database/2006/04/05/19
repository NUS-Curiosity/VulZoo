Yeah, it could be indeed...

It's not directly related to the discussion topic, but i just wanted to
inform you about the current Internet censorship campaign promoted by the
Italian government since last February 20th: a list of web sites offering
(illegal) on-line gambling services is blocked through DNS records
hijacking performed at the ISP level.

In other words, the Italian government is forcing all the major ISPs to
break regular DNS functionality and override these censored records:

Italy is the first "democratic" country to do something like that, AFAIK. 

Just my 2 euro-cents,
