Subject: Re: Buffer-overflow in Ultr@VNC 1.0.1 viewer and
	server


Hello,

Thank you for the disclosure of this issue. I'd like to better understand 
the extent of the problem, for which the code snippets have been very 
helpful, but I still would need some help in the case of the server 
vulnerability.

Could you confirm my impression that the server vulnerability can only 
overflow the buffer in 3 bytes? (" --" is a C-Style string, doesn't it?).
Is there a way to exploit this for code execution, or would it be limited 
to DoS?, 
How could one control the result of the FormatMessage for any of those two 
purpouses?

Thanks in advance.

Juan Alvarez
