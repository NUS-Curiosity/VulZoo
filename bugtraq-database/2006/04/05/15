---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated libc-client packages fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:184098
Issue date:        2006-04-04
Product:           Fedora Core 2
Keywords:          Bugfix, Security
CVE Names:         CVE-2005-2933
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated libc-client packages that fix a buffer overflow issue are now
available.

C-client is a common API for accessing mailboxes.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the way C-client parses user
supplied mailboxes. If an authenticated user requests a specially
crafted mailbox name, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code on a
server that uses C-client to access mailboxes. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CVE-2005-2933 to this issue.

All users of libc-client should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch that resolves this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
