4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe
Document Server for Reader Extensions, which can be exploited by
malicious users to bypass certain security restrictions and conduct
script insertion attacks, or by malicious people to gain knowledge of
sensitive information or conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

1) Missing access control restrictions in the Adobe Document Server for
Reader Extensions (ads-readerext) can be exploited by authenticated
users to access functionality, which they should not have access to, by
manipulating the "actionID" and "pageID" parameters.

Successful exploitation e.g. allows a low-privileged user with "Draft"
permissions to create a new administrative user account.

2) Input passed to the "ReaderURL" variable in the "Update Download
Site" section of ads-readerext is not properly sanitised before being
used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary script code (prefixed
with either "ftp://" or "http://"), which will be executed in an
administrative user's browser session when logging in.

Normally, editing this field requires administrative privileges.
However, this can be combined with vulnerability #1 and therefore be
exploited by any valid user.

3) Input passed to the "actionID" parameter in ads-readerext and the
"op" parameter in Adobe Server Web Services (AlterCast) is not properly
sanitised before being returned to users. This can be exploited to
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in
context of a vulnerable site.

Examples:
http://[host]:8019/ads-readerext/ads-readerext?actionID=[code]
http://[host]:8019/altercast/AlterCast?op=[code]

4) Different error messages are returned when attempting to log into
ads-readerext depending on whether or not the supplied username exists.
This can be exploited to enumerate valid accounts.

5) A user's session ID for ads-readerext is passed in the URL
("jsessionid" parameter) and exposed to other web sites in the
"Referer:" header. 

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to the current version of Adobe Document Server for Reader
Extensions.

NOTE: Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions 6.0 is no longer a
supported product. Adobe has shipped two subsequent versions (Adobe
Document Server for Reader Extensions 6.1 and LiveCycle Reader
Extensions 7.0) both of which are not affected.

======================================================================
