3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows,
which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct spoofing attacks.

The vulnerability is caused due to an input validation error in the
Object Packager (packager.exe) in the handling of the "Command Line"
property. This can be exploited to spoof the filename and the
associated file type in the Packager security dialog by including a "/"
slash character in the "Command Line" property.

Example:
cmd /c [shell command] /[file].txt

This can further be exploited to execute arbitrary shell commands on a
user's system by tricking a user into opening and interacting with e.g.
a malicious Rich Text document or Word document containing an embedded
Package object in e.g. WordPad. 

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Apply patches issued by Microsoft.
