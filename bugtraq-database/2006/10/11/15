gCards Version 1.13
http://www.gregphoto.net/gcards/index.php

22 include_once('../config.php');			# the variable is defined
23 include_once('../inc/UIfunctions.php');	# no variable change
24 include_once('loginfunction.php');		# just a couple functions
25 include_once('../inc/smileyClass.php');	# just a single class
26 include_once("../inc/".$languageFile);	# the only include with $languageFile

$languageFile is defined on line 93 of config.php, by default to
"language_en.php"

Maybe im missing where the vulnerability is?
