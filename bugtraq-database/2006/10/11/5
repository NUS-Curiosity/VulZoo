CVE: CVE-2006-3864



Overview:

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the logged in user. An array boundary condition may be
violated by a malicious Microsoft Office (DOC/PPT/XLS) file in order to redirect
execution into attacker-supplied data. Exploitation requires that the
attacker coerce or
persuade the victim to open a malicious Microsoft Office file.


(Not)Details:

The specific flaw lies with in the Office binary mso.dll.
There will be a memory corruption during the analysis of a malformed
Microsoft Office File.

Microsoft said "We have confirmed that the issue you reported to us is
potentially
exploitable"

Because there are too many boring MS OFFICE vulnerabilities released this year,
I am boring to write an technical advisory and I believe that nobody
is interested in that.
So I just post this advisory for record purpose only ;) Sorry.
