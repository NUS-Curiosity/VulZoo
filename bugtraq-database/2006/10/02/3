Subject: 0day in Firefox from ToorCon '06

CNet is writing about some 0day vulnerabilities in Firefox that were 
demonstrated at ToorCon '06 by Mischa Spiegelmock and Andrew Wbeelsoi:

http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-6121608.html

Mischa and Andrew also claim to have found about 30 0day vulnerabilities 
in Firefox. The article mention that the vulnerabilities from the 
presentation are specific to Firefox's implementation of Javascript and 
hints that they are stack overflows. On the other hand, the recent 
security-related Mozilla commits following the presentation deal with 
improper validation of scope chain lookups in jsxml.c, jsinterp.c and 
jsiter.c, which could allow injecting content into the Chrome context. 
We'll probably see a security release of Firefox in the next week, but 
in the mean time I have put a couple of links to the code diff's that 
fix these vulnerabilities at
