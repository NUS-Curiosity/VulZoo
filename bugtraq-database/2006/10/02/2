Subject: ZERT patch for setSlice()

A ZERT patch has now been released and is avilable on our site (
http://isotf.org/zert/ ).

A full patch (for limited Windows versions, which is built very nicely) is
available from Determina.

Our patch automates the Microsoft suggested workaround.

Thanks,

	Gadi.
