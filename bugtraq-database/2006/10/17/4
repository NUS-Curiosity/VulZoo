As I'm sure everyone is aware by now.

1. "Flaw" only affects pirated copies that have intentionally removed some security features. Nothing we can really do here when this happens

2. This is an IE exploit thats been fixed for well over a year where GIF files would be parsed as HTML.

3. Versions >= 3.6.0 by default have anti-robot registering enabled, all previous versions had to enable this manually.
