Subject: TORQUE Spool Job Race condition (torque <= 2.0.0p8)

Hello all,

Back in March i audited a software called TORQUE Resource Manager and found a
critical race condition vulnerability which could be used by malicious users to
escalate their privileges.

"TORQUE is an open source resource manager providing control over batch jobs and
distributed compute nodes. It is a community effort based on the original *PBS
project and, with more than 1,200 patches, has incorporated significant
advances in the areas of scalability, fault tolerance, and feature extensions
contributed by NCSA, OSC, USC , the U.S. Dept of Energy, Sandia, PNNL, U of
Buffalo, TeraGrid, and many other leading edge HPC organizations. This version
may be freely modified and redistributed subject to the constraints of the
included license."

This paper was submitted to "Cluster Resources INC", a great grid software
company which kindly supports the TORQUE Resource Manager (Open Source)
software. They where very helpfull and profissional. A big hug to their GREAT
team ;o)!!!

Iam now sharing the paper with the community:

PS: sorry for the PDF but the report is 13 pages long...

Best regards,
