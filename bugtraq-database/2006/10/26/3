 Lyrics3 v2.00 tags Heap Overflow Vulnerability

AOL Nullsoft Winamp Ultravox Lyrics3 v2.00 tags Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.25.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 25, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Lyrics3 is a system for embedding the lyrics inside an MP3 song file.
The Winamp media player has support for this protocol. More information
about Winamp is available at the following site:

    http://www.winamp.com

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the
Ultravox Lyrics3 parsing code in AOL Corp.'s Nullsoft Winamp media
player could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the currently logged in user.

Due to an error in the parsing of certain Lyrics3 tags, a malicious
server can cause the Winamp client to allocate a very small amount of
space and then try fill it with a large amount of server supplied date,
potentially overwriting values which will lead to code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute code in the context of
the user who started Winamp. Exploitation requires that attackers social
engineer victims into connecting to a server. This can be accomplished
by embedding a link in a web page to a playlist file, a 'shout:' URI or
a 'uvox:' URI, which are automatically loaded by Winamp from Internet
Explorer. Alternatively, one of these items could be placed in a
playlist file. However, attackers cannot force users to open the content
they have supplied.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version
5.24 and 5.3 of Nullsoft Winamp. Previous versions also may be affected.

V. WORKAROUND
