Subject: Metasploit Framework 2.7 Released

The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source exploit development 
platform. The 2.7 release includes three user interfaces, 157 exploits 
and 76 payloads.The Framework will run on any modern operating system 
that has a working Perl interpreter. The Windows installer includes a 
slimmed-down version of the Cygwin environment. 

Windows users are encouraged to update as soon as possible. A number of 
improvements were made that should make the Windows experience a little  
less painful and a lot more reliable. All updates to 2.6 have been rolled 
into 2.7, along with some new exploits and minor features. 

This release is available from the Metasploit.com web site:
  - Unix:  http://metasploit.com/tools/framework-2.7.tar.gz
  - Win32: http://metasploit.com/tools/framework-2.7.exe

The latest version can be pulled directly from Subversion:
 $ svn co http://metasploit.com/svn/framework2/trunk/

A demonstration of the msfweb interface is running live from:

This may be the LAST 2.x version of the Metasploit Framework. All
development resources are now being applied to version 3.0. More
information about version 3.0 can be found online at:
  - http://metasploit.com/projects/Framework/msf3/
  
Exploit modules designed for the 2.2 through 2.6 releases should maintain
compatibility with 2.7. If you run into any problems using older
modules with this release, please let us know.
