This 0day was reported on 10/20/06 here
http://www.mnin.org/advisories/2006_novell_httpstk.pdf.

Seems that your initiative has fallen a bit behind.  Your customers
had to wait for you to realize this had already been released and a
signature was added to Bleeding Snort on 10/23.

It's also a bit odd that Novell released the updates on 10/20/06, the
same day as the MNIN advisory.

Based on the time line it looks like the whole thing might have been
ripped off.....

Cheers,

Matt
