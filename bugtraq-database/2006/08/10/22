Synopsis
========

A format string vulnerability has been reported in Net::Server which
can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Net::Server is an extensible, generic Perl server engine. It is used by
several Perl applications like Postgrey.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-perl/net-server       < 0.88                          >= 0.88

Description
===========

The log function of Net::Server does not handle format string
specifiers properly before they are sent to syslog.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted datastream to an application using
Net::Server, an attacker could cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Net::Server should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/net-server-0.88"
