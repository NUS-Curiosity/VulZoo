Synopsis
========

libwmf is vulnerable to an integer overflow potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libwmf is a library for reading and converting vector images in
Microsoft's native Windows Metafile Format (WMF).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libwmf      < 0.2.8.4                       >= 0.2.8.4

Description
===========

infamous41md discovered that libwmf fails to do proper bounds checking
on the MaxRecordSize variable in the WMF file header. This could lead
to an head-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted WMF file, a remote
attacker could cause a heap-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running the application that uses
libwmf.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround for this issue.

Resolution
==========

All libwmf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libwmf-0.2.8.4"

References
==========
