I found no mambo-phphop, did you mean mambo-phpshop,
now VirtueMart: <http://www.mambo-phpshop.net/>?

I found no mod_phpshop-Archive, so I tested some files
from the actual VirtueMart. They did the usual check for
direct calls (the lines 

|Â defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or die( 'Direct Access to this
| location is not allowed.' );
 
near the top of each file). So there is no inclusion 
possible.


Where did you find the archive with the reported vulnerable
code? I would like to take a look on it.

Regards
  Carsten
