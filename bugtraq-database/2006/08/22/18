Subject: Tons of SQL-injections and XSS in Eichhorn Portal and vendor page

Hi list.

There are lots of SQL injections and XSS in the 'Eichhorn Portal' by
'Guder und Koch Netzwerktechnik' and their own website.

Input passed to multiple parameters in different PHP-files isn't
properly sanitised before being returned to the user.

This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user's browser session in context of an affected site or conduct some
SQL injection.


Because there are so many Bugs, I will just give some examples of not
properly checked parameters and form fields:

Eichhorn Portal
- main
parameter "profil_nr"
textfield "suchstring" in "suchForm"
parameter "sprache"

- gallerie module
parameter "GaleryKey"
parameter "Breadcrumbs"

- ggbns module
parameter "GGBNSaction"


guderundkoch.de
- index.php
attribute "topic"


Vendor is not notified, because they don't offer a mailaddress for
this purpose. But they should see lots of strange requests in their
log files :)
