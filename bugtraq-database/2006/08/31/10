    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-610

Description:
    Previous versions of the libmusicbrainz package are vulnerable to
    compromised or otherwise malicious servers, if a client attempts
    to access the server.  While this is a remote source of data,
    it cannot be triggered directly by a remote attacker, and requires
    explicit or implicit user complicity.  It is therefore similar to
    mail client IMAP parsing vulnerabilities.
