Subject: Assessment of Vista Kernel Mode Security


Everyone - Symantec has just released an in depth report on the security
of the Windows Vista kernel.  This is a detailed technical report that
discusses how Vista boots, how PatchGuard and Code Integrity work, as
well as a technique on how to bypass them.

You can find the paper here:

urity.pdf

These technologies introduce a number of concerns for the software
industry. Some of them are discussed here:

If anyone thinks this is self-serving, it really isn't.  These
technologies have real implications on the future of software
development.
