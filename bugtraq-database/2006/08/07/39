Subject: Re: Re[2]: [Full-disclosure] Attacking the local LAN via XSS

I agree with you. Sometimes routers do not have http enabled although
I believe that most administrators enable this service to perform
easy/remote administration tasks. However, it is quite common to find
http enabled devices. :) printers, wireless printers, cameras... you
name it. Attacking these devices is not that severe as attacking the
border router however, if the attacker is able to misconfigure one or
more of these devices some bad things can happen (DoS, etc).

IMHO, if you want to do stuff on lower level, you need to think of
something else. JavaScript, Flash and Java Applets are technologies
that are designed to run on the WEB. This is why, IMHO, they are quite
good platform for performing WEB/HTTP based attacks.

cheers
