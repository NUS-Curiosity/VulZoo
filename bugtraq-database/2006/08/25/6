Subject: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Asterisk 1.2.10 (Fixed in 1.2.11)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Mu Security ( http://www.musecurity.com/ ) posted details of multiple
vulnerabilities in Asterisk which have been fixed in the latest version.

You can find more information at the Daily Asterisk News Site:

http://www.sineapps.com/news.php?rssid=1448

Excerpt from their release:

Vulnerability Details:

A remote stack buffer overflow condition in Asterisk's MGCP
implementation could allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerable
code is triggered with the use of a malformed AUEP (audit endpoint)
response message.

A second issue exists in the handling of file names sent to the
Record()application which could lead to arbitrary code execution via a
format string attack or arbitrary file-overwrite via directory traversal
techniques. The impact of this vulnerability is minimal, however, as it
requires an administrator to use a client-controlled variable as part of
the filename.

Solution:

Mu Security would like to thank the Asterisk security team for their
timely response to these issues.

A patch for the buffer overflow is available from the following link:
http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asterisk/asterisk-1.2.11-patch.gz

To protect against the Record() vulnerability, do not use
user-controlled variables ( eg, ${CALLERIDNAME} ) as part of the the
filename argument.
