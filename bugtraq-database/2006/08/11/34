Thank you for the response.

My question is "is it even a workaround."

Cisco's solution is to have the VPN concentrator refuse new SA
requests once the number of pending SA requests exceeds the set
amount. But the symptom of the DOS is that no new SA's can be formed.
So the workaround produces the same results as the DOS .
