   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2006-09
   Advisory Title: SAP-DB/MaxDB WebDBM remote buffer overflow
   Author: Oliver Karow / Oliver_Karow@...antec.com
   Release Date: 29-08-2006
   Application: SAP-DB/MaxDB 7.6.00.22 - WebDBM
   Platform: Windows/Unix
   Severity: Remotely exploitable/Local System Access
   Vendor status: Verified by vendor / Resolved in 7.6.00.31
   CVE Number: CVE-2006-4305
   Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/19660


Overview: 

     A connection from a WebDBM Client to the DBM Server causes a 
buffer overflow when the given database name is too large. This 
can result in the execution of arbitrary code in the context of 
the database server.


Details: 
     SAP-DB/MaxDB is a heavy-duty, SAP-certified open source 
database for OLTP and OLAP usage which offers high reliability, 
availability, scalability and a very comprehensive feature set. 
It is targeted for large mySAP Business Suite environments 
and other applications that require maximum enterprise-level 
database functionality and complements the MySQL database server.

     A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in MaxDB's WebDBM. 
Due to an input validation error, it is possible to execute 
arbitrary code with the privileges of the 'wahttp' process by 
sending a malformed HTTP request. Authentication is not required 
for successful exploitation to occur.
	

Vendor Response:

The above vulnerability has been fixed in the latest release of 
the product, MaxDB 7.6.00.31.

Licensed and evaluation versions of MaxDB are available for 
download in the download section of www.mysql.com/maxdb:
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/maxdb/7.6.00.html. 

If there are any further questions about this statement, please
contact mysql-MaxDB support.

Please note that SAP customers receive their downloads via the 
SAP Service Marketplace www.service.sap.com and must not use 
downloads from the addresses above for their SAP solutions.

Recommendation:

	The vendor has released MaxDB 7.6.00.31 to address 
this issue. Users should contact the vendor to obtain the 
appropriate upgrade.

As a temporary workaround the SAP-DB WWW Service should either 
be disabled or have access to it restricted using appropriate 
network or client based access controls.
