Synopsis
========

AlsaPlayer is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows which could lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

AlsaPlayer is a heavily multithreaded PCM player that tries to utilize
ALSA utilities and drivers. As of June 2004, the project is inactive.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /    Vulnerable    /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/alsaplayer      <= 0.99.76-r3             Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

AlsaPlayer contains three buffer overflows: in the function that
handles the HTTP connections, the GTK interface, and the CDDB querying
mechanism.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit the first vulnerability by enticing a user to
load a malicious URL resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
the permissions of the user running AlsaPlayer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

AlsaPlayer has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
issues. AlsaPlayer users are advised to uninstall the package until
further notice:

    # emerge --ask --unmerge "media-sound/alsaplayer"

==========
