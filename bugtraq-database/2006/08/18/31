Subject: Re: UPDATE vBulletin Version 3.5.4 exploit

If you have the CAPTCHA enabled then the registrations wonï¿½t even go through. This can be enabled via the Admin Control Panel. It's not enabled by default due to extra module requirements in PHP.

The option for CAPTCHA exists in all versions of vBulletin and the majority of customers enable it almost immediately.

Though if you are talking about the flood being allowed in the first place then surely this is something that should be handled at the server level by modules such as mod_evasive.
