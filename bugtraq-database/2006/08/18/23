Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] RE: when will AV vendors fix this???

I'd still argue... If the malicious code is a known variant and
recides in the computer exploiting the stated flaw, here are ppl.
argueing the AV will catch it during execution anyways. BUT there are
many scenerios when ADVANCE HERCULES SCAN, suspecious activity scans
etc are only (mostly) enabled for testing DURING MANUAL SCANS as
having those enabled during auto protect would cause significant
preformance problems. (think of this scenerio again)

& lastly... NOD32  has an option to scan inside ADS too.

guys..... could anyone suggest any AV that isn't buggy to this trick?
