Essentially, the work needed to solve this problem isn't worth the expenditure of time and effort, because the file, in order to infect the system, has to be executed.  Once the file is executed "normal" on-access scanning will catch the exploit *if* it is known.  (If it's unknown, it doesn't matter anyway.)  Yes, on-demand scanning won't "see" the file, but even malicious files are benign until they are run.

The same applies to the On-Demand scanner: it might or might not detect it, even if the *known* malware can still run on a system, as many tricks exists to get the file executed. Here are two articles showing this with ADS, including some test results:

You've got my curiosity now.  Are you saying that no AV product will 
"see" exploit once it enters memory?  Granted, that's one step further 
than on-access, but I thought that all AV products (now) were looking at 
memory for file accesses.
