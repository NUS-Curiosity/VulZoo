Subject: Registration Now Open!: 3rd Annual US OWASP AppSec Conference - Oct 16-18 2006 - Seattle, WA

Registration for the 3rd Annual US OWASP Conference is now open.

It is available at:
http://guest.cvent.com/i.aspx?4W,M3,57a181da-f20b-40fb-80ef-472a647bce7b

OWASP is switching to the use of Cvent to help manage the conference
registration process. Hopefully this will make it easier and a better
experience for everyone. Feedback on this switch is appreciated.

For the moment, we are providing all the conference information on both
the OWASP portal and Cvent at:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006 and
http://guest.cvent.com/i.aspx?5S,M3,57a181da-f20b-40fb-80ef-472a647bce7b

Registration is only available at the Cvent link above. Please register
early. The most important thing is that the conference hotel prices and
availability are only locked in until Sept. 22. After that, the prices
may revert to the conference hotel's normal prices or worse, the rooms
may simply not be available, so please register for the conference and
hotel as soon as possible.

For those flying in, you may be better off without a car as the
conference, the hotels, and the dinner are all within walking distance
of each other and it costs $20+ / night to park your car many places.

Thanks, Dave

Subject: ANNOUNCING: 3rd Annual US OWASP AppSec Conference - Oct 16-18
2006 - Seattle, WA

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce its third annual U.S. Application Security
Conference. This year's conference will be held October 16-18 at the
Bell Harbor International Conference Center right on the waterfront in
downtown Seattle, WA. Please reserve these dates!! The first two
conferences were on the East coast so we felt it was the West coast's
turn. This facility looks to be the nicest facility we have had the
opportunity to use yet.

This conference will include:
- Training (On Oct 16): various 1-day application security courses are
being offered the day prior to the conference
- Main Conference (Oct 17-18) This year's conference will include
presentations and also some panels to help encourage discussion amongst
the attendees
- Evening Social Event (Oct 17) - We are planning a social event as we
do each conference which facilitates the attendees ability to mingle and
get to know each other better.

Current details on the conference are available on the OWASP website at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006

This year's conference will be kicked off with a keynote by Michael
Howard from Microsoft on "The Benefits of the SDL initiative to
Microsoft and its Customers". Mike is a top member of Microsoft's
security team and a coauthor of several application security books
including Writing Secure Code, 2nd Ed., and 19 Deadly Sins of Software
Security. He will be talking about the Microsoft Security Development
Lifecycle (SDL) and the benefits Microsoft has gained by developing and
adopting it.

OWASP's AppSec conferences are dedicated to real-world application
security issues and solutions. You'll learn many aspects of application
security, including people, process, and technology perspectives.

You'll hear presentations on topics like:

  - Web Services Security
  - Securing AJAX Applications
  - The Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle
  - The benefits of various new and enhanced OWASP projects, like:
         - OWASP Software Assurance Metrics
         - OWASP Code Review Standards
         - OWASP Java Project
         - OWASP .Net Project

The two panels are going to be on:
  - Lessons learned from Major Application Security Initiatives
  - What is in your application security toolbox?

The current agenda is available at: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006/Agenda

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a non-profit charitable organization, OWASP has
been able to keep the cost to $400 per seat if you are able to register
prior to Sept. 18, 2006. The cost to OWASP Members is only $350 prior to

Center. Each class is $675 for conference attendees (and includes
lunch). Registration for the courses will be available via the
conference registration page.
