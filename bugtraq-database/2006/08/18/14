*Of course* it's a "security-related" problem.  The solution to that 
problem is what is being discussed.

When data is at rest, it presents no threat to the OS (AFAIK).  It's 
just electrons aligned in a certain, specific way on media.  It's only 
when data enters memory and becomes part of the stream that the 
processor(s) have to act upon that the threat becomes "real".  For data 
to enter memory it must be accessed in some way.  If that access process 
is being monitored and *if* the exploit is known, it will be detected 
and whatever action is specified by the protective software will be taken.

To put it another way, what risk do bombs stored in a concrete bunker 
present?  None, unless they are accessed somehow.  If proper monitoring 
is in place, that will never happen without being detected and prevented.
