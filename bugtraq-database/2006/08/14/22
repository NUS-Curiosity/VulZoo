Subject: Kaspersky Anti-Hacker personal firewall unstealthy stealth mode

Kaspersky personal firewall 1.8.180 in "stealth mode" configuration doesnt detect nor block timestamp and network block ICMP request. They still call it a stealth mode feature, yeah sure ;)

Try: nmap -sP -PE <IP>
     namp -sP -PM <IP>
