	Remember: some years ago "off by one" was treated as useless for 
exploits.

	Any type of data/file hiding (of course, alternate data streams in 
the first place) can become the last brick required for some new attack 
vector.

	So, while currently I can't present any workable scenario, I 
wouldn't consider such type of data hiding as "not a security-relate 
problem".
