YaBB in both versions, 1.0 and 2.0/2.1 are PERL scripts, not PHP
(http://www.yabbforum.com/). Maybe you are talking about YabbSE (the
predecessor of SMF, if I remember correctly)? 

Please post the correct name and VERSION number (plus company
or developer website) of the buggy software you found.

Thanks a lot!


Back to the topic: the YaBB forum scripts written in PERL are (of
course) not vulnerable to the PHP attack shown.

Bye

Volker.
