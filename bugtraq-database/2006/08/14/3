Subject: Informix Long Username Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Informix Long Username Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Systems Affected: Informix 9.40.xC6 and earlier, 10.00.xC2 and earlier
Severity: Critical
Vendor URL: http://www.ibm.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl@...software.com ]
Date of Public Advisory: 2nd August 2006
Advisory number: #NISR02082006A
CVEID: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3853
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/research/

Description
***********
Informix Dynamic Server is a database developed by IBM. During a security 
assessment of the database it was found to be vulnerable to a stack based 
buffer overflow in the authentication procedure.

Details
*******
When an Informix server logs on a user it copies the username to a 260 byte 
stack based buffer without first verifying its length. An attacker can 
exploit this by overflowing this buffer to overwrite the saved return 
address on the stack and thus redirect the process' path of execution to a 
location of their choosing.

Whilst the IBM advisory indicates that only Informix running on Windows is 
vulnerable to this NGS we're able to determine that Informix running on 
Linux is also vulnerable.

Fix Information
***************
IBM was alerted to this flaw on the 6th January 2005; a fix has now been 
made available. IBM's advisory on the matter can be found here:
