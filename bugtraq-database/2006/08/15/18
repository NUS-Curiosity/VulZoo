Use a different Firmware then... Preferably, Sveasoft or DD-WRT

<quote>
The Sveasoft firmware is a replacement firmware upgrade for ASUS,
Belkin, Buffalotech, and Linksys wireless routers.

I wish I could upgrade.  The latest firmware revsion for my router is
1.0.9.
  Your router and mine may have the same name, but there the similarity
ends.  Flip your router over to figure out which hardware revision you
have.
  Mine is the v5.  Yours is probably v4 or earlier.

I'm told that there was a major change in the router between v4 and v5.
v4 and earlier were based on linux.  v5 and later were based on VxWorks.

Linksys appears to have introduced this bug when they made that switch.

Thanks for your testing.
