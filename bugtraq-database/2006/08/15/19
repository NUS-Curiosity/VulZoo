Description
***********
Informix Dynamic Server is a database developed by IBM. During a security 
assessment of Informix multiple file creation/write/read issues were 
discovered.

Details
*******
The LOTOFILE function and rlt_tracefile_set functions can be used to create 
and write to files. The SET DEBUG FILE can also be used to create and write 
to files.


Fix Information
***************
IBM was alerted to this flaw on the 6th January 2005. Patches have now been 
made available; further a workaround is to revoke public execute permission 
of the functions involved. There is no workaround for the set debug file.

NGSSQuirreL for Informix, an advanced vulnerability assessment scanner 
designed specifically for Informix, can be used to accurately determine 
whether your servers are vulnerable to this flaw. More information about 
NGSSQuirreL for Informix can be found here
