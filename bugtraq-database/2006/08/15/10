 Vulnerability

HEYYYY ...
Security FOCUS Moderators please don't add !
cfgLanguage is defined in config.php :
$cfgLanguage	= 'uk';
how can you change $cfgLanguage when it is defined ?
Another Fake BUG Like Mafia Moblog Vulnerability :
MAFIA MoBlog BID : 19458
MAFIA : http://securityfocus.com/bid/19458
Milw0rm And SecurityFocus Moderators :
please don't add File Inclusion Bugs before checking.
sh3ll sh3ll.ir reported another fake bug.
when someone reports fake you shouldn't add.
