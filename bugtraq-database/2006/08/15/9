Subject: RE: ANNOUNCING: 3rd Annual US OWASP AppSec Conference - Oct 16-18 2006 - Seattle, WA

Many more details for the OWASP conference have been settled and are now
available on the OWASP site, including:

1) Most of the agenda is set: See:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006/Agenda

2) Conference hotel discounts have been negotiated and I'd strongly
recommend making your reservations early as many of the rates expire
after Sept 15. And downtown Seattle hotels are expensive so locking in
the conference rates will be helpful.

See:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006#Accommodations

3) The dinner event is now planned for Anthony's Pier 66, right near the
conference center.

See:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006#Evening_Social_
Event_-_Oct_17th

4) All the pricing details are now on the site as well, repeated from
the message below. See:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006#Conference_Fees

The only thing missing is opening registration for the conference :-(
Due to unforeseen difficulties with our credit card processing accounts,
we haven't been able to open registration yet. It SHOULD be open in the
next 2-3 days. I'll send out another announcement when registration is
open. In the mean time, I'd recommend booking your hotel and flights to
lock in advanced pricing!!!!

Thanks, Dave

Subject: ANNOUNCING: 3rd Annual US OWASP AppSec Conference - Oct 16-18
2006 - Seattle, WA

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce its third annual U.S. Application Security
Conference. This year's conference will be held October 16-18 at the
Bell Harbor International Conference Center right on the waterfront in
downtown Seattle, WA. Please reserve these dates!! The first two
conferences were on the East coast so we felt it was the West coast's
turn. This facility looks to be the nicest facility we have had the
opportunity to use yet.

This conference will include:
- Training (On Oct 16): various 1-day application security courses are
being offered the day prior to the conference
- Main Conference (Oct 17-18) This year's conference will include
presentations and also some panels to help encourage discussion amongst
the attendees
- Evening Social Event (Oct 17) - We are planning a social event as we
do each conference which facilitates the attendees ability to mingle and
get to know each other better.

Current details on the conference are available on the OWASP website at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006

This year's conference will be kicked off with a keynote by Michael
Howard from Microsoft on "The Benefits of the SDL initiative to
Microsoft and its Customers". Mike is a top member of Microsoft's
security team and a coauthor of several application security books
including Writing Secure Code, 2nd Ed., and 19 Deadly Sins of Software
Security. He will be talking about the Microsoft Security Development
Lifecycle (SDL) and the benefits Microsoft has gained by developing and
adopting it.

OWASP's AppSec conferences are dedicated to real-world application
security issues and solutions. You'll learn many aspects of application
security, including people, process, and technology perspectives.

You'll hear presentations on topics like:

  - Web Services Security
  - Securing AJAX Applications
  - The Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle
  - The benefits of various new and enhanced OWASP projects, like:
         - OWASP Software Assurance Metrics
         - OWASP Code Review Standards
         - OWASP Java Project
         - OWASP .Net Project

The two panels are going to be on:
  - Lessons learned from Major Application Security Initiatives
  - What is in your application security toolbox?

The current agenda is available at:
