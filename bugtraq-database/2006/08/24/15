Subject: EEYE: Internet Explorer Compressed Content URL Heap Overflow Vulnerability

Internet Explorer Compressed Content URL Heap Overflow Vulnerability

Release Date:
August 24, 2006

Date Reported:
August 17, 2006

Severity:
High (Code Execution)

Systems Affected:
Internet Explorer 6 SP1 with MS06-042 - Windows 2000
Internet Explorer 6 SP1 with MS06-042 - Windows XP SP1

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a heap overflow vulnerability in
the MS06-042 cumulative Internet Explorer update that would allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system of a victim who
attempts to access a malicious URL. Only Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP1
systems running Internet Explorer 6 SP1 with the MS06-042 patch applied
are vulnerable.

The heap overflow occurs when URLMON.DLL attempts to handle a long URL
for which the web server's response indicated GZIP or deflate encoding.
This means that the user interaction requirement for this attack is
negligible, since clicking a hyperlink, visiting a malicious web page,
or even attempting to view an image for which the source is a malicious
URL, permits exploitation of the vulnerability.  Furthermore, the
attacker is not required to control a web server in order to serve up a
specially-crafted response, since any compressed response -- even an
error message -- is sufficient to cause the overflow, regardless of its
content.

Technical Details:
URLMON.DLL version 6.0.2800.1565, distributed with the MS06-042 patch
for Internet Explorer 6 SP1 on Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP1, contains
a heap buffer overflow vulnerability due to an incongruous use of
lstrcpynA.  CMimeFt::Create allocates a 390h-byte heap block for a new
instance of the CMimeFt class, within which there is a 104h
(MAX_PATH)-byte ASCII string buffer at offset +160h:

    1A4268DD    push    390h            ; cb
    1A4268E2    call    ??2@...AXI@Z    ; operator new(uint)

When an access to a URL elicits a GZIP- or deflate-encoded response from
the web server, CMimeFt::Start will attempt to copy the URL into the
104h-byte string buffer using the lstrcpynA API function, but it passes
a maximum length argument of 824h (2084 decimal), a value typically used
as the maximum length of a URL:

    1A426199    push    824h            ; iMaxLength
    1A42619E    push    eax             ; lpString2
    1A42619F    add     esi, 160h
    1A4261A5    push    esi             ; lpString1
    1A4261A6    call    ds:lstrcpynA

As a result, fields within the CMimeFt class instance as well as the
contents of adjacent heap blocks can be overwritten with
attacker-supplied data from the malicious URL.

URLMON.DLL in the MS06-042 patch for Internet Explorer 5 uses MAX_PATH
both as the buffer size and as the maximum copy length, while URLMON.DLL
in the patch for Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003 uses 824h in both
places.

This issue was originally documented as an Internet Explorer crash in
Microsoft Knowledge Base Article KB923762
(http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=923762; Revision 2.0 as of August
21st), in response to numerous reports of conflicts between the MS06-042
patch and various HTTP-based software products, dating back to at least
August 11th. eEye independently discovered the flaw on August 15th and
subsequently reported it to Microsoft on the 17th.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.
Blink Endpoint Vulnerability Prevention preemptively protects from this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
Microsoft has released a new version of the MS06-042 patch to correct
this vulnerability. The revised patch is available at:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS06-042.mspx.

Note that installing the original release of the MS06-042 update causes
a system to become vulnerable, so the version 2.0 release of the
MS06-042 patch will need to be applied in order to secure that system.

Systems with the hotfix described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article
KB923762 (http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=923762) applied are not
susceptible to this vulnerability, although the MS06-042 v2.0 patch
should still be installed on these systems.
