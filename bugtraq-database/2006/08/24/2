Vendor: VistaBB (http://www.vistabb.net)
Version: 2.033 and prior versions must be affected.
About: Via this methods remote attacker can include arbitrary files to 
VistaBB.Variable phpbb_root_path did not sanitized properly before using it 
on includes/functions_mod_user.php and includes/functions_portal.php so 
remote attacker can include internal and external files to VistaBB
For including internal files magic_quotes_gpc must be off on server settings 
because remote attacker needs to use null char at the end of filename.
Eg: /etc/passwd%00
Level: Highly Critical
