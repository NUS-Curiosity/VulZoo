Is this <http://www.open-sef.org/>?
Which version did you test?

In the actual Version (2.0.0-RC5_SP2) you could see

/** Ensure this file is being included by a parent file */
defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or die( 'Direct access to this location is not
allowed.' );

at the top of the file, so it's impossible to call it
directly and manipulate any variable.
