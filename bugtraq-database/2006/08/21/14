 Vulnerability

I made this script a long time ago and actually I donï¿½t use it anymore (I use a newer version which is not ready for "the real world" yet). By accident I discovered this page when I showed someone how many hits you will get when you google on your own name.

You say "Venedor Contacted, But No Response", but I haven't seen a mail about this, or it was disguised as spam..... and I removed it.

But I made a quick update (remove the language option) and placed it on my site (http://matthijs.draijer.org/download.php?id=35)
