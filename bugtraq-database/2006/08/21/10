[ Introduction ]

  (*) 2wire Gateway User Interface: It Work with the Modems / Routers 
of 2Wire, Inc., it take the work out of manage a local network. 
the Users see important information about the DSL connection, 
devices on the network, firewall logs, and more. Optional notification 
features let users know if there is a problem and guides them to a fix.

  (*) CRLF: It's a special character or sequence of characters 
signifying the end of a line of text.

   [Char] [ Complete name ] [Hex]  [ascii]
     CR  = Carriage Return = \0A  =  10
     LF  = Line_Feed       = \0D  =  13
 
[ Explanation ]

When a evil request is maked and sended at 2wire Webserver
and this can't process the request, result as a Denegation 
of service (DoS).
The error comes at the moment of include a End_of_line (CRLF)
into any variable, when we're using a GET method it's 
imposible (inside a normal situation), but, it's really true?..
