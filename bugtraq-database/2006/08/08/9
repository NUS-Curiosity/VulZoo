Description:
    In previous versions of the mysql package, there is no option to disable
    the MERGE storage engine, which can lead to a various vulnerabilities if
    a user's privileges are revoked on a target table but not on a MERGE
    table that references it.  In this version of the mysql package, the
    mysql server has a new "--skip-merge" option that disables the MERGE
    storage engine, which can be used to limit exposure to this potential
    weakness.  Using the "--skip-merge" option also limits functionality,
    and it should not be enabled without consideration for local usage
    requirements.
