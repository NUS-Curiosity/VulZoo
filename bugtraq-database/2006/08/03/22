Note about Drupal 4.7.3 and custom themes or JavaScript
-------------------------------------------------------

A bug in the form API theme layer made it possible to have an ID occur more
than once in a page. This invalidates the HTML, makes styling with CSS hard
or impossible, and can break JavaScript. A patch was committed to ensure
unique IDs. 
This patch has a side-effect that IDs for hidden form fields in your site's
HTML will change. You might need to adapt your custom CSS or JavaScript, if
it refers to such a changed ID.
