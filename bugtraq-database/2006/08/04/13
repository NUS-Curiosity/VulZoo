Title: CA eTrust Antivirus WebScan vulnerabilities

CA Vulnerability ID (CAID): 34509

CA Advisory Date: 2006-08-03

Discovered By: 
Matt Murphy of the TippingPoint Security Research Team

Impact: Remote attacker can execute arbitrary code.

Summary: Ca eTrust Antivirus WebScan is a free, web-based virus 
scanner that is located at 
http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/virusinfo/scan.aspx.  CA eTrust 
Antivirus WebScan v1.1.0.1047 and earlier contains vulnerabilities 
that can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or 
compromise the integrity of the WebScan software.  The first 
vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate parameters.  
The second vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in WebScan.  
Matt Murphy has identified multiple attack vectors that exploit 
these vulnerabilities.

Mitigating Factors: Exploitation of these vulnerabilities is 
non-trivial.

Severity: CA has given this vulnerability a Medium risk rating.

Affected Products:
CA eTrust Antivirus WebScan v1.1.0.1047 and earlier

Affected platforms:
Internet Explorer 4.0 or above on Microsoft Windows

Status and Recommendation: 
CA eTrust Antivirus WebScan v1.1.0.1048 addresses all of the 
vulnerabilities.
Visit http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/virusinfo/scan.aspx and 
allow Internet Explorer to install the new webscan.cab software.  
Note that the software is digitally signed by CA.
Alternatively, you can simply remove an older, vulnerable object
by using one of these two methods:
a)  Start Internet Explorer, and then select "Tools" > "Internet 
Options" > "General" tab.  On the "General" tab, click on the 
"Settings" button in the "Temporary Internet Files" section.  On 
the "Settings" dialog window, click on the button labeled "View 
Objects" and then right-click on the "WScanCtl Class" object and 
select the "Remove" option.
b)  Open an Explorer window and browse to 
"<system>\downloaded program files".  Then right-click on the 
"WScanCtl Class" object and select the "Remove" option.

Determining if you are affected:
Browse to the C:\WINDOWS\Downloaded Program Files or 
C:\WINNT\Downloaded Program Files folder and check the version 
number of the "WScanCtl Class" object.  If the version number is 
less than 1,1,0,1048, you need to update the ActiveX control.
Another way to determine if you are affected is to Start Internet 
Explorer, and then select "Tools" > "Internet Options" > "General" 
tab.  On the "General" tab, click on the "Settings" button in the 
"Temporary Internet Files" section.  On the "Settings" dialog 
window, click on the button labeled "View Objects" and then check 
the version of the "WScanCtl Class" object.  If the version number 
is less than 1,1,0,1048, you need to update the ActiveX control.

Note that v1.1.0.1045 is the last version that was widely 
distributed.
