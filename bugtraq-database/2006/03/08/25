Subject: a worm for mediaWiki??


Hi,
i've noticed a strange thing on MediaWiki that i used sometimes.
The highlight word on the varius articoles on mediaWiki was replace
with strange string like this:
NaodW29-pre1dc0e53c28ac067d00000016

For look this on google see here:
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=NaodW29&btnG=Search

Is this an 0days mass exploit??

Bye
