Once the first request to the nameservers is made, the object should be 
cached by the nameservers.  Instead of one packet to each server, consider 
a stream of packets to each server.  The recipient will recieve a stream 
of 100K answers with likely only 200K of traffic back to the attackers DNS 
server.

Or better, find some random authoritative nameserver with a big DNS 
record, and then a very small portion of the attackers traffic is used and 
it is less likely to be tied back to the attacker since they don't own the 
record being requested.
