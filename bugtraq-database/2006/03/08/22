About D2KBlog :
--------------------
Free, open-sourced, full featured asp+access blog .

Vulnerability:
--------------------
SQL_Injection:
Input passed to the "memName" parameter in 'profile.asp' via the cookie is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
Successful exploitation extracts username and password of administrator.
Script Insertion:
Input passed to the "msg" field in 'default.asp' isn't properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious user data is viewed.

Proof of Concepts:
--------------------
SQL_Injection :
Cookie : memName=[SQL_Injection]

Script Insertion :
Default.asp , POST : name=KAPDA&email=KAPDA&msg=<script>alert("XSS")</script>&submit=Send+Message

--------------------
