Subject: Critical Risk Vulnerability in L-Soft Listserv


Peter Winter-Smith of NGSSoftware has discovered a number of vulnerabilities
in L-Soft's LISTSERV list management system. The worst of these carries a
critical risk rating.

Affected versions include:

- LISTSERV version 14.4, including LISTSERV Lite and HPO
- LISTSERV version 14.3, including LISTSERV Lite and HPO

And possibly all prior versions of LISTSERV which are installed with the web
archive interface, which is currently the default installation behaviour.

The vulnerabilities which have been fixed can, in the worst of cases, allow
a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system
hosting the LISTSERV archive web interface.

This issue has been resolved in the latest release of L-Soft LISTSERV
(version 14.5), which may be downloaded from:

http://www.lsoft.com/download/listserv.asp
http://www.lsoft.com/download/listservlite.asp

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details of this flaw for three months.
Full details will be published on the 3rd June 2006. This three month
window will allow users of L-Soft's LISTSERV the time needed to apply the
patch before the details are released to the general public. This reflects
NGSSoftware's approach to responsible disclosure.
