A first impact Proof of Concept is to use imagemagick tools with gocr to 
have a good image.
I've used colors level input: 31 0.11 160 (you can use gimp too to see 
the effects) to have a white background and black (or most like black 
:P) foreground.
Later i've used gocr with djpeg in pipe (see gocr -h to understand 
better) and i've obtained the famous number.
I've already writed a perl software to send sms to cantv mobiles and not 
is soo hard to implement this last operations, but not is public this 
latest version because i do for myself.

Good work, to the advisors. But i think that everyone that have a not so
