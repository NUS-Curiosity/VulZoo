My phpBB is 2.06, however, when I implement the script to test the vulnerability of my site, there is no result coming out, is that means that my website is OK?

Besides, what do we need to change of the value of these serizable string in order to make it work?

What is the difference between "a:1:{s:0:"";s:4:"test";}" and";a:1:{i:0;s:8:"aaaaaa";}s:7:"s??

Cheers
