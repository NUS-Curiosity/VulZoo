Synopsis
========

tetris-bsd is prone to local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

bsd-games is a collection of NetBSD games ported to Linux.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-misc/bsd-games      < 2.17-r1                    >= 2.17-r1

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered that
the checkscores() function in scores.c reads in the data from the
/var/games/tetris-bsd.scores file without validation, rendering it
vulnerable to buffer overflows and incompatible with the system used
for managing games on Gentoo Linux. As a result, it cannot be played
securely on systems with multiple users. Please note that this is
probably a Gentoo-specific issue.

Impact
======

A local user who is a member of group "games" may be able to modify the
tetris-bsd.scores file to trigger the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of other players.

Workaround
==========

Do not add untrusted users to the "games" group.

Resolution
==========

All bsd-games users are advised to update to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-misc/bsd-games-2.17-r1"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:

Concerns?
=========

Security is a primary focus of Gentoo Linux and ensuring the
confidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost
importance to us. Any security concerns should be addressed to
security@...too.org or alternatively, you may file a bug at
