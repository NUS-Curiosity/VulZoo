Subject: Re: Secunia Research: Microsoft Internet Explorer "createTextRange()"Code
 Execution


Internet Explorer 6 on XP SP2 portuguese seems not vulnerable to code execution, thatï¿½s what I conclude after several tests on 4 machines. the vulnerability exists, but it causes IE to crash after some time and Windows alerts about low virtual memory. some times while IE was frozen and windows alerting about low virtual memory, some applications could not be run till IE got completely terminated.
