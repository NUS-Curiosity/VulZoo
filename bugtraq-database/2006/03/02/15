Subject: RE: Evil side of Firefox extensions


A lot of problems can be chalked up to user error but we all need to
face the fact that users do not click No.  People are conditioned to
just click Yes/Ok/Next no matter what; even when they know better.  Even
home users would be better off with the feature enabled.  If they had to
enter a password, they'd at least have to think for two seconds before
they installed the extension.

In an office environment, administrators could prevent most users from
installing their own extensions (although determined users might find a
way).

This is definitely a good idea, although I don't think it should be a
compulsory feature (optional would be nice). If more people than just
you have access to a machine at the end of the day there's no way to
guarantee security. This is just another method of stealing information
like a keylogger would (although admittedly, more intelligent).
This isn't so much a bug as it would be user error (in my opinion), you
choose what extensions you want to install and if you're foolish enough
to install an extension from an untrusted source then you can expect
horrible things to happen.
