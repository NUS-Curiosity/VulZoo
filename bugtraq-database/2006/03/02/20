[ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS]

Detail and PoC :
--------------------

The application does not validate the "lid" variable upon submission to ratelink.php(*) and ratefile.php.

h**p://[target]/public/modules/mylinks/ratelink.php?lid={number}">[code]

h**p://[target]/public/modules/downloads/ratefile.php?lid={number}">[code]

--------------------
(*)ratelink.php was later found to be vulnerable too.
