Subject: Re: recursive DNS servers DDoS as a growing DDoS problem


Here are some dns servers I gathered/scanned during the time I researched
this months ago(that appear to still be up):

68.1.199.151
68.1.196.116
68.1.195.161
68.1.193.177

Just remember when you test/capture packets that the domain being
resolved must NOT exist(ie. "x").

So, for example one request to a DNS server that sends 24 dups back would roughly equal 60x(24*2.5) amplification of data.
