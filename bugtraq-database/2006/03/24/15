Vulnerabilitiy found in comodo hacker guardian free scan.

http://www.hackerguardian.com/

After trying their service, I have noticed a few bugs in the site that could 
lead to their free scan service to be used for purposes that it is not 
intended for. I have created a webpage detailing the problem:

As a security company I'm sure they understand the risks that these bugs pose.

I have contacted hacker guardian but have yet to receive a reply.
