Subject: Re: [ GLSA 200603-23 ] NetHack, Slash'EM, Falcon's Eye: Local privilege escalation


Hello everyone.

Doesn't the included text from the advisory really make it sound more like a 
problem with their system for managing games?  It doesn't point out any flaw 
in nethack in general, just behavior that's unexpected/unwanted/uncontrollable
in their system. 

Are any other distributions/platforms vulnerable to a problem in nethack like
this?  Sounds like it'd be big news, considering the install base of these
games.  

If this problem is on their end, are other games/applications able to trigger
it?

They've essentially wiped these fundamental applications (sorry) off their
tree for the time being, that's pretty severe.

Does anyone have any insight into this?  I'm a big nethack fan..

Thanks.
