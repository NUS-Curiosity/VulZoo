The documentation is distressingly vague.

Theo,

this is not about paying or not paying, it is not about owing somebody
something, but about sensible disclosure of security problems to the
world.

Sendmail has been an important part of the Internet infrastructure and
has gained a lot of honour and respect.  Many people use this piece of
software and a lot of distributors/vendors are proliferating this
software.  They do deserve better, as do the users who decide to trust
this vendor.

Maybe this is indeed the way to go.  There are several other
feature-rich mail transport agents.
