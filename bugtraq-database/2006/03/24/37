After or before it hit the news? You may be able to alert vendors, but
the problem with critical infrastructure is that is widely deployed around
the world. Releasing the way you did is irresponsible.

You can do non-disclosure for a while or full disclosure, you can't do
both.

Indeed. And yet blaming the user is not how you solve the problem, is it?
The Internet being insecure is a give, do you blame the Internet for
telnet not being secure, or do you create SSH?

How long before enough Sendmail servers globally are patched?

I agree, my point is that if you release, do it as soon as you can as you
ARE critical infrastructure. If you want to let vendors get something
done, wait a whole lot longer than a month.
