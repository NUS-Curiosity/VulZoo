HPSBUX02101 SSRT051128 rev.1 - HP-UX VirtualVault running Apache
1.3.X Remote Unauthorized Access

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted
upon as soon as possible.

Release Date: 2006-03-01
Last Updated: 2006-03-15

Potential Security Impact: Remote unauthorized access

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company,
        HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A security vulnerability has been identified in Apache HTTP
server versions prior to Apache 1.3.34 that may allow HTTP
Request Splitting/Spoofing attacks, resulting in remote
unauthorized access.

References: Apache HTTP Server version 1.3.34 announcement

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.04 running Virtualvault 4.7 or Virtualvault 4.6 or
Virtualvault 4.5.

BACKGROUND

The Apache Software Foundation (http://httpd.apache.org/) and the
Apache HTTP Server Project have announced the release of version
1.3.34 of the Apache HTTP Server:

 "Of particular note is that 1.3.34 addresses and fixes 2
  potential security issues:

    * If a request contains both Transfer-Encoding and
      Content-Length headers, remove the Content-Length,
      mitigating some HTTP Request Splitting/Spoofing attacks.

    * Added TraceEnable [on|off|extended] per-server directive to
      alter the behavior of the TRACE method."

Note: To determine if a system has an affected version, search the
output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset" for an affected fileset.
Then determine if the recommended patch or update is installed.
