What he is basically saying is that you hold no right whatever 
to demand it.

The "International Infrastructure's" need doesn't constitute 
a claim on Sendmail or its developers.  As Theo stated, if 
that's unacceptable, buy software with a commercial license 
(which would then give you the right to demand that trust, as 
included in the license).
