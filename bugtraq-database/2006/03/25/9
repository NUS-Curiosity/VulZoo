No, he said: "I am up to the challange and I will do my best." If he 
couldn't he would have been responsible enough to say "I can't."

If he stayed anyway and would have not been up to task (which he was), 
he would have been seriously attacked as well and maybe even it would 
have been taken from him.

At this point I should probably not Paul is critical to DNS and a big 
part of bind, but he would be the first to say bind and DNS are not 
*his*. I think it's great he's around.

I personally appreciate OpenSSH, yet you keep insisting on saying on 
this thread that because it is free you shouldn't be held responsible, 
be expected to do anything or even worse, be expected to work on this 
unless you get paid.

Maybe you should change your moto about being the most secure OS around?

No one expects you to follow our procedures, heck, we are not the guys 
who re-coined "responsiuble disclosure" (which was a cool invention at 
first) as "work with us in our way or you are not responsible".

There are *no* procedures, you are held to your conscience. That said, I 
am sure you know how to be responsible.

On critical Internet infrastructure, which is global, there should be. 
No one country can make them.
