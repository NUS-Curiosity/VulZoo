I would imagine that a number of people have been following this
discussion... and the technical issues have been well covered by
people more conversant with the software involved than am I.

I'd just like to say thanks to Theo, Paul and Eric for the effort
and hours they've worked on the products being discussed.. and
hope that more people would do the same.


Observation to the opposing side:

Being kind: the complaints being voiced appear to lack merit or
substance... which causes people to wonder what the real point of
them is...

You're way past looking a gift horse in the mouth.

Maybe it's a good time to stop?
