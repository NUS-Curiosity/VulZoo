There is no flaw in nethack that we're aware of, this is an interaction
between nethack and the policy used for managing games on gentoo that
results in a security problem.

Unlikely, gentoo uses a non-standard method of installing games, that is
very unlikely to be used elsewhere.

Yes, Gentoo does not use the standard setgid system for games that store
system-wide high scores, save games, etc, and as a result anyone can
manipulate the high score tables or save games.

Nethack was simply not designed to work this way and does not expect
users to be able to modify it's state data arbitrarily, and as a result
makes assumptions about the format of the files that may not hold true
on Gentoo.

We have decided to temporarily revoke these packages while these issues
are resolved.

Thanks, Tavis.
