It's a security issue. He who controls the dns server controls you, yes?

Ok we are talking about locking down DNS like we locked down smtp relay. So
if you want to send a mail today can you just use any smtp server you want
or are you severly limited, possibly by a port 25 block which forces you to
use just your ISP's mail smtp server?

Don't you think creating a control point like that is dangerous? Especially
dangerous when it's DNS which runs virtually every function on the internet?

It's not a conspiracy theory, it's fact, if you create a control like that
someone is going to want to control it. I suggest only that we consider this
along with everything else.
