If we have access to another user ~/ why installing root kit and not use
some trivial attack ? like path attack as example or clean exec ?
installing a root kit on monitored system will yell alarms. as i
previously said if we have access to another user ~/ we have full access
to all privileges that this user have.
the main issue here is how we get access to the user ~/

about the local virus ..
in the example given by the author we compromise the user A which have
sudo to root
if we have knowledge of the target system we can easily make automated
program that compromises other users accounts but .. /there is always
but/ in order to compromise other users we will need bigger privs than
the user that we attack or some system wide exploit /which is sort of
bigger privs/. then if we have those privs why bothering writing a
automated program and not compromise them at once ?

the only scenario that this is useful is if we have a user A which can
execute commands in the context of a user B which can execute commands
in context of root
in that case if we have a way to compromise user A's ~/ then we can make
some automated program that gathers information ,even have some
predefined logic about handling some commands enabled in /etc/sudoers,
 and then exploit it. but thats a very rare case.

p.s.
sudo to root without pass ... c'mon you have to be kidding me, right ?
