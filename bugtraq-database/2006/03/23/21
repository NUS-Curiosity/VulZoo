ISS Multiple Products Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.23.05
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=403
March 23, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Internet Security Systems (ISS) has developed a suite of tools aimed at
securing server and desktop systems. A flaw exists within a central
module to these components that can allow unprivileged users to obtain
complete control of the machine.

   http://www.iss.net/products_services/products.php

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a design error in the multiple Internet Security
Systems (ISS) products may allow a user to gain System level privileges.
Exploitation of this issue is trival and can be done manually.

This exploit has been confirmed in ISS BlackIce 3.6 product and is
reportedly also found in the following products:

- BlackICE PC Protection (Consumer)
- BlackICE Server Protection (Consumer)
- BlackICE Agent for Server (Corporate)
- RealSecure Desktop 3.6 and 7.0 (Corporate)

To exploit this condition you must first trigger an action that would
initiate the Application Protection Module to display a warning. For the
BlackIce product, this can be initiated by launching any executable
moved or installed after the product itselft was first installed.

 From the "Application Protection" dialog press the "More Info" button
with will bring up a secondary form. With this form active, pressing the
F1 key will bring up the standard Windows Open File dialog prompting the
user to manually locate the help file for the application.

The problem arises when the BlackIce process fails to drop
permissions before launching the help dialog. If a user resets the
dialog file mask by entering *.exe [enter] they can then launch any
executable on the system from the dialog by right clicking on it and
choosing "open". Applications run in this manner will be executed with
System level rights.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as the System Administrator user. This allows complete system
compromise including the installation and removal of applications, and
ability to read and write any file on the system.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability exists in version 3.6 of ISS
BlackIce PC Desktop for Windows with all current updates applied.

V. WORKAROUND

There is currently no known work around for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

for and a free upgrade from BlackICE Agent for Server.  There are no
other ISS products that use the components described."
