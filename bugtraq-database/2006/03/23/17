Subject: Vulnerability Alert Services - Independent List


Hello

Love them or loathe them, commercial vulnerability alert services which
report salient detail from lists such as Bugtraq and Full Disclosure fulfil
a valuable security function to many organisations.

We would like some help in updating the vendor agnostic view of all
vulnerability alert services (good, bad & ugly) at
http://www.securitywizardry.com/alert.htm as we are now looking for an alert
service ourselves we need to update the page, if you know of any other
services that we don't have (below) please contact us off list.

One kind hearted supplier was providing us a free feed with which we
verified the information on our vulnerability radar
http://securitywizardry.com/radar.htm However, following the publicised
visit to the NSA by President Bush http://www.securitywizardry.com/about.htm
the feed was withdrawn.  Thus far we have details on:

Symantec Deepsight Alert Services
SecurityMob
FrCIRT
iAlert Web
TraceAlert
SecurityTracker
Cybertrust Vulnerability/Threat Management
Vulnerability Tracking Service
X-Force Threat Analysis Service
http://www.securitywizardry.com/alert.htm

As mentioned please reply off list if you wish to add to the list of
providers, if there is sufficient value in the changes I will post a
summary, otherwise the page will remain available
