Synopsis
========

Format string vulnerabilities in IMAP Proxy may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code when connected to malicious IMAP servers.

Background
==========

IMAP Proxy (also known as up-imapproxy) proxies IMAP transactions
between an IMAP client and an IMAP server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/up-imapproxy       < 1.2.4                      >= 1.2.4

Description
===========

Steve Kemp discovered two format string errors in IMAP Proxy.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could design a malicious IMAP server and entice
someone to connect to it using IMAP Proxy, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code with the rights of the victim user.

Workaround
==========

Only connect to trusted IMAP servers using IMAP Proxy.

Resolution
==========

All IMAP Proxy users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/up-imapproxy-1.2.4"

References
==========
