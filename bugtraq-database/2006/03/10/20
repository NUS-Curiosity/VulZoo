Synopsis
========

flex might generate code with a buffer overflow, making applications
using such scanners vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

flex is a programming tool used to generate scanners (programs which
recognize lexical patterns in text).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-devel/flex      < 2.5.33-r1                      >= 2.5.33-r1

Description
===========

Chris Moore discovered a buffer overflow in a special class of
lexicographical scanners generated by flex. Only scanners generated by
grammars which use either REJECT, or rules with a "variable trailing
context" might be at risk.

Impact
======

An attacker could feed malicious input to an application making use of
an affected scanner and trigger the buffer overflow, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

Avoid using vulnerable grammar in your flex scanners.

Resolution
==========

All flex users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/flex-2.5.33-r1"
