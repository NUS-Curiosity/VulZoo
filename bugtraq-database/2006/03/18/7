Yes, and a number of people have confirmed this problem thus far
(including the author of the initial reply to my post). I did not test it
on Windows 98, however, and I cannot (nor want to) comment on its memory
management antics.

Yes, I can. The instructions I provided are *not* a prerequisite to
overwrite memory. They're merely a recommendation to make the PoC reliably
crash your browser, should you want to confirm the problem independently
without much research.

I have all reasons to believe that this problem *is* exploitable without
having to talk anyone into it - having mshtml.dll render a specially
crafted webpage or a sequence of meta-refresh webpages is very much
sufficient.
