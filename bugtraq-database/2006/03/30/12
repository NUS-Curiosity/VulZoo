uh... caching maybe?... the second field of your answer section when using

no, its not, and it doesnt require that all internet sofware be rewritten, 
it means that they either need to be
recompiled, or just have the dynamicly linked library they use for dns 
resolution to be replaced..

i think its pretty obvious that locking down dns servers at least brings the 
DNS attacks down to the same problem weve always had..
that being good old fashioned udp packeting. and at that point.. why bother 
using dns..
