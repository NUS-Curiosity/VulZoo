Subject: [DRUPAL-SA-2006-003] Drupal 4.6.6 / 4.5.8 fixes
	session fixation issue

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drupal security advisory                                  DRUPAL-SA-2006-003
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advisory ID:    DRUPAL-SA-2006-003
Project:        Drupal core
Date:           2006-03-13
Security risk:  less critical
Impact:         hijacking
Where:          from remote
Vulnerability:  session fixation attack
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------
If someone creates a clever enough URL and convinces you to click on it, and
you later log in but you do not log off then the attacker may be able to
impersonate you.

Versions affected
-----------------
All Drupal versions before 4.6.6.

Solution
--------
The fix to this issue requires PHP 4.3.2 or higher, which is higher than the
minimum requirements for the Drupal 4.5.x branch. If you are still running 
an older version of PHP, you must upgrade it or this issue will not be
fixed.

If you are running Drupal 4.5.x then upgrade to Drupal 4.5.8.
If you are running Drupal 4.6.x then upgrade to Drupal 4.6.6.
