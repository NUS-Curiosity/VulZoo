Now, the proper way to exploit this is to craft a record in a zone you
control, that is some 4 kibibytes large, and have the spoofed query use
EDNS0 (RFC2671) and advertise a willingness to receive such a large
message. Much better payback. 

This is not anything artificial, it is based on actual attacks. Go and
restrict your recursing name servers to answering queries from your own
networks -- we are now, and this makes me sad, at a point where SMTP was
1994-5, open relays were at times regarded as a good utility. No such thing
today, and I think DNS will take the same route. 

Do this limitation soon, but with care and afterthought, so as not to
create a walled garden. What we do not want is packet filters as a panic
measure. We want the end nodes to be sturdy in themselves. Like other
spoofing attack countermeasures, this is a measure that will protect your
neighbours more than yourselves, so do it for the good of others.
