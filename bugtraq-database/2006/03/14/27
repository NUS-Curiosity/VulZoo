Subject: High Risk Vulnerability in Microsoft Excel


Peter Winter-Smith of NGSSoftware has discovered a high risk vulnerability
in Microsoft Excel which may allow an remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code on a user's system via the Internet Explorer Excel plugin.

This issue has been resolved in the Microsoft bulletin MS06-012, which may
be downloaded from:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-012.mspx

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details of this flaw for three months.
Full details will be published on the 14th June 2006. This three month
window will allow users of Microsoft Excel the time needed to apply the
patch before the details are released to the general public. This reflects
NGSSoftware's approach to responsible disclosure.
