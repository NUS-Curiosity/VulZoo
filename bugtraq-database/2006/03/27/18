 recovery attack


Hi,

- As has been pointed out, this is a BETA release, so it's a bit, er, inelegant to describe this as a flaw in 3.0. Guess I'll have to bump the release number when we fix this...

- At least this is an implementation flaw, as opposed to the format design flaw that the good folks at ElcomSoft found last time...

  Cheers,

        Rony
