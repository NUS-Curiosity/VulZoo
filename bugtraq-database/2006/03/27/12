Synopsis
========

OpenOffice.org contains a vulnerable version of libcurl that may cause
a heap overflow when parsing URLs.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an office productivity suite, including word
processing, spreadsheet, presentation, data charting, formula editing
and file conversion facilities. libcurl, which is included in
OpenOffice.org, is a free and easy-to-use client-side library for
transferring files with URL syntaxes, supporting numerous protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/openoffice-bin       < 2.0.2                  >= 2.0.2
  2  app-office/openoffice         < 2.0.1-r1              >= 2.0.1-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

OpenOffice.org includes libcurl code. This libcurl code is vulnerable
to a heap overflow when it tries to parse a URL that exceeds a 256-byte
limit (GLSA 200512-09).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to call a specially crafted URL with
OpenOffice.org, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.0.2"

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.0.1-r1"
