Subject: WLSI - Windows Local Shellcode Injection - Paper


Hi.

For those who didn't attend to Black Hat Europe nor
EuSecWest, here is the paper on which the presentation
was based.


WLSI - Windows Local Shellcode Injection

Abstract:
This paper describes a new technique to create 100%
reliable local exploits for Windows
operating systems, the technique uses some Windows
operating systems design weaknesses
that allow low privileged processes to insert data on
almost any Windows processes no matter
if they are running under high privileges. We all know
that local exploitation is much easier
than remote exploitation but it has some difficulties.
After a brief introduction and a description
of the technique, a couple of samples (Exploits for
MS05-012 and MS05-040) will be provided so the reader
will be able to write
his/her own exploits.

Enjoy.
