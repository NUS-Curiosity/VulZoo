Subject: Re: Arin.net XSS

ok?

So what exactly are you going to exploit here?  This site doesn't have any logins or even use cookies.  Are you going to trick a user into entering in a credit card number before they can search the whois database?

I think that XSS in many instances is a serious issues.  Many of the XSS issues reported on FD are rarely of much consequence but could theoretically lead to a sessions hijack or tricking the user into a fake login screen.  However, in this instance I fail to see what the point could possible be?  If it is that you can simply run javascript then so what?  Close to 100% of any webhosting provider on the internet will let you upload your own javascript.  Might as well report that geocities.com is vulnerable to XSS because you could upload an html file with javascript on it.

Anyway.. that's my take on this.  Feel free to correct me.. I don't mind.

Steven

  Subject: [Full-disclosure] Arin.net XSS 


  Title
  ARIN.NET input validation holes in "?queryinput=" allows remote users conduct cross-site scripting attacks

  Notification
  Multiple attempts to contact Arin site administrators went unanswered

  Exploit Included:  Yes

  Description
  The "?queryinput=" script does not properly validate user-supplied input in several parameters to filter HTML code. A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. 

  Some demonstration exploit URLs are provided:
