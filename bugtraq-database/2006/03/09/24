It looks like strings starting with NaodW29 are being used internally by 
the wiki engine as part of it's normal business.  Several posts from 
Nov/Dec 2005 suggest that certain changes may have caused the wiki 
engine to expose these internal strings.  It appears, at least on the 
surface, to be a simple bug.
