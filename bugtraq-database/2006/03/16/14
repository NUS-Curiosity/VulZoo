Daniel followed up with me in private and confirmed that the PoC *did*
work for him when he followed certain additional instructions: because the
attack depends on memory layout and usage, to get consistent results, be
sure to close *all* MSIE windows, then go to Start -> Run... and type:

  iexplore http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/iedie.html

That should crash the browser immediately, because there are no other
buffers nearby to "absorb" the initial fencepost. Still, if no dice, try
hitting 'Reload' a couple of times.
