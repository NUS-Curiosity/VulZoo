I. BACKGROUND

Milkeyway is a software for the management and administration of
internet access within public structures and frameworks, where
the service supplying must be submitted to a scrupulous inspection.

II. DESCRIPTION

Nearly all SQL queries are vulnerable to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
There are also some XSS vulnerabilities.

III. ANALYSIS

Since there are 28 detected different vulnerabilities only an
abstract will be included in this mail, please refer to the complete
advisory aviable here:

2) add_userIp() SQL INJECTION
3) updateTimeStamp() SQL INJECTION
4) authuser.php USER DELETE SQL INJECTION
5) delete_user() SQL INJECTION
6) authuser.php MODIFY USER modify_user() SQL INJECTION
7) authuser.php MULTIPLE XSS
8) authuser.php EDIT SQL INJECTION
9) authuser.php RELEASE USER SQL INJECTION

26) chgpwd.php SQL INJECTION 1
27) chgpwd.php SQL INJECTION 2
28) logout.php SQL INJECTION

IV. DETECTION

Milkeyway 0.1 and 0.1.1 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Input validation will fix the vulnerability.
Magic quotes ON will protect you against most of these injections
except chapter 11 (authuser.php ORDERING SQL INJECTION) where the
input has no single or double quotes around, making magic quotes
useless.

11) SQL is injectable by $_GET['filter']

---------------- in authuser.php -----------------
$orderingFilter = $_GET['filter'];
if ($orderingFilter == '') $orderBy ="order by uname ASC" ;
else $orderBy ="order by ".$orderingFilter." ".$direction;
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM authuser ".$orderBy );
--------------------------------------------------
