Subject: Announcement: Domain Contamination By Amit Klein


The Web Application Security Consortium is proud to present 'Domain Contamination' written 
by Amit Klein. In this article Amit discusses how an attacker who's hijacked a domain for a
short period of time can still retain control of its audience long after the domain is 
returned to its rightful owner.
