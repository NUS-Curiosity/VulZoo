Subject: memory leak in IE?


I've tried the following code in IE on XP SP2 and it appears there is a
memory leak.  It could potentially lead to a dos.  Interestingly I tried
the same code with a very large status message and the leak seemed to
slow down.  

Strange.



<HTML>
<Body>
<script language="JavaScript">
       setInterval("x()",5); 
       function x(){window.status= "My website is important... boomkark
me!"}
</script>
This sample eats about 4K of memory per second.
</Body>
</HTML>
