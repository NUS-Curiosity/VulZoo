Subject: iDefense Labs Quarterly Hacking Challenge


iDefense Labs is pleased to announce the launch of our quarterly hacking
challenge. Going forward, on a quarterly basis, we will select a new
focus for the challenge and outline the rules for vulnerability
discoveries that will qualify for the monetary rewards.

For the current quarter, iDefense Labs will pay $10,000 for each
vulnerability submission that results in the publication of a Microsoft
Security Bulletin with a severity rating of critical. In order to
qualify, the submission must be received by midnight EST on March 31,
2006. The $10,000 prizes will be paid out following the publication of
the Microsoft Security Bulletin and will be paid in addition to any
amount paid for the vulnerability when it is initially accepted.
