Determining CAM versions:

Simply running camstat will return the version information in the 
top line of the output on any platform. The camstat command is 
located in the bin subfolder of the installation directory.

The example below indicates that CAM version 1.11 build 27 
increment 2 is running.

    E:\>camstat
    CAM - machine.ca.com Version 1.11 (Build 27_2) up 0 days 1:16

Determining the CAM install directory:

Windows: the install location is specified by the %CAI_MSQ% 
environment variable
Unix/Linux/Mac: the /etc/catngcampath text file holds the CAM 
install location
