Black Hat Federal 2006 news:
Black Hat Federal generated a large amount of interest from the
press and blog world. The presentations were more paranoid in nature,
dealing with topics from root kits to reverse engineering and
physical 
memory forensics. Read the stories at Slashdot, Washington Post,
SecurityFocus, the Register, Government Computer News, and others.
