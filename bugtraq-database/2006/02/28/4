               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mod_auth_pgsql package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:177326
Issue date:        2006-02-27
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2005-3656
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated mod_auth_pgsql package that fixes a format string flaw is now
available.

The mod_auth_pgsql package is an httpd module that allows user
authentication against information stored in a PostgreSQL database.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

Several format string flaws were found in the way mod_auth_pgsql logs
information. It may be possible for a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code as the 'apache' user if mod_auth_pgsql is used for user
authentication. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
assigned the name CVE-2005-3656 to this issue.

Please note that this issue only affects servers which have
mod_auth_pgsql installed and configured to perform user authentication
against a PostgreSQL database.

All users of mod_auth_pgsql should upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
