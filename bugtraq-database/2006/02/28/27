Subject: Re: Mozilla Thunderbird : Multiple Information
	Disclosure Vulnerabilities


Hello,

If you carefully look at the inline attachments, you will find this
(first proof of concept) :

<html><head></head><body style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border:
0px;"><iframe src="http://www.sysdream.com" width="100%" height="100%"
frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe>

The information disclosure doesn't come from the first iframe, but from
the second one. Indeed, the inline attachment "basic.html" itself
contains a iframe, which is not correctly filtered and makes Thunderbird
fetch any external resource.


Best regards,
