Just got half a dozen bounces because my plain-text email supposedly
contained "Suspicious I-Frame.a (Malicious Mobile Code) virus". Those of
you behind McAfee GroupShield barriers may not be getting the whole
conversation here if people can't even use words like i-frame in plain
text without being suppressed as a virus.

(remove the hyphen in i-frame throughout)
