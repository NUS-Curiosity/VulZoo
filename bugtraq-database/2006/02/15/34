Subject: Openwall GNU/*/Linux (Owl) 2.0 release


Hi,

For those few who don't know yet, Openwall GNU/*/Linux (or Owl) is a
security-enhanced operating system with Linux and GNU software as its
core, intended as a server platform.  More detailed information is
available on the web site:

	http://www.openwall.com/Owl/

After many Owl-current snapshots, Owl 2.0 release is finally out.  The
major changes made since Owl 1.1 are documented:

	http://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES-2.0.shtml

Owl 2.0 is built around Linux kernel 2.4.32-ow1, glibc 2.3.6 (with our
security enhancements), gcc 3.4.5, and recent versions of over 100 other
packages.  It offers binary- and package-level compatibility for most
packages intended for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (RHEL4) and Fedora Core 3
(FC3), as well as for many FC4 packages.

Additionally, Owl 2.0 uses our new installer, making installation a lot
easier than it used to be for Owl 1.1 and below.

The new release (including an ISO-9660 image for the CD) can be freely
downloaded from our FTP mirrors:

	http://www.openwall.com/Owl/DOWNLOAD.shtml

or it can be ordered on a CD with delivery worldwide:

	http://www.openwall.com/Owl/orders.shtml

Of course, we prefer the latter, but it's your choice.  Similarly, you
may choose to pay just what it costs to get the CD to you, or you may
also support our project.

Owl CDs are bootable on x86 and include a live system, x86 binary
packages for installation to a hard drive, and full source code which
may be rebuilt with one simple command ("make buildworld").

Owl 2.0 binary packages for SPARC and Alpha (EV56+) are available via
the FTP mirrors only.

PGP-signed mtree(8) specifications for all of the above are available
via FTP and in the root directory of Owl CDs (such that you don't even
have to blindly trust CDs you receive in the mail).

The 1.1-stable branch is now officially unsupported, in favor of the
2.0 release and its corresponding stable branch.  Owl 2.0-stable already
exists in the CVS repository and will also be made available via FTP
once the need arises (that is, once an important post-release fix is
applied).
