Hi
I sent him an email about his bugs and exploits.
He asked me to add him in his ICQ.
I told him I dont have and I gave him my msn and he added me.
He asked me if I want the exploits I have to pay 500$.
I said how and he gave me a site for transfring money.
I told him I cant. I said if you want me to transfer money by paypal I will do.Then, he said yes. I told him do you have an account and he replied No. I opend an account for him, new account and gave him the password.He asked me to send money. I did :)
I sent him 500$. Then he disappeared and he gave me nothing.
He thinks he took 500$ :)
He doesnt know anything and he is from russia and his langauge is broken.
This is the result:
We got a new king of rippers but this time by caiming that the have new exploits and they will sell it.
