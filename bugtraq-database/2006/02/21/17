 ---------------------------------------------------

This issue was originally (?) discovered by Yuan Qi who posted it on
Bugzilla [1] on 11th November 2004 [2]. I rediscovered this
vulnerability on 1st October 2005 and reported it several weeks later
to the Mozilla Software Foundation [3] because I did not find any
advisory or bugzilla post about this problem..

I decided to release an advisory about this DoS vulnerability, even
though it's an old issue.

o Description:
=============

The award-winning Web browser is better than ever. Browse the Web
with confidence - Firefox protects you from viruses, spyware and
pop-ups. Enjoy improvements to performance, ease of use and privacy.

Visit http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ for detailed information.

o Denial of Service:
===================

Following HTML code forces Firefox to crash:
> <frameset></frameset>
> <table><p><form><map><dl><table><small>

Online-demo:
