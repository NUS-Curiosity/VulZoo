Subject: [BUGZILLA] Security Advisory for Bugzilla 2.20, 2.21.1, and 2.18.4


Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers three security bugs that have recently been
discovered and fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ The 'whinedays' and 'mostfreqthreshold' parameters are not correctly
  validated in editparams.cgi. The first one can lead to SQL injection.

+ Escaped HTML markup in titles of RSS feeds are incorrectly decoded by
  some RSS readers and could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

+ The login form on the home page, in conjuction with very specific
  configuation settings and a specially formed URL, may redirect you
  outside the Bugzilla installation, allowing the login name and password
  to be stolen.

All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.20.1.

Development snapshots of 2.21 before 2.22rc1 are also vulnerable.
If you are using a development snapshot, you should upgrade to 2.22rc1,
use CVS to update, or apply the patches from the specific bugs listed below.

None of these vulnerabilities affect the old Bugzilla 2.16.x versions.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
-------
Class:       SQL injection
Versions:    2.17.1 and above
Description: The 'whinedays' parameter, editable from editparams.cgi,
             is not validated before being saved. This can lead to SQL
             injection in the whineatnews.pl script. This injection
             requires administrative privileges.
             The validation for the 'mostfreqthreshold' parameter is also
             missing, but this is not exploitable.

Issue 2
-------
Class:       Cross Site Scripting
Versions:    2.20rc1 - 2.20, 2.21.1
Description: Some RSS readers incorrectly decode escaped HTML markup in
             feed titles and this could be used to inject some scripts.
             Although this is not a Bugzilla bug, we prefer to shift to
             Atom feeds, where the RFC is unambiguous about HTML markup
             in feed titles.

Issue 3
-------
Class:       Sensitive Data Exposure
Versions:    2.19.3 and above
Description: When the Bugzilla login page is at a subdirectory of the web
             server and the subdirectory name is a resolvable host on the
             victim's local network, it is possible to craft a URL that,
             when used to login to Bugzilla, would send the user's
             credentials to this host.
             These conditions make this flaw very difficult to exploit.
