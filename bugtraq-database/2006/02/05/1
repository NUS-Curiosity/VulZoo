Subject: cPanel 10 mime/handle.html XSS Vulnerability

mime/handle.html of cPanel 10 is vulnerable to an XSS vulnerability. This
can be leveraged by entering an injected html into the extension and/or
mime-type specified. I sucesfully leveraged this issue causing the page to
execute the code <script>alert('hi')</script> each time.

Content of type "text/html" skipped
