Synopsis
========

The GStreamer FFmpeg plugin is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may
be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The GStreamer FFmpeg plugin uses code from the FFmpeg library to
provide fast colorspace conversion and multimedia decoders to the
GStreamer open source media framework.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                           /  Vulnerable  /     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg     < 0.8.7-r1       >= 0.8.7-r1

Description
===========

The GStreamer FFmpeg plugin contains derived code from the FFmpeg
library, which is vulnerable to a heap overflow in the
"avcodec_default_get_buffer()" function discovered by Simon Kilvington
(see GLSA 200601-06).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run an application using the
GStreamer FFmpeg plugin on a maliciously crafted PIX_FMT_PAL8 format
image file (like PNG images), possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GStreamer FFmpeg plugin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg-0.8.7-r1"
