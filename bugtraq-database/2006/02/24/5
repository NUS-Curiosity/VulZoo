1. Topic:

An updated firefox package that fixes several security bugs is now
available.

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance and portability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

Igor Bukanov discovered a bug in the way Firefox's Javascript
interpreter derefernces objects. If a user visits a malicious web page,
Firefox could crash or execute arbitrary code as the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the
name CVE-2006-0292 to this issue.

moz_bug_r_a4 discovered a bug in Firefox's XULDocument.persist()
function. A malicious web page could inject arbitrary RDF data into a
user's localstore.rdf file, which can cause Firefox to execute arbitrary
javascript when a user runs Firefox. (CVE-2006-0296)

A denial of service bug was found in the way Firefox saves history
information. If a user visits a web page with a very long title, it is
possible Firefox will crash or take a very long time the next time it is
run. (CVE-2005-4134)

Users of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
