But if there really *was* a hole that allowed an actual break-in they
would have to do that anyway, because they wouldn't know if anyone had
broken in before and just wiped his tracks, would they?

Crispin, please, I expressly said that I do agree with Paul on that
part.

I do not (fully) agree on this part, though. I already gave some reasons
why, e.g. when is one authorized to use a machine? Plus, I do not
believe that companies which won't secure their servers properly (thus
putting themselves and/or their customers at risk) should be protected
by the law in this way. This kind of jurisdiction would encourage people
to care less about security than they already do, because if someone
breaks in, they will be able to sue him.

The OBSOC system is AFAIK closed source and the Deutsche Telekom would
not go to the trouble of putting up a test system for public testing.
The person who broke in was an actual customer. I repeat my question: Do
you really believe that this person should be prosecuted? Should he have
ignored the problem instead, leaving the other customers at risk?
