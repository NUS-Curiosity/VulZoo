Synopsis
========

noweb is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local
user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

noweb is a simple, extensible, and language independent literate
programming tool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/noweb      < 2.9-r5                            >= 2.9-r5

Description
===========

Javier Fernandez-Sanguino has discovered that the lib/toascii.nw and
shell/roff.mm scripts insecurely create temporary files with
predictable filenames.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary file
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
an affected script is called, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the script.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All noweb users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/noweb-2.9-r5"
