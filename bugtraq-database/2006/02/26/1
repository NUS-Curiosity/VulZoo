Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in GraphicsMagick allows attackers to crash the
application and potentially execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GraphicsMagick is a collection of tools to read, write and manipulate
images in many formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/graphicsmagick       < 1.1.7                   >= 1.1.7

Description
===========

The SetImageInfo function was found vulnerable to a format string
mishandling. Daniel Kobras discovered that the handling of "%"-escaped
sequences in filenames passed to the function is inadequate in
ImageMagick GLSA 200602-06 and the same vulnerability exists in
GraphicsMagick.

Impact
======

By feeding specially crafted file names to GraphicsMagick an attacker
can crash the program and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GraphicsMagick.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GraphicsMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/graphicsmagick-1.1.7"
