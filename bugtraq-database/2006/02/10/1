HPSBTU02095 SSRT051007 rev.2 - HP Tru64 UNIX Running DNS
BIND4/BIND8 with Forwarders: Remote Unauthorized Privileged Access

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted
upon as soon as possible.

Release Date: 2006-02-06

Potential Security Impact: Remote unauthorized privileged access

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company,
        HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential vulnerability has been identified on the HP Tru64 UNIX
operating system running DNS BIND4 or BIND8 when used by DNS
Forwarders. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely to gain
unauthorized privileged access to the DNS clients.

References: http://isc.org/sw/bind/bind8.php

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
The following supported versions of HP Tru64 UNIX are affected:

    * HP Tru64 UNIX 5.1B-3
    * HP Tru64 UNIX 5.1B-2/PK4
    * HP Tru64 UNIX 5.1A PK6
    * HP Tru64 UNIX 4.0G PK4
    * HP Tru64 UNIX 4.0F PK8

BACKGROUND

The Internet Software Consortium's (isc.org) Berkeley Internet
Name Domain (BIND) is a popular DNS server used on many operating
systems including Tru64 UNIX.

- From the Internet Software Consortium's web site
http://www.isc.org:

  BIND4/BIND8 Unsuitable for Forwarder Use

  If a nameserver -- any nameserver, whether BIND or otherwise --
  is configured to use "forwarders", then none of the target
  forwarders can be running BIND4 or BIND8. Upgrade all
  nameservers used as "forwarders" to BIND9. There is a current,
  wide scale Kashpureff-style DNS cache corruption attack which
  depends on BIND4 and BIND8 as "forwarders" targets.

Due to architectural limitations BIND4/BIND8 will never be
suitable for use as a forwarder target. BIND9 should be used
instead.

RESOLUTION

HP has released the following Early Release Patch kits (ERPs)
publicly for use by any customer. The ERP kits use dupatch to
install and will not install over any Customer Specific Patches
(CSPs) that have file intersections with the ERP.

The ERP kits distribute the following items:

    * The BIND9 release
    * BIND9 manpages
    * Upgraded bindconfig application to support BIND9
      (5.1B-3, 5.1B-2/PK4, and 5.1A PK6 only)
