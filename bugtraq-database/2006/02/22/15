Well, to me it's not quite so clear.

A portscan is a probe to find out what services a publicly available
machine provides towards the Internet. I entirely fail to see what's
hacking about that, much less illegal hacking.

That's ridiculous. Did you actually read what that case was about?
Besides, how am I invited to use a website? How am I invited to send
e-mail to someone (i.e. use their mail server)? You just asked for the
Internet to be shut down.

Whether they could or couldn't hire someone to do the testing is not the
point here. A customer noticed the vulnerability, and exploited it to
confirm it was real. Do you really believe he should be prosecuted for
that?

You didn't answer the first question: is one supposed to not notice
this kind of things? Do I have to trust that companies do their job
properly, even if there's evidence that they don't? You can't be serious
here.
