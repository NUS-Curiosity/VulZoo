Subject: Multiple Injection Vulnerabilities in PHP PEAR::Auth Module

PRODUCT:
    PEAR::Auth Authentication Module Package
    http://pear.php.net/package/Auth

VERSIONS AFFECTED:
    All versions < 1.2.4
    1.3 series < 1.3.0r4

DESCRIPTION:
    Multiple injection vulnerabilities exist in the PEAR::Auth module.
    Some of the PEAR::Auth Container back ends do not fully validate
    input from the user before presenting it to the underlying
    authentication mechanisms.  This allows a malicious user to
    perform injection attacks against the underlying authentication
    mechanism in order to falsify authentication credentials.

    2006.02.08 - Other developers contacted
