South River WebDrive Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

     ---Summary---

     Software  Affected: South River WebDrive
     Software Versions Tested:  6.08 build 1131
     Vendors URL:        http://www.webdrive.com
     Vulnerability Type: Boundary Condition Error
     Credit:             Discovered by Adrian Castro
     Proof of Concept:   None Provided
     Attack Vector:      Local
     Threat Level:       Medium

     ---Vendors Product Description---

     WebDrive is more than just an FTP Client. By connecting to WebDAV, FTP, or SFTP servers through a virtual drive, files are transferred by simply saving them to a drive letter. There's no need to run a separate FTP client interface. Unlike typical FTP clients, WebDrive lets you open and edit server-based files without the additional download step.

To install WebDrive on Windows NT/2000/XP you must have administrator privileges.  Once installed you can use WebDrive from any NT user account.

    ---Vulnerability Description---

     The name entry field in WebDrive is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to a programming error.  The name field allows for 257 characters to be copied to a 256 character buffer.  Successful exploitation causes the program to fail, and behave erratically/crash on future runs of the program.

This vulnerability affects WebDrive 8 running on Windows 2000 SP4, and Windows XP Professional SP2. Other versions of WebDrive and Windows may also be affected.

   ---Solution---

   None at this time.
