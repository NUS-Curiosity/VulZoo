That's silly.  Researchers know full well how to do this without ever 
breaking any laws.  In fact, most of the best researchers who are finding 
the bugs and weaknesses in systems never breakin to any system not owned by 
them.

To me there is not.  They're my systems.  Stay out, thank you very much.

If you want to learn how to hack, set up your own network, install some 
OSes, with various patch levels, and hack away.  You can learn everything 
you need to know without ever touching a system you do not own.  Get your 
buddies involved.  Hack each other's boxes.  But do not hack into systems 
that do not belong to you.  That *should* be illegal and you *should* be 
prosecuted.

> Now, I'm not saying that I support accessing computer systems illegally.

Yes, you are.  You're talking about breaking in to systems that you do not 
have permission to enter.

And you're wrong.  I don't have to hack into someone else's equipment to 
know how to hack into things.

That's because you have tunnel vision.  You think the only way to learn to 
hack is to attempt to break in to someone else's equipment.

Do locksmiths break in to random houses to learn their craft?

Oh, well that gives me great comfort.  Never mind that I can be prosecuted 
for the breakin because I've violated a law such as GLB, HIPAA, etc. by 
"allowing" a breakin.  I'm glad your friends are so "ethical".  If you only 
think about what's in it for you, you'll always be slanted toward violating 
the law.  Try thinking about the poor victim whose systems you're breaking 
in to.  Put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself, how would I feel if I 
discovered that someone had entered my systems without my knowledge?  Or 
bettter yet, how about if I reach in your pocket and take the keys to your 
car, take it out for a spin, then return it?  Are you OK with that?  No 
hard feelings?
