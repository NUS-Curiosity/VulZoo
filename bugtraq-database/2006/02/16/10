I am very sorry. It was definitely not my intention to offend you.
Yet I appear to have offended you, or even worse apparently
somehow provoked you.

I am not willing to enter into some sort of dual with you.
I don't know the `rul35` of such an engagement.
So I politely decline your invitation.
If it is required of me, I acknowledge defeat by your superior
skills and knowledge.

I believe you do an injustice to the community spirit of this list.
I honestly have no doubt that you know more about
security etc. than I do.
Your actions however show how little you know of human nature.

I make no demands, and definitely no threats.
Should you decide to retaliate against me, you will cost me time
and money that I do not have to spare.

I think it would be a very empty victory.

I would like to believe that you are a better man than that,
despite your previous post.

Your actions will show your nature.

I am not shamed by any part of my attempt to take part in this
community.

I regret it.
