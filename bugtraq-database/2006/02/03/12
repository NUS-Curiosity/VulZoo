Subject: AOL Instant Messenger Version 5.9.3861 Local Buffer Overrun
 Vulnerability


As I submitted to full disclosure:

"I have discovered that there is a buffer overrun vulnerability in AOL's Instant Messenger program. I have only tested this on version 5.9.3861. The problem causes a minimum of a program crash. I am not sure as to the posibility of shellcode execution.

The vulnerability can be exploited by supplying an overly large username from which to obtain "buddy info."

If you are unsure as to what I am talking about, I can post a screenshot." 

Well, I made a Macromedia Captivate-made video of it. http://www.dotshell.net/aim.swf. What I am thinking is that a program can be written to write an overlong string and shellcode to the address effected and execute the same operation to leverage the problem.
