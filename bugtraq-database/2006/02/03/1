"worm"?

Raises two questions -- one about your understanding of a very simple 
security concept and another about the moderator's choice of items, as 
your post is purely a self-promoting (?) piece of fluff devoid of 
significant security implications...

And the universal GIF-parsing vulnerability it exploits to spread is?

That's right -- there isn't one.

Nor is there even such a vuln limited to one more or less popular web 
browser or similar application possibly used for handling/viewing such 
image files...

So, it's the blog equivalent of the notoriously vicious ".sig virus"...

Yep, and that is much the same risk as the possibility of a spammer or 
some other similarly unscrupulous sleaze-oid (like your typical 
adware/spyware pusher) finding (or buying) that same 0-day .GIF-
rendering sploit and deploying it through their own "distribution 
channels".

In short, there is no new or extended threat here...

Well that's nice and reassuring, isn't it??

No -- folk with a few functioning brain cells will have immediately 
recognized, as did I, that it not a worm, therefore it cannot be a self 
mutating one.

And, of course, even fewer functioning brain cells are needed to work 
out that it is Robin Schuil who "mutates" the .GIF at the end of the 
static link this whole silly farce depends on, so it certainly is NOT a 
_self_ mutating anything...

One may tempted, at this point, to draw a conclusion about the quality 
of journalists employed by news.com/C|Net, but as doing so in print may 
not please the list moderators (or at least, may agitate their lawyers 
were the moderators to accept such a posting), one will resist...
