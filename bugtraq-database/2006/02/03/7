When this problem was (to my knowlegde) first published in December 1998,  
this was called the "Cookie Monster Bug". See  
http://help.netscape.com/kb/consumer/19981231-1.html (the original  
advisory page is gone).

The problem about the two internal dot rule for ccTLDs is that many ccTLDs  
are using a flat structure similar to the generic .com TLD, not a  
hierarchical structure like the one used by the .UK domain. To make  
matters worse, many ccTLDs are actually using a combination of the two  
structures.

As far as I know there is no reliable algorithmic way to determine if a  
domain name is a valid domain (like company.tld) or a subTLD (like co.uk).  
One method could be a blacklist for common subTLDs like co.tld, com.tld,  
ac.tld, etc., but it is dificult to make such a list complete, and some  
ccTLDs also have multilevel subTLDs and also uses geographic names in such  
second level domains, e.g. city.state.us, and many countries have national  
names for their subTLDs. Last time I checked http://www.govcom.org/  
indicated that at least half of the ccTLDs had some form or hierarchical  
structure, but an unknown percentage of these are using a hybrid structure.

Opera's current approach (which is not perfect) is to use a DNS lookup for
non-generic (only those in Netscape's original list are considered generic  
in this context) that are either second level domains or two levels up  
 from the server setting the cookie. If there is an IP address defined for  
the domain name, the cookie is accepted for the domain, otherwise it is  
only accepted for the server
setting the cookie.

We are investigating ways to improve on this method, but as far as I can  
tell, any improvement will require a coordinated effort by all the gTLD  
and ccTLD registries.

In Opera this domain would be handled as described above, with a DNS  
lookup, and since ".com." will not resolve the cookie will only be  
accepted for the server setting the cookie.

RFC 2965, which is supported by Opera, already specifies such an extension  
to the cookie format. See http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt for more  
details.
