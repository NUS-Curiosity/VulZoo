February 23, 2006

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2005-3525

-- Affected Vendor:
Adobe Macromedia

-- Affected Products:
Macromedia Shockwave Installer

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since November 22, 2005 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 3934. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Macromedia Shockwave. Exploitation
requires the target to visit a malicious web site.

This specific flaw exists within the ActiveX control with CLSID
166B1BCA-3F9C-11CF-8075-444553540000. Specifying large values for two
specific parameters to this control results in an exploitable stack
based buffer overflow. Due to the nature of this vulnerability, the
target user is not required to have fully completed an installation of
Shockwave to be vulnerable.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has fixed the issue in the Shockwave Player ActiveX installer.
Since the vulnerability occurs in the installer, no action needs to be
taken by current Macromedia Shockwave Player by Adobe customers.
Customers downloading and installing the latest Shockwave Player are no
longer vulnerable with the updated Shockwave Player ActiveX installer.
