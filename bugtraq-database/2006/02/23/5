W00t! DEF CON 14 is now in effect! The Call for Papers is open.

This is a short announcement to let everyone know that we are opening the call
for papers for DEFCON 14 - the annual gathering of subversive computer folks. 
Earlier submissions are given higher priority, so prepare your best kung-foo
grip, and send it our way.  Remember, we are always looking for original and
highly technical content, unusual subject matters, software releases,
innovative hardware hacking, and generally mind-blowing content. Check out past
convention archives to get an idea of what we are talking about.

DEF CON 14 will be August 4-6 at the Riviera Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Did
you notice that? It's a new hotel this year!
See www.defcon.org for more general information. A more complete announcement
will be released in a month or so with details of contests and content.
