Hi,

We're looking for other speakers for our annual ISESTORM event
(www.isestorm.org) from April 1 - 8. This is our third event 
which we do at cost and it will take place in Barcelona, Spain 
again at La Salle University (La Salle URL). We are inviting 
speakers to talk about experiences within the security 
business according to the various class topics.

ISESTORM is for the student to learn to walk the walk in the 
real world of security while walking out with 3 independent 
security certifications. It applies the BS7799/ISO27001 with 
the OPSA and the CISSP CBK over 6 days of study. Each day, an 
industry expert presents or discusses with the students 
topical areas in security such as a technology or a regulatory 
compliance that will enrich the student's know-how for dealing 
with such issues in the workplace.

We have some speakers already but would like to open up the 
invitation for more. We can pay travel expenses for those 
interested. This is also a good opportunity for anyone who 
wants to get more familiar with the OPST or OPSA (or of course 
just see Barcelona).

Please let me know by next week if you are interested and some 
details about the topic.

Sincerely,
-pete.
