The problem is, there's no such thing as a domain which is,
or which is not "clearly and obviously bogus". There won't
be internationally applicable rules (i.e., blacklists and
whitelists) that describe the "validity" of domain names.
What if there actually exists a company called paypal
unlocking (TM) somewhere in the remote outskirts of a tasmanian
village? We simply can't build security mechanisms which rely
on domain names. That has been, and still is, the
major problem with protocols like SSL/TLS which are
otherwise technically sound.

Cheers,

	Stefan.
