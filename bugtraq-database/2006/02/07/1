Seeing what accounts people are trying to log into is also important.
I'm sure that most administrators would be interested in seeing, for
example, login attempts on a deleted ex-staff member's account.

OpenSSH tries to be idiot proof against stupid syslogds by stripping 
control characters from log strings, but you can always invent a 
bigger (hypothetical) idiot.

If your log processing software is so fundamentally broken that it
passes unmodified data to shells, SQL servers or HTML then nothing is
going save you - you will need to ensure that every piece of software
that logs can never be cajoled into writing something that could be 
misinterpreted.

This destroys useful information and lessens the evidentary value of 
the log file. A better prevention:

chmod 0600 /var/log/authlog

(assuming it isn't already).
