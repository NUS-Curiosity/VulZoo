I responded to this yesterday, but for some reason it didn't make it to 
the list.  So, second try.

protection.php doesn't exist in dotProject.  There is no 'siteurl' 
parameter used anywhere in dotProject.

Note that you state that register_globals must be turned ON, and you 
state this is the default.  register_globals has been deprecated in PHP 
since 4.1.0 and the default has been OFF since 4.2.0.

With register_globals turned off none of these attacks are possible. 
Our installation instructions clearly state that register_globals is a 
security risk and it should be turned off.  Even the check.php script 
you refer to later checks this and reports it as a security risk.

Both of these files are provided for installation support.  Neither of 
them are required for the running of dotProject.  The installation 
instructions state that you should remove or secure this directory for 
maximal security.  They are provided in order to display that information.

And this is all explained in the installation instructions, where is the 
need for this post?

Incorrect.  You contacted us on 28th, (a Saturday), we discussed with 
the devs and responded to you on the 2nd of Feb, which you fail to note 
here, and you never got back to us.
