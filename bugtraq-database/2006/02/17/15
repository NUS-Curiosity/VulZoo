A user with active admin privileges must be tricked into clicking on a
carefully crafted url in order to set up this attack.  It can only be
used to execute PHP files on the local system, so the attacker must
contrive some other way to get the PHP file onto the server before it
can be used, therefore this advisory is not a "remote file execution" as
mentioned in the subject line.
