Subject: SNORT Incorrect fragmented packet reassembly


Snort 2.4.3 has a bug in processing fragmented ip packets which has ip options. frag3 preprocessor of snort skips [ip_option_length] bytes from end of the ip options when reassembling packet, thus allowing anyone to evade ids.

Guys at snort.org already informed and are fixing the problem.
