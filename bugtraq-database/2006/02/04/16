This is a meaningless distinction. No matter how many components a
domain has, subdomains can still be delegated to distinct entities.

For a university, should the student union website be sent cookies set
by the registrar's site?

If an ISP gives each customer a subdomain, should customers be sent
each other's cookies? Does it matter how many components the ISP's
domain has?

[The correct answer to all of the above is "no".]

The whole concept of trying to infer boundaries from the domain is
broken by design. At least with the ancestor/descendent case, the
administrators of the parent domain could alway redirect the entire
domain to their own server, so you aren't really losing anything by
allowing cookies to travel up or down the tree. But any mechanism
which allows cookies to be transferred to "sibling" domains is
fundamentally flawed.

Any improvement will require that browsers only pass cookies to
domains which are explicitly permitted by the setter, and pass the
setter domain to all recipients alongside the cookie. IOW, a protocol
change. Anything else is papering over the cracks.
