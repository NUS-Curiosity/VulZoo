The mwcollect Alliance has been launched today. The mwcollect Alliance
is a non-profit community effort to collect autonomously spreading
malware and share with anti-virus and vulnerability researchers. Malware
is collected with the mwcollect Malware Collection Daemon
(http://www.mwcollect.org/) which has been released in v3.0.3 today.

To gain access to the Alliance's Malware Database, one has to apply for
Alliance participation and frequently contribute samples by deploying
own sensors. Application is only granted, if a trusted identity can be
etablished and the applicating individual has sufficient reputation.

More detailed information on joining can be found on
https://alliance.mwcollect.org/?join , information on the Alliance in
general can be found on https://alliance.mwcollect.org/ .


Best Regards,

Georg 'oxff' Wicherski
mwcollect Alliance Founder
