why do we need this?

you're referring to what already takes place commercially.

"hi i want a security assessment".

who's going to do these assessments for free? who confirms that the
people doing the assessment know what they are doing?

"Customer: I was hacked .." -> me: -> "David Litchfield told me it was
secure, blame him" -> "David Litchfield: Oh no, our VAAL is just a
guide." -> "Customer: So why the hell do I care about it then?"

Guides for people to use are okay (hello OWASP Guide, and others) but
all your trying to start is a non-commercial free security assessment
service.
