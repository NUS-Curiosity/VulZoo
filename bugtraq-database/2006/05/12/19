Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0026

Package names:	   kernel
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-05-12
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 3.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of
  your Trustix Secure Linux operating system. The kernel handles the 
  basic functions of the operating system: memory allocation, process 
  allocation, device input and output, etc.

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: An error in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP) code that uses incorrect state table entries when certain
    ECNE chunks are received in CLOSED state, could be exploited by
    attackers to cause a kernel panic via a specially crafted packet.
  - An error exist when handling incoming IP-fragmented SCTP control
    chunks, which could be exploited by attackers to cause a kernel
    panic via a specially crafted packet.
  - Linux SCTP (lksctp) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (infinite recursion and crash) via a packet that contains
    two or more DATA fragments, which causes an skb pointer to refer
    back to itself when the full message is reassembled, leading to
    infinite recursion in the sctp_skb_pull function
  - Linux SCTP (lksctp) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (deadlock) via a large number of small messages to a receiver
    application that cannot process the messages quickly enough, which
    leads to "spillover of the receive buffer."
  - A vulnerability has been identified due to an input
    validation error when processing arguments containing backslash
    ("\\") characters passed to certain commands (e.g. "cd"),
    which could be exploited by authenticated attackers to escape
    chroot restrictions for a CIFS or SMBFS mounted filesystem.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-2271, CVE-2006-2272, CVE-2006-2274,
    CVE-2006-2275 and CVE-2006-1864 to these issues.
