Subject: Kenshoto Report: IIS 6.0 Remote Exploit PoC


Once again ...
kenshoto will be running the Defcon Capture the Flag contest in 2006.
This year's CtF will be a knock-down-drag-out-cyberninja war, the 
likes of which the world has never seen (except maybe last year).

For the qualifying round, we've widened the scope from last year. With
multiple challenges in various categories, there's something for 
every hacker, regardless of skillset (except running scripts and writing
perl).

The core skill for this contest will be finding vulnerabilities in
software. Those of you who have avoided playing in CtF because you
think it is for lamers, we bet you can't find all our vulnerabilities.

Teams will still need to defend a server, and will need to be able to 
exploit the vulnerabilities they find. As last year, the vulnerabilities
will be 100%-custom, so leave your nessus, metasploit and core impact
bullshit at home.

There will be a qualifying round, which will start on Friday, June 9th 
at 10:00 PM EDT. Only 8 teams will qualify. Last year's winners,Shellphish, are automatically qualified (leaving 7 team slots), unless  they too decide to play in the qualifying round, in which case they willstill need to place in the top 8.             

Registration is currently open at http://kenshoto.com/quals/ 

We encourage anyone (even individuals) to attempt to qualify, even if as a learning experience. We intend quals to be enjoyable for everyone,regardless of your plans for Defcon. Challenges will range wildlyin difficulty from Mitnick to Eagle we've got it all.Good luck... you're going to need it.
