CVE-2006-1463

-- Affected Vendor:
Apple

Apple QuickTime versions prior to 7.1

TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since March 20, 2006 by Digital Vaccine protection

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's QuickTime media player.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of H.264 content. The
implicit trust of a user-supplied size value during a memory copy loop
allows an attacker to create an exploitable memory corruption
condition. Exploitation requires that an attacker either coerce the
target to open a malformed media file or visit a website embedding the
malicious file.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has identified and corrected this issue in QuickTime 7.1.
Customers can obtain the fix from Apple's Software Downloads web site:
