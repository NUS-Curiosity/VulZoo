Exactly. You don't do caching on computers that won't ever come off the 
network. i.e. don't do it on desktops. If you have that much of a problem 
with AD being unavailable, you better look more closely at your AD 
architecture.
You may do caching on laptops, and then i'd hope you don't have people 
sharing laptops. If you do, well then, that's another story requiring 
careful consideration, but a little off-topic.
