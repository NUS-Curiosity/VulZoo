Subject: WikiNi Persistent Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability


Hi,

I've found a vulnerability more than 2 months ago, and notified the developers, but still no answer, so I'm posting here.

http://zone14.free.fr/advisories/3/

Vendor: WikiNi
Vulnerable: WikiNi 0.4.2 and below

Persistent Cross Site Scripting

A persistent XSS vulnerability is the most dangerous kind of XSS vulnerabilities, as the data submitted by the malicious user is stored permanently on the server. It could potentially hit a large number of other users with little need for social engineering.
Just edit a page and insert: ""<script>alert('XSS Vulnerable');</script>""

Restrictions
The attacker needs to have the rights to edit at least one page of the wiki, but most of the time it is the case. Moreover, WikiNi 0.4.2 is used on more than 100,000 pages according to Google.
