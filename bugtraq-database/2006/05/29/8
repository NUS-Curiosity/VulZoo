Subject: Buffer overflow in QuickTime 7.0.4?


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


I'm not sure if this one is known but I see the last buffer overflows
show Quicktime 7.x vulnerable and suggest upgrading to 7.0.4*.

* http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303101

I was downloading Elephant's dream from
http://osaddict.com/files/Elephants_Dream_1024-h264-st-aac.mov on
Windows XP*, and started playing with scrolling past the end of the
movie.  This invariably crashes Firefox with the QuickTime player, etc etc.

So I opened the QuickTime Player itself, v7.0.4, and threw it forward to
half-way.  I get a dialog box claiming the Microsoft Visual C Runtime
detected a "buffer overflow," and immediately remember-- windows has
stack smash protection now, thanks to the MS Research Glepnir project
looking into StackGuard!  I know the basic concept-- canaries on the stack.

So apparently I threw QuickTime 7.0.4 into an overflow again?

The question here is, can anyone else reproduce this one?  I don't have
an exact environment or a file for you (it was downloading while it was
going), but just let the download go for a bit and start trying to open
it in QuickTime while it's downloading and scroll past the end.
