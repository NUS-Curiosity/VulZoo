Since ASLR has been in and has been trivially circumvented in Linux
for years now (see my papers on return-to-libc & return-to-got) I
don't see it being a particularly hard issue to defeat :-)  Maybe
though, if they also randomise some other key areas like heap
locations and do some fancy relocation to non writable/executable
pages plus the drop-in of some ascii armour, we might then be on par
with a hardened Linux or *BSD..

Granted, I haven't looked at Vista yet :)
