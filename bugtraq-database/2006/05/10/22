People that don't read the documentation are the same that leave apache
web servers open, the same that set up open relay mail servers, and so
on. So actually reading the documentation is the right thing to do. The
management interface is an experimental feature, and it's not supposed
to be used on production sites. And further more, you can have
authentication. From the openvpn manual:

--management IP port [pw-file]
              Enable a TCP server on IP:port to handle daemon management
functions. pw-file,  if specified, is a password file (password on
        first line) or "stdin" to prompt from standard input.  The pass
             word  provided will set the password which TCP clients will
need          to provide in order to access management functions...

So, this is not a security flaw nor a design flaw, because it is an
EXPERIMENTAL feature. It is on the wish list for openvpn 2.1 to make it
use TLS/SSL. There is no point in your arguments. And, if you are so
worried about it, go use IPSec or even worse, use PPTP.

My 3 cents,
