BACKGROUND
For a PGP signed version of this security bulletin please write to: security-alert@...com 

CERT VU#457875 ( http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/457875) reports a potential security 
vulnerability in the BINDv4 Domain Name Server (DNS). 

HP-UX B.11.00 may be affected by this vulnerability if the BINDv4 Domain Name Server 
(DNS) is configured to do both of the following:

  * support recursive requests and cache the results 
  * respond to DNS requests made by untrusted systems 

To determine if an HP-UX system has an affected version, search the output of 
"swlist -a revision -l fileset" for one of the filesets listed below. For affected 
systems verify that the recommended action has been taken.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

HP-UX B.11.00
=============
InternetSrvcs.INETSVCS-RUN
action: add "options no-recursion" to /etc/named.boot

END AFFECTED VERSIONS

RESOLUTION
The potential vulnerability may be avoided by blocking access to the system from 
untrusted systems or by disabling DNS recursion. 

To disable DNS recursion, add the following to /etc/named.boot:

  options no-recursion 

The option will take effect when named is restarted.

Note: This issue has been previously reported in HPSBGN01156 SSRT2400 rev.0 (7 August 2003). HPSBGN01156 did not have the Affected Versions for the HP-UX Security Patch Check. The Affected Versions information is contained in this Security Bulletin.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
add "options no-recursion" to /etc/named.boot
