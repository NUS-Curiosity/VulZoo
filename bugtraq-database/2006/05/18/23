Hi Chris,

This is almost similar to what I notice with the scans. The URL you provided 
is similar except for a few differences. The scans are being done from the 
inside interface to the outside from the firewall. The scan is a complete 
TCP Connect scan.

However, what you have pointed out is really appreciated. There definitely 
is a problem with this erratic behavior of Checkpoint which is being called 
as a feature. The same scans work perfectly fine on our PIX firewalls.

i've seen this behavior recently too. the reason it does this is the
checkpoint device is replying to a session startup before receiving a
legitimate response from the actual endpoint.

you probably should read this thread
