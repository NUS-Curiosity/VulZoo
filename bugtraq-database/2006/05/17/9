Hi David,

The firewalls are not configured to confuse the scanner. The configurations 
have been checked by the Checkpoint Tech Support and the Checkpoint SMEs 
from our team. This is not a mis-configuration issue and SYNdefender is 
disabled.

Souds to me like the firewall is configured to confuse scanners on
purpose.  If the performance really does degrad to DoS levels then this is
more likely a mis-configuration of one of their add-ons, not an actual
bug.  Have the settings for their IPS and SYN-Defender been checked
carefully?
