For what it's worth, before I did security, I did HCI. And trust me,  
I am well aware of Whitten's work. We've had Whitten come in and talk  
to us.

And we do have full-time HCI people. They live full and complete  
lives because the human factors of security is the hardest thing  
there is. We do extensive user testing on all our systems and the way  
things are presently done are as a result of that testing. However,  
count thoroughly on continued improvements based on continued testing.

However, we do not make Truecrypt, we make PGP. The Truecrypt people  
make Truecrypt.
