Synopsis
========

Remote attackers can include local files which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

phpWebSite provides a complete web site content management system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpwebsite      < 0.10.2                       >= 0.10.2

Description
===========

rgod has reported that the "hub_dir" parameter in "index.php" isn't
properly verified. When "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled, this can be
exploited to include arbitrary files from local ressources.

Impact
======

If "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled, which is not the default on Gentoo
Linux, a remote attacker could exploit this issue to include and
execute PHP scripts from local ressources with the rights of the user
running the web server, or to disclose sensitive information and
potentially compromise a vulnerable system.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpWebSite users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phpwebsite-0.10.2"

References
==========
