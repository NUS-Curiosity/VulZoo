Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

     A local denial of service vulnerability in proc memory handling has
     been found.

 CVE-2004-0394

     A buffer overflow in the panic handling code has been found.

 CVE-2004-0447

     A local denial of service vulnerability through a null pointer
     dereference in the IA64 process handling code has been found.

 CVE-2004-0554

     A local denial of service vulnerability through an infinite loop in
     the signal handler code has been found.

 CVE-2004-0565

     An information leak in the context switch code has been found on
     the IA64 architecture.

 CVE-2004-0685

     Unsafe use of copy_to_user in USB drivers may disclose sensitive
     information.

 CVE-2005-0001

     A race condition in the i386 page fault handler may allow privilege
     escalation.

 CVE-2004-0883

     Multiple vulnerabilities in the SMB filesystem code may allow denial
     of service of information disclosure.

 CVE-2004-0949

     An information leak discovered in the SMB filesystem code.

 CVE-2004-1016

     A local denial of service vulnerability has been found in the SCM layer.

 CVE-2004-1333

     An integer overflow in the terminal code may allow a local denial of
     service vulnerability.

 CVE-2004-0997

     A local privilege escalation in the MIPS assembly code has been found.
 
 CVE-2004-1335
 
     A memory leak in the ip_options_get() function may lead to denial of
     service.
      
 CVE-2004-1017

     Multiple overflows exist in the io_edgeport driver which might be usable
     as a denial of service attack vector.
 
 CVE-2005-0124

     Bryan Fulton reported a bounds checking bug in the coda_pioctl function
     which may allow local users to execute arbitrary code or trigger a denial
     of service attack.

 CVE-2005-0528

     A local privilege escalation in the mremap function has been found

 CVE-2003-0984

     Inproper initialization of the RTC may disclose information.

 CVE-2004-1070

     Insufficient input sanitising in the load_elf_binary() function may
     lead to privilege escalation.

 CVE-2004-1071

     Incorrect error handling in the binfmt_elf loader may lead to privilege
     escalation.

 CVE-2004-1072

     A buffer overflow in the binfmt_elf loader may lead to privilege
     escalation or denial of service.

 CVE-2004-1073

     The open_exec function may disclose information.

 CVE-2004-1074

     The binfmt code is vulnerable to denial of service through malformed
     a.out binaries.

 CVE-2004-0138

     A denial of service vulnerability in the ELF loader has been found.

 CVE-2004-1068

     A programming error in the unix_dgram_recvmsg() function may lead to
     privilege escalation.

 CVE-2004-1234

     The ELF loader is vulnerable to denial of service through malformed
     binaries.

 CVE-2005-0003

     Crafted ELF binaries may lead to privilege escalation, due to 
     insufficient checking of overlapping memory regions.

 CVE-2004-1235

     A race condition in the load_elf_library() and binfmt_aout() functions
     may allow privilege escalation.

 CVE-2005-0504

     An integer overflow in the Moxa driver may lead to privilege escalation.

 CVE-2005-0384

     A remote denial of service vulnerability has been found in the PPP
     driver.

 CVE-2005-0135

     An IA64 specific local denial of service vulnerability has been found
     in the unw_unwind_to_user() function.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

                                     Debian 3.0 (woody)
     Source                          2.4.18-14.4
     Alpha architecture              2.4.18-15woody1
     Intel IA-32 architecture        2.4.18-13.2
     HP Precision architecture       62.4 
     PowerPC architecture            2.4.18-1woody6
     PowerPC architecture/XFS        20020329woody1            
     PowerPC architecture/benh       20020304woody1
     Sun Sparc architecture          22woody1    

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine.
