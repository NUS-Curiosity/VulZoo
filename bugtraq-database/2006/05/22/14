Subject: Generic Browser Crash with Java 1.4.2_11, Java 1.5.0_06


Hi y'all,

the celebration week for Java is over, so let's come back to
some old bugs. 2,5 years ago I found a bug in 1.4.2_02 which
let browsers crash. Naively I submitted the bug to their database
and waited that the bug would be fixed. But until now, nothing happened.

Therefore I donate the bug to the public, it is described here:

http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4944300

You can test it here, as it crashes all known browsers, enabled with java
plugin up until 1.4.2_11 and 1.5.0_06, be sure to save your work
before trying:

Yes, I know there were more important things to do at Sun, like
getting all 4 legs on the new 1.6.0 version, was it called mule or
mustang, I don't remember.

Cheers
Marc
