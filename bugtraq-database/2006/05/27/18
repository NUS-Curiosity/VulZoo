 SDA , PGP 8.x & 9.x and Truecrypt.


We appreciate your comments,
Did you check truecrypt video ? http://www.safehack.com/Advisory/truecrypt/truecrypt.html
We are not saying maybe it is documented feature. We did not see that and the objective was not to test truecrypt but it was to test pgp. It was a trial on truecrypt and we reported our findings.
