you'd be surprised how fast a gsr can spit out streams of !.!..!..!

yep. It's just not turned on on routers by default, so this one caught
us a little bit by surprise when engineers were running a burn in
test in the lab on an OC-192 card.
(_usually_ you don't cream a router with lots of little packets via
telnet)

yup. I've got plenty of ammo to throw at irritating and dubiously
self-righteous backline, but sometimes the only way to raise matters
above somebody who doesn't want to admit there is a problem, is
to provide a little community pressure to fix it. (even if it
isn't critical or may be hard to reproduce without appreciably
fast equipment on hand).

A DOS that makes a machine unusable is a DOS. Mis-categorizing it
(on their half) as jabber  is wrong as well as condescending (left
that part out) and just plain irritating from a company that usually
takes operating system availability much more seriously.
