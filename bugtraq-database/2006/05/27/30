Windows  doesn't  cache  passwords.  If I remember correctly, the cached
value  is  actually  MD5  from  NT  key and can not be used directly. LM
hashes     can     be     disabled    through    group    policy,    see
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=299656.   Local   SAM  doesn't  store
domain accounts.

If  your users on shared hosts work with local administrators privileges
- you have no security at all. Forget about about PWDUMP, it's too hard.
Think   about   trojans  and  keyloggers  user  can  install  to  obtain
credentials  of  different  user. Even more: if you have shared computer
and  you  have  no  physical  security,  everyone  can  install hardware
keylogger.

Your problem is you have strange approach to security. Good approach is:

What should I protect?
