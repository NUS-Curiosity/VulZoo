cisco router. extending ping. 0 delay.
I was speaking of cisco ping.
I should have said 'timeout'. mea culpa.

running ping on the cisco to another device (preferably a fast
cisco as the source and a nice fast interface like a gige or
a IP/sonet)

dedicated, switched Ethernet here.
it seems to mostly overwhelm the sun's interupt processing, but
that's just a theory since Sun has decided that the solution is to
unplug the machine on the other end.

We're only talking about 14000 packets per second to kill a netra
T1. I've been able to drive one faster than that via other means
without causing a 'jabber effect'.

indeed. that's my issue, the console should not be hung. The machine
should not require a hard reset. And, I do not believe there is
an electrical problem. I'm not doing anything down that low, It's
just a TCP/IP stream, and, a not outrageous one at at that.

correct. standalone mechine. (even if it were not, there would still
be response on console to, e.g. break)

See, that's where I have trouble. From a Security perspective, you'd
want to avoid the DOS via some kind of drop or disable mechanism
in the first place... IMHO.

neither.
What is triggering it is the stream of !...!..!!..!..!....!!!
stuff from the cisco.

I've found the Netra interface to be pretty resilient and robust (previously).
