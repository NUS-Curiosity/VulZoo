Hi.

Of course it is, but it's hidden away nicely, and who reads documentation 
anyway eh? ;o)  ..certainly not a system administrator in a hurry to set up 
a VPN while being bitched at by his boss.  I thought I'd bring it to the 
attention of everyone on this list who may be running it, and didn't realise 
the implications.  If you want to bitch about something, bitch about these 
XSS attacks appearing on bugtraq relating to guestbook v1, etc. that about 
two people in the world use that doesn't include big organisations.  As 
opposed to OpenVPN - which is used by many, including some big organisations 
I'm guessing.  Additionally, they could have put warnings in the actual 
code, checks, even disable binding to a specific NIC.  However, as someone 
mentioned, they don't enable the interface by default - so we'll give them a 
blue peter badge for that.

Have a lovely day.
