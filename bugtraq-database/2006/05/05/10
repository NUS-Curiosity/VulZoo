"Secure by default" is not just a catch phrase. it's a really good idea. By 
making the default behaviour to be insecure (once enabled) the result will 
be many more insecure sites than if it was secured (i.e. authentication 
required) and had to be made insecure by design. Unfortunately although they 
have disabled it by default, once enabled it presents a huge security hole 
that most people would not expect. I would not expect an administrative 
service to be completely lacking in security once enabled, I suspect others 
are in the same boat.

As a developer:

If you disable it by default

And you make it use strong encryption such as TLS/SSL by default (linking to 
OpenSSL isn't to terribly hard)

And you require a user account to be created and passworded, or provide the 
ability to use PAM for example and require that a user belong to a specific 
group (openvpnadmin for example)

Then you make it much more difficult for people to end up with an insecure 
system.
