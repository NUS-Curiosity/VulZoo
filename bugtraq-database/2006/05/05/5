Subject: Idle scan rediscovered!!!


hello world!,
                  the idle scan was just rediscovered in my lab while
i was trying to replicate a dos attack on a windowsxp ,linux(debian
sarge) and win2k workstations. I had thought that IDLE scan was a
closed chaper after the ipid0 and randomisations were applied( i think
Marco Ivaldi's bugtraq mail on bypassing the zero IP ID was patched).

Idle scan attack should be re-investigated and vulnerable systems
patched. Till the developers patch it up, everybody should learn to
use some suitable workarounds. My time limit and eagerness to report
this to the community at the earliest have resulted in certain
compromises; although i had replicated the attack on debian sarge(yes
its affected too!!) and win2k i was unable to document because i got
so tired that i leave it to you all as an exercise!!

please see my page for the technical details and screenshots of my
replication of the IDLE scan attack:
