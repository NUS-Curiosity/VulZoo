Subject: Re: RE: Oracle, where are the patches???



I think everything about Oracle has been said,
everything is in the table to show how really bad
Oracle is at security, but only few people seems to
get the message, I wonder if at least goverments are
paying attention since national infraestructure
systems are running with Oracle, what else we can do
to have this sad company to start taking security
seriously?
 So if people at .gov is hearing you should be worry
about national security and start acting on Oracle, I
guess .gov don't want their data easily compromised.


Cesar.
