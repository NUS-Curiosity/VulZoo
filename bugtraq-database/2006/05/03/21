Subject: Re: Ejabberd : Symlink vulnerability during installation process


The problem was in the software generating the installer. We have worked with their team and they have been very responsive.

The problem has been fixed with the release of a new installer version (Less than one day, about 12  jours :-):
Version: ejabberd-1.1.1_2-linux-installer.bin
Download page: http://www.process-one.net/en/projects/ejabberd/download.html#binaries

Note that the problem was not on ejabberd itself but on its installer generation tool, which is a third-party installer generator software.

Best regards,
