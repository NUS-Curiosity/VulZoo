PassMasterFlex (and PassMasterFlex+) XSS injection

Discovered by: Nomenumbra
Date: 5/4/2006
impact:moderate (privilege escalation,possible defacement)


PassMasterFlex(+) is a database-driven multiple login that utilizes cookies for authentication.
PassMasterFlex+ was written not only to provide an alternative to the Apache login but in 
response to numerous requests to have multiple users.

PMF doesn't filter any data in the user's profiles, thus allowing them to embed any XSS code there
to elevate their privileges.
Also upon failed login attempt, data gets written to the "hack-log" but without filtering. It is
possible to embed XSS in a custom user-agent to obtain cookies.
