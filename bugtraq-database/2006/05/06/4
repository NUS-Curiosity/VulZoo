ChipmunkBlogger improper input sanitizing

Discovered by: Nomenumbra
Date: 6/4/2006
impact:moderate (privilege escalation,possible defacement)

Posts (potentially made by lower-privilege members) and profile names aren't properly sanitized, thus resulting
in being vulnerable to the following kind of XSS injection:

<SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>

The photo gallery input isn't sanitized either, by giving the following
input as an url we have a nice XSS attack:

javascript:alert(%27xss%27)
