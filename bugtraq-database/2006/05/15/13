Subject: JDK 1.4.2_11, 1.5.0_06, unsigned applets consuming all free harddisk
 space


Hi y'all,

Quite a while ago I was testing  with applets and found
this by accident. It is definitely not a big issue, but worth
to mention, as I discovered that an applet was eating up all the
free space on the harddrive by allocating a large file in
the users hidden temp dir (filename is something like
+~JF57558.tmp ).

Even when leaving the page the applet continues to work due
to the broken event management between the browser
and the JVM and after quitting the browser the temp file
is not deleted.
Therefore it leaves the machine in a terrible state, with
no available space left, necessary for automatic security updates.
And I am just transferring zero bytes but more harmful payload is
certainly possible.

Java is supposed to work similar on all platforms (write
once, crash everywhere :-). So please tell me whether
the following link fills up your hard disk
(use on your own RISK, of course):

I tested with Firefox 1.5.0.3 and JDK 1.4.2_11 on a WinXP
box and on another XP machine with IE6 , JDK 1.5.0_06.

But I doubt that Sun will ever fix the bug, as they know the issue
since 2004.

Cheers
Marc
