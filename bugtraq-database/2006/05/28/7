queries to Eggblog.This SQL injection works with
Eggblog version 3.0.6 and below.The problem is that id parameter id

queries and execute them.This SQL injection needs
magic_quotes_gpc off.
There is another problem in Eggblog 2.x.In registration member  
register status did not sanitized properly.This caused to
remote attacker "register new member" as a admin nick and get  
administration privileges on Eggblog.
