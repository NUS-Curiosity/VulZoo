Subject: Motion detectors and cell phones


This is a little off topic and has nothing to do with computer but a lot to
do with security. I'm going to start the thread by asking, does anyone know
about a correlation between cell phones and motion detectors? I'm asking
this way because I may or may not have discovered something huge.

Comments appreciated.
