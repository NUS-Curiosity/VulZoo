IpLogger <= 1.7 XSS

Discovered by: Nomenumbra

impact:moderate (potential privilege escalation,possible defacement)

tjthedj's IpLogger (http://tjthedj.us/projects/iplogger/) suffers from XSS in a user's useragent.
It is possible to construct a useragent containing javascript, thus
being displayed to the user once he check's the logs.
