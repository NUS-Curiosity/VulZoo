Subject: [TOOL] untidy - XML Fuzzer

List,

   I'm glad to release a beta version of untidy; untidy is general
purpose XML Fuzzer. It takes a string representation of a XML as input
and generates a set of modified, potentially invalid, XMLs based on
the input. It's released under GPL v2 and written in python.

Cheers,
