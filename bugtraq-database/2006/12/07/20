bla bla bla, full disclosure is cheaper

i really hate responsible disclosure criers, it's a personal choice,
you can't cry if somebody wants to do that different

we are speaking about MIME!! don't you think that an AV should be aware

the mime trick not the clamav dos

very interesting paper Hendrik
