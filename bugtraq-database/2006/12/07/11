I think this function just *tries* to check inputs, but doesn't
succeed.  Did you do any live testing using $topic ?

We should expect to see more erroneous cleansing/checking functions as
programmers attempt to implement security in their products.

This matters later on.

Since the assignment of $exinput is commented out, the variable is
undefined.  So, $countname is set to 0.

(This was probably commented out because the function doesn't exist in
PHP 4.)

Since $countname is 0, this loop is not entered.

Since $checkcount is 0, the function always returns "yes", meaning
"the input looks valid to me."

  <SCRIPT>abc</SCRIPT> === yes

  ABCDE GHIF AKLSM === yes

  ABCDEGHIFAKLSM === yes

There might be other logic errors in the function, but this is the
most obvious one.
