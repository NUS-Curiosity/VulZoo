Also confirmed working on Windows Server 2003 R2 (Build 3790) with
Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.11

1st exploit was working fine putting iexplore.exe at 100% CPU. It
complained about "IE restricting this web page from running scripts"
(probably because of enabled Internet Explorer Enhanced Security
Configuration), but if you click "allow this website to run this"
(which is enabled by default if above mentioned IE ESC is not present)
it works.

2nd and 3rd were not exactly working, (also because of IE ESC) because
after clicking allow after several windows it was asking again, but
should work on WinXP and IE7.
