Synopsis
========

OpenSSL contains multiple vulnerabilities including the possible
execution of remote arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenSSL is a toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer, Transport
Layer Security protocols and a general-purpose cryptography library.
The x86 emulation base libraries for AMD64 contain a vulnerable version
of OpenSSL.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  emul-linux-x86-baselibs       < 2.5.5                    >= 2.5.5
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to AMD64 users.

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry, both of the Google Security Team,
discovered that the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() function contains a buffer
overflow vulnerability, and that the SSLv2 client code contains a flaw
leading to a crash. Additionally, Dr. Stephen N. Henson found that the
ASN.1 handler contains two Denial of Service vulnerabilities: while
parsing an invalid ASN.1 structure and while handling certain types of
public key.

Impact
======

An attacker could trigger the buffer overflow by sending a malicious
suite of ciphers to an application using the vulnerable function, and
thus execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
application. An attacker could also consume CPU and/or memory by
exploiting the Denial of Service vulnerabilities. Finally, a malicious
server could crash a SSLv2 client through the SSLv2 vulnerability.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All AMD64 x86 emulation base libraries users should upgrade to the
latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs-2.5.5"
