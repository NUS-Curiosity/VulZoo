Synopsis
========

libgsf improperly allocates memory allowing for a heap overflow and
possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The GNOME Structured File Library is an I/O library that can read and
write common file types and handle structured formats that provide
file-system-in-a-file semantics.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnome-extra/libgsf      < 1.14.2                        >= 1.14.2

Description
===========

"infamous41md" has discovered that the "ole_init_info" function may
allocate too little memory for storing the contents of an OLE document,
resulting in a heap buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted OLE
document, and possibly execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
user opening the document.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libgsf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/libgsf-1.14.2"

==========
