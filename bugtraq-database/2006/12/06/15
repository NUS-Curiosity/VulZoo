So, do this, poc:

Log on to local machine as administrator.


Use IE:

BANG, you are using IE with elevated privledges.

This is stupid, and anyone who doesn't see how stupid this is isn't
listening.

Last free clue to anyone: if you don't understand this, and think this
is a security violation or if you think symantec needs to fix this, you
need to find a different job.  You will be chasing dragons when there is
real work to do.
