   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2006-012
Advisory Title: 2X ThinClientServer Create Admin Account Replay Vulnerability
        Author: Oliver Karow / oliver_karow@...antec.com
  Release Date: 12-04-2006
   Application: 2X ThinClientServer Enterprise Edition v3_sp2-r1865 
      Platform: Windows / Linux
      Severity: Remotely exploitable / Administrator Access
 Vendor status: Verified by vendor. Resolved in ThinClientServer 4.0.2248
    CVE Number: CVE-2006-6221
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21300


Overview:

	From vendor's website:

"2X ThinClientServer provides a complete solution for the central
deployment, configuration and management of thin clients, and
provides load balancing and redundancy of terminal servers."

It is possible to create administrative user accounts for the application,
without authentication.



Details:

	During the installation procedure, an administrative user account
for the application is created. Sending the same request with a different
username, after the installation is completed, creates an additional administrative
account. The account can be created remotely and authentication is not required.



Vendor Response:

The above vulnerability is fixed and applicable to the following versions:
- - ThinClientServer 4.0
	Users of ThinClientServer Version 4 are unaffected by this issue.
- - ThinClientServer 3.0
	Please Upgrade your machine to Version 4.0.2248 or higher and deploy
the new ThinClientOS 4.0 on your network to resolve this issue. This can be
done by uploading the new image zip file in the Management Console and setting
it as the new default image for your ThinClients.

Customers who have prior versions of ThinClientServer are requested to upgrade
to at least 4.0.2248 version.



Recommendation:

	Upgrade to Version 4.0.2248 or higher to solve the issue.
