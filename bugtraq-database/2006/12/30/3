** Inge Henriksen Security Advisory - Full Disclosure Proof of Concept at http://ingehenriksen.blogspot.com/ **

Advisory Name: SoftArtisans FileUp(TM) viewsrc.asp remote script source disclosure exploit
Tested and Confirmed Vulerable: SoftArtisans SAFileUp(TM) 5.0.14 (Standard)
Severity: High
Type: Script source disclosure
>From where: Remote 
Discovered by: Inge Henriksen (http://ingehenriksen.blogspot.com/) 
Vendor Status: Notified 
Overview: 

SoftArtisans SAFileUp(TM) is a popular web server component for transactional uploading of files to a web server using a web browser.

When installing SoftArtisans SAFileUp(TM) you should avoid installing the samples as viewsrc.asp can let remote anonymous users see script source code or configuration settings outside the /SAFileUpSamples virtual directory. This is accomplished by modifying the "path" query variable to point to files outside the designated directory. A web browser from a remote location is a sufficient tool to see the source code or configuration settings in plain text.
