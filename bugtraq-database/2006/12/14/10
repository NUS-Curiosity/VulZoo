    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-857

Description:
    Previous versions of the libgsf package contain a flaw in parsing
    OLE documents that could allow an attacker to crash applications
    that use libgsf, and possibly to cause them to execute arbitrary
    code, by presenting a user with an intentionally malformed OLE
    document.
