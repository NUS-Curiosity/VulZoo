Subject: Re: The newest Word flaw is due to malformed data structure
 handling

And without any reasonable technical details it is very difficult to give a title field for the vulnerability.
Several advisories using titles like Word Unspecified Code Execution Vulnerability or Word Code Execution Vulnerability #2, #3 are not the trend we want.
Related to the newest Word issue US-CERT assigned a good title:
Microsoft Word malformed pointer vulnerability
