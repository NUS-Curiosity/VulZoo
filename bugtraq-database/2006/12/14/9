Subject: Re: Microsoft 0-day word vulnerability - Secunia - Extremely critical

I'm seeing this vulnerability detected like crazy as of 12 Dec. Symantec is picking it up as Bloodhound.Exploit.106 as of 12 DEC defs. Strange thing is that some of the docs I'm seeing being detected with this vulnerability are docs users have had on their systems for years and haven't opened in a very long time...so how are they getting infected???
