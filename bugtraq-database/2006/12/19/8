Subject: Trend Micro's Vista "0day exploit auction" claim

A number of popular tech news sources are reporting Trend Micro's CTO, 
Raimund Genes, publicly claiming that there are "auctions" for zero-day 
Windows Vista exploits. Further, he claims these auctions are fetching 
approx $50,000.

Could anyone verify Trend Micro's claim?

It seems dubious, at best, to me and possibly nothing more than pure FUD.

Sorry to get off topic.
