Synopsis
========

pam_ldap contains a vulnerability that may allow a remote user with a
locked account to gain unauthorized system access.

Background
==========

pam_ldap is a Pluggable Authentication Module which allows
authentication against LDAP directories.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-auth/pam_ldap        < 183                             >= 183

Description
===========

Steve Rigler discovered that pam_ldap does not correctly handle
"PasswordPolicyResponse" control responses from an LDAP directory. This
causes the pam_authenticate() function to always succeed, even if the
previous authentication failed.

Impact
======

A locked user may exploit this vulnerability to bypass the LDAP
authentication mechanism, possibly gaining unauthorized access to the
system.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All pam_ldap users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/pam_ldap-183"
