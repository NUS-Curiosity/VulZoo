Cisco has come across with the requested firmware.

Thanks Russell.

If cisco needs copies of emails from tac about this issue I will save
them.

Russell also suggested that if anyone had problems getting tac to send
security updates that they call the phone number and/or send email to
psirt to escalate it.

Seems that the problem is not with Cisco's policies, but some of the
(offshore?) tech support people answering the tac@...co.com email still
don't know Cisco's policies.
