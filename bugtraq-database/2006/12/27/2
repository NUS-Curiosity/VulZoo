Subject: Re: LuckyBot v3 Remote File Include

Hi,

 > www.Example.com/[Lucky]/classes/ircbot.class.php?dir=SHELL?&file=

In 'run.php', the include statement (  include_once $dir . $file; ) is 
within a function:

   include_dir($dir)

It appears that the function is never called with user-controllable input.

In 'classes/ircbot.class.php', the include statement ( include $dir . 
$file ."/plugin.php"; ) is also within a function:

   load_plugins($dir)

Again, it appears that the function is never called with 
user-controllable input.

Did you test this?

Stuart
