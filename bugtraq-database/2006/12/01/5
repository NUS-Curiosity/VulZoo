ContentServ again (still) features remote reading of arbitrary files
====================================================================


ContentServ is a cms and "cross media publishing" software.

Let me quote from their website:

"At ContentServ, there is always something happening. We continously enhance our products and services.[...]"

Ok.

Still with me? Ok. Lets forget the sql injections for a moment, what if we try:

Ooops!


have fun!
