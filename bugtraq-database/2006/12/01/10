 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Thanks for pointing this out JP, it does in fact look confusing. We 
determined during the Digital Vaccine filter creation process that a 
previously released filter was robust enough to block the attack without 
further modification and the vendor was immeditately notified.

you waited over a year to report it to the vendor?

sounds like analyzing your digital vaccine rules might yield a slew of
reproducible 0 days that vendors are unaware of.....

about how much info can be gleaned from it>
