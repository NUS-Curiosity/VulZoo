Synopsis
========

ClamAV is vulnerable to Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.88.7                      >= 0.88.7

Description
===========

Hendrik Weimer discovered that ClamAV fails to properly handle deeply
nested MIME multipart/mixed content.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted email with deeply nested MIME
multipart/mixed content an attacker could cause ClamAV to crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88.7"
