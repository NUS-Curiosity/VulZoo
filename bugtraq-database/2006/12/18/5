Subject: Cisco not honoring update promises?

Has anyone else had a problem with Cisco not honoring their posted,
advertised promise to provide updates to IOS if it's a security
vulnerability?

I have spend almost a month going back and forth with Cisco on this and
decided to ask this question in bugtraq.
Each time I get back 'your contract expired, you must pay for an update
despite what we say on our web site'

Since this is more than just one low level off shore tech who doesn't
know cisco's policies, I assume Cisco is for some reason going back on
their documented policy?  Does anyone KNOW for sure?

Their web site: (specifically the 'Free upgrades for non-contract
customers must be requested through the TAC, which I have done several
times.  



Customers without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

    * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
    * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
    * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of
this notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.
