Synopsis
========

ModPlug contains several boundary errors that could lead to buffer
overflows resulting in the possible execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ModPlug is a library for playing MOD-like music.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libmodplug      < 0.8-r1                     >= 0.8-r1

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma has reported various boundary errors in load_it.cpp and
a boundary error in the "CSoundFile::ReadSample()" function in
sndfile.cpp.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can entice a user to read crafted modules or ITP
files, which may trigger a buffer overflow resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ModPlug users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libmodplug-0.8-r1"
