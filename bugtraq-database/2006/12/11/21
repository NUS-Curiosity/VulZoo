Synopsis
========

Tar is vulnerable to directory traversal possibly allowing for the
overwriting of arbitrary files.

Background
==========

The Tar program provides the ability to create and manipulate tar
archives.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/tar      < 1.16-r2                            >= 1.16-r2

Description
===========

Tar does not properly extract archive elements using the GNUTYPE_NAMES
record name, allowing files to be created at arbitrary locations using
symlinks. Once a symlink is extracted, files after the symlink in the
archive will be extracted to the destination of the symlink.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to extract a specially crafted tar
archive, possibly allowing for the overwriting of arbitrary files on
the system extracting the archive.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tar users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/tar-1.16-r2"
