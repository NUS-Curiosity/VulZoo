Synopsis
========

MadWifi is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could potentially lead
to the remote execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

Background
==========

MadWifi (Multiband Atheros Driver for Wireless Fidelity) provides a
Linux kernel device driver for Atheros-based Wireless LAN devices.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-wireless/madwifi-ng      < 0.9.2.1                 >= 0.9.2.1

Description
===========

Laurent Butti, Jerome Raznieski and Julien Tinnes reported a buffer
overflow in the encode_ie() and the giwscan_cb() functions from
ieee80211_wireless.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted wireless WPA packets
containing malicious RSN Information Headers (IE) that could
potentially lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code as the root
user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MadWifi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/madwifi-ng-0.9.2.1"
