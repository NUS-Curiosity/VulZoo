Subject Name:            OpenSER
Subject Summary:         SIP router
Subject Home:            http://www.openser.org/
Subject Versions:        * <= 1.1.0

Vulnerability Id:        BID:21706
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           local system
Attack Impact:           arbitrary code execution

Description:
    A buffer overflow was discovered [0] in the "parse_expression"
    function of the "permissions" module of the SIP router OpenSER [1],
    versions up to and including 1.1.0. The OpenSER "permissions" module
    is used to determine if a SIP call has appropriate permission to be
    established. The "parse_expression" function is used during parsing
    of the modules local allow/deny configuration files.
    
    The buffer overflow is triggered by parsing a configuration
    line expression consisting of more than 500 characters and
    potentially could lead to the execution of arbitrary code under
    the privileges of the OpenSER process. Successfully exploiting the
    vulnerability requires that the local attacker has write access
    to the configuration files used with the configuration functions
    "allow_routing", "allow_register" and "allow_refer_to".
