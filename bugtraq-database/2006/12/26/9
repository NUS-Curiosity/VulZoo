Subject Name:            Links
Subject Summary:         Web Browser
Subject Home:            http://links.twibright.com/
Subject Versions:        * < 2.1pre26

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2006-5925
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           arbitrary code execution

Description:
    Teemu Salmela discovered [0] that the Links [1] character-mode
    web-browser performs insufficient sanitising of URLs based on the
    "smb" scheme, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary shell
    commands. The problem is triggered by the shell meta characters '"'
    and ';' in URLs starting with "smb://" on GET and PUT requests.
