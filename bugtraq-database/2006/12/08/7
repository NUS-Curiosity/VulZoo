Subject Name:            GNU tar
Subject Summary:         archive format utility
Subject Home:            http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/
Subject Versions:        * <= 1.16

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2006-6097, CVE-2002-1216
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           manipulation of data

Description:
    The archive format utility GNU tar [0], versions up to and including
    1.16, allows user-assisted attackers to overwrite arbitrary files
    via a TAR format file that contains a "GNUTYPE_NAMES" record with
    a symbolic link. As the "GNUTYPE_NAMES" based "name mangling"
    functionality in TAR format files is (1) a GNU extension only, (2)
    is no longer supported for TAR file creation by GNU tar since a
    longer time and (3) the extraction of such records is too dangerous,
    the functionality has been deactivated by default now in OpenPKG.
    For backward compatibility (usually to extract already existing
    older TAR format files), the introduced command-line option
    "--allow-name-mangling" is available.
