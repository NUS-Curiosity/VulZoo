 Overflow Vulnerability

Sophos Antivirus CHM File Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.08.06
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 08, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Sophos AntiVirus offers protection from the latest Trojans, worms and
Viruses. More information is available on the vendors site at:

http://sophos.com/products/

II. DESCRIPTION

Sophos AntiVirus Engine is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow attack when
scanning malformed CHM archives.

Specifically, if the CHM file has a Window_size of 0 set in a LZX
decompression header then memory corruption will occur.

III. ANALYSIS

Malformed CHM files can lead to a heap overflow condition on the local
machine. Files received as email attachments, uploaded via web forms or
otherwise saved to disk may trigger this condition if auto scanning is
enabled on the target machine. Archive scanning is disabled by default and
must be specified in order for this vulnerability to trigger.

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in the following Sophos Antivirus
products:

 * Sophos Antivirus for Linux

Previous versions of Sophos Antivirus are suspected vulnerable.  Other

Windows versions of the Sophos Antivirus product do not appear to be
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling the option to scan within archives will prevent exploitation of
this vulnerability.
