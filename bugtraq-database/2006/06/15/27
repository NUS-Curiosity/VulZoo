Description:
    KDM allows the user to select the session type for login. This setting
    is stored in the user home directory. Previous versions of KDM will
    follow a symbolic link and can thus disclose the contents of any file
    on the system (such as /etc/shadow) to arbitrary users. KDM is not the
    default window manager on rPath Linux.
