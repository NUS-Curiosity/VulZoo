In response of the DieselScripts reaction we have contacted them and  
told them we should write an article about them and their way of  
working. They came up with the same reason why they use these  
phonehomeprocedure and some shocking details about the way they use  
it. At the end we've got them to remove the phonehomeprocedure ;) The  
article itself is at

making-the-errors-a-big-one-cant.html
