Synopsis
========

Opera contains an integer signedness error resulting in a buffer
overflow which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 8.54                             >= 8.54

Description
===========

SEC Consult has discovered a buffer overflow in the code processing
style sheet attributes. It is caused by an integer signedness error in
a length check followed by a call to a string function. It seems to be
hard to exploit this buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code because
of the very large amount memory that has to be copied.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can entice a user to visit a web page containing a
specially crafted style sheet attribute that will crash the user's
browser and maybe lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-8.54"
