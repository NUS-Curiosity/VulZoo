Synopsis
========

Tor is vulnerable to a possible buffer overflow, a Denial of Service,
information disclosure and information leak.

Background
==========

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/tor     < 0.1.1.20                           >= 0.1.1.20

Description
===========

Some integer overflows exist when adding elements to the smartlists.
Non-printable characters received from the network are not properly
sanitised before being logged. There are additional unspecified bugs in
the directory server and in the internal circuits.

Impact
======

The possible buffer overflow may allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the server by sending large inputs. The other
vulnerabilities can lead to a Denial of Service,  a lack of logged
information, or some information disclosure.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.1.1.20"
