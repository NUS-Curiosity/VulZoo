               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated ipsec-tools package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:190941
Issue date:        2006-06-06
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2005-3732
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated ipsec-tools package that fixes a bug in racoon is now
available.

The ipsec-tools package is used in conjunction with the IPsec
functionality in the linux kernel and includes racoon, an IKEv1 keying
daemon.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 2 - i386
Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

A denial of service flaw was found in the ipsec-tools racoon daemon. If
a victim's machine has racoon configured in a non-recommended insecure
manner, it is possible for a remote attacker to crash the racoon daemon.
(CVE-2005-3732)

Users of ipsec-tools should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches, and is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
