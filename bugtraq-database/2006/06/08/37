I agree with the below. Besides the best way to setup MailMarshal is to
set it to bin/error on anything it cant unpack (which it generally does
anyway) as it should fault with an unpacking error. You should be able
to set the system that if it cant scan/unpack/check any file or email
that it holds it and does not send it on.

Any other configuration is reckless

This advisory is rather useless without the actual .reg file
information. It's also rather asinine, since any content filter can be
"bypassed" in this manner by simply encrypting a ZIP, RAR, or the
archive of your choosing. This is the equivalent of saying "we have
found a vulnerability in the Logitech wireless mouse, whereby if you
double click to execute a malicious file, your system becomes infected.
The vendor has advised us that we have a fundamental problem
understanding how the internet and computers in general function. The
workaround is to remove the batteries from the wireless mouse"



I'm quite disappointed in the recent lack of quality in Bugtraq's
entries. Next we'll have end-users submitting bugs because their CDROM
isn't a fully-functional coaster for their ale.
