Anyone with access to the .vmx config file for a virtual machine has
control over that virtual machine and is unavoidably able to make it
fail in a number of other ways. A user could attempt to boot a
3rd-party virtual machine with a specially crafted .vmx file while
running other (potentially mission-critical) virtual machines, and in
crashing VMware would terminate those other virtual
machines--consequently this is a quite legitimate security issue,
albeit a non-critical one (as the generally accepted practice of not
running noncritical applications alongside critical ones prevents
exploitation, and DoS of a virtualization environment pending
application restart is far short of a disastrous condition). However,
do you (or does anyone) know if it is possible to make a specially
crafted .vmx file along similar lines to exploit this buffer overflow
in such a way as to execute arbitrary code as the user running VMware?
If that were possible, that would make this vulnerability much more
critical.
