Synopsis
========

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Thunderbird allow cross site
scripting, JavaScript privilege escalation and possibly execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mozilla Thunderbird is the next-generation mail client from the Mozilla
project.

Affected packages
=================

     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

  2  mozilla-thunderbird-bin      < 1.5.0.4                 >= 1.5.0.4
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Several vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla Thunderbird.
For details, please consult the references below.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could craft malicious emails that would leverage
these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with elevated
privileges, spoof content, and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.4"

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.4"

Note: There is no stable fixed version for the Alpha architecture yet.
Users of Mozilla Thunderbird on Alpha should consider unmerging it
until such a version is available.
