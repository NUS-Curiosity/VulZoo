Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in the network code of Typespeed can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Typespeed is a game to test and practice 10-finger-typing. Network code
allows two users to compete head-to-head.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-misc/typespeed       < 0.5.0                       >= 0.5.0

Description
===========

Niko Tyni discovered a buffer overflow in the addnewword() function of
Typespeed's network code.

Impact
======

By sending specially crafted network packets to a machine running
Typespeed in multiplayer mode, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running the game.

Workaround
==========

Do not run Typespeed in multiplayer mode. There is no known workaround
at this time for multiplayer mode.

Resolution
==========

All Typespeed users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-misc/typespeed-0.5.0"
