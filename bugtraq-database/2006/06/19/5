in boastmachine folder, the below shouldn't be vulnerable with config.php declaring $bmc_dir.

vote.php
--------------------------------------
include_once dirname(__FILE__)."/config.php";
include_once dirname(__FILE__)."/$bmc_dir/main.php";

config.php
--------------------------------------
$bmc_dir="bmc";
