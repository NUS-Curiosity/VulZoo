Subject: Re: # MHG Security Team --- MyBloggie 2.1.1 version Remote File
 Include Vulnerabilit


This is not vulnerable,PHP-Nuke having a special in their files and when includes mainfile.php it overwrites the global variables and it caused to make an arbitrary file inclusion.
But in MyBloggie there is no common vulnerability like it.I checked all files and all versions did not see any vulnerability like you are given.
