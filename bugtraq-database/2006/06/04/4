Subject: Multiple Vendor NTFS Data Stream Malware Stealth
	Technique

Hi to all!

	Because it isn't a new problem and is well known by virus and spyware
writters I decide to release to the public now. Full disclosure.

	Attached goes a simple paper that describes this "very-advanced"
technique that was applicable at 1993 and is currently applicable.

Regards,
Joxean Koret
