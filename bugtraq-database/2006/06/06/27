But after a disclosure of a PHP issue with a functioning exploit, many
sites are regularly hacked soon afterward.  It might be off by
default, but it is clearly on (or required) in many operational
environments.  Some products specifically recommend or require
register_globals, so they will have these issues.

In this sense, I agree.  Default configuration is one thing, but
active negligence is another.

That said, Squirrelmail apparently thinks this issue is important
enough to release an advisory:

 http://www.squirrelmail.org/security/issue/2006-06-01

So maybe they know more about the implications on their consumers than
we do.
