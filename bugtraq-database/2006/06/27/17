Subject: Taking Over Laptops by Fuzzing Wireless Drivers


Some news items showed up in the past couple of days about vulnerabilities
in wireless device drivers. These vulnerabilities were apparently found by
the use of a 802.11 Fuzzing tool called lorcon
(http://www.802.11mercenary.net/lorcon/).

Apparently, David Maynor and Jon Ellch intend to demonstrate taking over a
laptop by the use of a wireless driver vulnerability next month at Black
Hat USA 2006.

I personally intend to go only to defcon, but this will be cool. :)

2nd Generation Fuzzing product.
