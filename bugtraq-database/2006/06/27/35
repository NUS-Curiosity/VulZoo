http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-06-019.html
June 27, 2006

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2006-3134

-- Affected Vendor:
GraceNote

-- Affected Products:
CDDBControl ActiveX Control

TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since April  3, 2006 by Digital Vaccine protection

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems that have some versions of the GraceNote CDDBControl ActiveX
object installed. There is a buffer overflow in an ActiveXObject
registered by several products that use the Gracenote CDDB for CD
information lookup. The ActiveX Object is commonly registered as safe
and can be accessed from a malicious web site.

The specific flaw exists when a large string is supplied as an option
for the instantiated control. An attacker can gain control of the
process leading to arbitrary code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Recently, a security vulnerability was found within a limited number of
our products. This is the first time we have been made aware of any
security vulnerability, and to date we have not received any reports of
end users being affected by this issue.  As soon as this vulnerability
was detected Gracenote took immediate action and followed every
required step to address this matter.  As a solution, we have developed
a software patch which is being provided to all of our affected
customers and they will be working through their normal channels and
processes to alert end-users and to update and fix affected
applications.
