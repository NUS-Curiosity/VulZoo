P.A.I.D v2.2

Effected files:
faq.php
input form of logging in.
index.php

The input forms of logging into My Account do not sanatize user input. For PoC of a XSS attack simply put in:
"><IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')><"

It also seems when logging in, even if your details are incorrect and you browse normal parts of the site like the FAQ or the Contact Us page etc, a message will be output in the top righton the screen with the text "Welcome back,username", as if you were successfully logged in.
