Well I think the advisory was quite good, except for the missing reg 
file but that file can be find in the Mailmarshal website as they have 
put a knowledge base there.

It looks that Mailmarshal doesn't know that the ACE archive file is 
actually an archive file so it will not try to unpack it but because 
Mailmarshal recognises ACE files it won't be blocked by the unknow 
attachment rules.

In relation to encrypt zip files and the rest that won't work as Hayden 
said that if it can unpack the file it won't release the file.
