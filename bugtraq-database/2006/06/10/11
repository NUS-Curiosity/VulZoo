Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0034

Package names:	   binutils, mysql, spamassassin 
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-06-09
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  binutils 
  Binutils is a collection of utilities necessary for compiling programs.
  It includes the assembler and linker, as well as a number of other
  miscellaneous programs for dealing with executable formats.

  mysql 
  MySQL is a true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL (Structured Query
  Language) database server. MySQL is a client/server implementation
  that consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many different client
  programs/libraries.

  spamassassin
  SpamAssassin provides you with a way to reduce, if not completely
  eliminate, Unsolicited Bulk Email (or "spam") from your incoming email.
  It can be invoked by a MDA such as sendmail or postfix, or can be called
  from a procmail script, .forward file, etc. It uses a 
  genetic-algorithm-evolved scoring system to identify messages which look
  spammy, then adds headers to the message so they can be filtered by the
  user's mail reading software.  This distribution includes the
  spamd/spamc components which considerably speeds processing of mail.

Problem description:
  binutils < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been identified which could be
    exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
    service. This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error in the libbfd 
    library ["bfd/tekhex.c"] when processing a file containing malformed
    a Tektronix Hex Format (TekHex) record, which could be exploited by
    attackers to crash an affected application or compromise a vulnerable
    system via a malicious file.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-2362 to this issue.

  mysql < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > 
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in MySQL caused due to
    an error within the server when parsing a query string that is escaped
    with the "mysql_real_escape_string()" function. This can potentially be
    exploited in an environment that uses multi-byte character encoding to
    bypass SQL injection escaping.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-2753 to this issue. 

  spamassassin < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in SpamAssassin, which
    can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
    SpamAssassin when running with vpopmail and the paranoid (-P) switch,
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted
    message that is not properly handled when invoking spamd with the
    virtual pop username.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-2447 to this issue.
