	code available?


Dear Andrey,

 can you give your comments on why vulnerability that looks so dangerous
 according  to  description (remote kernel-level buffer overflow in ICMP
 processing,  according  to  MS) rated "high", not "critical"? Are there
 are  mitigating  factors for Windows 2003 with RRAS enabled or any RRAS
 installation is vulnerable?

 P.S.  last  instruction  I've got was to publish information only after
 vendor's fix. I did :)
