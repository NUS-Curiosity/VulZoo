Subject: [REVERSEMODE ADVISORY] MS06-030 - Microsoft Mrxsmb.sys privilege
 escalation advisory



Microsoft Server Message Block Redirector Driver (mrxsmb.sys)does not
verify  user-mode buffer properly, allowing to any user to overwrite any
desired memory address. The successful exploitation results in Ring0
code execution.

+ Paper/Advisory: -Reversing mrxsmb.sys. Chapter I "Getting Ring0"-(pdf)
+ Exploit code (c source code)

This issue has been addressed in the recent bulletin, MS06-030 .
