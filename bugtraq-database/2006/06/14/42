Synopsis
========

A flaw in DokuWiki's spell checker allows for the execution of
arbitrary PHP commands, even without proper authentication.

Background
==========

DokuWiki is a simple to use wiki targeted at developer teams,
workgroups and small companies.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /    Vulnerable    /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/dokuwiki      < 20060309-r1               >= 20060309-r1

Description
===========

Stefan Esser discovered that the DokuWiki spell checker fails to
properly sanitize PHP's "complex curly syntax".

Impact
======

A unauthenticated remote attacker may execute arbitrary PHP commands -
and thus possibly arbitrary system commands - with the permissions of
the user running the webserver that serves DokuWiki pages.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All DokuWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/dokuwiki-20060309-r1"
