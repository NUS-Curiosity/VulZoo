3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in PicoZip, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the 
"zipinfo.dll" info tip shell extension when reading a ACE, RAR, or
ZIP archive that contains a file with an overly long filename. This
can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when the user
moves the mouse cursor over a malicious archive either in Windows
Explorer or from any program that uses the file-open dialog box.

Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution.
