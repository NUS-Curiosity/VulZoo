I performed this research while developing NFR's web signatures, and found
that all web servers I tested (several years ago) handled end-of-lines using
"\x0d\x0a" and "\x0a" interchangeably. If you find a web server that
interprets "index.php" in the example above as an actual filename, I for one
would be very interested in knowing about it.
