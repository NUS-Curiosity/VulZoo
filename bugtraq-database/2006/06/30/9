The related SANS Internet Storm Center Diary entry is the following:
http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=1448

This story was updated later on Wednesday to include detailed test results.
Secunia test link included to SA20825 advisory was used.

I have not reproduced it with Firefox 1.5.0.4 in Win XP SP2 and W2K SP4 SF,
for some reason.
Firefox version is localized in my test environment, as well.

Tested on:
Firefox 1.5.0.4 on Mac OS 10.4 - not vulnerable
Firefox 1.5.0.4 on FreeBSD 6.0 (x86)  - not vulnerable
Firefox 1.5.0.4 on Windows XP Professional SP2 - not vulnerable
Internet Explorer 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp.050622-1524 on Windows XP Professional
SP2 - vulnerable
