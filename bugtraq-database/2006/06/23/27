Subject: Dating biz@ dating script v1.0 - XSS


Custom dating biz@ dating script v1.0

Homepage:
http://www.e-cbd.biz/php_dating_script.html

Affected files:

*Profiles
user_view.php
photo_create.php
---------------------------------

The edit profile form can be spoofed and a user can enter any data he wishes and it will update his profile. The "Choose an opening like and Pople say you look like" input boxes are the only ones that when entered, will be reviewed by the sites admin. Max char limit stored in the db for each profile box appears to be 36 chars EXCEPT for the input box "Special Cases". This box is where I will 

display our XSS example with the cookie info.

PoC:

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
