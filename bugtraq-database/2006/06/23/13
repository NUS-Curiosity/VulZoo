There are other ways that might carry a bigger injection threat:

Style sheet:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml
/reference/properties/charset_1.asp

Object property:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml
/reference/properties/charset.asp


By extension, it should also work for inline styles.
