Subject: Vishing (voice/phone phishing) - public incident


Last year some of us made jokes about Vishing on funsec, today it's a
reality. Here is the incident going public:

Special thanks to the good guys at Websense and the PIRT guys at
CastleCOPS PIRT.

I guess jokes about Vishing with a heavy Russian accent were good, too bad
this wave file doesn't have that accent. :)

The attacked party is Santa Barbara Bank & Trust. I suppose the IRS will
also take interest in this.
