    http://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-457

Description:
    In previous kernel versions, systems that use the SCTP protocol
    are vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks including
    remotely-triggered kernel crashes, and all systems are vulnerable
    to local denial of service including locally-triggered kernel
    hangs.
    
    This update requires a reboot to implement the fixes.
