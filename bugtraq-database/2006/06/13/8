Subject: ZoneEdit.com Forcing Pop-Unders on
	WebForward-Configured Domains


Problem:

DNS service ZoneEdit.com now owned by MyDomains.com has started forcing 
JavaScript pop-Unders onto users' browsers when the domain owner uses 
the ZoneEdit WebForward feature.

Details:

Casale Media, Inc. is the Pop-Under Spammer responsible for paying My 
Domains cash money to distribute this crap to users. Example script 
shown below, embedded within the WebForward "Cloaking" frame.

script language="JavaScript" src="http://as.casalemedia.com/sd?s=65701&f=1"


Possible Resolutions:

Stop using ZoneEdit for backup/failover or primary DNS service.

Remove the economic incentive to lie, cheat and steal.

Prosecute the offenders and send them to prison.
