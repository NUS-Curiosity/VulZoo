Details
=======

Wireless Control System is a centralized, systems-level application
for managing and controlling lightweight access points and wireless
LAN controllers for the Cisco Unified Wireless Network.

WCS contains multiple vulnerabilities including information
disclosure and privilege escalation issues. The issues are detailed
below:

  * CSCsd15955-Remote users can connect to the WCS internal database
    with an undocumented username and hard-coded password, gaining
    access to the sensitive configuration information of managed
    wireless access points.
  * CSCsd15951-The undocumented database username and password are
    present in several WCS files in clear text.
  * CSCse21391-WCS installations contain the default administrator
    username root with a default password of public. The password is
    not required to be changed during installation or upon the
    initial login. There is a workaround for this vulnerability.
  * CSCsd71397-A remote user can read from or write to arbitrary
    locations in the filesystem of a WCS system via the internal TFTP
    server. This problem only occurs if the directory path chosen by
    the user during the installation of WCS for the root of the
    internal TFTP server contains a space character. There is a
    workaround for this vulnerability.
  * CSCse01127-The login page for the WCS HTTP interface fails to
    properly sanitize user-supplied data for malicious script code.
    This may result in the ability for an attacker to entice a user
    to access a malicious URL which executes arbitrary script code in
    the user's web browser.
  * CSCse01409-The WCS HTTP server does not properly secure certain
    directories, potentially allowing access to sensitive information
    like WCS usernames and directory paths.

These issues are documented by the following Cisco bug IDs:

  * CSCsd15955 ( registered customers only) -WCS DBserver is remotely
    accessible using Solid SQL and static password
  * CSCsd15951 ( registered customers only) -Database passwords are
    written in clear text on the program folders
  * CSCse21391 ( registered customers only) -WCS ships with default
    administrator account and password
  * CSCsd71397 ( registered customers only) -WCS tftp read/writes to
    C:\ if given dir has a space
  * CSCse01127 ( registered customers only) -Possible CSS attack on
    login page of WCS
  * CSCse01409 ( registered customers only) -WCS allows
    unauthenticated access to user list and html files on server

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities presented in this
advisory have different impacts.

  * CSCsd15955-May result in the exposure of sensitive configuration
    information for wireless access points managed by the WCS server,
    including encryption keys. With the encryption keys for managed
    wireless networks, an attacker can intercept and decrypt network
    traffic.
  * CSCsd15951-May allow an attacker to gain access to the WCS
    internal database.
  * CSCse21391-May allow an attacker to gain complete control of a
    WCS installation.
  * CSCsd71397-May result in the ability to read from and write to
    arbitrary locations in the filesystem of a system running WCS,
    including the ability to overwrite and create new files.
  * CSCse01127-Exploitation may allow an attacker to execute
    arbitrary script code in a user's web browser. This may be used
    to obtain sensitive session information which can be used to
    access the WCS management interface.
  * CSCse01409-Exploitation may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive
    WCS configuration data such as WCS usernames and directory
    installation paths.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

WCS version 4.0 can be obtained from
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/Wireless_Control_System_Software.
Please contact the Cisco TAC to obtain earlier versions of WCS
software.

+---------------------------------------+

Users of the 3.2 software version can upgrade to 3.2(63) to receive
all fixes. CSCse21391 currently has no fix, although there is a
workaround that will completely eliminate the vulnerability. Fixed
software will be available in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Workarounds
===========

There are are no workarounds for vulnerabilities described in
CSCsd15955 (default database account and password), CSCsd15951
(database user and password in clear text), CSCse01127 (XSS) and
CSCse01409 (unprotected HTTP directories).

There is a workaround for the vulnerability described in CSCse21391
(default administrator account and password). Users can change the
password for the root username via the WCS HTTP management interface.
Select Administration -> Accounts -> root to change the password.

There is a workaround for the vulnerability described in CSCsd71397
(TFTP file read and write). Follow these steps to mitigate the TFTP
vulnerability.

  * Stop the WCS service via Programs -> Wireless Control System ->
    StopWCS.
  * Edit the file \webnms\conf\NmsProcessesBE.conf. WCS is typically
    installed in C:\Program Files\WCS32. Modify the section
   
        # java com.adventnet.nms.tftp.NmsTftpServer [TFTP_ROOT_DIRECTORY dir] [PORT portNo]
        # RJS WARNING - If you change these lines, you must change the installer.
        PROCESS             com.adventnet.nms.tftp.NmsTftpServer
        ARGS            TFTP_ROOT_DIRECTORY C:/some directory PORT 69 RETRIES 3 TIMEOUT 30000
        
   
    by placing quotes around the directory path like "C:/some
    directory".
  * Start the WCS service via Programs -> Wireless Control System ->
    StartWCS.
