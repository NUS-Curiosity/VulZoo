In this time, none

Description:
Syworks SafeNET is network resource protection solution which organized by client/server, but that has serious vulnerability.
It has client policy file that can be modified by end user.

In file of policy.dat
08h to 16h: Ascii value of Syworks SafeNET server address
18h: The switch of Syworks SafeNET client (On: 0x01, Off: 0x00)
1ch to 1dh: ICMP limit (0x0000 to 0xFFFF)
20h to 21h: Broadcast limit (0x0000 to 0xFFFF)
