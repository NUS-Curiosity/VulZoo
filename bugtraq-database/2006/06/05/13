The word-wrapping of his mail client broke the exploit.  If you clean that
up by only putting line-breaks between tags, it seems to work.  Try:

 	http://static.die.net/firefox-marquee-dos/

This breaks Firefox/1.5.0.3 on Ubuntu 5.0.4 and WinXP, and Firefox/1.5.0.2
on Ubuntu 5.1.0.  The browser freezes and on Linux the window stops
repainting.
