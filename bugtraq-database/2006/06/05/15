Subject: New <<BackTrack release announcement


Muts & I like to announce a new and stable release of "<< BackTrack".
This project i a merger out of two well known security penetration
testing focused linux live distributions (Whax and Auditor). After
hundreds of combined man hours, we can provide you with the finest
linux and windows tools on one CD. Yes, i said windows tools. Using
Wine, we have embedded some of the tools missing in the linux
environment.

Get your free copy at one of our mirror at http://www.remote-exploit.org

The complete list of changes, fixes and tools is not done yet but
partially available on out website at http://www.remote-exploit.org.

Because of the merger of two completely different distributions, there
are some differences compared to Auditor Whax. The quality of this CD
is directly depending on the quality of users feedback. We have some
minor known errors and constantly maintain the CD. We expect to
release about quarterly during 2006/2007 to enhance quality.

If you are looking for support check out the forum section on our
website or the irc channel #remote-exploit at irc.freenode.org.

DVD-Release:
We have now a DVD version finished which contains also Rainbow-tables,
Openoffice, VMWare player and some other nifty stuff. Unfortunately we
didn't decided how to release it. Maybe there will be a small amount
of money charged, because we do all our work in private time and the
donations are more than lousy. Feel free to contact us if your
interested in this version.

Customization:
Yes, we do customizations on a fair donation base.
