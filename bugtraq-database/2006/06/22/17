No, it's ISO-8859-1. According to

http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-035.pdf

Page 27 (37):

"11.2 Transformation from 7-bit to 8-bit codes

Within a CC-data-element any 7-bit combination has an equivalent 8-bit
form comprising b7 to b1 of the 7-bit form, together with a b8 of ZERO."


the MSB must be set to 0. The folks at Mozilla say it is evangelism for
some broken AOL pages, but then I ask why evangelism, when it does not
work with IE?
