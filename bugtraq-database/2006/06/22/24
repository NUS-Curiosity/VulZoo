We have addressed these security issues (where applicable) and this article is no longer revelant.

We would like to inform readers of this article that the referenced folder 'messenger' was never available to the general public, therefore these findings cannot be a fair representation of the final product.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us for more information.
