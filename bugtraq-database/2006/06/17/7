Subject: PHP security (or the lack thereof)



>From my own mail archives, PHP appears to make up at least 4%
of the email to bugtraq I see - or over 1000 issues since 1995,
out of the 25,000 I have saved.

People complain about applications like sendmail...in the same
period, it has been resopnsible for less than 200.

Do we have a new contender for worst security offender ever
written ?

And where are the more secure drop-in rewrites ?
