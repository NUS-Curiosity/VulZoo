That's a rather odd question.  Microsoft has been (rightly) criticized 
for providing server *applications* that are insecurely configured (as 
you point out), but php is not an application.  Php is a language, so 
until a program or script is written and accessible from the server, it 
does nothing.  Php, by itself, is not accessible externally because it's 
not running a daemon that opens a port.

Register_globals is set to off by default, so I suppose in that sense 
you can say it's "secure" by default, but it's really a inert object 
until someone does something with it.

Any language can be misused to create insecure software.  The more 
powerful the language, the less difficult it is to create security holes 
(or perhaps the more obvious the holes really are.)  But until an 
attacker has an open port to attack (unless they're sitting at the 
console), everything on a server is "secure".  (Of course the server is 
also useless, but that's beside the point.)
