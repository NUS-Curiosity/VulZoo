Synopsis
========

A heap overflow vulnerability in the Hashcash utility could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Hashcash is a utility for generating Hashcash tokens, a proof-of-work
system to reduce the impact of spam.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/hashcash       < 1.21                            >= 1.21

Description
===========

Andreas Seltenreich has reported a possible heap overflow in the
array_push() function in hashcash.c, as a result of an incorrect amount
of allocated memory for the "ARRAY" structure.

Impact
======

By sending malicious entries to the Hashcash utility, an attacker may
be able to cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Hashcash users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/hashcash-1.21"
