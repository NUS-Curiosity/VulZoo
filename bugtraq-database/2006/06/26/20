Mosaic didn't really handle charsets.

It used Motif as the underlying toolkit, and rendered the binary text stream
using XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET, which could default to ISO 8859-1 most of
the time, or something else if you tweaked your X11 installation and
properties.

So, basically, Mosaic worked as firefox/opera do, not as IE.
