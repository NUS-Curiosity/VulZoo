I guess most of the remaining offending apps were written in C: as much as 96% ?!!
(including basically all of microsoft's stuff!!)

Surely the least secure language of all time !!!

Note also that no vulnerable apps were written in:
 - cobol, rpg3, prolog, ada, scheme, lisp, pl/1, occam, modula-2, or MIX

We're planning to roll out our next enterprise ecommerce grid as a set of
modula-2 plugins to cobol-based container controlled by a dynamic gridded
application matrix written in prolog, all running on highly parallel
lisp machines.

;)
