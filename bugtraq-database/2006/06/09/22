Synopsis
========

Vixie Cron allows local users to execute programs as root.

Background
==========

Vixie Cron is a command scheduler with extended syntax over cron.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-process/vixie-cron      < 4.1-r9                    >= 4.1-r9

Description
===========

Roman Veretelnikov discovered that Vixie Cron fails to properly check
whether it can drop privileges accordingly if setuid() in do_command.c
fails due to a user exceeding assigned resource limits.

Impact
======

Local users can execute code with root privileges by deliberately
exceeding their assigned resource limits and then starting a command
through Vixie Cron. This requires resource limits to be in place on the
machine.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Vixie Cron users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-process/vixie-cron-4.1-r9"

==========
