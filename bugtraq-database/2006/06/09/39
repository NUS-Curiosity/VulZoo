3) Vendor's Description of Software

SelectaPix is a free (GPL Licence), highly configurable PHP/MySQL 
image gallery system which can be integrated into your existing site 
in minutes. The password-protected admin section allows you to upload 
up to 10 jpeg images in one go, and arrange them into albums and 
sub-albums.

======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in SelectaPix, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct 
cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks.

1) Some input is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL 
query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting 
arbitrary SQL code.

Examples:
http://[host]/view_album.php?albumID=[code]
http://[host]/popup.php?albumID=2&imageID=[code]
http://[host]/index.php?albumID=[code]
* The "username" and "passwd" parameters passed in "admin/member.php".

This can further be exploited to bypass the authentication process and 
access the administration section.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled 
(except for the "albumID" parameter).

2) Input passed to the "albumID" parameter in "popup.php" and 
"view_album.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to 
the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script 
code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 1.31. Prior 
versions may also be affected.

======================================================================
5) Solution

Update to version 1.4.
