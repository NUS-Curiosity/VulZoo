Synopsis
========

Format string vulnerabilities in mod_auth_pgsql may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

mod_auth_pgsql is an Apache2 module that allows user authentication
against a PostgreSQL database.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/mod_auth_pgsql       < 2.0.3                     >= 2.0.3

Description
===========

The error logging functions of mod_auth_pgsql fail to validate certain
strings before passing them to syslog, resulting in format string
vulnerabilities.

Impact
======

An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
Apache2 server by sending specially crafted login names.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All mod_auth_pgsql users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/mod_auth_pgsql-2.0.3"
