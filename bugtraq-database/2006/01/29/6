Synopsis
========

Paros's database component is installed without a password, allowing
execution of arbitrary system commands.

Background
==========

Paros is an intercepting proxy between a web server and a client meant
to be used for security assessments. It allows the user to watch and
modify the HTTP(S) traffic.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-proxy/paros      <= 3.2.5                             > 3.2.5

Description
===========

Andrew Christensen discovered that in older versions of Paros the
database component HSQLDB is installed with an empty password for the
database administrator "sa".

Impact
======

Since the database listens globally by default, an attacker can connect
and issue arbitrary commands, including execution of binaries installed
on the host.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Paros users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --snyc
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/paros-3.2.8"
