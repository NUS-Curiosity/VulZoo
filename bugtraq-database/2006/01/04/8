        CESA-2005-003


1. Systems affected:

        KDE 3.2.0 up to including KDE 3.5.0
	KOffice 1.3.0 up to including KOffice 1.4.2


2. Overview:

        kpdf, the KDE pdf viewer, shares code with xpdf. xpdf contains
        multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities that allow specially
	crafted pdf files, when opened, to overflow heap allocated
	buffers and execute arbitrary code.

        The patches announced in the KDE security advisory 20051207-1
        were incomplete. This re-issued advisory contains updated patches
        that correct issues with the original upstream patch that were
        found and fixed by Ludwig Nussel, Martin Pitt and Chris Evans.
        The previous patches and advisory have been removed.


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied pdf files can be used to execute arbitrary
	code on the client machine.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
