Subject: Microsoft Exchange Critical Vulnerability


John Heasman and Mark Litchfield of NGSSoftware have discovered a critical 
vulnerability
affecting Microsoft Exchange.  The vulnerable versions include:

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4
Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server Pack 3 with the Post-Service Pack 3 Update 
Rollup of August 2004

Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Exchange Server 
2003 Service Pack 2
are *not* affected.


The vulnerability potentially allows execution of arbitrary code when the 
Microsoft
Exchange Server Information Store processes a specially crafted email 
message.


The flaw has now been addressed and patches are available from:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-003.mspx


NGSSoftware are going to withhold details of this flaw for three months. 
Full details will
be published on the 10th April 2006.  This three month window will allow 
system
administrators the time needed to obtain the patch before the details are 
released to the
general public.  This reflects NGSSoftware's approach to responsible 
disclosure.
