Subject: Cerberus Helpdesk vulnerable to XSS


Inputs in the Cerberus Helpdesk is not properly sanitized, and XSS is possible in a lot of the systems input fields and url parameters.

You can add XSS that will hit every user of the system, and even simple scripting tags like <script>alert(�f�)</script> is allowed
