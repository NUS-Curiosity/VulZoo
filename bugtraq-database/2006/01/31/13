Subject: Re: EasyCMS vulnerable to XSS injection.


Kind of you to notice, our system will during the next week be patched for XSS flaws in the different input fields which might be of concern for XSS. The rest of the system will also be checked to reensure that all user-input is processed securely.

We take this matter seriusly, and would like to inform that you are referring to the input fields of the contact form - which outputs a reciept with the given data which was not checked for XSS, since we don't use cookies in Easy CMS.

I will update this post when we have more news on this upcomming security update.

regards,
Kim Steinhaug
Easy CMS developer
