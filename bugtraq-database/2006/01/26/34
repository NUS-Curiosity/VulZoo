I don't agree - basic security says that no user should have more access
than he strictly needs. A user that only uses a fixed set of queries
doesn't need to see how the database is laid out - if he can, an
attacker wouldn't need to guess the names of other fields that may
contain sensitive information.

Obviously those fields should be access-restricted as well, but you
shouldn't make things easier on any front.
