Subject: BlackWorm: 2 million infected? ISP notifications.


2 million hits:

The counter is now at 2 million. Check out Sunbelt’s blog on this:
http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/blackworm-worm-over-18-million.html

 From past experience the 2 million hits probably mean a little over a 
million users infected.

ISP notification:

In cooperation with many (US-CERT, FBI, SANS ISC, many in the industry, 
etc.) and with special thanks to:
Dr. Johannes Ullrich (SANS ISC) and Prof. Randal Vaughn (Randy — 
Baylor.edu), an attempt to contact all the ISP’s who have infected users 
has been made.

A new list of IP’s that hit the (still secret) counter address is being 
compiled, so we can make another run of ISP notifications.

The reporting emails are sent from Baylor.edu and contain a URL to the 
SANS ISC with a time-limited specially crafted URL for the respective 
ISP authorities to get their infected users’ information from.

I'll update here when possible if there is anything to update.
