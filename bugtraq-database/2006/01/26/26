Synopsis
========

Gallery is possibly vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack that
could allow arbitrary JavaScript code execution.

Background
==========

Gallery is a web application written in PHP which is used to organize
and publish photo albums. It allows multiple users to build and
maintain their own albums. It also supports the mirroring of images on
other servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/gallery       < 1.5.2                           >= 1.5.2

Description
===========

Peter Schumacher discovered that Gallery fails to sanitize the fullname
set by users, possibly leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Impact
======

By setting a specially crafted fullname, an attacker can inject and
execute script code in the victim's browser window and potentially
compromise the user's gallery.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gallery users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-1.5.2"

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
