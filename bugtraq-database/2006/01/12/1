The patch Ilfak wrote can't work on a Windows 9x machine since it relies 
on technology that did not exist in Windows 9x.

The idea that Gibson is going to "write" a patch for Windows 9x and save 
the mankind sounds pretty ridiculous. Even if there will be a patch for 
Windows 9x written by third parties *and* GRC happens to be one of them 
(or at least claims being one of them, probably the best and/or the only 
one), I am pretty confident that Gibsons solution is to be considered 
the least trustworthy one. He never published sophisticated software 
(and still there is no claim that he really wrote the software he 
publishes) and he apparently has absolutely no clue about the security 
implications he is talking about. GRC looks like a huge marketing bubble 
without *any* fundamental security researcher knowledge behind it.

For more information on the status of the WMF vulnerability in Windows 
9x i'd like to refer to an article by Swa Frantzen at SANS ISC:
