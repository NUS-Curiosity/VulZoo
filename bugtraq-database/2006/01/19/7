Subject: HITBSecConf2005 Videos Released !


Hi all,

After a long wait and a series of misadventures, we are pleased to
announce the availability of the HITBSecConf2005 Kuala Lumpur
videos.

You can grab them here: http://video.hitb.org/2005.html

The videos are distributed via Bit Torrent network and are broken
down into two separate packages.

HITBSecConf2006 will be taking place this year from September
16th - 19th at The Westin Kuala Lumpur. Stay tuned for the CfP
which will be announced sometime next month.

Cheers and enjoy the videos.
