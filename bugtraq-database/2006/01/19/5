Subject: Re: MSN Messenger Password Decrypter for WinXP/2003

the MSN-Password-Recovery.exe is a normal nullsoft installer.

after installing the software there's one pe-file called:

MSN Password Recovery.exe

which is upx packed. after unpacking with upx -d

i throwed it into IDA and had a short look for suspicious code snippets.

funny is this one:

.text:004021AF                 call    ebp ; SendDlgItemMessageA
.text:004021B1                 push    offset OutputString ; "Greetings to 
all reversers who reverse" ...
.text:004021B6                 call    OutputDebugStringA
.text:00401260 OutputString    db 'Greetings to all reversers who reverse 
this program - it',27h
.text:00401260                 db 's easier to make another program rather 
than brake ours!',0Ah


;)

basically it enums the creds and if it finds one, the tool looks eg. at: 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\Creds\username@...bla.com

key ps:password and it's values

then decrypts with CryptUnprotectData() and shows you the password to the 
cred if you're a registered customer. ;)

but i really can't find malicious stuff in there, nor phone home stuff.

with regards,

frank
