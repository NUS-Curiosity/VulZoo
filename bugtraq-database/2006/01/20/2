Hi,
This is the author of the MSN Messenger Password Recovery tool. Searched in google and found this post.
I would like to assure you that this program is not dangerous and does not perform any illegal actions. All it does is read the registry values and decrypt them. What's wrong with using UPX?
As far as the link at the bottom is concerned - we are in the process of making the Skype tool and will put a proper website in place once we are finished.
Also, regarding you message that this program is malicious:
