Subject: Re: Microsoft knew about the WMF flaw for years



Throughout all this discussion, we should not forget that it was not
just Microsoft, but other developers who appear to have implemented
and preserved this same WMF functionality over the years, e.g. Wine.
The problem might have originated with Microsoft's design choices way
back when, but few subsequent WMF implementations seem to have dealt
with this functionality.  This is a general challenge with design
flaws, however.
