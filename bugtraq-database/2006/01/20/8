Subject: Re: Directory traversal in phpXplorer


Hey,

I just wanted to point out a couple of things I neglected to mention
in my first reply to this advisory:
1) Even if something isn't a critical problem, a vendor should still
respond to the issue, if for no other reason than to straighten out
the situation with the user who had enough insight to spot it and
assume its a problem.
2) Only reporting a bug between Dec 20 - Jan 4 is in bad practice, I
think.  The advisory noted those two dates as when the vendor was sent
an advisory.  As most people know this  period of time is considered
Christmas and New Years vacation in the USA and other places.  Beyond
that the phpXplorer project is an open source project and may not have
dedicated support.

In short a little more leeway should be profited during the holidays
and vendors should always respond to issue like this so no one gets
hung out to dry like this.

Best Regards,
Stan Bubrouski
