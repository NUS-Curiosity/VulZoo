Hm, since when path disclosure is "medium importance"?

The first one verified as applicable to 3.8.1 too (easily
avoidable by adding IP- or user-based access restriction
to /typo3 since that's administrative backend anyways),
and the rest doesn't disclose anything on properly configured
at least display_errors-wise webserver, which is a documented
recommended (and often reiterated everywhere) PHP setup.
