"We?"  "Us?"  Just who are you referring to?  A vulnerability was 
discovered, they researched it, created and tested a patch (like they always 
do) and issued it.  Done.  Move on, please.  There is nothing to learn here, 
other than the fact that everyone and their brother came out of the woodwork 
saying that the world was going to end and spreading mis-information.  I 
believe even *you* posted erroneous information.  Nice.

First everyone bitches about how bad Microsoft security is, how they don't 
"get it" and how they don't care.  Then, when they issue a patch 
out-of-cycle, we hear pompous comments like "See!  I told you so!  They can 
do it if they want to, so they should do EVERYTHING like this!!"   They 
handled it the right way, and still, they get criticism.  Great.

Oh, that's rich.  Let's see-- wasn't it YOU that said to Dave Litchfield 
regarding Oracle:

So, it's OK for Oracle to have the worst security (both in product and in 
attitude) of any vendor on the face of the planet,  and to take the "Oh, 
let's not pick on them by singling them out" mindset, but now you are 
DEMANDING that every patch be treated like the WMF patch just because YOU 
said so??  Why are you singling out Microsoft here?

What about WINE?  Where is your DEMAND that THEY patch immediately?  Where 
is the patch, anyway?  Oh, there isn't one yet.  Shouldn't you be ripping 
them a new one?  After all, WINE is still vulnerable to the WMF exploit.

Oh, I totally get your drift.  You are biased, and speak with a forked 
tongue.
