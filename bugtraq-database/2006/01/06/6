Nice, seems to crash the intel graphics controller.

Here's a zip for your perusal.

Wow, a simple big jpeg completely crashes (and reboots) Windows XP SP2 with
all the latest patches when viewed in IE6.

-> DON'T GO with Internet Explorer if you don't want to crash:
http://www.geocities.com/teh_kids/index.html (no problems whatsoever in
Firefox or Opera).

Is this a known unpatched vulnerability?
