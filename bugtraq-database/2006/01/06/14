Subject: What is sbininitd port 65534 ???


  I've seen graphs on the sans.org site indicating that traffic on this
port has seen a major rise.  It sounds like something linux might be
vulnerable to.  I've tried finding out what gives, but neither Google
nor the major security sites I've tried show any hits for "sbininitd",
other than to note that port 65534 is used by the sbininitd trojan.

  My ADSL-modem-cum-souter blocks unsolicited traffic by default.  I've
put in a specific packet-filter rule to block the port for now, but I'd
really like to know what I'm up against, and more info on protection.
