Subject: Re: what we REALLY learned from WMF


It's easy for us on this side to Monday morning quarterback and say "oh 
make it so".  There are times too that I go...okay ...come on ...how 
many days has it taken for that to get fixed?  But then again, I don't 
write code, I don't track back dependencies, I don't ensure umpteem 
languages still work and all the other interconnectivity between 
programs and code still function.

It's easy to say this stuff on this side.... but understand that the 
mere release of a beta patch puts in jeopardy all of the consumer home 
machines and small businesses that have no admin to protect them and 
take mitigation measures.

What "I" really learned from this is to decide my "OWN" risk tolerance 
and stop listening to all the sites and blogs and news reports and what 
not that spread a lot of FUD and misinformation and used this many times 
as a PR vehicle.  Only I know what risk I will tolerate.  That's what I 
learned from this.
