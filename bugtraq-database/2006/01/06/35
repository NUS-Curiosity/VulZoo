Synopsis
========

HylaFAX is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution and unauthorized
access vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

HylaFAX is an enterprise-class system for sending and receiving
facsimile messages and for sending alpha-numeric pages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/hylafax     < 4.2.3-r1                       >= 4.2.3-r1

Description
===========

Patrice Fournier discovered that HylaFAX runs the notify script on
untrusted user input. Furthermore, users can log in without a password
when HylaFAX is installed with the pam USE-flag disabled.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit the input validation vulnerability to run
arbitrary code as the user running HylaFAX, which is usually uucp. The
password vulnerability could be exploited to log in without proper user
credentials.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All HylaFAX users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/hylafax-4.2.3-r1"
