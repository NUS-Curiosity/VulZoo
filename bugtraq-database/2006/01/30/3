Amit,

Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape are vulnerable to this flaw (and probably so is
Konqueror). You are right in regard to MSIE 6, however - my apologies.

I tested the vulnerability with *.com.pl for Firefox, and then followed up
with a quicker test for *.ids.pl with MSIE, assuming it wouldn't implement
such a kludge - my bad.

So, to sum up - the first bug applies to Mozilla-based browsers, but not
to MSIE; the other two bugs apply to all browsers.
