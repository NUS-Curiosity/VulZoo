	password


Wasn't this reported a long time ago?

Paros is prone to a remote authentication bypass vulnerability.

This issue may result in the disclosure of sensitive information, and
possible execution of commands on the victim machine.

Paros version 3.2.5 is affected; earlier versions may also be vulnerable.

Update: version 3.2.6 was released and addresses this issue from
remote computers, as the database listens only on localhost by
default. This still allows local users to connect, as the default
username of "sa" with a blank password is still used.
