Subject: WehnTrust - When you have to trust Wehntrust


Dear  List,

Small blurp I came around; when Wehntrust creates the autostart key
it forgets to correctly quote the string in the key and thus may
trigger an autostart of c:\program.bat|exe|com up-on reboot... [2]

Quoting [1] :
^^^^^^^^^^^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
c:\program files\sub dir\program.exe,

In this case, the system will successively expand the string when
interpreting the file path, until a module is encountered to execute.
The string used in the above example would be interpreted as follows:

   c:\program.exe
   c:\program files\sub.exe
   c:\program files\sub dir\program.exe
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
