Subject: Visual Studio Remote Code Execution


Hi,

I coded a remote code execution exploit for visual studio 2005 and below.

If you open a solution and you click on the Form1.cs file the code inside the UserControl1_Load function is executed. You can code your backdoor inside this function. Basically the exploit only start a calc.exe application.

Have a look at
