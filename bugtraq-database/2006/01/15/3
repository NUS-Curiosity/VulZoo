Subject: EZDatabase Directory Transversal,
	XSS and Path Disclosure Vulnerability


Synopsis: EZDatabase directory transversal, XSS and path disclosure
          vulnerability

Product: EZDatabase
         http://www.ezdatabase.org

Version: Confirmed on EZDatabase < 2.1.2

Author: Josh Zlatin-Amishav

Date: January 15, 2006

Background:
Written in PHP and MySQL, ezDatabase is the foundation for your online
databases. It is a powerful web based application that allows even
non-technical users to create online databases for their website.
ezDatabase will do the hard work while you concentrate on building the
databases you want.

Issue:
The $p variable is not properly sanitized in index.php. Note the code in
index.php tacks on a ".php" to any file requested.

PoC:
http://localhost/index.php?db_id=1&cat_id=1&display=30&p=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E&rowstart=90
