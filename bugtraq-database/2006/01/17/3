Subject: Sun Java Update Scheduler gets placed in
	autostart without absolute path quotes

Name: SunJavaUpdateSched

Value: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_05\bin\jusched.exe

 

…Meaning that Windows will attempt to execute C:\Program.exe first, and then
the rest of the path if that doesn’t exist.

 

Might be a bug in the old version – I haven’t updated yet. Not a very
critical bug, although the autostart is in HKLM, so users can install
malware on other users’ accounts.

 

Kind regards,

Paul Nickerson
