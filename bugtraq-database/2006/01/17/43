Since Roundcube is only available in Alpha version, it's pre-configured with a high verbose level. It allows you to configure wether erros should be displayed or just be logged into a file:
$rcmail_config['debug_level'] = 1;

Also the reported error is a custom message that RoundCube produces while checking the GET parameters and not a PHP generated include failure or whatever.

Regards,
Thomas
