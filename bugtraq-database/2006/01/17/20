Subject: Re: Hacking With The Google Search Engine


And Foundstone has this free tool SiteDigger 2
which uses the GHDB signatures or their own signatures.
You need a google licence key to use the tool for automated searches,
up to 1000 searches a day, while the GHDB already contains 1265
signatures and 175 foundstone signatures, so you might want to tweak
them.

Or j0hnny's own gooscan Google scanner application.
