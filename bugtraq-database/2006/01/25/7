Subject: ANN: New release of CORE FORCE free endpoint security package


Greetings

CoreLabs, the research arm of Core Security Technologies is pleased to
announce a new release of CORE FORCE, a free software endpoint security
solution.

CORE FORCE 080.120 is now available for download at
http://force.coresecurity.fom

This new release ships new UI improvements based on feedback from users
during the last few months. It also integrates and improves
compatibility and stability work done since the release of CORE FORCE R0.70.

* New network activity viewer that lists all TCP, UDP and ICMP traffic
  in the network.
  - Firewall permissions can be created based on a connection's
    information.
  - For TCP connections, an additional column displaying the state of
    the connection is available.
  - "Go to process" command to go to the entry in the process viewer for
     the process that generated the permission.
* Process viewer UI rewritten to support dynamic updates and changes.
  - Simplified display of information about a process (with less
    emphasis in processes' windows).
  - New command to add a new security profile for a running process.
  - Fixed sorting by the PID column (numbers are not compared as strings
     anymore).
* Log viewer updates
  - "Go to process" support to find the entry for the process that
    generated the log entry in the process viewer.
* "Add new program" wizard now allows the user to select a program from
   a list that shows the programs available in the Programs section of
   Windows' Start menu.
* The launch control information for a security profile downloaded from
  the community web site is now correctly updated to match the
  executable file previously selected in the "Add new program wizard".

The security modules have also been updated to fix a number of problems
reported by users.

* Fixed a race condition that would generate a BSOD in the firewall.
* Fixed evaluation of registry permissions for registry values (in
  some conditions permissions from parent keys were not being enforced).
* A potential BSOD when handling new permissions in the runtime
  repository of permissions.

We've also integrated a new crash handler into CORE FORCE's
configuration UI to be able to gather technical feedback when the
program unexpectedly fails. This feature will allow us to improve the
development of fixes for new bugs.
