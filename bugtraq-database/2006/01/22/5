Subject: RE: MySQL 5.0 information leak?


Traditionally the schema for a database is NOT secure information.
Applications download this information to build queries on the fly.

The essential problem is relying on security by obscurity, "I have user
accounts (nss) that have publicly available credentials but noone [sic]
should be able to see how the database really is organized".

Hi.

I just upgraded to mysql 5.0.18 and started using all those cool new
features. :)

But concerning VIEWs, I think the information_schema is too verbose to the
user. I started creating a VIEW that searches information from several
tables, mangles the data and gives the user a clean table with his data. So
far, so good.

But I only give the user access to this VIEW, so he cannot see what's done
to get his data from several tables.

SHOW CREATE VIEW myview;
does (correctly) result in an error that the user is not allowed to see the
CREATE VIEW.

But SELECT * FROM information_schema.views; returns the full query that
ceates the desired VIEW.

I think of this as a security issue because I have user accounts (nss) that
have publicly available credentials but noone should be able to see how the
database really is organized. 

What do you think of this? Bug?

cu, Bernd
