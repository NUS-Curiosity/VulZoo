Synopsis
========

KDE fails to properly validate URIs when handling javascript,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. kjs is the javascript interpreter used in
Konqueror and other parts of KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdelibs     < 3.4.3-r1                       >= 3.4.3-r1

Description
===========

Maksim Orlovich discovered an incorrect bounds check in kjs when
handling URIs.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to load a specially crafted webpage containing
malicious javascript, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running kjs.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdelibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose kde-base/kdelibs-3.4.3-r1
