Synopsis
========

Blender is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may be exploited by
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Blender is an open source software for 3D modeling, animation,
rendering, post-production, interactive creation and playback.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/blender       < 2.40                            >= 2.40

Description
===========

Damian Put has reported a flaw due to an integer overflow in the
"get_bhead()" function, leading to a heap overflow when processing
malformed ".blend" files.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user into opening a specially crafted
".blend" file, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running Blender.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Blender users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/blender-2.40"
