Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.13.06: Novell SUSE
 Linux Enterprise Server Remote Manager Heap Overflow


Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Remote Manager Heap Overflow

iDefense Security Advisory 01.13.06
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?type=vulnerabilities
January 13, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is a platform for open source
computing in an enterprise environment.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Novell Inc.'s
Open Enterprise Server Remote Manager allows attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of a an
HTTP POST request with a negative Content-Length paramater. When such a
request is received, controllable heap corruption occurs which can lead
to the execution of arbitrary code using traditional Linux heap overflow
methods. The following HTTP request can be used to trigger this
vulnerability.

  POST / HTTP/1.0
  Content-Length: -900

  DATA_THAT_WILL_BE_USED_TO_OVERWRITE_THE_HEAP

iDefense Labs testing has determined that with careful manipulation of
the string, an arbitrary 4 byte write may be achieved which can be used
to gain execution control.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in Novell SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 9. All previous versions are suspected vulnerable.
Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server components are included in Novell
Open Enterprise Server; as such, Open Enterprise Server is also
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
