Subject: RE: WMF Exploit



Taking a look at the first rule, it looks like it would be ineffective to
prevent a slightly modified exploit image. The first "content:" attribute
looks for a hardcoded wmf header, including the dword 00 00 1f 52 (remember
dwords are backwards in memory) filesize property. This is obviously going
to change if the attacker changes the shellcode (I think it might even be
ignored and automatically calculated).

Also, the second image includes the windows version property (0x0300). I'm
not sure if the image renderer even pays attention to this. It may, but it's
just something you should pay attention to.

I just wanted to bring this to everyone's attention. I don't know the layout
of the rules, but I just recognized that first hex string as a wmf image
header.

Sunbelt Kerio and Bleeding Snort have put together two rules for this:

alert ip any any -> any any (msg: "COMPANY-LOCAL WMF Exploit"; content:"01 
00 09 00 00 03 52 1f 00 00 06 00 3d 00 00 00"; content:"00 26 06 0f 00 08 
00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00"; reference: 
url,www.frsirt.com/exploits/20051228.ie_xp_pfv_metafile.pm.php; 
sid:2005122802; classtype:attempted-user; rev:1;) 

alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"BLEEDING-EDGE EXPLOIT 
WMF Escape Record Exploit"; flow:established,from_server; content:"01 00 
09 00 00 03"; depth:500; content:"00 00"; distance:10; within:12; 
content:"26 06 09 00"; within:5000; classtype:attempted-user; 
reference:url,www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2005/3086; sid:2002733; 
rev:1;) 

Simply add it to Sunbelt Kerio's bad-traffic.rlk file, or download it:
