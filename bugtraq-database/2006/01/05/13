Can someone *please* remove this post? The service this posting is referring to is not ready yet & I am guessing it has been leaked either via somebody working for us or as a result of the "interest" we have been getting in certain circles.

This service is not active until February 01, 2006, and we are not accepting any registrations until then. Thanks for your understanding.
