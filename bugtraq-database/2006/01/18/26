Summary
=======

The Cisco IOS Stack Group Bidding Protocol (SGBP) feature in certain
versions of Cisco IOS software is vulnerable to a
remotely-exploitable denial of service condition. Devices that do not
support or have not enabled the SGBP protocol are not affected by
this vulnerability.

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. There are workarounds available to mitigate
the effects of the vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20060118-sgbp.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects any device that runs Cisco IOS and has
enabled the SGBP protocol. SGBP is enabled by defining a stack group,
which is done using the global IOS command "sgbp group <name>". The
presence of this command will cause the device to begin listening on
port 9900, even if the remaining SGBP parameters are not fully
configured.

The following examples demonstrate device configurations for which
SGBP is enabled:

    Router#show sgbp
    Group Name: test Ref: 0xA3728C00
    Seed bid: default, 50, default seed bid setting

Or:

    Router#show running-config | include sgbp
    sgbp group test_group

If your device displays output similar to either of the above
examples, please consult the IOS software table below to determine
whether your version of IOS is affected.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco products that do not run IOS, do not contain support for SGBP,
or do not have SGBP enabled are not affected by this vulnerability.

Systems on which SGBP is not supported or enabled will return either
blank output or an error message. The following examples demonstrate
device configurations that are not affected by this vulnerability:

  * A system that supports but is not enabled for SGBP returns this
    output:
   
        Router#show sgbp
        Router#
   
  * A system that does not support SGBP returns this error message:
   
        Router#show sgbp
        Router#show sgbp
                     ^ 
        % Invalid input detected at '^' marker.
   
Details
=======

Multilink PPP (MLP) allows users to combine multiple PPP links into a
single logical network connection, thus enabling on demand bandwidth
allocation. When implemented across multiple device chassis, this is
known as Multichassis Multilink PPP (MMP). The Stack Group Bidding
Protocol is the mechanism by which devices participating in MMP
locate each other and negotiate for a connection termination point.

The SGBP implementation provided by the Cisco Internetwork Operating
System (IOS) is susceptible to a denial of service attack when
presented with a crafted UDP packet. Sending such a packet to port
9900 of an affected device will cause it to freeze and stop
responding to or passing traffic. After a delay, the system watchdog
timer will detect this condition and force a reset of the device. The
system recovery behavior will be controlled by the device
configuration register; for example, the router may reload or drop to
the ROM monitor.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsb11124. 

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause the affected
device to become unresponsive and trigger a hardware reset, resulting
in a denial of service condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Cisco has provided updated software to address this vulnerability.
For further details, please refer to the software table below.

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release
train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a
given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible
releases that contain the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the
anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the "Rebuild"
and "Maintenance" columns. A device running a release in the given
train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less
than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable. The release
should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later
version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label).

Workarounds
===========

  * Configure Access Control Lists (ACLs)
   
    For sites that require the SGBP protocol to be enabled, it may be
    possible to apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) to prevent
    untrusted hosts from exploiting this vulnerability. The following
    extended access-list can be adapted to your network. This example
    assumes that the SGBP members communicate using the 192.168.10.0
    network.
   
        access-list 101 permit udp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.10.0
          0.0.0.255 port eq 9900 
        access-list 101 deny udp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 port eq 
          9900 
        access-list 101 permit ip any any
   
    The access-list must then be applied to all interfaces using
    configuration commands such as:
   
        interface ethernet 0/0 
        ip access-group 101 in 
   
  * Enable Control Plane Policing
   
    The Control Plane Policy (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate
    this vulnerability, as in this example:
   
        ! Do not police SGBP traffic from the trusted network 
        access-list 140 deny udp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 9900 
        ! Police SGBP traffic from untrusted hosts and networks 
        access-list 140 permit udp any any eq 9900 
        ! Do not police any other type of traffic going to the router 
        access-list 140 deny ip any any 
        ! 
        class-map match-all sgbp-class 
        match access-group 140 
        ! 
        policy-map control-plane-policy 
        ! Drop all traffic that matches the class "sgbp-class"
        class sgbp-class 
        drop 
        ! 
        control-plane 
        service-policy input control-plane-policy
   
    Note: CoPP is only available on certain platforms and IOS release
    trains. Additional information on the configuration and use of
    the CoPP feature can be found at the following URL: 
    http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1838/
    products_white_paper09186a0080211f39.shtml
   
  * Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)
   
    Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your
    network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be
    allowed to target your infrastructure devices and block that
    traffic at the border of your network. Infrastructure ACLs are
    considered a network security best practice and should be
    considered as a long-term addition to good network security as
    well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white
    paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection
    Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended
    deployment techniques for iACLs: 
    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html
   
  * Configuring Receive Access Lists (rACLs)
   
    For distributed platforms, rACLs may be an option starting in
    Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 series GSR
    and 12.0(24)S for the 7500 series. The receive access lists
    protect the device from harmful traffic before the traffic can
    impact the route processor. Receive path ACLs are considered a
    network security best practice, and should be considered as a
    long-term addition to good network security, as well as a
    workaround for this specific vulnerability. The CPU load is
    distributed to the line card processors and helps mitigate load
    on the main route processor. The white paper entitled "GSR:
    Receive Access Control Lists" will help identify and allow
    legitimate traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets:
