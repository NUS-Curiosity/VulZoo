Details:
########
Oracle Reports is Oracle's award-winning, high-fidelity enterprise reporting tool.

It enables businesses to give immediate access to information to all levels within and outside of the organization in an unrivaled scalable and secure environment. Oracle Reports, a component of the Oracle Application Server, is used by Oracle itself for the E-Business Suite. Many large customers are using Oracle Reports as reporting tool for their enterprise applications.

The Oracle Reports parameter desformat can read any file by using an absolute or relative file name.
Parts of the file content are displayed in the Reports error message (see test case)

The DESFORMAT parameter specifies the format for the job output. In bit-mapped environments, use DESFORMAT to specify the printer driver to be used when DESTYPE is FILE.
In character-mode environments, use it to specify the characteristics of the printer named in DESNAME.
