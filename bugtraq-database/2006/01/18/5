 Networker nsrd.exe DoS Vulnerability


EMC Legato Networker nsrd.exe DoS Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.17.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=375
January 17, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

EMC Legato NetWorker is a cross-platform backup and recovery
application.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in EMC Corp.'s
Legato Networker allows attackers to crash the nsrd service.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of
malformed RPC requests to RPC program number 390109. By sending such a
request, an attacker is able to cause a NULL pointer to be used as the
base in a memory reference, which leads to a crash of the service. The
daemon will crash on a NULL pointer dereference as no exception handlers
are invoked which might allow it to recover.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to crash the nsrd.exe
process.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in Networker 7.2 build 172.
All previous versions are suspected vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
