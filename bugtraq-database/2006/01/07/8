Subject: Re: MD:Pro - Malware Distribution Project


> On 01 February 2006 Frame4 Security Systems will launch their Malware Distribution Project (MD:Pro) service, which will offer developers of security systems and anti-malware products a vast collection of downloadable malware from a secure and reliable source, exclusively for the purposes of analysis, testing, research and development. For a preview of MD:Pro, visit http://www.frame4.net/mdpro.
> 
> Bringing together for the first time a large back-catalogue of malware, computer underground related information and IT security resources under one project, this major new system also contains a large selection of undetected malware, along with an open, collaborative platform, where malware samples can be shared among its members. The database is constantly being updated with new files, and maintained to keep it running at an optimum. MD:Pro will contain around 120.000 downloadable malware samples by the end of 2006. There are currently 6500+ files in the system (and counting).
> 
> A product of many years' research, cataloging and compilation of hard to find information, this subscription based service will be extremely attractive to anti-virus/anti-spyware manufacturers, developers of IDS/IPS systems, etc., along with large corporations and ISPs. Registrations will be limited to corporate customers only.
> 
> Key benefits are:
> 
> - A single, secure, and reliable download resource
> - Vast amounts of historical data, along with the very latest malware sources
> - Custom system, designed to provide maximum benefit to anti-malware research staff
> - Contents updated and maintained continuously by skilled security engineers
> - Systems monitored 24 x 7 for maximum possible uptime and availability
> - A non-public list, made available for the purposes of analysis, testing, research & development
> 
> PLEASE NOTE - The system is currently under heavy development; we are due to go live 01 February 2006, and as such, are not accepting any registrations for now (we are keeping applications pending until then however, and will allow access after go-live). As mentioned above, registrations will be limited to corporate customers only.
