Subject: Free tool for pattern identification (for researchers)


I'll keep this post short. See the webpage for *lots* more detail. Please send questions/comments/etc to me off-list, as this [probably] has no reason to become a thread. I'm posting this link to a couple lists, so if you are getting this twice, I apologize. 

I'm posting an application based on computational biology algorithms and genetics research to help researchers looking for similarities among distinct datasets/files/binaries. The program acquires common patterns from a number of different files, or inversely (for false positive testing) finds patterns that do not exist among different files. It can handle many files at the same time, and is faster than other tools I've worked with that only partially do the same. 

For a primer on the algorithms and to download the program, see the page it's posted to at http://www.proventsure.com. Follow the link in the middle/bottom of the page to "Research and Free Tools." The name of the application is the Universal Pattern Searcher. 

Hope it's as useful for you as it's been for us.
