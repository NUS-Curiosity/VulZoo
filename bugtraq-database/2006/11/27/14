It's inescapable problem with this type of paper - someone's interpretation 
of the scientific data and what it means is actually just their opinion and 
without the interpretation you just have a bunch of pretty pictures. That 
said, if I venture an opinion I fully expect there will be people that 
disagree and they should challenge that opinion. I'm never one to step back 
from a good debate :)
