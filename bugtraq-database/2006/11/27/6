Subject: TFTP Server AT-TFTP Server v 1.9 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
 (Long filename)

TFTP Server AT-TFTP Server v 1.9 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (Long filename)

------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:

AT-TFTP Server is a Freeware TFTP server for Windows 9x/NT/XP.
(http://www.alliedtelesyn.co.uk/en-gb/support/downloads/tools.asp) 
It provides an implementation of the TFTPv2 protocol.

A vulnerability has been identified in TFTP Server AT-TFTP Server v1.9, which could be exploited by remote or local attackers to execute arbitrary commands or cause a denial of service. This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error when handling an overly long file name (more than 227 bytes) passed to a "GET" or "PUT" command, which could be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system or crash an affected application.
----------
