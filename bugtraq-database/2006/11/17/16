4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities and a weakness in
Panda ActiveScan, which can be exploited by malicious people to
disclose system information, cause a DoS (Denial of Service), and
compromise a user's system.

1) The "Reinicializar()" method in the "ActiveScan.1" ActiveX control
allows rebooting the system when invoked. This can be exploited by
e.g. a malicious website to reboot a user's system without any user
confirmation.

2) The "ObtenerTamano()" method in the "PAVPZ.SOS.1" ActiveX control
returns the file size of a given local filename. This can be exploited
by e.g. a malicious website to determine the presence of local files
and the corresponding file sizes.

3) The "Analizar()" method in the "ActiveScan.1" ActiveX control is
not thread safe. This can be exploited by e.g. a malicious website via
a race condition to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 5.54.01.
