Description:
  According to a vendor security information [0], a Denial of Service
  (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CGI library of the programming
  language Ruby [1], versions up to and including 1.8.5. The problem
  is triggered by sending the library an HTTP request that uses
  multipart MIME encoding and has an invalid boundary specifier that
  begins with "-" instead of "--". Once triggered it will exhaust all
  available memory resources effectively creating a DoS condition. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-5467 [2] to the problem.
