Details

Product: xenis.creator CMS

Original Advisory:
============
http://www.majorsecurity.de/index_2.php?major_rls=major_rls31

Introduction
============
xenis.creator CMS is a well known content management system.

More Details
============
XSS:
Input passed directly to the "contid" and "search" parameter in "default.asp" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

SQL injection:
Input passed directly to the "nav", "s" and "print" parameter in "default.asp" is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Fix
===
none known

Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure that html tags
are not going to be executed. You should also work with the "mysql_real_escape_string()" or "addslashes()" php-function to ensure that sql statements
can't be delivered over the "get" variables. Further it is recommend to set off the "register globals" option in the
"php.ini" on your webserver.

Example:
$pass = htmlentities($_POST['pass']);
$test = htmlspecialchars($_GET('test'));
$id = intval($_POST['id']);
?>
