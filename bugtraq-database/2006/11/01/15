Subject: Outpost Insufficient validation of 'SandBox' driver input buffer

Hello,

We would like to inform you about a vulnerability in Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0.


Description:

Outpost insufficiently protects its driver \Device\SandBox against a manipulation by malicious applications and it fails 
to validate its input buffer. It is possible to open this driver and send arbitrary data to it, which are implicitly 
believed to be valid. It is possible to assemble the data in the input buffer such that the driver performs an invalid 
memory operation and crashes the whole operating system. Further impacts of this bug were not examined.


Vulnerable software:

     * Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0 (964.582.059)



More details and a proof of concept including source code is available here:
