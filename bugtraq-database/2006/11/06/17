Synopsis
========

An integer overflow flaw in the Qt pixmap handling could possibly lead
to a Denial of Service or the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Qt is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, which is used e.g. by KDE.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  x11-libs/qt     < 4.1.4-r2                            >= 4.1.4-r2
                                                           *>= 3.3.6-r4

Description
===========

An integer overflow flaw has been found in the pixmap handling of Qt.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted pixmap image in an
application using Qt, e.g. Konqueror, a remote attacker could be able
to cause an application crash or the execution of arbitrary code with
the rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Qt 3.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/qt-3.3.6-r4"

All Qt 4.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/qt-4.1.4-r2"
