Subject: Cracking String Encryption in Java Obfuscated Bytecode

Hi All,

With the continuous move towards bytecode type of languages (with java and .NET being the prime examples), code obfuscation is a topic that we will be seeing more of in the future.

Below is a link to a paper detailing how to crack String encryption in some of the more popular Java obfuscators.

As the conclusions state, a lot more needs to be done on the subject. Naturally, your comments are more than welcome.

Thank you,
