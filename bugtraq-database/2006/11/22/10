No. Additionally, if I was to find a bug in released code today Microsoft 
would fix it as usual and a public announcement would be made. It is 
imperative for both Microsoft and NGSSoftware that NGSSoftware is seen to be 
independent and not "in the pocket" of Microsoft. Since working with 
Microsoft we have been publicly credited in many Microsoft Bulletins - 
here's the list for 2006 alone:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-nov.mspx
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-aug.mspx
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-jun.mspx
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-mar.mspx
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-jan.mspx

The bottom line is that Oracle really is just more buggy.
Cheers,
David
