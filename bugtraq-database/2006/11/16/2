Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0063

Package names:	   bind, openssh, rpm, texinfo
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-11-15
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  bind
  BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS
  (Domain Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named),
  which resolves host names to IP addresses, and a resolver library
  (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS). A DNS
  server allows clients to name resources or objects and share the
  information with other network machines. The named DNS server can be
  used on workstations as a caching name server, but is generally only
  needed on one machine for an entire network.

  openssh
  Ssh (Secure Shell) a program for logging into a remote machine and for
  executing commands in a remote machine. It is intended to replace
  rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
  two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and
  arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
  OpenSSH is OpenBSD's rework of the last free version of SSH, bringing
  it up to date in terms of security and features, as well as removing
  all patented algorithms to seperate libraries (OpenSSL).

  rpm
  The RPM Package Manager is a powerful command line driven package
  management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying,
  querying, and updating software packages. Each software package
  consists of an archive of files along with information about the
  package like its version, a description, etc.

  texinfo
  Texinfo is a documentation system that can produce both online
  information and printed output from a single source file. Normally,
  you'd have to write two separate documents: one for online help or
  other online information and the other for a typeset manual or other
  printed work. Using Texinfo, you only need to write one source
  document. Then when the work needs revision, you only have to revise
  one source document. The GNU Project uses the Texinfo file format
  for most of its documentation.

Problem description:
  bind  < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Raise the minimum safe OpenSSL versions to OpenSSL
    0.9.7l and OpenSSL 0.9.8d. Versions prior to these have known
    security flaws which are exploitable in named. [RT #16391]
  - Change the default RSA exponent from 3 to 65537.

  openssh < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A weakness has been reported in OpenSSH, which
    can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security
    restrictions. The weakness is caused due to an error within the
    privilege separation monitor, which may weaken the authentication
    process (SA22771).
 
  rpm < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in RPM, caused due
    to a boundary error when processing certain RPM packages. This can
    be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking
    a user into querying a specially crafted RPM package.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-5466 to this issue.

  texinfo < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Buffer overflow in the texi2dvi and texindex commands
    allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Texinfo 
    file.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-4810 to this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
