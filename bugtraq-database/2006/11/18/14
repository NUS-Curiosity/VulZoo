Introduction
============
Travelsized CMS is a content management system made only using PHP.

More Details
============
Cross Site Scripting:
Input passed directly to the "page", "page_id" and "language" parameter in "index.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site. 

Fix
===
None known

Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure that html tags
are not going to be executed. Further it is recommend to set off the "register globals" option in the
"php.ini" on your webserver.

Example:
$pass = htmlentities($_POST['pass']);
$test = htmlspecialchars($_GET('test'));
?>
