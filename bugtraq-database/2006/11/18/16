Subject: linksys wrt54g v5 authentication bypass fixed

About the authentication bypass vulnerability in certain linksys routers:

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/442452/30/0/threaded

Linksys has silently patched the authentication bypass vulnerability.  There 
is still no fix for the CSRF vulnerability.

The fixed firmware revision is 1.00.10.

Note that WRT54G v4 and earlier linksys routers are based on different 
hardware and different firmware than the v5 and later routers.  If you have 
a v4 or earlier router, this vulnerability doesn't affect you.  If you have 
v5 or later, it's time to patch.
