Synopsis
========

RPM is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and possibly the execution of
arbitrary code when opening specially crafted packages.

Background
==========

The Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package
management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying,
querying, and updating computer software packages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/rpm     < 4.4.6-r3                           >= 4.4.6-r3

Description
===========

Vladimir Mosgalin has reported that when processing certain packages,
RPM incorrectly allocates memory for the packages, possibly causing a
heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted RPM package
and execute code with the privileges of that user if certain locales
are set.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All RPM users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/rpm-4.4.6-r3"
