 a malformed cookie

PR05-06: Immediacy .NET CMS possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting
through a malformed cookie

This advisory has been published following consultation with UK NISCC
<http://www.niscc.gov.uk/>

Date found: 2005-02-27

Vulnerable: Immediacy .NET CMS 5.2

Severity: Low

Author: Gemma Hughes [gemma.hughes at procheckup.com]

Vendor Status: CVE Candidate not Assigned

Description:

Immediacy CMS appears to allow Cross Site Scripting attacks via a
malformed 'Set-Cookie:' header. This issue concerns the 'logon.aspx'
program and 'lang' variable. This could allow attackers to cause the
execution of malicious script code within the context of the vulnerable
site.

Note: web browser-specific CRLF injection techniques may be required in
order to exploit this issue.
