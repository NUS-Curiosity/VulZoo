Subject: Re: Wordpress File Inclusion

That word you keep using? I don't think it means what you think it means.

IOW, You can't inject a value into the $file parameter to load_template() like this. And I'm pretty sure that you can't do it all, unless you've installed a third-party plugin or theme that's doing something really weird with wp_query.
