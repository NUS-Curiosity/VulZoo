Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in SAP Web Application Server 6.40
 and7.00

Is there any more information available for these patches?  Unfortunately SAP makes it difficult to find what you are looking for on the service marketplace sometimes, and I am not sure which avenue to look for the patch 66 for Web AS 7.00.  Is this a basis patch, abap patch, java, or kernel patch, etc?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
