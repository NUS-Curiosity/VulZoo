Subject: EUSecWest/London CFP extended to Nov. 7

Hi folks, some brief news:

Some people have asked for late submissions to the EUSecWest
paper selections. In the interest of fairness, we are extending the 
deadline for all until next Tuesday (November 7), at which time
the submissions will be reviewed. Details of submissions can
be found on the http:/eusecwest.com site under the speakers 
sections.

PacSec/Tokyo paper descriptions have been published, and 
CanSecWest/Vancouver early discount registration is now available.

thanks,
--dr
