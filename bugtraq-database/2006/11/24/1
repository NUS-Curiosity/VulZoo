Subject: Re: Cracking String Encryption in Java Obfuscated Bytecode

With respect, I disagree from a Java perspective.

1) If you are deploying Java on the server you are protected by so many
layers, code obfuscation is not critical
2) If you are deploying Java Applets for enterprise applications, you
are nuts. They are inherently insecure and Java applets have a long
history of critical problems.
