Synopsis
========

LHa is affected by several vulnerabilities including the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

LHa is a console-based program for packing and unpacking LHarc
archives.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/lha      < 114i-r6                            >= 114i-r6

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several
vulnerabilities in the LZH decompression component used by LHa. The
make_table function of unlzh.c contains an array index error and a
buffer overflow vulnerability. The build_tree function of unpack.c
contains a buffer underflow vulnerability. Additionally, unlzh.c
contains a code that could run in an infinite loop.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to uncompress a specially crafted archive, a remote
attacker could cause a Denial of Service by CPU consumption or execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LHa users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/lha-114i-r6"
