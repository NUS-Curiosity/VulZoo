-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of the Novell Netware Client.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in a print provider installed by the Netware
Client. The nwspool.dll library does not properly handle long arguments
to the Win32 EnumPrinters() and OpenPrinter() functions. Exceeding 458
bytes in the first argument to OpenPrinter() or 524 bytes in the second
argument to EnumPrinters() results in an exploitable buffer overflow
within the Spooler service.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely via Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) requests to the Spooler service. The Spooler exposes the
"spoolss" named pipe, which allows an anonymous user to issue certain
spooler commands. These include the OpenPrinter() and EnumPrinters()
calls required to exploit this vulnerability.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
