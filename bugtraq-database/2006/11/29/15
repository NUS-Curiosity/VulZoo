====================================================================== 
1) Affected Software 

Borland idsql32.dll versions 5.1.0.4 (as used by RevilloC MailServer)
and 5.2.0.2 as included with Borland Developer Studio 2006.

NOTE: Other versions may also be affected. Furthermore, any 
application using the vulnerable library and passing (partially)
user-controlled arguments to the affected function may also be
vulnerable.

====================================================================== 
2) Severity 

Rating: Moderately critical
Impact: System Access
Where:  From Remote

====================================================================== 
3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Borland products,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in idsql32.dll
when processing SQL statements using the "DbiQExec()" function. This
can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly
long SQL statement (more than 4000 bytes).

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Restrict access to applications and services using the vulnerable
library.

Applications using the vulnerable function should check the length
of the user input before creating an SQL statement and using it in a
query.

====================================================================== 
5) Time Table 

15/11/2006 - Vendor notified.
27/11/2006 - Vendor reminder sent.
29/11/2006 - Public disclosure.
