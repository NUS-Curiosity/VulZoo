Spree e-commerce JSON Hijacking Vulnerabilities
CVE-2010-3978


INTRODUCTION


Spree e-commerce is an open source commerce platform written for the Ruby on Rails framework supporting "Over 100 extensions created by our active and dedicated community".

This problem was confirmed in the following versions of the Spree e-commerce, other versions maybe also affected.

All 0.11.x versions
The upcoming code 0.30.x versions


CVSS Scoring System

The CVSS score is: 2.7
	Base Score: 3.3
	Temporal Score: 2.7
We used the following values to calculate the scores:
	Base score is: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N
	Temporal score is: E:F/RL:OF/RC:C


DETAILS

There are multiple JSON Hijacking vulnerabilities and as result, an attacker can steal confidential information such as: product costs, price and quantities and users email, encrypted password, tokens, OpenID identifier, phone and address as well as orders count and values by period.

There are some pages within the default Spree installation that use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as a transport mechanism between the client and the server. As the application cannot differentiate real requests from forged requests, and the JSON object returned can be accessed by the attacker's malicious code via a script tag, those pages are vulnerable to an attack known as JSON Hijacking.

The affected pages are:
	- /admin/products.json
	- /admin/users.json
	- /admin/overview/get_report_data

Proof of concept exploitation code is available to interested parties.
