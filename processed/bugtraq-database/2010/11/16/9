Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, the worst of which
allowing local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root.

Background
==========

The GNU C library is the standard C library used by Gentoo Linux
systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-libs/glibc      < 2.11.2-r3                      >= 2.11.2-r3

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, amongst others the
widely-known recent LD_AUDIT and $ORIGIN issues. For further
information please consult the CVE entries referenced below.

Impact
======

A local attacker could execute arbitrary code as root, cause a Denial
of Service, or gain privileges. Additionally, a user-assisted remote
attacker could cause the execution of arbitrary code, and a
context-dependent attacker could cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU C library users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/glibc-2.11.2-r3"
