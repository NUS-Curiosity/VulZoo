4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Adobe Shockwave
Player, which may be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a function in dirapi.dll not validating
the size and number of sub-chunks inside a "pamm" chunk during initial
parsing of the sub-chunks. This can be exploited to corrupt memory 
outside the bounds of a buffer allocated for the "pamm" data via a 
specially crafted Director file.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Update to version 11.5.9.615.
