4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by missing input validation within a 
library used by the bundled Microsoft Office Document Imaging 
application when converting certain data during parsing of TIFF
