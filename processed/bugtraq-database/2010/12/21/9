       Technical details
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

       A MIDI file format parsing vulnerability exists in the in_midi
       plugin and can be exploited with a specially crafted input
       file. The plugin suffers from an integer wrapping flaw which
       leads to a heap overflow.

       If an attacker is able to entice the user to open a malicious
       file, successful exploitation leads to code being executed in
       the context of the logged in user.

       Solution
       Upgrade to 5.6 or later.
