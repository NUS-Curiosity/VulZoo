Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 12.10.10: RealNetworks RealPlayer Memory
 Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.10.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 10, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

RealPlayer is RealNetworks's media player product used to render video
and other media. For more information, visit http://www.real.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in
RealNetworks, Inc.'s RealPlayer media player could allow attackers to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the targeted user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the way RealPlayer handles
specially crafted RealMedia video files.

When processing specially crafted RealMedia files, RealPlayer uses a
value from the file to control a loop operation. Realplayer fails to
validate the value before using it, which leads to heap memory
corruption and an exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
in the context of the current user. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker must persuade a victim into using RealPlayer to open a
specially crafted media file. This could be accomplished by either
direct link or referenced from a website under the attacker's control.
An attacker could host a Web page containing a malformed file. Upon
visiting the malicious Web page exploitation would occur and execution
of arbitrary code would be possible. Alternatively a malicious media
file could be attached within an e-mail file.

IV. DETECTION

Windows RealPlayer SP 1.1.4 and prior and Linux RealPlayer 11.0.2.1744
and prior are vulnerable.
