Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 12.10.10: RealNetworks RealPlayer RealAudio
 Codec Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.10.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 10, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

RealPlayer is RealNetworks's media player product used to render video
and other media. For more information, visit http://www.real.com/.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in
RealNetworks, Inc.'s RealPlayer media player could allow attackers to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the targeted user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the way RealPlayer handles
specially crafted RealMedia files using RealAudio codec.

When decoding an audio stream in a specially crafted RealMedia file,
RealPlayer uses a value from the file without properly validating it,
which leads to heap memory corruption and an exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
in the context of the currently logged-on user. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a victim into using RealPlayer
to open a specially crafted media file. This could be accomplished by
either direct link or referenced from a website under the attacker's
control. An attacker could host a Web page containing a malformed file.
Upon visiting the malicious Web page, exploitation would occur and
execution of arbitrary code would be possible. Alternatively a
malicious media file could be attached within an e-mail file.

IV. DETECTION

Windows RealPlayer SP 1.1.4 and prior; Mac RealPlayer 12.0.0.1379 and
prior; Linux RealPlayer 11.0.2.1744 and prior are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
