Package        : xpdf
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3702 CVE-2010-3704

Joel Voss of Leviathan Security Group discovered two vulnerabilities
in xpdf rendering engine, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code if a malformed PDF file is opened.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.02-1.4+lenny3.

For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable 
distribution (sid), these problems don't apply, since xpdf has been 
patched to use the Poppler PDF library.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.
