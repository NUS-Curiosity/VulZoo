Synopsis:          VMware ESXi 4.1 Update Installer SFCB Authentication
                   Flaw
Issue date:        2010-12-21
Updated on:        2010-12-21
CVE numbers:       CVE-2010-4573
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware ESXi 4.1 Update Installer might introduce a SFCB
   Authentication Flaw.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware ESXi 4.1 if upgraded from ESXi 3.5 or ESXi 4.0 with a modified
   SFCB configuration file.

3. Problem Description

 a. ESXi 4.1 Update Installer SFCB Authentication Flaw

    Under certain conditions, the ESXi 4.1 installer that upgrades an
    ESXi 3.5 or ESXi 4.0 host to ESXi 4.1 incorrectly handles the SFCB
    authentication mode. The result is that SFCB authentication could
    allow login with any username and password combination.

    An ESXi 4.1 host is affected if all of the following apply:
    - ESXi 4.1 was upgraded from ESXi 3.5 or ESXi 4.0.
    - The SFCB configuration file /etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg was modified prior
      to the upgrade.
    - The sfcbd daemon is running (sfcbd runs by default).

    Workaround
    A workaround that can be applied to ESXi 4.1 is described in VMware
    Knowledge Base Article KB 1031761

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2010-4573 to this issue.
