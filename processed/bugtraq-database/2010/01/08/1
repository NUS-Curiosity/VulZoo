ZDI-10-001: Novell iManager eDirectory Plugin Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-001
January 7, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-4486

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell iManager

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell iManager. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists in an application called by the iManager in order to
handle importing/exporting of schema information. While
importing/exporting from the schema, the sub-application fails to
validate the length of its arguments while copying user-supplied data
into statically allocated stack buffer. This can result in code
execution under the privileges of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
