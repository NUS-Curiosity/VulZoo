3. Problem Description

 a. VMware vCenter Update Manager Jetty Web server vulnerabilities

    VMware vCenter Update Manager is an automated patch management
    solution for VMware ESX hosts and Microsoft virtual machines. Update
    Manager embeds the Jetty Web server which is a third party
    component.

    The default version of the Jetty Web server in Update Manager is
    version 6.1.6 for which the following relevant vulnerabilities are
    reported.

    A directory traversal vulnerability in Jetty allows for obtaining
    files from the system where Update Manager is installed by a remote,
    unauthenticated attacker. The attacker would need to be on the same
    network as the system where Update Manager is installed.

    A cross-site scripting vulnerability in Jetty allows for running
    JavaScript in the browser of the user who clicks a URL containing a
    malicious request to Update Manager. For an attack to be successful
    the attacker would need to lure the user into clicking the malicious
    URL.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2009-1523 and CVE-2009-1524 to these issues.

    VMware would like to thank Claudio Criscione of Secure Network for
    reporting these issues to us.

    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerabilities in each release, if a solution is
    available.
