-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must open a malicious PowerPoint PPT file.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of TextCharsAtom (0x0fa0)
records contained in a PPT file. Due to the lack of bounds checking on
the size argument an unchecked memcpy copies user-supplied data from the
file to the stack, overflowing key exception structures. Exploitation of
this vulnerability can lead to remote compromise of the affected system
under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
