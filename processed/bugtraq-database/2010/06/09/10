The only problem is that the upgrade is not free, so you either pay up or stay vulnerable.

> This message is in response to the original message posted on June 3, 2010 addressing a SQL Injection vulnerability in the RSA Key Manager C Client version 1.5.  The original message referenced CVE-2010-1904.
> 
> A vulnerability has been identified in the RSA Key Manager (RKM) C client 1.5 that may expose the product to a SQL Injection attack. An attacker having access to encrypted data may be able to leverage this vulnerability in an attempt to alter the RKM C Client 1.5 cache.
> 
> Affected Products:
> RKM C Client versions 1.5.x.x, all platforms (Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, etc).

> RKM C Client 2.1.x, all platforms
> RKM C Client 2.2.x, all platforms
> RKM C Client 2.5.x, all platforms
> RKM C Client 2.7, all platforms
> All versions of RKM Java Client

> RKM PKCS#11 Module for Oracle TDE
> RKM Server, all versions and platforms
> RKM Appliance, all versions
> Customer using EMC PowerPath with RSA encryption
> Customer using Brocade Encryption Switches with RSA encryption
> 
> What is the impact?
> An attacker can attempt to modify the cache to insert an arbitrary encryption key that may lead to data unavailability (such as decryption failure of data encrypted by that modified key). 
> 
> There is no impact on confidentiality of the data as the attacker would need the cache encryption key in order to decrypt the data.
> 
> As of the date of this posting, RSA is not aware of any instances where this vulnerability may have been compromised nor are there signs of published exploit code.
> 
> Recommendations
> 
> RSA, The Security Division of EMC, recommends all customers upgrade to the latest version of RKM C Client and RKM Server/Appliance.
