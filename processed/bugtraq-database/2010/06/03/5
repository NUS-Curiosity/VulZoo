Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflow errors in XEmacs might allow remote,
user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

XEmacs is a highly extensible and customizable text editor.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-editors/xemacs     < 21.4.22-r1                 >= 21.4.22-r1

Description
===========

Tielei Wang reported multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in the
tiff_instantiate(), png_instantiate() and jpeg_instantiate() functions
in glyphs-eimage.c, all possibly leading to heap-based buffer
overflows.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF,
JPEG or PNG file using XEmacs, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application, or a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All XEmacs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/xemacs-21.4.22-r1"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since July 26, 2009. It is likely that your system is already
no longer affected by this issue.
