Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Fetchmail, allowing
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or to conduct
Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

Background
==========

Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/fetchmail      < 6.3.14                        >= 6.3.14

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Fetchmail:

* The sdump() function might trigger a heap-based buffer overflow
  during the escaping of non-printable characters with the high bit set
  from an X.509 certificate (CVE-2010-0562).

* The vendor reported that Fetchmail does not properly handle Common
  Name (CN) fields in X.509 certificates that contain an ASCII NUL
  character. Specifically, the processing of such fields is stopped at
  the first occurrence of a NUL character. This type of vulnerability
  was recently discovered by Dan Kaminsky and Moxie Marlinspike
  (CVE-2009-2666).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect with Fetchmail to a
specially crafted SSL-enabled server in verbose mode, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application. NOTE: The issue is only existent on
platforms on which char is signed.

Furthermore, a remote attacker might employ a specially crafted X.509
certificate, containing a NUL character in the Common Name field to
conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on SSL connections made using
Fetchmail.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Fetchmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.3.14"
