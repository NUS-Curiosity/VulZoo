-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's Webkit. User interaction is required
in that a user must be coerced into visiting a malicious website.

The specific flaw exists within the way Webkit inserts an element into
an editable container. Immediately before the actual insertion the
library will manipulate the contents of the field in order to insert the
new node. Upon traversal of the tree by the library, the application
will attempt to access an uninitialized element that was created prior
to the insertion. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution
under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
