-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within IE's support for the CStyleSheet object.
When a style sheet array is created it contains a reference to it's root
container. If the stylesheet was created as part of an element not in a
markup the root container can be freed when that element is destroyed.
When the application attempts to use the stylesheet after this, an
invalid pointer is utilized. This can be leveraged by attackers to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the
browser.

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
