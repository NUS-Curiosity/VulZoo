-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari's Webkit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's support of the run-in
display property. On insertion of a specific element with the "run-in"
display property, the application will create a duplicate reference of a
child element used to support that attribute. Upon destruction of the
parent container, the application will then call the destructor for this
child element multiple times. Successful exploitation can lead to code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
