CVE-2010-0284

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files on
vulnerable installations of Novell Access Manager. Authentication is not

of the Novell Management Console which exists within the servlet located
within nps.jar. Due to a failure to sanitize '../' directory traversal
modifiers from a parameter an attacker can specify any filename to
upload arbitrary contents into. Successful exploitation can result in
code execution under the context of the service.
