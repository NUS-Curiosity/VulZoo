Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.10.10: Adobe Flash Player Out Of Bounds
 Memory Indexing Vulnerability

iDefense Security
Advisory 06.10.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 10, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Flash Player is a very popular Web browser plugin. It is available
for multiple Web browsers and platforms, including Windows, Linux and
MacOS. Flash Player enables Web browsers to display rich multimedia
content, such as online videos, and is often a requirement for popular
websites. For more information, see the vendor's site at the following
link.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an array indexing vulnerability in Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Flash Player could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the current user.<BR><BR> During the
processing
of certain types of Adobe Flash code, a certain function may be tricked
into accepting an overly large index argument. The index argument may
reference a memory location outside the bounds of memory allocated for
an array object. Arbitrary code execution can occur when an index is
calculated to point to a sensitive memory location, and the memory
location is overwritten with specially crafted values.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Shockwave
Flash file created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes
this via social engineering or injecting content into a compromised,
trusted site.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the latest
version of Flash Player at the time of testing, version 10.0.22.87.
Adobe Flash Player versions 10.0.45.2 and prior and Adobe AIR
1.5.3.9130 and prior are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

A Internet Explorer plugin is available to temporarily block and unblock
Flash content using a single click. Only trusted sites should be
unblocked when using this plugin. More information is available at
http://flash.melameth.com. <BR> <BR> A Firefox plugin is
available to
temporarily block and unblock Flash content using a single click. Only
trusted sites should be unblocked when using this plugin. More
information is available at: http://flashblock.mozdev.org.
