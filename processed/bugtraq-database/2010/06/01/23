Synopsis
========

Race conditions when editing files could lead to symlink attacks or
changes of ownerships of important files.

Background
==========

nano is a GNU GPL'd Pico clone with more functionality.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-editors/nano       < 2.2.4                           >= 2.2.4

Description
===========

Multiple race condition vulnerabilities have been discovered in nano.
For further information please consult the CVE entries referenced
below.

Impact
======

Under certain conditions, a local, user-assisted attacker could
possibly overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on an
attacker-owned file that is being edited by the victim, or change the
ownership of arbitrary files.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All nano users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/nano-2.2.4"
