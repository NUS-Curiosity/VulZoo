References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5161

Description:
    In previous versions of openssh, the default cipher order preferred a 
    block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, which is
    suspectible to a plaintext recovery attack.  This update changes the
    cipher order to prefer the AES CTR modes, and adds countermeasures
    to mitigate attacks against CBC modes.
