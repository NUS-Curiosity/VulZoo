Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation
Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100324-sip

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 March 24 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS Software that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected
device when SIP operation is enabled. Remote code execution may also
be possible.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. For devices that must run SIP there are no
workarounds; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure of
the vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100324-sip.shtml

Note: The March 24, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes seven Security Advisories. All the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each
advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or
vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following
URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software
vulnerabilities that have been published on March 24, 2010, or
earlier:

Affected Products
=================

These vulnerabilities only affect devices running Cisco IOS Software
with SIP voice services enabled.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices running affected Cisco IOS Software versions that are
configured to process SIP messages are affected.

Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software do not process SIP messages by
default. Creating a dial peer by issuing the command "dial-peer voice"
will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco IOS device to process
SIP messages. In addition, several features within Cisco Unified
Communications Manager Express, such as ePhones, once configured will
also automatically start the SIP process, which will cause the device
to start processing SIP messages. An example of an affected
configuration follows:

    dial-peer voice <Voice dial-peer tag> voip
     ...
    !

In addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a 
"dial-peer" command that causes the device to process SIP messages,
administrators can also use the command "show processes | include SIP"
to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that
handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the
processes "CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET" or "CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET" indicates that the
Cisco IOS device will process SIP messages:

    Router#show processes | include SIP
     149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET
     150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET

Warning: Because there are several ways a device running
Cisco IOS Software can start processing SIP messages, it is
recommended that the "show processes | include SIP" command be used to
determine whether the device is processing SIP messages instead of
relying on the presence of specific configuration commands.

Cisco Unified Border Element images are also affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Note: The Cisco Unified Border Element feature (previously known as
the Cisco Multiservice IP-to-IP Gateway) is a special Cisco IOS
Software image that runs on Cisco multiservice gateway platforms. It
provides a network-to-network interface point for billing, security,
call admission control, quality of service, and signaling
interworking.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router#show version
    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG), which is used by the Cisco
IOS NAT and firewall features of Cisco IOS Software, is not affected
by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco IOS XE Software and Cisco IOS XR Software are not affected by
these vulnerabilities.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and
video calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is
responsible for handling all aspects of call setup and termination.
Voice and video are the most popular types of sessions that SIP
handles, but the protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other
applications that require call setup and termination. SIP call
signaling can use UDP (port 5060), TCP (port 5060), or TLS (TCP port
5061) as the underlying transport protocol.

Three vulnerabilities exist in the SIP implementation in Cisco IOS
Software that may allow a remote attacker to cause a device reload,
or execute arbitrary code. These vulnerabilities are triggered when
the device running Cisco IOS Software processes malformed SIP
messages.

In cases where SIP is running over TCP transport, a TCP three-way
handshake is necessary to exploit these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities are addressed by Cisco bug IDs CSCsz48680,
CSCsz89904, and CSCtb93416, and have been assigned Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2010-0580, CVE-2010-0581,
and CVE-2010-0579, respectively.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerabilities in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in this advisory may
result in a reload of the device. Repeated exploitation could result
in a sustained denial of service condition. There is a potential to
execute arbitrary code. In the event of successful remote code
execution, device integrity could be completely compromised.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release for this Advisory" column of the table.
The "First Fixed Release for all Advisories in 24 March 2010 Bundle
Publication" column indicates the earliest possible releases which
have fixes for all the published vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS
Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to
the latest available release where possible.

Workarounds
===========

If the affected Cisco IOS device requires SIP for VoIP services, SIP
cannot be disabled, and no workarounds are available. Users are
advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit exposure to the
vulnerabilities. Mitigation consists of allowing only legitimate
devices to connect to affected devices. To increase effectiveness,
the mitigation must be coupled with anti-spoofing measures on the
network edge. This action is required because SIP can use UDP as the
transport protocol.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express and Cisco IOS Software
H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities", which is available at the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100324-voice.shtml

Disable SIP Listening Ports
+--------------------------

For devices that do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and
most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device.
Some versions of Cisco IOS Software allow administrators to disable
SIP with the following commands:

    sip-ua
     no transport udp
     no transport tcp
     no transport tcp tls

Warning: When applying this workaround to devices that are
processing Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or H.323 calls, the
device will not stop SIP processing while active calls are being
processed. Under these circumstances, this workaround should be
implemented during a maintenance window when active calls can be
briefly stopped.

The "show udp connections", "show tcp brief all", and
"show processes | include SIP" commands can be used to confirm that
the SIP UDP and TCP ports are closed after applying this workaround.

Depending on the Cisco IOS Software version in use, the output from
the "show ip sockets" command may still show the SIP ports open, but
sending traffic to them will cause the SIP process to emit the
following message:

    *Feb  2 11:36:47.691: sip_udp_sock_process_read: SIP UDP Listener is DISABLED

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

For devices that need to offer SIP services it is possible to use
Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic to the device from
untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T,
12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a
device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the
risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly
permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in
accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The
following example can be adapted to specific network configurations:

    !-- The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.
    !-- Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used
    !-- to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane
    !-- policy (the CoPP feature.) If the access list matches (permit)
    !-- then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not
    !-- match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.
    
    access-list 100 deny udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 deny udp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5061
    
    !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4
    !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and
    !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
    !-- to infrastructure devices.
    !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
    !-- the CoPP feature.
    
    class-map match-all drop-sip-class
      match access-group 100
    
    !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
    !-- Control-Plane of the device.
    
    policy-map control-plane-policy
     class drop-sip-class
      drop
    
    !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the
    !-- device.
    
    control-plane
     service-policy input control-plane-policy

Warning: Because SIP can use UDP as a transport protocol, it
is possible to easily spoof the IP address of the sender, which may
defeat access control lists that permit communication to these ports
from trusted IP addresses.

In the above CoPP example, the access control entries (ACEs) that
match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action result
in these packets being discarded by the policy-map "drop" function,
while packets that match the "deny" action (not shown) are not
affected by the policy-map drop function. Additional information on
the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html
