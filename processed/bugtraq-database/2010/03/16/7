Description:
    In previous versions of BIND, there have been several vulnerabilities
    reported related to cache poisoning of systems where DNSSEC is enabled.
    To address these issues, BIND has been updated to 9.4.3-P5 in both 
    rPath Linux 1 and 2.  
    
    For rPL 1, this update includes a library version change, so the 
    older package versions have been promoted to the rpl:1-compat label.
    This allows users who may have linked applications to the BIND libraries
    to continue to include the old bind:lib component where necessary.
