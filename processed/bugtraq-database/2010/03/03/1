Workarounds
===========

Administrators can mitigate the SCCP- and SIP-related vulnerabilities
by implementing filtering on screening devices to permit access to
TCP ports 2000 and 2443, and TCP and UDP ports 5060 and 5061 only
from networks that require SCCP and SIP access to Cisco Unified
Communications Manager appliances.

It is possible to mitigate the CTI Manager vulnerability by disabling
the CTI Manager service t is not necessary; however, this workaround
will interrupt applications that reply on the CTI Manager service.
Administrators can also mitigate the vulnerability by implementing
filtering on screening devices to permit access to TCP port 2748 only
from networks that require access to the CTI Manager service. Please
consult the following documentation for details on disabling Cisco
Unified Communications Manager services:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/service/6_0_1/admin/sasrvact.html#wp1048390

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:
