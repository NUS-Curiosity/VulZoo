rpc.pcnfsd syslog format string vulnerability
CVE-2010-1039

INTRODUCTION

There exists a vulnerability within a log function of the rpc.pcnfsd service
which when properly exploited can lead to remote compromise of the vulnerable 
system.
This vulnerability was confirmed in the following versions and operating
systems, other versions and operating systems may be also affected.

IBM AIX 6.1.0 and lower
IRIX 6.5
HP-UX 11.11, 11.23, 11.31

DETAILS

This vulnerability can be triggered by sending a rpc request resulting in an
invalid directory causing the service to call _msgout() function that call 
syslog() function to log the error without checking for formatted strings.

This is the vulnerable function (pcnfsd version 1.2 source).

from pcnfsd_print.c

psrstat pr_start2(system, pr, user, fname, opts, id)

...
...            

if (rename(pathname, new_pathname)) 
                   
{

                                                pathname, new_pathname);
