-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Mercury LoadRunner. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the process magentproc.exe that binds to
TCP port 54345. A specially crafted packet will allow unauthenticated
users to execute local commands. When a state of 0 or 4 is passed after
the parameters, mchan.dll will process the commands on the host. This
allows for remote code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
