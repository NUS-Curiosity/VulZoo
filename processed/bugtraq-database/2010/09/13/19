-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the support for XUL <tree> objects. If a
specific property of a tree object is set and the parent node attempts
to remove the child, the process can be made to access invalid memory.
This can be abused by an attacker to execute remote code under the
context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
