ZDI-10-163: Adobe Shockwave Director tSAC Chunk Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-163
August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2874

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the undocumented tSAC
RIFF chunk. By setting a specified field within this structure to NULL,
the application fails to initialize an object pointer. This
uninitialized pointer is later called which causes the application to
jump into random heap memory. By crafting the applications memory state
an attacker can utilize this issue to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
