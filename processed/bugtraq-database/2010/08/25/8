TPTI-10-13: Adobe Shockwave Director tSAC Chunk Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-10-13
August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2866

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing
Director's RIFF-based file format. While parsing the tSAC chunk, the
DIRAPI module does not properly verify the signedness of a count value
within an undocumented structure. By providing a large enough negative
value a pointer can be miscalculated leading to memory corruption. This
can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under
the context of the user running the web browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
