4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in glpng, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application
using the library.

1) An integer overflow error within the "pngLoadRawF()" function in
glpng.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g.
tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PNG file in an
application using the library.

2) An integer overflow error within the "pngLoadF()" function in
glpng.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g.
tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PNG file in an
application using the library.
