Description:
    Previous versions of curl do not properly restrict the amount of
    callback data sent to an application that requests automatic 
    decompression, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (application crash) or have unspecified other impact by
    sending crafted compressed data to an application that relies on the
    intended data-length limit.  This has been fixed.
