Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in libpng might lead to privilege escalation
or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

libpng is a standard library used to process PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) images. It is used by several programs, including web
browsers and potentially server processes.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libpng       < 1.4.3                          >= 1.4.3

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libpng:

* The png_decompress_chunk() function in pngrutil.c does not properly
  handle certain type of compressed data (CVE-2010-0205)

* A buffer overflow in pngread.c when using progressive applications
  (CVE-2010-1205)

* A memory leak in pngrutil.c when dealing with a certain type of
  chunks (CVE-2010-2249)

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause programs
linked against the library to crash or execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the vulnerable program, which could be
the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.4.3"
