-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Download Manager. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the gp.ocx ActiveX control. This control
has a CLSID of {E2883E8F-472F-4fb0-9522-AC9BF37916A7} and the ProgID
Atlcom.get_atlcom. Upon initialization this control copies the values
from two parameters into a fixed length buffer. If supplied with large
enough values this can lead lead to a buffer overflow that can be
leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running the browser.
