-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the libpr0n library which is responsible
for handling image caching and animation and is due to the way the
application handles animations received from the server via the
multipart/x-mixed-replace mimetype. During a case where the
bits-per-pixel changes, the application will free a pointer and then can
be made to reuse the freed pointer later. This can lead to code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
