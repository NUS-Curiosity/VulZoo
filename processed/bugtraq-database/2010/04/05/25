-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun's Java Runtime Environment. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of MixerSequencer objects.
When this object is used to play a MIDI file, the GM_Song structure is
populated with song data. In particular, it stores a integer value from
the file and uses it later as an index into an array of function
pointers. If this value is over 128 the process can be made to call a
pointer outside the array. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the user running the applet.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
