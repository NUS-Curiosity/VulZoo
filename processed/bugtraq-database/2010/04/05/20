-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of MPEG content. Upon
reading a field used for compression within a 'genl' atom in the movie
container, the application will decompress outside the boundary of an
allocated buffer. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution
under the context of the application.
