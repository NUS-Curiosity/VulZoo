4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in e107, which can be
exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.

Input passed via the "content_heading" parameter to 
107_plugins/content/content_manager.php while creating new content is
not properly sanitised before being displayed to the user. This can be
