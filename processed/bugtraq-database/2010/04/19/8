4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in e107, which can be
exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.

An error exists in the handling of file uploads for avatar and
photograph images. This can be exploited to upload and execute 
arbitrary PHP code via a specially crafted image file with a 
".php.filetypesphp" extension.

Successful exploitation requires that "Public Uploads" are disabled 
(default), but uploads for avatar or photograph images for users are 
enabled, and a certain server configuration (e.g. an Apache server 
with the "mod_mime" module installed).

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 0.7.20.
