Package        : freetype
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1133 CVE-2012-1134 CVE-2012-1136 CVE-2012-1142 
                 CVE-2012-1144

Mateusz Jurczyk from the Google Security Team discovered several
vulnerabilties in Freetype's parsing of BDF, Type1 and TrueType fonts,
which could result in the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed
font file is processed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-2.1+squeeze4. The updated packages are already available
since yesterday, but the advisory text couldn't be send earlier.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.
