APPLE-SA-2012-03-12-1 Safari 5.1.4

Safari 5.1.4 is now available and addresses the following:

Safari
Available for:  Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later
Impact:  Look-alike characters in a URL could be used to masquerade a
website
Description:  The International Domain Name (IDN) support in Safari
could be used to create a URL which contains look-alike characters.
These could be used in a malicious web site to direct the user to a
spoofed site that visually appears to be a legitimate domain. This
issue is addressed through an improved domain name validity check.
This issue does not affect OS X systems.
