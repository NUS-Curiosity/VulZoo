ZDI-12-136 : Apple QuickTime Invalid Public Movie Atom Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-136
August 17, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3220

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
Apple

- -- Affected Products:
Apple QuickTime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's QuickTime player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within how the application handles a malformed
atom type when playing a movie encoded with uncompressed audio. When
decoding the audio sample the application will use a 16-bit length for
allocating a buffer, and a different one for initializing it. This can
cause memory corruption which can lead to code execution under the context
of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222
