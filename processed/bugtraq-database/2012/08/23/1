ZDI-12-145 : Symantec Endpoint Protection SemSvc.exe AgentServlet Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-145
August 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0289

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Symantec

- -- Affected Products:
Symantec Endpoint Protection

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec Endpoint Protection. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within SemSvc.exe which listens by default on TCP
port 8443 (https).  The SemSvc service exposes a servlet called
'AgentServlet" which allows remote users to activate certain tasks without
prior authentication. In doing so, it is vulnerable to directory traversal
attacks and arbitrary file deletion. When certain files are deleted, the
eval() method will allow for executing user supplied commands. An attacker
can leverage these vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the
SYSTEM.

- -- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
