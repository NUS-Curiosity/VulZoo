- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within Quicktime.qts when parsing the 'sean' atom.
The size specified in the atom's header is added to 0x0C and subsequently
allocated. File data is then copied into that buffer along with a series of
nulls. If the buffer is undersized, the copy operation can be made to
corrupt adjacent memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
execute code under the context of the process.

- -- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
