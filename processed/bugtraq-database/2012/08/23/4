- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of GE Proficy Real-Time Information Portal.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

This specific flaw exists within the Remote Interface Service
(rifsrvd.exe). The Remote Interface Service listens on TCP port 5159 by
default. The process does not sufficiently validate two input strings that
are used to create a configuration file on the server. Remote,
unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending
malformed ID_SAVE_SRVC_CFG message packets to the target, which could
ultimately lead to remote code execution under the context of the SYSTEM
user.

- -- Vendor Response:
GE has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
found at:
