CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3418 CVE-2012-3419 CVE-2012-3420 CVE-2012-3421

It was discovered that Performance Co-Pilot (pcp), a framework for
performance monitoring, contains several vulnerabilites.

CVE-2012-3418
	Multiple buffer overflows in the PCP protocol decoders can
	cause PCP clients and servers to crash or, potentially,
	execute arbitrary code while processing crafted PDUs.

CVE-2012-3419
	The "linux" PMDA used by the pmcd daemon discloses sensitive
	information from the /proc file system to unauthenticated
	clients.

CVE-2012-3420
	Multiple memory leaks processing crafted requests can cause
	pmcd to consume large amounts of memory and eventually crash.

CVE-2012-3421
	Incorrect event-driven programming allows malicious clients to
	prevent other clients from accessing the pmcd daemon.

To address the information disclosure vulnerability, CVE-2012-3419, a
new "proc" PMDA was introduced, which is disabled by default.  If you
need access to this information, you need to enable the "proc" PMDA.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.3-squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.5.

We recommend that you upgrade your pcp packages.
