Subject: [CVE-2012-3870] Openconstructor CMS 3.12.0 'createobject.php',
 'name' and 'description' parameters Stored Cross-site Scrpting
 vulnerabilities

###Title###: 
Openconstructor CMS 3.12.0 'createobject.php', 'name' and 'description' parameters Stored Cross-site Scrpting vulnerabilities


###Affected Software###:

###Description###: 
Openconstructor (formerly known as eSector Solutions Web Constructor) is an open source web Content Management System written in PHP. Stored XSS vulnerabilities exist on the 'name' and 'description' 
parameters, which are used as properties when creating a new object. Verson 3.12.0 is vulnerable, previous version may be affected, but they have not been tested.


###CVE###
CVE-2012-3870


###Impact###:
Authenticated attackers can plant malicious javascript in the web application, with the aim to execute it on the other user's browser.

CVSS Base Score: 4.9 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N)

###Details###:
When creating a new object in the "object" section, the application asks to set a name and a description for that object.
The application does not escape the html tags correctly for these parameters. The vulnerability has been tested on an Internet Explorer 7 browser (because the application is designed
to work with IE). Newer version of the browser with the anti-xss filter enabled, may help to protect users from such attacks.

'createobject.php' contains multiple lines of code (for the various kind of objects) with code similar to the following one:

$obj->name = $_POST['name'];
$obj->description = $_POST['description'];
$result = ObjManager::create($obj);

$obj with name and description attributes is passed to ObjManager::create() function without HTML escaping.

When the user access the "Object" section and list the objects with a malicious name or description, will trigger the exploit. Additionally, if the object can be published,
the exploit can be triggered also in the "Sitemap" section.


###Proof of Concept###:
Here is a trace of the required POST to plant the javascript
