ZDI-12-134 : IBM Lotus Quickr QP2 ActiveX _Times Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability

August  3, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-2176

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
IBM

- -- Affected Products:
IBM Lotus Quickr

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Quickr. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the QP2.cab ActiveX control. When passing a
long string argument to the Attachment_Times or Import_Times parameters
during the control's instantiation it is possible to overflow a stack
buffer causing memory corruption. This can be leveraged by an attacker to
execute code under the context of the user running the browser.

- -- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
found at:
