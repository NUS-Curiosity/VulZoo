Package        : pdns
Vulnerability  : packet loop
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0206

Ray Morris discovered that the PowerDNS authoritative sever responds
to response packets.  An attacker who can spoof the source address of
IP packets can cause an endless packet loop between a PowerDNS
authoritative server and another DNS server, leading to a denial of
service.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.21.2-1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.22-8+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.
