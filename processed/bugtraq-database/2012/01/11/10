3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in NTR ActiveX 
control, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by missing input validation in the 
handling of the "StopModule()" method and can be exploited via a 
specially crafted "lModule" parameter to reference an expected module 
structure at an arbitrary memory address. This can be exploited to 
dereference an arbitrary value in memory as a function pointer.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

Upgrade to version 2.0.4.8.
