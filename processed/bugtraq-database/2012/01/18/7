Cisco IP Video Phone E20 Default Root Account

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120118-te

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 January 18 16:00  UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco TelePresence Software version TE 4.1.0 contains a default
account vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to take complete control of the affected device.

The vulnerability is due to an architectural change that was made in
the way the system maintains administrative accounts. During the
process of upgrading a Cisco IP Video Phone E20 device to TE 4.1.0, an
unsecured default account may be introduced. An attacker who is able
to take advantage of this vulnerability could log in to the device as
the root user and perform arbitrary actions with elevated privileges.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.

Affected Products
=================

Cisco TelePresence TE Software runs on Cisco IP Video Phone E20
devices.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco IP Video Phone E20 devices that have been upgraded to TE 4.1.0
are affected.

The TE 4.1.0 release has been deferred from Cisco.com and
Tandberg.com, and is no longer available for download. The deferral
notice can be found at the following link: Software Deferral Notice


Administrators can determine the version of software running on their
device by logging in to the command-line interface (CLI) as the admin
user and issuing the xstatus systemunit command and finding the
SystemUnit Software Version field.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco TelePresence TE Software historically has contained a single
account that acted as both admin and root. This single super account
utilized the same password for both the admin and root authentication
and was always enabled. With the introduction of TE 4.1.0, an
architectural change was made to help harden the devices by allowing
administrators to disable the root account. The intended result of
this change is to separate the super account into two accounts, root
and admin, while subsequently disabling the root account by default.

It was found that in many cases, customers upgrading from a previous
release of TE software to TE 4.1.0 are likely to experience an error
condition in which the root account is not properly disabled. This
creates a situation in which the root account is accessible via SSH
with a default password. It was subsequently discovered that the
command implemented to allow an administrator to enable or disable the
root account does not function correctly.

Workarounds are available in the Workarounds section of this
document.  These workarounds involve changing the root and admin
passwords to administrator-defined values.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtw69889 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2011-4659.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has scored the vulnerability in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this
security advisory is in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps organizations determine the urgency and priority of
a response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can also
compute environmental scores that help determine the impact of the
vulnerability in their own networks.

Cisco has provided additional information regarding CVSS at the
following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to compute the environmental
impact for individual networks at the following link:
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss


*  CSCtw69889 - Cisco TelePresence TE Software Default Root Account Vulnerability 

CVSS Base Score - 10.0
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain root access to the affected
device.  This could allow the attacker to take arbitrary actions on
the device with elevated privileges.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult
the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at:
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
And review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded
contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and
software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the
new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to
contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their
contracted maintenance providers.

Cisco TelePresence Software version TE 4.1.1 is available on Cisco.com
and replaces TE 4.1.0.

Customers Using Third-Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers with Cisco products that are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers,
should contact that organization for assistance with the appropriate
course of action.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix depends on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Because of the variety of
affected products and releases, customers should consult their service
providers or support organizations to ensure that any applied
workaround or fix is the most appropriate in the intended network
before it is deployed.
