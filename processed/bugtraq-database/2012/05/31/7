Package        : strongswan
Vulnerability  : authentication bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2388

An authentication bypass issue was discovered by the Codenomicon CROSS
project in strongSwan, an IPsec-based VPN solution. When using
RSA-based setups, a missing check in the gmp plugin could allow an
attacker presenting a forged signature to successfully authenticate
against a strongSwan responder.

The default configuration in Debian does not use the gmp plugin for
RSA operations but rather the OpenSSL plugin, so the packages as
shipped by Debian are not vulnerable.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
