Package        : ikiwiki
Vulnerability  : cross-site scripting
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0220

Ra√∫l Benencia discovered that ikiwiki, a wiki compiler, does not
properly escape the author (and its URL) of certain metadata, such as
comments. This might be used to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20100815.9.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20120516.

We recommend that you upgrade your ikiwiki packages.
