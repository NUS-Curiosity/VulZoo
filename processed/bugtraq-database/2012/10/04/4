Subject: XnView JLS File Decompression Heap Overflow 

XnView JLS File Decompression Heap Overflow 

Summary

XnView Formats PlugIn is prone to an overflow condition. The JLS Plugin (xjpegls.dll) library fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. With a specially crafted JLS compressed image file, a context-dependent attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.
