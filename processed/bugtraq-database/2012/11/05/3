Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceape, an internet
suite based on Seamonkey:

CVE-2012-3982
        Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
        allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
        corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
        arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
        Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
        A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
        implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
        code via unspecified vectors, related to the
        nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
        Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
        GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
        the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
        impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
        attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
        service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
        remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
        vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
        memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
        allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
        unspecified vectors.

Additionally, this update fixes a regression in the patch for
CVE-2012-3959, released in DSA-2554-1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-16.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.
