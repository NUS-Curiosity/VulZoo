The problem with rainbow tables for WPA2-PSK is that a rainbow table can 
only be created for one specific network name (ESSID). The default 
wireless network configured by Belkin has a network name such as 
"Belkin.34cb". Having this additional three or four hex digits means 
that one had to create 4096 or 65,536 different rainbow tables with each 
of them containing a large percentage of the 2^32 possible keys. While 
this may in theory be feasible, creating the rainbow tables would 
require a significant amount of computation power and storage.

Given the fact that the key can be calculated solely based on the 
publicly visible mac address (BSSID) of the wireless network (with some 
minor variations between the different router models), doing the actual 
brute force is not required to crack the key.
