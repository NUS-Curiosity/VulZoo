Package        : extplorer
Vulnerability  : Cross-site request forgery
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3362
Debian Bug     : 678737

John Leitch has discovered a vulnerability in eXtplorer, a very feature
rich web server file manager, which can be exploited by malicious people
to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks.

The vulnerability allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests 
without performing any validity checks to verify the request. This can be 
exploited for example, to create an administrative user account by tricking
an logged administrator to visiting an attacker-defined web link.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.2-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.3-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.3-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your extplorer packages.
