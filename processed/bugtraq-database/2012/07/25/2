APPLE-SA-2012-07-25-1 Safari 6.0

Safari 6.0 is now available and addresses the following:

Safari
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4
Impact:  Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-
site scripting attack
Description:  A cross-site scripting issue existed in the handling of
feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.
CVE-ID
CVE-2012-0678 : Masato Kinugawa

Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4
Impact:  Visiting a maliciously crafted website may cause files from
the user's system to be sent to a remote server
Description:  An access control issue existed in the handling of
feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.
CVE-ID
CVE-2012-0679 : Aaron Sigel of vtty.com

Safari
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

autocomplete should be disabled

CVE-ID
CVE-2012-0680 : Dan Poltawski of Moodle

Safari Downloads
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4
Impact:  Opening maliciously crafted files on certain websites may
lead to a cross-site scripting attack
Description:  An issue existed in Safari's support for the
'attachment' value for the HTTP Content-Disposition header. This
header is used by many websites to serve files that were uploaded to
the site by a third-party, such as attachments in web-based e-mail
applications. Any script in files served with this header value would
run as if the file had been served inline, with full access to other
resources on the origin server. This issue is addressed by
downloading resources served with this header, rather than displaying
them inline.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3426 : Mickey Shkatov of laplinker.com, Kyle Osborn,
Hidetake Jo at Microsoft and Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR)

WebKit
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4
