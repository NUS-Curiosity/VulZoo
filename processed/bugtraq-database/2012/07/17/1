Windows Kernel ReadLayoutFile Heap Overflow


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Windows Kernel ReadLayoutFile Heap Overflow
Advisory ID: CORE-2011-1123
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/windows-kernel-readlayoutfile
Date published: 2012-05-08
Date of last update: 2012-07-11
Vendors contacted: Microsoft
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Heap-based Buffer Overflow [CWE-122]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2012-1890


3. *Vulnerability Description*

There is a bug in the ReadLayoutFile Windows Kernel function that can be
leveraged into a local privilege escalation exploit, potentially usable
in a client-side attack scenario or after a remote intrusion by other
means.

This bug is similar to another bug used by a client-side exploit in
Stuxnet.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Windows XP SP3.
   . Windows Vista SP2.
   . Windows 7
   . Windows 7 SP1.
   . Windows Server 2003 SP2.
   . Windows Server 2008 SP2.
   . Other Windows versions might be vulnerable but were not tested.


5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Apply security patch MS12-047 [4]


6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Nicol√°s Economou
from Core Security Technologies. The publication of this advisory was
coordinated by Fernando Russ.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

There is a bug in the 'ReadLayoutFile' Windows Kernel ('win32k.sys')
function that can be leveraged into a local privilege escalation
exploit, potentially usable in a client-side attack scenario, or after a
remote intrusion by other means.

Custom keyboard layouts are implemented using a .dll file exporting the
'KbdLayerDescriptor' function which, in theory, returns a pointer to a
structure of type 'KBDTABLES' that is stored in the '.DATA' sections of
the PE file. The 'NtUserLoadKeyboardLayoutEx' is a private function used
by 'LoadKeyboardLayout'[2] to load a custom keyboard layout, as
arguments 'NtUserLoadKeyboardLayoutEx' uses an open file handle pointing
to a keyboard layout library. When the function
'NtUserLoadKeyboardLayoutEx' is correctly called the PE file referenced
by its arguments is mapped in kernel space.

The bug is due to a memory corruption: a double word can be overwritten
in a position relative to the base of the allocated memory in kernel
space. We have to distinguish the following constraints for exploiting
this vulnerability:

   . There is no bound check for the value used to index the '.DATA'
section of the keyboard layout .dll where the actual where the actual
layout descriptor table is stored. (So, we can reference spurious memory
address)
   . The file handle used to load the keyboard layout must refer to a
file located in \Windows\System32.
   . The value used to index the '.DATA' section of the keyboard layout
is incorrectly bound checked.

We can confirm reliable exploitation for the following Microsoft Windows
versions:

   . Windows XP SP3,
   . Windows Vista,
   . Windows Server 2003 SP2,
   . Windows Server 2008 SP2.


8. *Report Timeline*

. 2011-11-23:
Core Security Technologies notifies MSRC of the vulnerability, including
technical details and a PoC that crashes Windows XP SP3.

. 2011-11-23:
Vendor acknowledges the receipt of the information. Vendor warns Core
Security Technologies that it may take longer than normal for a
technical review of the bug because of the Thanksgiving holiday.

currently investigating the issue, and that they'll let Core Security
Technologies know of their findings when the investigation is complete.

. 2011-11-29:
Core Security Technologies acknowledges the previous e-mail.

. 2011-12-08:
MSRC contacts Core Security Technologies for a quick update, informing
that they were able to reproduce the crash and that it is indeed very
similar to bug publicly exploited at [1]. MSRC informs that they are
currently discussing the next steps they will take with Windows Product
Team.

. 2012-01-09:
Ivan Arce, current CTO and founder of the Core Advisories Team, leaves

. 2012-01-18:
Core acknowledges the previous update and notifies that Nicolas Economou
has further analyzed the crash (publicly available in exploit-db) and
concluded it is indeed a different issue. Core offers to compile
Nicolas' findings into a private technical report.

. 2012-01-18:
MSRC validates Nicolas' findings stating the two issues are separate,
even though they share a same code area.

. 2012-03-09:
Core asks if the March publication date still stands.

. 2012-03-12:
MSRC notifies that, due to some late findings about app-compat concerns,
they will need more time to issue the patch. MSRC asks to re-schedule
the advisory publication to May 8th.

. 2012-03-09:
Core re-schedules the advisory publication to May 8th.

. 2012-04-01:
