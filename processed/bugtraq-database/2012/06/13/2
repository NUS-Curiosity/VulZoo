- -- Affected Products:

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Internet Explorer handles
dynamically changed colspans on a column in a table with the
table-layout:fixed style. If the colspan is increased after initial
creation it will result in a heap overflow. This can lead to remote code
execution under the context of the current program.

- -- Vendor Response:

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
