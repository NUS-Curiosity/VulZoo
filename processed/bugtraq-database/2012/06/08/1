Subject: CVE-2012-3287: md5crypt is no longer considered safe

The LinkedIn password incompetence has resulted in a number of "just use md5crypt and you'll be fine" pieces of advice on the net.

Since I no longer consider this to be the case, I have issued an official statement, as the author of md5crypt, to the opposite effect:

Please find something better now.

Thanks for using my code.
