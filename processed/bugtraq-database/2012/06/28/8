- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
Mozilla

- -- Affected Products:
Mozilla Firefox

TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Firefox handles nsDOMAttribute
child removal. It is possible to remove a child without setting the removed
child pointer to NULL, thus leaving it still accessible as a dangling
pointer. Subsequent use of this pointer allows for remote code execution. 

- -- Vendor Response:
Mozilla has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
