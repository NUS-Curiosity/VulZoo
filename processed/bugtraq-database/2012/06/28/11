- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Rational ClearQuest. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the CQOle ActiveX control. A function
prototype mismatch in an ActiveX wrapper results in an extra argument to be
pushed onto the stack, thereby misaligning the stack offset. When the
function returns, it can be made to jump to a memory address provided via
the ActiveX method call. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the user running the browser.

- -- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
found at:
