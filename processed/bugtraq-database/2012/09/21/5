APPLE-SA-2012-09-19-3 Safari 6.0.1

Safari 6.0.1 is now available and addresses the following:

Safari
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5,
OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1
Impact:  Opening a maliciously crafted downloaded HTML document may
lead to the disclosure of local file content
Description:  In OS X Mountain Lion HTML files were removed from the
unsafe type list. Quarantined HTML documents are opened in a safe
mode that prevents accessing other local or remote resources. A logic
error in Safari's handling of the Quarantine attribute caused the
safe mode not to be triggered on Quarantined files. This issue was
addressed by properly detecting the existence of the Quarantine
attribute.

Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5,
OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1
Impact:  Using Autofill on a maliciously crafted website may lead to
the disclosure of contact information
Description:  A rare condition existed in the handling of Form
Autofill. Using Form Autofill on a maliciously crafted website may
have led to disclosure of information from the Address Book "Me" card
that was not included in the Autofill popover. This issue was
addressed by limiting Autofill to the fields contained in the
popover.
