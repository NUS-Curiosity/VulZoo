RESOLUTION

HP has provided SiteScope update v11.13 to update for HP SiteScope v11.10 to
enable a resolution of this issue.

Obtain SiteScope update v11.13 from HP Software Support Online at
http://support.openview.hp.com/downloads.jsp .

Note: to prevent the vulnerability after applying the update an administrator
must disable the vulnerable SOAP API by adding the "_disableOldAPIs=true"
property to the master.config file. However, for application comparability
purposes, the default property is set to false to support integrations with
old versions of BSM/BAC, which disables the security protection.
