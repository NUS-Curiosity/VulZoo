Package        : zabbix
Vulnerability  : SQL injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3435
Debian Bug     : 683273

It was discovered that Zabbix, a network monitoring solution, does not
properly validate user input used as a part of an SQL query. This may
allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands (SQL
injection) and possibly escalate privileges.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.2-1squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.0.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.
