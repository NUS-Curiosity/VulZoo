+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unity Connection contains two vulnerabilities:


  * Cisco Unity Connection Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
  * Cisco Unity Connection Denial of Service Vulnerability

Exploitation of the Cisco Unity Connection Privilege Escalation
Vulnerability may allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate
privileges and obtain full access to the affected system.

Exploitation of the Cisco Unity Connection Denial of Service
Vulnerability  may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
system services to terminate unexpectedly, which may result in a
denial of service condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that mitigate these
vulnerabilities.

Information About Cisco Business Edition

Cisco Business Edition, Cisco Business Edition 5000, and Cisco
Business Edition 6000 are affected by these vulnerabilities if the
Cisco Unity Connection version that is used is among the affected
versions in the tables reported in the "Vulnerable Products" section
of the security advisory.

Cisco Business Edition 3000 is not affected by the vulnerabilities
included in this security advisory.

Determine the Software Version
+-----------------------------

To determine the Cisco Unity Connection software version that an
appliance is running, administrators can access the Cisco Unity
Connection web interface and click the "About" link at the top right.

Optionally administrators can log in to the command-line interface,
and access the main menu. The software version can be identified by
using the show version active command. The following example shows
Cisco Unity Connection running version 8.6.2:

    Welcome to the Platform Command Line Interface
    
    admin:show version active
    Active Master Version: 8.6.2.10000-30

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities. Cisco Unified Communication Manager and Cisco
Business Edition 3000 are not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Unity Connection is a feature-rich voice messaging platform
that runs on the same Linux-based Cisco Unified Communications
Operating System that is used by Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Cisco Unity Connection scales to support enterprise
organizations with up to 100,000 users.

Cisco Unity Connection Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
+--------------------------------------------------------

Cisco Unity Connection contains a vulnerability that may allow an
authenticated, remote attacker with privilege of the Help Desk
Administrator role to elevate privileges and obtain full access to
the affected system.

The vulnerability is due to improper privilege assignment and
validation of the "Help Desk Administrator" role. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system as the Help
Desk Administrator user and changing the password for the
administrative user.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtd45141 
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
ID CVE-2012-0366.

Cisco Unity Connection Denial of Service Vulnerability
+-----------------------------------------------------

Cisco Unity Connection contains a vulnerability that may allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause system services to
terminate unexpectedly, which may result in a denial of service.
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of TCP segments. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of
TCP segments to the affected system.


This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtq67899 
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID 
CVE-2012-0367.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has scored the vulnerabilities in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this
security advisory is in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps organizations determine the urgency and priority
of a response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can also
compute environmental scores that help determine the impact of the
vulnerability in their own networks.

Cisco has provided additional information regarding CVSS at the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at the following link:

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded
contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and
software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the
new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised
to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their
contracted maintenance providers.


Workarounds
===========
There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================
Cisco has released free software updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Prior to deploying
software, customers are advised to consult their maintenance
providers or check the software for feature set compatibility and
known issues that are specific to their environments.

Customers may only install and expect support for feature sets they
have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise
using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of
the Cisco software license at:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html
or as set forth at http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, upgrades should be
obtained through the Software Center on Cisco.com at:
http://www.cisco.com

Customers Using Third-Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers with Cisco products that are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers,
should contact that organization for assistance with the appropriate
course of action.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix depends on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Because of the variety of
affected products and releases, customers should consult their
service providers or support organizations to ensure that any applied
workaround or fix is the most appropriate in the intended network
before it is deployed.

Customers Without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have the product serial number available and be
prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of
entitlement to a free upgrade. Customers without service contracts
should request free upgrades through the TAC.
