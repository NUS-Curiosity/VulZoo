Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : code injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0830 

Stefan Esser discovered that the implementation of the max_input_vars
configuration variable in a recent PHP security update was flawed such
that it allows remote attackers to crash PHP or potentially execute
code.

This update adds packages for the oldstable distribution, which were
missing from the original advisory. The problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny16, installed into the security archive
on 3 Feb 2012.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
