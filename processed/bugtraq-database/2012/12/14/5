Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
The tunnel-server component of the VMware View Connection Server fails
to ensure that  each requested URL refers to a file that is both
located within the web root of the server and is of a type that is
allowed to be served. 

A remote unauthenticated attacker can use this weakness to retrieve
arbitrary files from the affected server's underlying root file
system. This can be accomplished by submitting URL encoded HTTP GET
requests that traverse out of the affected subdirectory.

Solution Description
--------------------
VMware has produced a solution for the issue in the form of an upgrade
which is available through their website. The VMware advisory can be
found: http://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2012-0017.html
