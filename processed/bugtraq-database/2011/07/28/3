TeamSHATTER Security Advisory

Oracle Enterprise Manager vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (metricDetail$type page)

July 26, 2011

Risk Level:
Medium

Affected versions:
Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control versions 10.1.0.6, 10.2.0.5
Oracle Enterprise Manager control included in Oracle Database versions 10.1.0.5, 10.2.0.3, 10.2.0.4, 10.2.0.5, 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.1, 11.2.0.2
Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martinez Fayo of Application Security, Inc.

Details:
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when an attacker tricks a legitimate web application into sending malicious code, generally in the form of a script, to an unsuspecting end user. The attack usually involves crafting a hyperlink with malicious script code embedded within it. A valid user is likely to click this link since it points to a resource on a trusted domain. The link can be posted on a web page, or sent in an instant message, or email. Clicking on the link executes the attacker-injected code in the context of the trusted web application. Typically, the code steals session cookies, which can then be used to impersonate a valid user.
There are instances of XSS vulnerabilities in the Instance Management component of Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control.  For example the 'commentinput' parameter of /em/console/database/monitoring/metricDetail$type web page is vulnerable to this kind of attacks.

Impact:
Attackers might steal administrator's session cookies, thereby allowing the attacker to impersonate the valid user.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Fix:
Apply July 2011 CPU.
