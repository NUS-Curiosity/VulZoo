Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 07.20.11: Multiple Vendor WebKit frameset
 style Heap Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.20.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 20, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

WebKit is an open source web browser engine. It is currently used by
Apple Inc.'s Safari browser, as well as by Google's Chrome browser. For
more information, see the vendor's site at the following link.

http://webkit.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap based buffer overflow vulnerability in
WebKit, as included with Apple Inc.'s Safari Web browser, could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current
user.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing a frameset element with a
malicious style attribute. Specifically, by setting the padding property
to certain values it is possible to trigger a heap based memory
corruption vulnerability. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious webpage
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.
After the user visits the malicious web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

Safari versions prior to 5.1 and 5.0.6 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of an effective workaround for this
vulnerability as it occurs in the core parsing code. However, disabling
scripting will make the vulnerability more difficult to exploit using
known techniques.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Apple Inc. has released patches which addresses this issue. For more
