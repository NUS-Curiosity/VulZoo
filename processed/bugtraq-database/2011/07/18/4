Package        : oprofile
Vulnerability  : command injection
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 624212
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1760

Jamie Strandboge noticed that the patch propoused to fix CVE-2011-1760 in 
OProfile has been incomplete.

For reference, the description of the original DSA, is:

OProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its
control utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary
commands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is
authorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the
flaw to escalate his privileges.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.3-2+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.1+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.4.


We recommend that you upgrade your oprofile packages.
