Paul Belanger reported a vulnerability in Asterisk identified as AST-2011-008 
(CVE-2011-2529) through which an unauthenticated attacker may crash an Asterisk 
server remotely. A package containing a null char causes the SIP header parser 
to alter unrelated memory structures.

Jared Mauch reported a vulnerability in Asterisk identified as AST-2011-009 
through which an unauthenticated attacker may crash an Asterisk server remotely. 
If a user sends a package with a Contact header with a missing left angle 
bracket (<) the server will crash. A possible workaround is to disable chan_sip.

The vulnerability identified as AST-2011-010 (CVE-2011-2535) reported about an

may crash an Asterisk server remotely by sending a crafted option control frame.
