Package        : krb5-appl
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1526 

Tim Zingelmann discovered that due an incorrect configure script the 
kerborised FTP server failed to set the effective GID correctly, 
resulting in privilege escalation.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5-appl packages.
