APPLE-SA-2011-11-14-1 iTunes 10.5.1

iTunes 10.5.1 is now available and addresses the following:

iTunes
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.5 or later, Windows 7, Vista,
XP SP2 or later
Impact:  A man-in-the-middle attacker may offer software that appears
to originate from Apple
Description:  iTunes periodically checks for software updates using
an HTTP request to Apple. This request may cause iTunes to indicate
that an update is available. If Apple Software Update for Windows is
not installed, clicking the Download iTunes button may open the URL
from the HTTP response in the user's default browser. This issue has
been mitigated by using a secured connection when checking for
available updates. For OS X systems, the user's default browser is
not used because Apple Software Update is included with OS X,
however this change adds additional defense-in-depth.
