- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Realplayer.  User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way RealPlayer handles MPEG files.
Realplayer parses the mpg file by doing a do while loop where it uses
the width of the movie for the loop condition. However, it will
substracts 1 from the width for every iteration of the loop and then
compare it to 0. If the width of the movie was zero at the beginning the
loop will run 0xFFFFFFFF times. This results in a memory corruption that
can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current user.
