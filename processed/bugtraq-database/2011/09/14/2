Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 09.13.11: Microsoft Excel Record Integer
 Signedness Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 09.13.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 13, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Excel is the spreadsheet application included with Microsoft Corp.'s
Office productivity software suite. More information is available at the
following website:

http://office.microsoft.com/excel/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer signedness vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Excel could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability is an integer signedness issue that leads to an
invalid array indexing vulnerability. It is triggered by a certain
record with a negative 'iax' field.

It is possible to pass negative 16-bit values, which are later sign
extended to 32 bits. The sign extended value is later used as an index
into a heap-based array. Due to the incomplete validation of the 'iax'
field, it is possible to index outside of the bounds of the array, which
can lead to a controlled overwrite of arbitrary memory locations with
user data. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious
file. Attackers typically accomplish this by e-mailing a targeted user
the file or hosting the file on a Web page.
