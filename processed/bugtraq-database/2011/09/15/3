Unified Operations Manager Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110914-cusm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 September 14 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Two vulnerabilities exist in Cisco Unified Service Monitor and Cisco
Unified Operations Manager software that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on
affected servers.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

There are no workarounds available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110914-cusm.shtml

Note: CiscoWorks LAN Management Solution is also affected by these
vulnerabilities. A separate advisory for CiscoWorks LAN Management
Solution is available at:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110914-lms.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

All versions of Cisco Unified Service Monitor and Cisco Unified
Operations Manager prior to 8.6 are affected.

To determine the Cisco Unified Service Monitor and Cisco Unified
Operations Manager software version navigate to Administration >
Software Center (Common Services) > Software Update. The Software
Update page displays the licensing and software version.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products other than the CiscoWorks LAN Management
Solution are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Service Monitor and Cisco Unified Operations Manager
are products from the Cisco Unified Communications Management Suite.
They provides a way to continuously monitor active calls supported by
the Cisco Unified Communications System.

Two vulnerabilities exist in Cisco Unified Service Monitor and Cisco
Unified Operations Manager software that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on
affected servers. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending a
series of crafted packets to the affected server over TCP port 9002.

Both of these vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug ID 
CSCtn42961 ( registered customers only) and have been assigned CVE ID
CVE-2011-2738.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

*  CSCtn42961 - Cisco Unified Service Monitor Remote Code Execution

CVSS Base Score - 10
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         Complete
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 8.3
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on
affected servers.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine 
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

These vulnerabilities have been corrected in Cisco Unified Service
Monitor and Cisco Unified Operations Manager software version 8.6.

Cisco Unified Service Monitor and Cisco Unified Operations Manager
software can be downloaded from the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?mdfid=280110371&i=rm

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network
are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion
document for this advisory, which is available at the following link:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-201100914-cusm-lms.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to:

for additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone 
numbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
