CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2930 CVE-2011-2931 CVE-2011-3186 CVE-2009-4214

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4214

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters
    that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only
    affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).

CVE-2011-2930

    A SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote_table_name
    method could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a
    query.

CVE-2011-2931

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags  helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,
    who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output
    document.

CVE-2011-3186

    A newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in
    response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
    HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the
    Content-Type header.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
