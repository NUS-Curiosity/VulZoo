Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform.

CVE-2010-4351
    The JNLP SecurityManager returns from the checkPermission method
    instead of throwing an exception in certain circumstances, which
    might allow context-dependent attackers to bypass the intended
    security policy by creating instances of ClassLoader.

CVE-2010-4448
    Malicious applets can perform DNS cache poisoning.

CVE-2010-4450
    An empty (but set) LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable results in
    a misconstructed library search path, resulting in code execution
    from possibly untrusted sources.

CVE-2010-4465
    Malicious applets can extend their privileges by abusing Swing
    timers.

CVE-2010-4469
    The Hotspot just-in-time compiler miscompiles crafted byte
    sequences, resulting in heap corruption.

CVE-2010-4470
    JAXP can be exploited by untrusted code to elevate privileges.

CVE-2010-4471
    Java2D can be exploited by untrusted code to elevate privileges.

CVE-2010-4472
    Untrusted code can replace the XML DSIG implementation.

CVE-2011-0025
    Signatures on JAR files are not properly verified, which allows
    remote attackers to trick users into executing code that appears
    to come from a trusted source.

CVE-2011-0706
    The JNLPClassLoader class allows remote attackers to gain
    privileges via unknown vectors related to multiple signers and the
    assignment of "an inappropriate security descriptor

In addition, this security update contains stability fixes, such as
switching to the recommended Hotspot version (hs14) for this
particular version of OpenJDK.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.7-2~lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.7-2~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.8.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
