Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.12.11: Microsoft Internet Explorer
 Use-After-Free Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.12.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 12, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Internet Explorer is a graphical web browser developed by Microsoft
Corp. that has been included with Microsoft Windows since 1995. For
more information about Internet Explorer, please the visit following
website: <BR> <BR>
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Internet Explorer could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user. <BR> <BR> The
vulnerability occurs when an object is exchanged during a call to a
certain function. The object's memory is freed, however a reference to
the object remains. When the reference is later used to access the
object, this now invalid memory is treated as a valid object and one of
the object members is used to make an indirect function call. This may
result in the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted
sites.

IV. DETECTION

Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Since the vulnerability is triggered through JavaScript, disabling
Active Scripting will prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.
