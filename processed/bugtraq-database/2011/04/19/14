Subject: [USN-1114-1] KDENetwork vulnerability

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1114-1
April 18, 2011

kdenetwork vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 9.10

Summary:

An attacker could overwrite files owned by the user if KGet opened a
crafted metalink file.

Software Description:
- kdenetwork: networking applications for KDE 4

Details:

It was discovered that KGet did not properly perform input validation when
processing metalink files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted
metalink file, a remote attacker could overwrite files via directory
traversal, which could eventually lead to arbitrary code execution.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  kget                            4:4.5.1-0ubuntu2.2

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  kget                            4:4.4.5-0ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 9.10:
  kget                            4:4.3.2-0ubuntu4.5

After a standard system update you need to restart KGet to make all the
necessary changes.
