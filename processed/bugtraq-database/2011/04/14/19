-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Webkit. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way the Webkit library handles WBR
tags on a webpage. By adding children to a WBR tag and then consequently
removing the tag through, for example, a 'removeChild' call it is
possible to create a dangling pointer that can result in remote code
execution under the context of the current user.
