Subject: [USN-1125-1] PCSC-Lite vulnerability

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1125-1
April 27, 2011

pcsc-lite vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 9.10

Summary:

PCSC-Lite could be made to crash or run programs if it accessed a special
smart card.

Software Description:
- pcsc-lite: Middleware to access a smart card using PC/SC (development files)

Details:

Rafael Dominguez Vega discovered that PCSC-Lite incorrectly handled smart
cards with malformed ATR messages. An attacker having physical access
could exploit this with a special smart card and cause a denial of service
or execute arbitrary code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  libpcsclite1                    1.5.5-3ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  libpcsclite1                    1.5.3-1ubuntu4.2

Ubuntu 9.10:
  libpcsclite1                    1.5.3-1ubuntu1.2

After a standard system update you need to restart smart card applications
to make all the necessary changes.
