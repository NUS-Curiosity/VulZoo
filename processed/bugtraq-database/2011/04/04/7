 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2011:061
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ffmpeg
 Date    : April 1, 2011
 Affected: 2010.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been identified and fixed in ffmpeg:
 
 oggparsevorbis.c in FFmpeg 0.5 does not properly perform certain
 pointer arithmetic, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive memory contents and cause a denial of service via a crafted
 file that triggers an out-of-bounds read. (CVE-2009-4632)
 
 vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 uses an assignment operator when a
 comparison operator was intended, which might allow remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted file that modifies a loop counter and triggers a heap-based
 buffer overflow. (CVE-2009-4633)
 
 Multiple integer underflows in FFmpeg 0.5 allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted file that (1) bypasses a validation check in vorbis_dec.c
 and triggers a wraparound of the stack pointer, or (2) access a
 pointer from out-of-bounds memory in mov.c, related to an elst tag
 that appears before a tag that creates a stream. (CVE-2009-4634)
 
 FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with
 improperly ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use
 inconsistent codec types and identifiers, which causes the mp3 decoder
 to process a pointer for a video structure, leading to a stack-based
 buffer overflow. (CVE-2009-4635)
 
 FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang)
 via a crafted file that triggers an infinite loop. (CVE-2009-4636)
 
 The av_rescale_rnd function in the AVI demuxer in FFmpeg 0.5 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted
 AVI file that triggers a divide-by-zero error. (CVE-2009-4639)
 
 Array index error in vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
 code via a crafted Vorbis file that triggers an out-of-bounds
 read. (CVE-2009-4640)
 
 flicvideo.c in libavcodec 0.6 and earlier in FFmpeg, as used in MPlayer
 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via a crafted flic file, related to an arbitrary offset dereference
 vulnerability. (CVE-2010-3429)
 
 Fix memory corruption in WMV parsing (CVE-2010-3908)
 
 libavcodec/vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg 0.6.1
 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a crafted .ogg file, related to the
 vorbis_floor0_decode function. (CVE-2010-4704)
 
 Multiple buffer overflows in vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder
 in FFmpeg, as used in Google Chrome before 8.0.552.237 and Chrome
 OS before 8.0.552.344, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted WebM file, related to buffers
 for (1) the channel floor and (2) the channel residue. (CVE-2011-0480)
 
 Fix heap corruption crashes (CVE-2011-0722)
 
 Fix invalid reads in VC-1 decoding (CVE-2011-0723)
 
 And several additional vulnerabilites originally discovered by Google
 Chrome developers were also fixed with this advisory.
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
