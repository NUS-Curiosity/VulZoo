Package        : jabberd14
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1754

Wouter Coekaerts discovered that jabberd14, an instant messaging server
using the Jabber/XMPP protocol, is vulnerable to the so-called
"billion laughs" attack because it does not prevent entity expansion on
received data.  This allows an attacker to perform denial of service
attacks against the service by sending specially crafted XML data to it.


The oldstable distribution (lenny), does not contain jabberd14.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1.1-5+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1.1-5.1


We recommend that you upgrade your jabberd14 packages.
