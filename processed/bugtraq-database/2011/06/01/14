Details
=======

Cisco Unified IP Phones 7900 Series devices are affected by two
privilege escalation vulnerabilities and a signature bypass
vulnerability. The following sections provide the details of each
vulnerability addressed in this security advisory.

Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities
+------------------------------------
Cisco Unified IP Phones 7900 Series devices are affected by two
privilege escalation vulnerabilities that could allow an
authenticated attacker to make unauthorized phone configuration
changes or obtain potentially sensitive information.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCtf07426 
and CSCtn65815 and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and 
Exposures (CVE) identifiers CVE-2011-1602 and CVE-2011-1603 
respectively.

Signature Verification Bypass Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------
Cisco Unified IP Phones 7900 Series devices are affected by a
signature verification bypass vulnerability that could allow an
authenticated attacker to load a software image without verification
of its signature.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtn65962
and has been assigned CVE identifier CVE-2011-1637.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------
Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the two privilege escalation
vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated attacker to change phone
configuration and obtain system information.

Successful exploitation of the signature verification bypass
vulnerability that could allow an authenticated attacker to load and
execute a software image without verification of its signature.
 

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds available to mitigate any of these
vulnerabilities. Note: All of these vulnerabilities require the
attacker to be authenticated.
 

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html 
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

 

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com

 

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

 
Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
