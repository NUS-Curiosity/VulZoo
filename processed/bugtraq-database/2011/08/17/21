-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Realplayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way RealPlayer handles ID3v2 Tags.
RealPlayer creates a fixed size buffer for certain tags and will then
populate them with the data from the file. It uses a call to
WideCharToMultiByte to convert the data, but fails to take into account
that converting a single wide char might result in more then two
multi-byte chars. This causes more data to be written into the fixed
buffer then anticipated resulting in a heap buffer overflow.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
