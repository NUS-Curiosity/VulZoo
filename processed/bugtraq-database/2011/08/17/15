-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Easy Printer Care. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the XMLSimpleAccessor class ActiveX
control (CLSID 466576F3-19B6-4FF1-BD48-3E0E1BFB96E9). The SaveXML()
method is vulnerable to directory traversal, which allows an attacker to
write arbitrary content to the filesystem. A remote attacker could
leverage this vulnerability to gain code execution under the context of
the web browser.
