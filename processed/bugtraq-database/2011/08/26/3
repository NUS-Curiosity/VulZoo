Cisco Security Advisory: Denial of Service Vulnerabilities in Cisco
Intercompany Media Engine

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110824-ime

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 August 24 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Two denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco
Intercompany Media Engine. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit
these vulnerabilities by sending crafted Service Advertisement
Framework (SAF) packets to an affected device, which may cause the
device to reload.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

There are no available workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110824-ime.shtml

Note: Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software is also affected
by these vulnerabilities. A separate Cisco Security Advisory has been
published to disclose the vulnerabilities that affects the Cisco
Unified Communications Manager. That advisory is available at:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110824-cucm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco Intercompany Media Engine Software Release 8.0.x is affected by
this vulnerability. Cisco Intercompany Media Engine Software Release
8.5.x is not affected.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software Release 8.0.x is also
affected by these vulnerabilities.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Other than the Cisco Unified Communications Manager, no other Cisco
products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Intercompany Media Engine provides a technique for establishing
direct IP connectivity between enterprises by combining peer-to-peer
technologies with the existing public switched telephone network
(PSTN) infrastructure.

Cisco Intercompany Media Engine is affected by two DoS
vulnerabilities that an unauthenticated attacker could exploit by
sending crafted SAF packets to an affected device. Successful
exploitation could cause the device to reload.

Note: A TCP three-way handshake is needed in order to trigger these
vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCth26669 ( 
registered customers only) and CSCth19417 ( registered customers
only) ; and have been assigned CVE IDs CVE-2011-2563 and
CVE-2011-2564, respectively.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------
Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an
affected device to reload. Repeated exploitation could result in a
sustained DoS condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

These vulnerabilities have been corrected in Cisco Intercompany Media
Engine software version 8.5(1) and later.

Cisco Intercompany Media Engine software can be downloaded from:

http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?mdfid=282822890&i=rm

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the
network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin
companion document for this advisory, which is available at the
following link: 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20110824-cucm-ime.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html 
for additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone 
numbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various languages.
