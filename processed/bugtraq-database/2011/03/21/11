Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: yes/no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0441 CVE-2010-3709 CVE-2010-3710 CVE-2010-3870 
                 CVE-2010-4150

Stephane Chazelas discovered that the cronjob of the PHP 5 package in
Debian suffers from a race condition which might be used to remove
arbitrary files from a system (CVE-2011-0441).

When upgrading your php5-common package take special care to _accept_
the changes to the /etc/cron.d/php5 file. Ignoring them would leave the
system vulnerable.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny10.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.6-1.

Additionally, the following vulnerabilities have also been fixed in the
oldstable distribution (lenny):

CVE-2010-3709

    Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the ZipArchive class
    may dereference a NULL pointer when extracting comments from a zip
    archive, leading to application crash and possible denial of
    service.

CVE-2010-3710

    Stefan Neufeind discovered that the FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL filter
    does not correctly handle long, to be validated, strings. Such
    crafted strings may lead to denial of service because of high memory
    consumption and application crash.

CVE-2010-3870

    It was discovered that PHP does not correctly handle certain UTF-8
    sequences and may be used to bypass XSS protections.

CVE-2010-4150

    Mateusz Kocielski discovered that the imap extension may try to
    free already freed memory when processing user credentials, leading
    to application crash and possibly arbitrary code execution.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
