-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of libtiff. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the ThunderDecode
codec. While decoding a particular code within a row, the decoder will
fail to accommodate for the total expanded size of the row. This can
cause a heap-based buffer overflow which can lead to code execution
under the context of the application utilizing the library.

-- Vendor Response:
Libtiff has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
