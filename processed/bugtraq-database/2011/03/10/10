CVE ID         : CVE-2010-1783 CVE-2010-2901 CVE-2010-4199 CVE-2010-4040 CVE-2010-4492 CVE-2010-4493 CVE-2010-4577 CVE-2010-4578 CVE-2010-0474 CVE-2011-0482 CVE-2011-0778

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in webkit, a Web content engine
library for Gtk+. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2010-1783

  WebKit does not properly handle dynamic modification of a
  text node, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
  a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a
  crafted HTML document.


CVE-2010-2901

  The rendering implementation in WebKit allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.


CVE-2010-4199

  WebKit does not properly perform a cast of an
  unspecified variable during processing of an SVG use element, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted SVG document.


CVE-2010-4040

  WebKit does not properly handle animated GIF images,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.


CVE-2010-4492

  Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via vectors involving SVG animations.


CVE-2010-4493

  Use-after-free vulnerability in Webkit allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service via vectors related to the handling of mouse dragging events


CVE-2010-4577

  The CSSParser::parseFontFaceSrc function in WebCore/css/CSSParser.cpp in
  WebKit does not properly parse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted local font, related to "Type Confusion."


CVE-2010-4578

  WebKit does not properly perform cursor handling, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via unknown vectors that lead to "stale pointers."


CVE-2011-0482

  WebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during
  handling of anchors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML document


CVE-2011-0778

  WebKit does not properly restrict drag and drop operations, which might allow
  remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via unspecified vectors.



For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.7-0+squeeze1

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.7-1


Security support for WebKit has been discontinued for the oldstable
distribution (lenny).
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.

We recommend that you upgrade your webkit packages.
