CVE-2011-1530
KDC null pointer dereference in TGS handling

CVSSv2 Vector:          AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C

Report Confidence:      Confirmed

SUMMARY
=======

In releases krb5-1.9 and later, the KDC can crash due to a null
pointer dereference in code that handles TGS (Ticket Granting Service)
requests.  The trigger condition is trivial to produce using
unmodified client software, but requires the ability to authenticate
as a principal in the KDC's realm.

IMPACT
======

An authenticated remote attacker can crash a KDC via null pointer
dereference.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

* The KDC in krb5-1.9 and later is vulnerable.  Earlier releases
  predate the internal interface changes that led to this
  vulnerability.

FIXES
=====

* Workaround: restart the KDC when it crashes, possibly using an
  automated monitoring process.

* Apply the patch:

DETAILS
=======

The process_tgs_req() function in the KDC has logic that attempts to
find an alternative service principal if the service principal in the
client's TGS-REQ is unknown.  If the find_alternate_tgs() helper
function returns an error that is not KRB5_KDB_NOENTRY, it leaves the
server variable holding a null pointer.  The process_tgs_req()
function improperly ignores that error, and proceeds to call functions
that dereference the null pointer.

Prior to krb5-1.9, the krb5_db_get_principal() function and related
interfaces had output parameters "more" and "nprincs".  The krb5-1.9
release includes changes to these interfaces so that they no longer
have those outputs.  Prior to krb5-1.9, the find_alternate_tgs()
function in the KDC had a void return type, and indicated failure by
setting its "more" and "nprincs" outputs appropriately.  Its interface
changed in krb5-1.9 to instead return an error code, with
corresponding changes to process_tgs_req(); these changes to
process_tgs_req() were flawed and allow errors other than
KRB5_KDB_NOENTRY to cause a null pointer dereference.

The vulnerable code executes after the KDC authenticates the request,
so an attacker must have first obtained valid initial Kerberos
credentials for the target realm.
