Package        : acpid
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: partly
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1159 CVE-2011-2777 CVE-2011-4578 

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the acpid, the Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface event daemon:

CVE-2011-1159

    Vasiliy Kulikov of OpenWall discovered that the socket handling
    is vulnerable to denial of service.

CVE-2011-2777

    Oliver-Tobias Ripka discovered that incorrect process handling in
    the Debian-specific powerbtn.sh script could lead to local
    privilege escalation. This issue doesn't affect oldstable. The
    script is only shipped as an example in /usr/share/doc/acpid/examples.
    See /usr/share/doc/acpid/README.Debian for details.

CVE-2011-4578

    Helmut Grohne and Michael Biebl discovered that acpid sets a umask
    of 0 when executing scripts, which could result in local privilege
    escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.8-1lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.0.7-1squeeze3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.
