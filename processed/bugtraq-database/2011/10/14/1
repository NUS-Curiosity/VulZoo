Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in feh, the worst of which leading
to remote passive code execution.

Background
==========

feh is a fast, lightweight imageviewer using imlib2.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/feh                 < 1.12                     >= 1.12

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in feh. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

Impact
======

A malicious entity might entice a user to visit a URL using the
--wget-timestamp option, thus executing arbitrary commands via shell
metacharacters; a malicious local user could perform a symlink attack
and overwrite arbitrary files.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All feh users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/feh-1.12"
