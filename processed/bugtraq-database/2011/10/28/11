Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
The default deployment of Cisco Unified Contact Center 
Express (UCCX) system is configured with multiple listening 
services. The web service that is listening on TCP port 9080, 
or on TCP port 8080 in versions prior to 8.0(x),  serves a 
directory which is configured in a way that allows for a remote 
unauthenticated attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the 
UCCX root filesystem through a directory traversal attack. It is 
possible for an attacker to use this vector to gain console 
access to the vulnerable node as the 'ccxcluster' user, and 
subsequently escalate privileges.

Solution Description
--------------------
Cisco has released a patch for this vulnerability. Information 
regarding the software update which addresses this issue is available at:
