CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3257 : Bob Sielken of IBM

Data Security
Available for:  iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4,
iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later,
iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept
user credentials or other sensitive information
Description:  Fraudulent certificates were issued by multiple
certificate authorities operated by DigiNotar. This issue is
addressed by removing DigiNotar from the list of trusted root
certificates, from the list of Extended Validation (EV) certificate
authorities, and by configuring default system trust settings so that
DigiNotar's certificates, including those issued by other
authorities, are not trusted.

Data Security
Available for:  iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4,
iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later,
iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad
Impact:  Support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes may expose
users to spoofing and information disclosure as attacks improve
Description:  Certificates signed using the MD5 hash algorithm were
accepted by iOS. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses.
Further research or a misconfigured certificate authority could have
allowed the creation of X.509 certificates with attacker controlled
values that would have been trusted by the system. This would have
exposed X.509 based protocols to spoofing, man in the middle attacks,
and information disclosure. This update disables support for an X.509
certificate with an MD5 hash for any use other than as a trusted root
certificate.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3427

Data Security
Available for:  iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4,
iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later,
iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad
Impact:  An attacker could decrypt part of a SSL connection
Description:  Only the SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 versions of SSL were
supported. These versions are subject to a protocol weakness when
using block ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected
invalid data, causing the connection to close but revealing some
information about the previous data. If the same connection was
attempted repeatedly the attacker may eventually have been able to
decrypt the data being sent, such as a password. This issue is
addressed by adding support for TLS 1.2.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3389

Home screen
Available for:  iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4,
iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later,

Impact:  Switching between applications may lead to the disclosure of
sensitive application information
Description:  When switching between applications with the four-
finger app switching gesture, the display could have revealed the
previous application state. This issue is addressed by ensuring that
the system properly calls the applicationWillResignActive: method
when transitioning between applications.

Safari
Available for:  iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4,
iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later,
iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad
Impact:  Opening maliciously crafted files on certain websites may
lead to a cross-site scripting attack
Description:  iOS did not support the 'attachment' value for the HTTP
Content-Disposition header. This header is used by many websites to
serve files that were uploaded to the site by a third-party, such as
attachments in web-based e-mail applications. Any script in files
served with this header value would run as if the file had been
served inline, with full access to other resources on the origin
server. This issue is addressed by loading attachments in an isolated
security origin with no access to resources on other sites.
