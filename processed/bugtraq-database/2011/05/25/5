Debian Bug(s)  : 
                 
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-3875

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Linux implementation of the
    Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2 protocol. Local users may obtain access to
    sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2011-0695

    Jens Kuehnel reported an issue in the InfiniBand stack. Remote attackers can
    exploit a race condition to cause a denial of service (kernel panic).

CVE-2011-0711

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the XFS filesystem. Local users may
    obtain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2011-0726

    Kees Cook reported an issue in the /proc/pid/stat implementation. Local
    users could learn the text location of a process, defeating protections
    provided by address space layout randomization (ASLR).

CVE-2011-1016

    Marek Olšák discovered an issue in the driver for ATI/AMD Radeon video
    chips. Local users could pass arbitrary values to video memory and the
    graphics translation table, resulting in denial of service or escalated
    privileges. On default Debian installations, this is exploitable only by
    members of the 'video' group.

CVE-2011-1078

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem. Local users
    can obtain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2011-1079

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can cause a denial of service (kernel
    Oops).
    
CVE-2011-1080

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Netfilter subsystem. Local users
    can obtain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2011-1090

    Neil Horman discovered a memory leak in the setacl() call on NFSv4
    filesystems. Local users can explot this to cause a denial of service
    (Oops).

CVE-2011-1160

    Peter Huewe reported an issue in the Linux kernel's support for TPM security
    chips. Local users with permission to open the device can gain access to
    sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2011-1163

    Timo Warns reported an issue in the kernel support for Alpha OSF format disk
    partitions. Users with physical access can gain access to sensitive kernel
    memory by adding a storage device with a specially crafted OSF partition.

CVE-2011-1170

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Netfilter arp table
    implementation. Local users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can gain
    access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2011-1171

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Netfilter IP table
    implementation. Local users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can gain
    access to sensitive kernel memory.
    
CVE-2011-1172

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Netfilter IP6 table
    implementation. Local users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can gain
    access to sensitive kernel memory.
    
CVE-2011-1173

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Acorn Econet protocol
    implementation. Local users can obtain access to sensitive kernel memory on
    systems that use this rare hardware.

CVE-2011-1180

    Dan Rosenberg reported a buffer overflow in the Information Access Service
    of the IrDA protocol, used for Infrared devices. Remote attackers within IR
    device range can cause a denial of service or possibly gain elevated
    privileges.

CVE-2011-1182

    Julien Tinnes reported an issue in the rt_sigqueueinfo interface. Local
    users can generate signals with falsified source pid and uid information.

CVE-2011-1476

    Dan Rosenberg reported issues in the Open Sound System MIDI interface that
    allow local users to cause a denial of service. This issue does not affect
    official Debian Linux image packages as they no longer provide support for
    OSS.  However, custom kernels built from Debians linux-source-2.6.32 may
    have enabled this configuration and would therefore be vulnerable.

CVE-2011-1477

    Dan Rosenberg reported issues in the Open Sound System driver for cards that
    include a Yamaha FM synthesizer chip. Local users can cause memory
    corruption resulting in a denial of service. This issue does not affect
    official Debian Linux image packages as they no longer provide support for
    OSS.  However, custom kernels built from Debians linux-source-2.6.32 may
    have enabled this configuration and would therefore be vulnerable.

CVE-2011-1478

    Ryan Sweat reported an issue in the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) support in
    the Linux networking subsystem. If an interface has GRO enabled and is
    running in promiscuous mode, remote users can cause a denial of service
    (NULL pointer dereference) by sending packets on an unknown VLAN.

CVE-2011-1493

    Dan Rosenburg reported two issues in the Linux implementation of the Amateur
    Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) protocol. A remote user can cause a denial of service
    by providing specially crafted facilities fields.

CVE-2011-1494

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the /dev/mpt2ctl interface provided by
    the driver for LSI MPT Fusion SAS 2.0 controllers. Local users can obtain
    elevated privileges by specially crafted ioctl calls. On default Debian
    installations this is not exploitable as this interface is only accessible
    to root.

CVE-2011-1495

    Dan Rosenberg reported two additional issues in the /dev/mpt2ctl interface
    provided by the driver for LSI MPT Fusion SAS 2.0 controllers. Local users
    can obtain elevated privileges and ready arbitrary kernel memory by using
    specially crafted ioctl calls. On default Debian installations this is not
    exploitable as this interface is only accessible to root.

CVE-2011-1585

    Jeff Layton reported an issue in the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
    Local users can bypass authentication requirements for shares that are
    already mounted by another user.

CVE-2011-1593

    Robert Swiecki reported a signednes issue in the next_pidmap() function,
    which can be exploited my local users to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2011-1598

    Dave Jones reported an issue in the Broadcast Manager Controller Area
    Network (CAN/BCM) protocol that may allow local users to cause a NULL
    pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2011-1745

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
    Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
    to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC_BIND ioctl. On default Debian
    installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.

CVE-2011-1746

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
    Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
    to missing bounds checking in the agp_allocate_memory and
    agp_create_user_memory. On default Debian installations, this is exploitable
    only by users in the video group.

CVE-2011-1748

    Oliver Kartkopp reported an issue in the Controller Area Network (CAN) raw
    socket implementation which permits ocal users to cause a NULL pointer
    dereference, resulting in a denial of service.
    
CVE-2011-1759

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the support for executing "old ABI"
    binaries on ARM processors. Local users can obtain elevated privileges due
    to insufficient bounds checking in the semtimedop system call.

CVE-2011-1767

    Alexecy Dobriyan reported an issue in the GRE over IP implementation.
    Remote users can cause a denial of service by sending a packet during module
    initialization.

CVE-2011-1770

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    (DCCP). Remote users can cause a denial of service or potentially obtain
    access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2011-1776

    Timo Warns reported an issue in the Linux implementation for GUID
    partitions. Users with physical access can gain access to sensitive kernel
    memory by adding a storage device with a specially crafted corrupted invalid
    partition table.

CVE-2011-2022

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
    Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
    to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC_UNBIND ioctl. On default Debian
    installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.
