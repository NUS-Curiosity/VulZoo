Subject: Fwd: [USN-1122-1] Thunderbird vulnerabilities

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1122-1
May 05, 2011

thunderbird vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Thunderbird could be made to run programs as your login if it opened
specially crafted mail.

Software Description:
- thunderbird: mail/news client with RSS and integrated spam filter support

Details:

It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in the memory handling of
certain types of content. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run
arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0081)

It was discovered that Thunderbird incorrectly handled certain JavaScript
requests. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker could exploit this to
possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2011-0069)

Ian Beer discovered a vulnerability in the memory handling of a certain
types of documents. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run
arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0070)

Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo, Mats Palmgren and Jesse Ruderman
discovered several memory vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these
to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2011-0080)

Aki Helin discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the HTML rendering code.
An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user
running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0074, CVE-2011-0075)

Ian Beer discovered multiple overflow vulnerabilities. An attacker could
exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0077, CVE-2011-0078)

Martin Barbella discovered a memory vulnerability in the handling of
certain DOM elements. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run
arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0072)

It was discovered that there were use-after-free vulnerabilities in
Thunderbird's mChannel and mObserverList objects. An attacker could exploit
these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2011-0065, CVE-2011-0066)

It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in the handling of the
nsTreeSelection element. An attacker sending a specially crafted E-Mail
could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0073)

Paul Stone discovered a vulnerability in the handling of Java applets. If
plugins were enabled, an attacker could use this to mimic interaction with
form autocomplete controls and steal entries from the form history.
(CVE-2011-0067)

Soroush Dalili discovered a vulnerability in the resource: protocol. This
could potentially allow an attacker to load arbitrary files that were
accessible to the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0071)

Chris Evans discovered a vulnerability in Thunderbird's XSLT generate-id()
function. An attacker could possibly use this vulnerability to make other
attacks more reliable. (CVE-2011-1202)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  thunderbird                     3.1.10+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  thunderbird                     3.1.10+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make
all the necessary changes.
