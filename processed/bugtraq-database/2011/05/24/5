PR10-11: Multiple XSS injection vulnerabilities and a offsite
redirection flaw within HP System Management Homepage (Insight Manager)

Vulnerability found: 6th June 2010

Date Published 20th May 2011

Severity: Medium


Description:

XSS vulnerabilities have been found within HP System Management; Arising
from insufficient input filtering.
By using a specially-crafted link, and tricking the victim into clicking
on it, an attacker can perform malicious attacks such as the following:

- Hijack user accounts by stealing the victim's cookies that are
assigned to the victim's browser by the vulnerable website

- Hijack user accounts by injecting a "fake" html form on the html
rendered by the victim's web browser

- Redirect the victim to a malicious third-party website which would
perform a phishing attack to steal the user credentials or exploit a
vulnerability (i.e.: buffer overflow) on the

victim's web browser in order to compromise the victim's workstation

Notes:

Authentication is normally needed, unless system has been configured to
support anonymous autologin.
