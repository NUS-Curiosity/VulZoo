Subject: [USN-1111-1] Linux kernel vulnerabilities

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1111-1
May 05, 2011

linux-source-2.6.15 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

Summary:

Multiple flaws fixed in the Linux kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-source-2.6.15: Linux kernel

Details:

Dan Rosenberg discovered multiple flaws in the X.25 facilities parsing. If
a system was using X.25, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the
system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4164)

Vegard Nossum discovered that memory garbage collection was not handled
correctly for active sockets. A local attacker could exploit this to
allocate all available kernel memory, leading to a denial of service.
(CVE-2010-4249)

Nelson Elhage discovered that the kernel did not correctly handle process
cleanup after triggering a recoverable kernel bug. If a local attacker were
able to trigger certain kinds of kernel bugs, they could create a specially
crafted process to gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4258)

Nelson Elhage discovered that Econet did not correctly handle AUN packets
over UDP. A local attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash
the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4342)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the OSS subsystem did not handle name
termination correctly. A local attacker could exploit this crash the system
or gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4527)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that IRDA did not correctly check the size of
buffers. On non-x86 systems, a local attacker could exploit this to read
kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-4529)

Dan Carpenter discovered that the TTPCI DVB driver did not check certain
values during an ioctl. If the dvb-ttpci module was loaded, a local
attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service, or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-0521)

Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race
condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send
specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-0695)

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not
correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk
device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.
(CVE-2011-1017)
