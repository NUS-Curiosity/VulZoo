Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0446 CVE-2011-0447 
Debian Bug     : 614864

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-0446
    
    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when JavaScript
    encoding is used, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
    script or HTML.

CVE-2011-0447

    Rails does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an
    X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers
    to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny0.1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze0.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.11-0.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
