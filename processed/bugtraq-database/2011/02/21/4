Package        : mailman
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3089 CVE-2011-0707

Two cross site scripting vulnerabilities were been discovered in
Mailman, a web-based mailing list manager. These allowed an attacker
to retreive session cookies via inserting crafted JavaScript into
confirmation messages (CVE-2011-0707) and in the list admin interface
(CVE-2010-3089; oldstable only).

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1.11-11+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.13-5.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1:2.1.14-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.
