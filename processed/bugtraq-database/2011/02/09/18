Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.08.11: Adobe Shockwave Player Memory
 Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.08.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 08, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Shockwave Player is a popular Web browser plug-in. It is available
for multiple Web browsers and platforms, including Windows, and MacOS.
Shockwave Player enables Web browsers to display rich multimedia
content in the form of Shockwave videos. For more information, see the
vendor's site found at the following link:

http://get.adobe.com/shockwave

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Adobe
Systems Inc.'s Shockwave Player could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability takes place during the processing of a malicious Adobe
Director file. A malicious user could cause a memory corruption by
including malformed data in a chunk. This condition may lead to
arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation could result in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit this
vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Adobe Director
file created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this
via social engineering or injecting content into a compromised, trusted
site.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Shockwave
Player version 11.5.8.612 and version 11.5.9.615 (the latest version at
the time of testing). A full list of vulnerable Adobe products can be
found in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB11-01.

V. WORKAROUND

The killbit for the Shockwave Player ActiveX control can be set by
creating the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX
Compatibility\{233C1507-6A77-46A4-9443-F871F945D258}

Under this key create a new DWORD value called "Compatibility Flags" and
set its hexadecimal value to 400.

To re-enable Shockwave Player set the "Compatibility Flags" value to 0.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
