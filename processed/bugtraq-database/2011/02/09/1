Subject: CVE-2010-4435 - Multiple Vendor Calendar Manager Remote Code Execution

Dear List,

So finally all the vendors fixed this critical issue (remote code
execution).

As usual, here it goes the PoC to help in the exploitation.  It works
against all the affected vendors, so just adjust your payload and have fun!
