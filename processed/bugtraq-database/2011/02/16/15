CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0430 CVE-2011-0431

Two vulnerabilities were discovered the distributed filesystem AFS:

CVE-2011-0430

   Andrew Deason discovered that a double free in the Rx server
   process could lead to denial of service or the execution of
   arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0431

   It was discovered that insufficient error handling in the
   kernel module could lead to denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.7.dfsg1-6+lenny4. Due to a technical problem with the
buildd infrastructure the update is not yet available, but will be
installed into the archive soon.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.14+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages. Note that in order
to apply this security update, you must rebuild the OpenAFS kernel module.
