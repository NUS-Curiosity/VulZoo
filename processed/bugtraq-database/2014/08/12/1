Subject: IBM Maximo: Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability Addressed in Asset and
 Service Management (CVE-2014-0914 and -0915)

Two classes of persistent XSS issues we reported in IBM Maximo a month
or two back are now fixed:

http://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/further-ibm-maximo-asset-management-vulnerabilities-reported/

Individual bulletins linked from the above, but tl;dr is I would
suggest patching, as this could conceivably provide privilege
escalation routes for medium privilege users. Depends on what you're
doing and how much you trust your users.

cheers,
 Jamie
