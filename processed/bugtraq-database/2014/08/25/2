Package        : python-django
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0480 CVE-2014-0481 CVE-2014-0482 CVE-2014-0483

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0480

    Florian Apolloner discovered that in certain situations, URL
    reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs which could
    unexpectedly redirect a user to a different host, leading to
    phishing attacks.

CVE-2014-0481

    David Wilson reported a file upload denial of service vulnerability.
    Django's file upload handling in its default configuration may
    degrade to producing a huge number of `os.stat()` system calls when
    a duplicate filename is uploaded. A remote attacker with the ability
    to upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler,
    eventually causing it to become very slow.

CVE-2014-0482

    David Greisen discovered that under some circumstances, the use of
    the RemoteUserMiddleware middleware and the RemoteUserBackend
    authentication backend could result in one user receiving another
    user's session, if a change to the REMOTE_USER header occurred
    without corresponding logout/login actions.

CVE-2014-0483

    Collin Anderson discovered that it is possible to reveal any field's
    data by modifying the "popup" and "to_field" parameters of the query
    string on an admin change form page. A user with access to the admin
    interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model structure and the
    appropriate URLs, could construct popup views which would display
    the values of non-relationship fields, including fields the
    application developer had not intended to expose in such a fashion.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
