Subject: CVE-2014-5307 - Privilege Escalation in Panda Security Products

Vulnerability title: Privilege Escalation in Panda Security
CVE: CVE-2014-5307
Vendor: Panda Security
Product: Multiple
Affected version: Panda 2014 Products
Fixed version: Hotfix hft131306s24_r1
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou

Details:

Latest, and possibly earlier builds, of the PavTPK.sys kernel mode
driver of Panda Security software suffer from a heap overflow bug that
allows any user to elevate their privileges through an IOCTL request and
execute code as SYSTEM by controlling the EIP via a corrupted kernel object.

This driver is loaded into kernel memory during boot time and stays
resident without touching the disk later.
All Panda Security products using the faulty driver were found to be
vulnerable.
