Package        : php5
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3538 CVE-2014-3587 CVE-2014-3597 CVE-2014-4670

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-3538

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2013-7345 did not
    sufficiently address the problem. A remote attacker could still
    cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a specially-crafted
    input file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk
    regular expression rule.

CVE-2014-3587

    It was discovered that the CDF parser of the fileinfo module does
    not properly process malformed files in the Composite Document File
    (CDF) format, leading to crashes.

CVE-2014-3597

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2014-4049 did not
    completely address the issue. A malicious server or
    man-in-the-middle attacker could cause a denial of service (crash)
    and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS TXT record.

CVE-2014-4670

    It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain SPL
    Iterators. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause PHP to
    crash, resulting in a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u13. In addition, this update contains several
bugfixes originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fied soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
