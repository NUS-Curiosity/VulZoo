Vulnerability Type: HTTP Parameter Pollution [CWE-235]
CVE Reference: CVE-2014-5138
Risk Level: Low
CVSSv2 Base Score: 2.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Enterprise Solutions)

Advisory Details:

HTTP Parameter Pollution in Library Services Platform: CVE-2014-5138

The application allows multiple instances of the same query parameter.
The last instance of the parameter provided is used by the
application. As the application logic or any web application firewall
may interpret the parameters differently, an attacker may be able to
bypass the normal verification of parameter safety. The weakness was
not found to pose an immediate threat to application users in the
tested configuration. The Webpac Pro submodule was enabled at the time
of the test.
