HPSBMU03190 rev.1 - HP Helion Cloud Development Platform Community and
Commercial Editions, Remote Unauthenticated Access

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as
soon as possible.

Release Date: 2014-11-10
Last Updated: 2014-11-10

Potential Security Impact: Remote unauthenticated access

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP Helion Cloud
Development Platform Community Edition and HP Helion Cloud Development
Platform Commercial Edition. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely to
allow Unauthenticated access.

Note: On October 28, 2014, HP identified a critical security vulnerability in
the v1.0 release of the HP Helion Development Platform. The vulnerability is
in our Application Lifecycle Service (ALS) and requires immediate attention.

Vulnerability background: During the development process, valid user and host
security keys were unintentionally left on the ALS Seed Node image. These
keys are thus universal on all virtual machines created using the ALS Seed
Node image. If an attacker has a virtual machine (VM) created from the ALS
seed node image, they could potentially use that VM to connect (without
giving a password) to any other VM in any ALS cluster (including ones the
attacker does not own) if the attacker obtains a valid cluster VM IP address
and the cluster was created with an ALS seed node image containing the
vulnerability.

RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following instructions to resolve the vulnerability in HP
Helion Cloud Development Platform Community Edition and HP Helion Cloud
Development Platform Commercial Edition.

HP Helion Development Platform Commercial Edition v1.0  Public Cloud Trial
Starting with the image HP Helion Development Platform CE - Application
Lifecycle Service Seed Node 1.0.0.4.4, HP has resolved the technical issue in
the public cloud. Public cloud customers should immediately take the
following remediation steps:

Follow steps 2-4 for each affected trial VM.
Backup any running applications on an affected trial VM.
Shut down and destroy the trial VM and security groups. A trial VM in the
public cloud will have a name that follows the pattern "<5 random letters>"
and can be identified via the Horizon user console in the list of compute
instances. The trial will have 3 security groups that should be deleted  the
security groups will use the same 5 random letters for the start of the name
and will follow the pattern: "<5 random letters>-Core-Router","<5 random
letters>-Internal", "<5 random letters>-SSH".
Reinstall a new trial following the installation steps found here:
http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/devplatform/ALS-developer-trial-quick-start/

HP Helion Development Platform Commercial Edition v1.0 and HP Helion
Development Platform Community Edition v1.0 - Preview
HP has resolved the technical issue in the HP Helion Development Platform
Commercial Edition and HP Helion Development Platform Community Edition v1.0
Preview download from the HP HDN as of 11/03/2014. Customers who have
installed the HP Helion Development Platform Commercial Edition should
immediately take the following remediation steps:

the cluster:
For Community Edition: Delete all VMs and associated security groups. A
cluster VM can be seen in the compute Instance list and will have a name that
starts with the name of the cluster chosen at the time the cluster was
created, followed by a "-<description of cluster role>". Security groups that
should be deleted will also follow the same pattern.
For Commercial Edition, navigate to the Application Lifecycle Service ->
Clusters tab, select the cluster to delete, then click the Delete button.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each affected cluster.

administrator:

Click on Admin
Click on Development Platform
Click on Configure Services
In the Application Lifecycle Services row, click Download
When the download completes, ALS will be ready to use.

Recreate original clusters and redeploy applications following the same
