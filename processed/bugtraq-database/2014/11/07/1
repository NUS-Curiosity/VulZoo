Package        : qemu
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3689 CVE-2014-7815
Debian Bug     : 765496

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.

CVE-2014-3689

    The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security reported that
    guest provided parameter were insufficiently validated in
    rectangle functions in the vmware-vga driver. A privileged guest
    user could use this flaw to write into qemu address space on the
    host, potentially escalating their privileges to those of the
    qemu host process.

CVE-2014-7815

    James Spadaro of Cisco reported insufficiently sanitized
    bits_per_pixel from the client in the QEMU VNC display driver. An
    attacker having access to the guest's VNC console could use this
    flaw to crash the guest.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1+dfsg-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
