 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:225
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ruby
 Date    : November 25, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated ruby packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Will Wood discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled the encodes()
 function. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Ruby to
 crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary
 code. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce
 the vulnerability to a denial of service (CVE-2014-4975).
 
 Due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8080, 100% CPU utilization can
 occur as a result of recursive expansion with an empty String. When
 reading text nodes from an XML document, the REXML parser in Ruby can
 be coerced into allocating extremely large string objects which can
 consume all of the memory on a machine, causing a denial of service
 (CVE-2014-8090).
 
 Additionally ruby has been upgraded to patch level 374.
