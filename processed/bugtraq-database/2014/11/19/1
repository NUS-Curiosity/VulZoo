Package        : php5
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3710
Debian Bug     : 68283

Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security found an issue in the file
utility, whose code is embedded in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language.  When checking ELF files, note headers are incorrectly
checked, thus potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) by supplying a
specially crafted ELF file.

As announced in DSA-3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable
5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the
vulnerability is addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version
5.4.35, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly
incompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more
information:

 http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.35

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.35-0+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
