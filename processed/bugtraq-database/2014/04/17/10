 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:079
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : json-c
 Date    : April 17, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated json-c packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Florian Weimer reported that the printbuf APIs used in the json-c
 library used ints for counting buffer lengths, which is inappropriate
 for 32bit architectures.  These functions need to be changed to using
 size_t if possible for sizes, or to be hardened against negative
 values if not.  This could be used to cause a denial of service in
 an application linked to the json-c library (CVE-2013-6370).
 
 Florian Weimer reported that the hash function in the json-c library
 was weak, and that parsing smallish JSON strings showed quadratic
 timing behaviour. This could cause an application linked to the json-c
 library, and that processes some specially-crafted JSON data, to use
 excessive amounts of CPU (CVE-2013-6371).
