RESOLUTION

There is no resolution to this issue. The authentication process for the IPMI
2.0 specification mandates that the server send a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of
the requested user's password to the client, prior to the client
authenticating. The BMC returns the password hash for any valid user account
requested. This password hash can be broken using an offline brute force or
dictionary attack. Because this functionality is a key part of the IPMI 2.0
specification, there is no way to fix the problem without deviating from the
IPMI 2.0 specification. HP recommends the following actions to mitigate the
risk this introduces:

If you do not need to use IPMI, disable it. You can disable IPMI on iLO2/3/4
using the Disable IPMI over LAN command.
Maintain the latest iLO firmware that contains the most recent security
patches.
Employ best practices in the management of the protocols and passwords on
your systems and networks. Use strong passwords wherever possible.
If you must use IPMI, use a separate management LAN or VLAN, Access Control
Lists (ACLs), or VPN to limit and restrict access to your iLO management
interfaces.
