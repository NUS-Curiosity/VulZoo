Subject: Multiple Vulnerabilities in MODX Revolution < = MODX 2.2.13-pl

Product description:
============
MODX  (originally MODx) is a free, open source content management system and web application framework for publishing content on the world wide web and intranets.
============

MODX Revolution Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2014-2736)
============
The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection which is exploitable through the session ID supplied by the user.  This issue is exploitable without authentication.

Details:
----------------------
The vulnerability is triggered where the session ID is inserted into the modx_session table. In this location it is possible to inject SQL sub queries that will be executed by the application.

This issue is exploitable without authentication by passing crafted SQL subqueries into the session ID (PHPSESSID) passed to /index.php. Passing a carefully crafted subquery into the application will cause the application to execute arbitrary SQL queries within the context of database user privileges. Successful injection will cause the application to accept the session and not set a new cookie.

POC is withheld.

Authentication is not required to exploit this issue.
----------------------
