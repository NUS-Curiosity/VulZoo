Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-5298 CVE-2014-0076
Debian Bug     : 742923

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. The following
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids identify them:

CVE-2010-5298

    A read buffer can be freed even when it still contains data that is
used later on, leading to a use-after-free. Given a race condition in a
multi-threaded application it may permit an attacker to inject data from
one connection into another or cause denial of service.

CVE-2014-0076

    ECDSA nonces can be recovered through the Yarom/Benger FLUSH+RELOAD
cache side-channel attack.

A third issue, with no CVE id, is the missing detection of the
"critical" flag for the TSA extended key usage under certain cases.


Additionally, this update checks for more services that might need to
be restarted after upgrades of libssl, corrects the detection of
apache2 and postgresql, and adds support for the
'libraries/restart-without-asking' debconf configuration. This allows
services to be restarted on upgrade without prompting.


The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by CVE-2010-5298
and it might be updated at a later time to address the remaining
vulnerabilities.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u7.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1g-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
