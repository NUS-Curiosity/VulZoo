Package        : dpkg
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0471

Jakub Wilk discovered that dpkg did not correctly parse C-style
filename quoting, allowing for paths to be traversed when unpacking a
source package - leading to the creation of files outside the directory
of the source being unpacked.

The update to the stable distribution (wheezy) incorporates
non-security changes that were targeted for the point release 7.5.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.9.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.16.13.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.17.8.

We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.
