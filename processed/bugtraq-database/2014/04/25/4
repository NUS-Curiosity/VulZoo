Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-0343

    George Kargiotakis reported an issue in the temporary address handling
    of the IPv6 privacy extensions. Users on the same LAN can cause a denial
    of service or obtain access to sensitive information by sending router
    advertisement messages that cause temporary address generation to be
    disabled.

CVE-2013-2147

    Dan Carpenter reported issues in the cpqarray driver for Compaq
    Smart2 Controllers and the cciss driver for HP Smart Array controllers
    allowing users to gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2013-2889

    Kees Cook discovered missing input sanitization in the HID driver for
    Zeroplus game pads that could lead to a local denial of service.

CVE-2013-2893

    Kees Cook discovered that missing input sanitization in the HID driver
    for various Logitech force feedback devices could lead to a local denial
    of service.

CVE-2013-2929

    Vasily Kulikov discovered that a flaw in the get_dumpable() function of
    the ptrace subsytsem could lead to information disclosure. Only systems
    with the fs.suid_dumpable sysctl set to a non-default value of '2' are
    vulnerable.

CVE-2013-4162

    Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered that incorrect handling of IPv6 sockets
    using the UDP_CORK option could result in denial of service.

CVE-2013-4299

    Fujitsu reported an issue in the device-mapper subsystem. Local users
    could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2013-4345

    Stephan Mueller found in bug in the ANSI pseudo random number generator
    which could lead to the use of less entropy than expected.

CVE-2013-4512

    Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the user mode
    linux port. A buffer overflow condition exists in the write method
    for the /proc/exitcode file. Local users with sufficient privileges
    allowing them to write to this file could gain further elevated
    privileges.

CVE-2013-4587

    Andrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM virtualization
    subsystem. A local user could gain elevated privileges by passing
    a large vcpu_id parameter.

CVE-2013-6367

    Andrew Honig of Google reported an issue in the KVM virtualization
    subsystem. A divide-by-zero condition could allow a guest user to
    cause a denial of service on the host (crash).

CVE-2013-6380

    Mahesh Rajashekhara reported an issue in the aacraid driver for storage
    products from various vendors. Local users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges
    could gain further elevated privileges.

CVE-2013-6381

    Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the Gigabit Ethernet
    device support for s390 systems. Local users could cause a denial of
    service or gain elevated privileges via the SIOC_QETH_ADP_SET_SNMP_CONTROL
    ioctl.

CVE-2013-6382

    Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported an issue in the XFS filesystem.
    Local users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges could gain further elevated
    privileges.

CVE-2013-6383

    Dan Carpenter reported an issue in the aacraid driver for storage devices
    from various vendors. A local user could gain elevated privileges due to
    a missing privilege level check in the aac_compat_ioctl function.

CVE-2013-7263 CVE-2013-7264 CVE-2013-7265

    mpb reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg
    system calls. A local user could obtain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2013-7339

    Sasha Levin reported an issue in the RDS network protocol over Infiniband.
    A local user could cause a denial of service condition.

CVE-2014-0101

    Nokia Siemens Networks reported an issue in the SCTP network protocol
    subsystem. Remote users could cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
    dereference).

CVE-2014-1444

    Salva Peiro reported an issue in the FarSync WAN driver. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could gain access to sensitive kernel
    memory.

CVE-2014-1445

    Salva Peiro reported an issue in the wanXL serial card driver. Local
    users could gain access to sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2014-1446

    Salva Peiro reported an issue in the YAM radio modem driver. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could gain access to sensitive kernel
    memory.

CVE-2014-1874

    Matthew Thode reported an issue in the SELinux subsystem. A local user
    with CAP_MAC_ADMIN privileges could cause a denial of service by setting
    an empty security context on a file.
    
CVE-2014-2039

    Martin Schwidefsky reported an issue on s390 systems. A local user
    could cause a denial of service (kernel oops) by executing an application
    with a linkage stack instruction.

CVE-2014-2523

    Daniel Borkmann provided a fix for an issue in the nf_conntrack_dccp
    module. Remote users could cause a denial of service (system crash)
    or potentially gain elevated privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32-48squeeze5.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze5

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
