Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0138 CVE-2014-0139
Debian Bug     : 742728

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2014-0138

    Steve Holme discovered that libcurl can in some circumstances re-use
    the wrong connection when asked to do transfers using other
    protocols than HTTP and FTP.

CVE-2014-0139

    Richard Moore from Westpoint Ltd. reported that libcurl does not
    behave compliant to RFC 2828 under certain conditions and
    incorrectly validates wildcard SSL certificates containing literal
    IP addresses.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze8.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy9.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.36.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.36.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
