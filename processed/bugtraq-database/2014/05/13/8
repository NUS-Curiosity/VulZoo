Potential Security Impact: Remote disclosure of information

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP Systems
Insight Management (SIM) bundled software running OpenSSL. This is the
OpenSSL vulnerability known as "Heartbleed" which could be exploited remotely
resulting in disclosure of information.

The HP SIM software itself is not vulnerable to CVE-2014-0160 ("Heartbleed").
However, the software components bundled with HP SIM are impacted and should
be addressed if installed.

Note: If customers believe that the SIM installation was compromised while it
was running components vulnerable to Heartbleed they need to take the
following actions once they have upgraded to the non-vulnerable components.
This includes revoking, recreating, and re-importing certificates and
resetting passwords that might have been harvested by a malicious attacker
using the Heartbleed vulnerability.
HP has made the following hot fixes available for SIM v7.2.x that fix the
Heartbleed vulnerability: The HP SIM 7.2 Hotfix Kit is available in the
following location and is applicable to HP SIM 7.2.x installations. Please
read through the readme.txt file before proceeding with the installation.
Please click on the HP SIM 7.2 HotFix Kit link to download the hot fix for
your operating system platform:

http://h18013.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/hpsim/download.html

After installing SIM72_hotfix_2014_Apr_win.exe hotfix, HP Systems Management
Homepage has to be manually upgraded if it is already installed on the CMS.
HP SMH installer for 32-bit and 64-bit can be found in the CMS under the
location SIM_INSTALL_DIR\smartcomponents . The installer filenames are
cp023242.exe and cp023243.exe.
In case it is suspected that the infrastructure has been compromised, the
user needs to create new HP SIM Server certificate and Single Sign-on (sso)
certificates. To create new server and sso certificates, refer the HP SIM 7.2
Command Line Interface guide which can be found in the below URL:
ttp://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/enterprise/servers/solutions/info-library/inde
x

Refer to the mxcert command section which has the details to create new
server and sso certificates.
Once the new server certificate is created, it will invalidate any trust
relationship between CMS and any other system that depend on this
certificate, such as browsers. The user must re-establish the trust between
CMS and other system that uses this certificate, and revoke any previous SIM
certificates from any device previously configured to trust SIM (Onboard
Administrator, Virtual Connect Module, iLOs, and SMH instances).
Once the new sso certificate is created, the user must re-establish the trust
between HP SIM and managed devices (HP SMH, ILO, OA. VC) for Single Sign-on
to work. To reestablish trust with the sso certificate, refer to HP SIM 7.2
user guide and HP SIM Online help (under security section). HP SIM 7.2 user
guide is located in the below URL:
http://h20628.www2.hp.com/km-ext/kmcsdirect/emr_na-c03651392-3.pdf

HP SIM 7.3 user guide is located in the below URL:
http://h20628.www2.hp.com/km-ext/kmcsdirect/emr_na-c04030739-2.pdf

CMS Reconfigure Tool (aka mxrefconfig)

In case it is suspected that CMS OS credentials are also compromised, then it
is recommended that credentials are changed. The SIM User Guide (Chapter 19
CMS Reconfigure Tool pg 93) provides two procedures to change the service
account password along with other related accounts. The procedures to follow
are:

Procedure 18 - Changing the CMS password for HP SIM and Insight Control
Procedure 19 - Changing CMS password for Matrix OE and Operations
Orchestration
Note:

if the customer has Insight Control server deployment installed, procedures
to change the password are documented in the HP Insight Control Server
Deployment User Guide.

Frequently Asked Questions:

Will updated systems require a reboot after applying the SIM hotfix?
No, reboot of the system will not be required. Installing the new build would
be sufficient to get back to the normal state.
Will new certificates be issued along with the patch, or need to be handled
separately?
If you suspect the certificate has been compromised due to this
vulnerability, we do recommend creating new certificates for server and
Single Sign-on and revoking previous certificates. Instructions on creating
new certificate and re-establishing trust between CMS and managed devices are
in the notes above.
