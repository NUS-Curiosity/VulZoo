Last Updated: 2014-05-23

Potential Security Impact: Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX running
NTP. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely to create a Denial of
Service (DoS).

References: CVE-2013-5211 (SSRT101419)

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.31 running NTP v4.2.6 or XNTP v3.5
HP-UX B.11.23 running XNTP v3.5

===========================================================
             Information on CVSS is documented
            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following workaround to temporarily resolve this
vulnerability. This bulletin will be revised when a General Release patch for
HP-UX B.11.31 is available.
NOTE: No patches for XNTP v3.5 on HP-UX B.11.23 and HP-UX B.11.31 will be
made. Customers must disable "monlist" as follows.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes

To prevent the "monlist" DoS vulnerability, configure the following:

Verify that XNTP is installed, is running on your system, and verify the
NTPv4 version.

For example:

a. Verify XNTP is installed on the system:

ls -la /usr/sbin/xntpd

For NTP v4:

lr-xr--r-- 1 bin bin 14 Aug 9 2013 /usr/sbin/xntpd -> /usr/sbin/ntpd

For XNTP v3.5:

lr-xr--r-- 1 bin bin 741052 May 9 2013 /usr/sbin/xntpd -> /usr/sbin/ntpd

b. Check if the NTP process is running

ps -ef | grep ntp

For NTP v4:

root 124 1 0 06:46:18 ? 0:00 /usr/sbin/ntpd

For XNTP v3.5:

root 22248 1 0 06:25:28 ? 0:00 /usr/sbin/xntpd

c. Verify the NTP v4 version

/usr/sbin/ntpd --version

For NTP v4:

ntpd 4.2.6p5

For XNTP v3.5:

ntpd 4.2.6 Revision 0.0 Tue Nov 5 14:21:22 UTC 2012

Modify the ntp.conf on your time server and add either one of the two
following entries.

Entry Option #1

# Block all control queries from external systems, allows time services

restrict default noquery

# Allow local queries

restrict 127.0.0.1

Entry Option #2

# disable "monitor" queries. This will disable only

# monlist queries, even local.

disable monitor

Cycle the ntpd daemon (for NTP v4 and XNTP v3.5).

/sbin/init.d/ntpd stop
/sbin/init.d/ntpd start

Verification of the workaround.

Test on the local time server using the "ntpq -p" command.

Verify proper operation with output similar to:
remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset disp
======================================
*LOCAL(1) .LOCL. 6 l 13 16 377 0.000 0.000 0.233

On a remote time client, execute ntpdc or xntpdc as follows:
# ntpdc -c monlist server.name.with.restrict.or.disable
or
# xntpdc -c monlist server.name.with.restrict.or.disable
A timeout error should occur.
# xntpdc -c monlist xyz.hp.com
xyz.hp.com: timed out, nothing received
***Request timed out
