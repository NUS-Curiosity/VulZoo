Package        : qemu-kvm
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4344 CVE-2014-2894
Debian Bug     : 745157 725944

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.

CVE-2013-4344

    Buffer overflow in the SCSI implementation in QEMU,
    when a SCSI controller has more than 256 attached devices, allows
    local users to gain privileges via a small transfer buffer in a
    REPORT LUNS command.

CVE-2014-2894

    Off-by-one error in the cmd_smart function in the smart self test in
    hw/ide/core.c in QEMU allows local users to have
    unspecified impact via a SMART EXECUTE OFFLINE command that triggers
    a buffer underflow and memory corruption.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
