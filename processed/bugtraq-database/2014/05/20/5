Package        : python-django
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0472 CVE-2014-0473 CVE-2014-0474 CVE-2014-1418 
                 CVE-2014-3730

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0472

    Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted
    Python paths when using the reverse() URL resolver function. An
    attacker able to request a specially crafted view from a Django
    application could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary
    modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution.

CVE-2014-0473

    Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain
    pages that contained CSRF cookies. A remote attacker could use this
    flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass
    intended CSRF protections in a Django application.

CVE-2014-0474

    Michael Koziarski discovered that certain Django model field classes
    did not properly perform type conversion on their arguments, which
    allows remote attackers to obtain unexpected results.

CVE-2014-1418

    Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby discovered that
    cached data in Django could be served to a different session, or to
    a user with no session at all. An attacker may use this to retrieve
    private data or poison caches.

CVE-2014-3730

    Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly
    validated certain malformed URLs from user input. An attacker may
    use this to cause unexpected redirects.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze10.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u7.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
