Package        : strongswan
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2891

A vulnerability has been found in the ASN.1 parser of strongSwan, an
IKE/IPsec suite used to establish IPsec protected links.

By sending a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID payload to a vulnerable pluto or
charon daemon, a malicious remote user can provoke a null pointer
dereference in the daemon parsing the identity, leading to a crash and a
denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.6.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u4.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
