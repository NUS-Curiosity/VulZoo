Package        : xbuffy
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0469

Michael Niedermayer discovered a vulnerability in xbuffy, an utility for
displaying message count in mailbox and newsgroup accounts.

By sending carefully crafted messages to a mail or news account
monitored by xbuffy, an attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer
overflow, leading to xbuffy crash or even remote code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-8+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-8+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-9.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your xbuffy packages.
