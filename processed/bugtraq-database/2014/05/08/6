 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:082
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python-imaging
 Date    : May 8, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated python-imaging packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Jakub Wilk discovered that temporary files were insecurely created
 (via mktemp()) in the IptcImagePlugin.py, Image.py, JpegImagePlugin.py,
 and EpsImagePlugin.py files of Python Imaging Library. A local attacker
 could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to modify an
 arbitrary file accessible to the user running an application that
 uses the Python Imaging Library (CVE-2014-1932).
 
 Jakub Wilk discovered that temporary files created in the
 JpegImagePlugin.py and EpsImagePlugin.py files of the Python Imaging
 Library were passed to an external process. These could be viewed
 on the command line, allowing an attacker to obtain the name and
 possibly perform symbolic link attacks, allowing them to modify an
 arbitrary file accessible to the user running an application that
 uses the Python Imaging Library (CVE-2014-1933).
