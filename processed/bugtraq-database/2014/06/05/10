Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0195 CVE-2014-0221 CVE-2014-0224 CVE-2014-3470

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL:

CVE-2014-0195

    Jueri Aedla discovered that a buffer overflow in processing DTLS
    fragments could lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial
    of service.

CVE-2014-0221

    Imre Rad discovered the processing of DTLS hello packets is 
    susceptible to denial of service.

CVE-2014-0224

    KIKUCHI Masashi discovered that carefully crafted handshakes can
    force the use of weak keys, resulting in potential man-in-the-middle
    attacks.

CVE-2014-3470

    Felix Groebert and Ivan Fratric discovered that the implementation of
    anonymous ECDH ciphersuites is suspectible to denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u10. All applications linked to openssl need to
be restarted. You can use the tool checkrestart from the package
debian-goodies to detect affected programs or reboot your system. There's
also a forthcoming security update for the Linux kernel later the day
(CVE-2014-3153), so you need to reboot anyway. Perfect timing, isn't it?

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
