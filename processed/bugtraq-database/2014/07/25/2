Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* An attacker can get access to some bug information using
  the victim's credentials using a specially crafted HTML page.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross Site Request Forgery
Versions:    3.7.1 to 4.0.13, 4.1.1 to 4.2.9, 4.3.1 to 4.4.4, 4.5.1 to 4.5.4
Fixed In:    4.0.14, 4.2.10, 4.4.5, 4.5.5
Description: Adobe does not properly restrict the SWF file format,
             which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
             request forgery (CSRF) attacks against Bugzilla's JSONP
             endpoint, possibly obtaining sensitive bug information,
             via a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying
             the character-set requirements of a callback API.
