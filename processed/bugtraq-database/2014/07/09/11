 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:131
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : file
 Date    : July 9, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated file packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 A flaw was found in the way file parsed property information from
 Composite Document Files (CDF) files, where the mconvert() function did
 not correctly compute the truncated pascal string size (CVE-2014-3478).
 
 Multiple flaws were found in the way file parsed property information
 from Composite Document Files (CDF) files, due to insufficient boundary
 checks on buffers (CVE-2014-3479, CVE-2014-3480, CVE-2014-3487).
 
 Note: these issues were announced as part of the upstream PHP 5.4.30
 release, as PHP bundles file&#039;s libmagic library. Their announcement
 also references an issue in CDF file parsing, CVE-2014-0207, which
 was previously fixed in the file package in MGASA-2014-0252, but was
 not announced at that time.
