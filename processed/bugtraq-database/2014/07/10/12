Package        : eglibc
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0475

Stephane Chazelas discovered that the GNU C library, glibc, processed
".." path segments in locale-related environment variables, possibly
allowing attackers to circumvent intended restrictions, such as
ForceCommand in OpenSSH, assuming that they can supply crafted locale
settings.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u3.

This update also includes changes previously scheduled for the next
wheezy point release as version 2.13-38+deb7u2.  See the Debian
changelog for details.

We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.
