Package        : libgadu
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6487

Yves Younan and Ryan Pentney discovered that libgadu, a library for
accessing the Gadu-Gadu instant messaging service, contained an
integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow.  Attackers which
impersonate the server could crash clients and potentially execute
arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.9.0-2+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.11.2-1+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.11.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgadu packages.
