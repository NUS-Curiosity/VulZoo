Package        : bash
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-6271

Stephane Chazelas discovered a vulnerability in bash, the GNU
Bourne-Again Shell, related to how environment variables are
processed.  In many common configurations, this vulnerability is
exploitable over the network, especially if bash has been configured
as the system shell.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2+dfsg-0.1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bash packages.
