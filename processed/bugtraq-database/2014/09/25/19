Subject: CVE-2014-4958: Stored Attribute-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
 Vulnerability in Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor Control

All versions of the popular UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor Control product by Telerik may be affected by a high-risk stored attribute-based cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that is assigned CVE-2014-4958. This WYSIWYG rich text editor is �...what Microsoft chose to use in MSDN, CodePlex, TechNet, MCMS and even as an alternative to the default editor in SharePoint.�

Personally tested and confirmed are versions: 2014.1.403.35 (much newer) and 2009.3.1208.20 (much older) using Internet Explorer 8, version 8.0.7601.17514. However, all versions from Telerik at this time may be vulnerable and will continue to be until a patched is released. A workaround may be available.

Remediation: Telerik states: We have applied a patch to the editor that will be delivered with our Q3 edition of the controls that should be released towards the end of October. A blog post on the issue has been published here: http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/14-09-24/securing-radeditor-content-and-preventing-xss-attacks
