 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:244
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openafs
 Date    : December 14, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in openafs:
 
 Buffer overflow in certain client utilities in OpenAFS before 1.6.2
 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash)
 and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long fileserver ACL entry
 (CVE-2013-1794).
 
 Integer overflow in ptserver in OpenAFS before 1.6.2 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large list
 from the IdToName RPC, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow
 (CVE-2013-1795).
 
 OpenAFS before 1.4.15, 1.6.x before 1.6.5, and 1.7.x before 1.7.26
 uses weak encryption (DES) for Kerberos keys, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to obtain the service key (CVE-2013-4134).
 
 The vos command in OpenAFS 1.6.x before 1.6.5, when using the -encrypt
 option, only enables integrity protection and sends data in cleartext,
 which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by
 sniffing the network (CVE-2013-4135).
 
 Buffer overflow in the GetStatistics64 remote procedure call (RPC) in
 OpenAFS 1.4.8 before 1.6.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (crash) via a crafted statsVersion argument (CVE-2014-0159).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in libxml2, a library providing
 support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
 could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by
 an application using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption
 (denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if
 entity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior
 (CVE-2014-3660).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 1.4.15 version and
 patched to correct these issues.
