Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2014-12-12:  Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Jease
Product: Jease - Content Management System 2.11


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Jease v2.11 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject own script code as payload to the application-side of the vulnerable service function.

The vulnerability is located in the content values of the create function. Local attackers with low privileged application user accounts 
are able to manipulate the content input values by usage of the create functions. The execution of the persistent script code occurs in 
the view browser module of the content management system. The attack vector is persistent on the application-side and the request method 
to inject is POST. The issue allows to transfer persistent malicious script codes to the frontend service.

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.7.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
					[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] Create

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] content

Affected Module(s):
					[+] View - Browser Service


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account 
and with low user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information 
and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce:
1. Install the Content Management System
2. Open online service to interact (link - http://jease.127.0.0.1:8080/login?file&auth

Note: (Select the plaintext option present at the end of the content box) 
4. Enter “ <script>alert(document.cookie)</script> ” or “ <script>alert(document.cookie)</script> ” in the box and press view in browser option 
Note: the request got saved and is now persistent included to the browser module service
5. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the Jease CMS is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.7)
