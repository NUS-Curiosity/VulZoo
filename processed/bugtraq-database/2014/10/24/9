 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:203
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openssl
 Date    : October 23, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in openssl:
 
 OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
 to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
 downgrade. Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect
 using a downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in
 older servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle
 to downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the
 connection support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of
 weaknesses including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).
 
 When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
 integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
 ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
 causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
 tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
 attack (CVE-2014-3567).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 1.0.0o version where
 these security flaws has been fixed.
