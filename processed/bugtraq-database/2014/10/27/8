Package        : libxml2
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3660
Debian Bug     : 762864 765722 765770

Sogeti found a denial of service flaw in libxml2, a library providing
support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an
application using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption
(denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if
entity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior.
(CVE-2014-3660)

In addition, this update addresses a misapplied chunk for a patch
released in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy1 (#762864), and a memory leak
regression (#765770) introduced in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.2+dfsg1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.
