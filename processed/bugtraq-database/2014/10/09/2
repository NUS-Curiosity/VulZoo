1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Google Calendar Events WordPress Plugin: CVE-2014-7138

Input passed via the "gce_feed_ids" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=gce_ajax&gce_type=page&gce_feed_ids=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/immuniweb/%29;%3C/script%3E
