APPLE-SA-2014-10-20-1 iOS 8.1

iOS 8.1 is now available and addresses the following:

Bluetooth
Available for:  iPhone 4s and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  A malicious Bluetooth input device may bypass pairing
Description:  Unencrypted connections were permitted from Human
Interface Device-class Bluetooth Low Energy accessories. If an iOS
device had paired with such an accessory, an attacker could spoof the
legitimate accessory to establish a connection. The issue was
addressed by denying unencrypted HID connections.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-4428 : Mike Ryan of iSEC Partners

House Arrest
Available for:  iPhone 4s and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  Files transferred to the device may be written with
insufficient cryptographic protection
Description:  Files could be transferred to an app's Documents
directory and encrypted with a key protected only by the hardware
UID. This issue was addressed by encrypting the transferred files
with a key protected by the hardware UID and the user's passcode.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-4448 : Jonathan Zdziarski and Kevin DeLong

iCloud Data Access
Available for:  iPhone 4s and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  An attacker in a privileged network position may force
iCloud data access clients to leak sensitive information
Description:  A TLS certificate validation vulnerability existed in
iCloud data access clients. This issue was addressed by improved
certificate validation.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-4449 : Carl Mehner of USAA

Keyboards
Available for:  iPhone 4s and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  QuickType could learn users' credentials
Description:  QuickType could learn users' credentials when switching
between elements. This issue was addressed by QuickType not learning
from fields where autocomplete is disabled and reapplying the
criteria when switching between DOM input elements in legacy WebKit.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-4450

Secure Transport
Available for:  iPhone 4s and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL
Description:  There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL
3.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. An attacker
could force the use of SSL 3.0, even when the server would support a
better TLS version, by blocking TLS 1.0 and higher connection
attempts. This issue was addressed by disabling CBC cipher suites
when TLS connection attempts fail.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-3566 : Bodo Moeller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof Kotowicz of
Google Security Team
