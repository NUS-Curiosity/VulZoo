RESOLUTION

HP has released the following software updates to resolve the vulnerability
in HP StoreFabric B-series switches running Bash Shell.

  Note: HP and the switch vendor recommend running an active version of
Fabric OS (FOS) listed on the HP Single Point of Connectivity Knowledge
(SPOCK) website ( http://h20272.www2.hp.com/ ) and applying the work-around
information provided in the MITIGATION INFORMATION section below to protect
HP StoreFabric B-series switches from this vulnerability.

  Fabric OS (FOS) v7.3.0b (This version will be available soon and this
bulletin will revised at that time)

  The following focused fix FOS versions are available for the previously
released versions and have been renamed to include an additional hexadecimal
character appended to the FOS version on which it is based:

    FOS v7.2.1c1
    FOS v7.2.0d6
    FOS v7.1.2b1
    FOS v7.1.1c1
    FOS v7.1.0cb
    FOS v7.0.2e1
    FOS v7.0.0d1
    FOS v6.4.3f3
    FOS v6.4.2a3
    FOS v6.2.2f9

MITIGATION INFORMATION

  HP recommends the following steps to reduce the risk of this vulnerability:

    - Place the HP StoreFabric SAN switch and other data center critical
infrastructure behind a firewall to disallow access from the Internet.
    - Change all HP StoreFabric switch default account passwords, including
the root passwords, from the default factory passwords.
    - Examine the list of accounts, including ones on the switch and those
existing on remote authentication servers such as RADIUS, LDAP, and TACAS+,
to ensure only necessary personnel can gain access to HP StoreFabric FOS
switches. Delete guest accounts and temporary accounts created for one-time
usage needs.
    - Utilize FOS password policy management to strengthen the complexity,
age, and history requirements of switch account passwords.
