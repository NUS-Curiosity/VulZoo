Subject: CVE-2014-0372 - SQL Injection in Oracle Demantra

Vulnerability title: SQL Injection in Oracle Demantra
CVE: CVE-2014-0372
Vendor: Oracle
Product: Demantra
Affected version: 12.2.1
Fixed version: 12.2.3
Reported by: Oliver Gruskovnjak

Details:

The Oracle Demantra application is vulnerable to SQL injection.

An attacker with access to the vulnerable pages could manipulate the
queries being sent to the database, potentially enabling them to extract
sensitive information or modify content within the application.

In this particular instance, exploitation was more difficult as the
results of the attack had to inferred based on the pages returned, often
referred to as “blind” SQL Injection.
