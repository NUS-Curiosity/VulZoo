Package        : pidgin
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6485 CVE-2013-6490

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pidgin, a multi-protocol
instant messaging client. In addition to fixing the vulnerabilities,
this revision specific to the oldstable distribution (squeeze),
reduces the supported protocols to: IRC, Jabber/XMPP, Sametime, and
SIMPLE.

Users of other protocols are encouraged to either upgrade to the stable
distribution (wheezy) or to use the version in backports. It must be
noted, however, that the latter is not supported by the Security Team.

For reference, the original description of the vulnerabilities from
DSA-2859-1 is quoted below:

CVE-2013-6485

    Matt Jones discovered a buffer overflow in the parsing of malformed
    HTTP responses.

CVE-2013-6490

    Yves Younan discovered a buffer overflow when parsing SIMPLE
    headers.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.3-1+squeeze4.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.
