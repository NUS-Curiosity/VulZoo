Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6449 CVE-2013-6450
Debian Bug     : 732754 732710

Multiple security issues have been fixed in OpenSSL: The TLS 1.2 support
was susceptible to denial of service and retransmission of DTLS messages
was fixed. In addition this updates disables the insecure Dual_EC_DRBG
algorithm (which was unused anyway, see 
http://marc.info/?l=openssl-announce&m=138747119822324&w=2 for further
information) and no longer uses the RdRand feature available on some
Intel CPUs as a sole source of entropy unless explicitly requested.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
