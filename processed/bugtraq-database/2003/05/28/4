Subject:		OpenServer 5.0.5 OpenServer 5.0.6 : Buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities in Squid
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.9
Issue date: 		2003 May 27
Cross reference:
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	 Vulnerability in Squid related to proxy authentication
	 credentials may allow remote web sites to obtain the user's
	 proxy login and password.

	 FTP proxy in Squid does not compare the IP addresses of
	 control and data connections with the FTP server, which
	 allows remote attackers to bypass firewall rules or spoof FTP
	 server responses.

	 Buffer overflows in Squid allow remote attackers to cause a
	 denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
	 (1) via the MSNT auth helper (msnt_auth) when using denyusers
	 or allowusers files, (2) via the gopher client, or (3) via
	 the FTP server directory listing parser when HTML output is
	 generated.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Binaries
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenServer 5.0.5 		Squid distribution
	OpenServer 5.0.6		Squid distribution


3. Solution

	The proper solution is to install the latest packages.
