[slackware-security]  WU-FTPD Security Advisory (SSA:2003-259-03)

Upgraded WU-FTPD packages are available for Slackware 9.0 and
- -current.  These fix a problem where an attacker could use a
specially crafted filename in conjunction with WU-FTPD's
conversion feature (mostly used to compress files, or produce tar
archives) to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

In addition, a MAIL_ADMIN which has been found to be insecure has
been disabled.

We do not recommend deploying WU-FTPD in situations where security
is required.


Here are the details from the Slackware 9.0 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 23 14:43:10 PDT 2003
pasture/dontuse/wu-ftpd/wu-ftpd-2.6.2-i486-3.tgz:  Fixed a security problem in
  /etc/ftpconversions (CVE-1999-0997).  There's also another hole in wu-ftpd
  which may be triggered if the MAIL_ADMIN feature (notifies the admin of
  anonymous uploads) is used, so MAIL_ADMIN has been disabled in this build.
  Also note that we've moved this from /pasture to /pasture/dontuse, which
  should tell you something.
  (* Security fix *)
