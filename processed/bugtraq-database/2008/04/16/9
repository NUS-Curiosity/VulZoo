Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2008 April 16 1600 UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in the Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC)
Appliance that can allow an attacker to obtain the shared secret that
is used between the Cisco Clean Access Server (CAS) and the Cisco Clean
Access Manager (CAM).

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080416-nac.shtml.

|              | prior to 4.1.2         |
+---------------------------------------+

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco NAC Appliance software versions 3.6.4.4 and later in the 3.6.x
train; 4.0.6 and later in the 4.0.x train; and 4.1.2 and later in the
4.1.x train are not vulnerable. No other Cisco products are currently
known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco NAC Appliance solution allows network administrators to
authenticate, authorize, evaluate, and remediate wired, wireless,
and remote users and their machines prior to allowing users onto the
network. The solution identifies whether machines are compliant with
security policies and repairs vulnerabilities before permitting access
to the network.

A vulnerability exists in the Cisco NAC Appliance that can allow an
attacker to obtain the shared secret used by the CAS and the CAM from
error logs that are transmitted over the network. Obtaining this
information could enable an attacker to gain complete control of the CAS
remotely over the network.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsj33976 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2008-1155.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS
at

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.

* NAC Appliance Shared Secret Vulnerability (CSCsj33976)

CVSS Base Score - 10.0
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         Complete
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 8.3
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to
take complete control of the CAS remotely over the network.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Each row of the following software table (below) describes the earliest
possible releases that contain the fix for this vulnerability. These are
shown in the "First Fixed Release" column. A device running a release in
the given train that is earlier than the release in a specific column
(less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable. The
release should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later
version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label).

upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such
as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or fix
is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it is
deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service
contract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale
should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance
Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.
