Synopsis
========

gnome-screensaver allows local users to bypass authentication under
certain configurations.

Background
==========

gnome-screensaver is a screensaver, designed to integrate with the
Gnome desktop, that can replace xscreensaver.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                        /   Vulnerable   /      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver      < 2.20.0-r3       >= 2.20.0-r3

Description
===========

gnome-screensaver incorrectly handles the results of the getpwuid()
function in the file src/setuid.c when using directory servers (like
NIS) during a network outage, a similar issue to GLSA 200705-14.

Impact
======

A local user can crash gnome-xscreensaver by preventing network
connectivity if the system uses a remote directory service for
credentials such as NIS or LDAP, which will unlock the screen.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gnome-screensaver users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver-2.20.0-r3"
