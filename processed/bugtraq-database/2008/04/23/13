Synopsis
========

A design error in Openfire might lead to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Openfire (formerly Wildfire) is a Java implementation of a complete
Jabber server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/openfire       < 3.5.0                            >= 3.5.0

Description
===========

Openfire's connection manager in the file ConnectionManagerImpl.java
cannot handle clients that fail to read messages, and has no limit on
their session's send buffer.

Impact
======

Remote authenticated attackers could trigger large outgoing queues
without reading messages, causing a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Openfire users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/openfire-3.5.0"

References
==========
