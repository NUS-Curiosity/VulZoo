Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in start_kdeinit could possibly allow a local
attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

Background
==========

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like operating systems. start_kdeinit is a wrapper for kdeinit.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  kde-base/kdelibs        < 4.0                        *>= 3.5.8-r4
                                                           *>= 3.5.9-r3
                                                                  > 4.0
                                                                < 3.5.5

Description
===========

Vulnerabilities have been reported in the processing of user-controlled
data by start_kdeinit, which is setuid root by default.

Impact
======

A local attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with root
privileges, cause a Denial of Service or send Unix signals to other
processes, when start_kdeinit is setuid root.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdelibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.5.8-r4"
