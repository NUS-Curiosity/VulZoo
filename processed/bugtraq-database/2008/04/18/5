Synopsis
========

PHP Toolkit does not quote parameters, allowing for PHP source code
disclosure on Apache, and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

PHP Toolkit is a utility to manage parallel installations of PHP within
Gentoo. It is executed by the PHP ebuilds at setup.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/php-toolkit       < 1.0.1                      >= 1.0.1

Description
===========

Toni Arnold, David Sveningsson, Michal Bartoszkiewicz, and Joseph
reported that php-select does not quote parameters passed to the "tr"
command, which could convert the "-D PHP5" argument in the
"APACHE2_OPTS" setting in the file /etc/conf.d/apache2 to lower case.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a system administrator to run "emerge php" or
call "php-select -t apache2 php5" directly in a directory containing a
lower case single-character named file, which would prevent Apache from
loading mod_php and thereby disclose PHP source code and cause a Denial
of Service.

Workaround
==========

Do not run "emerge" or "php-select" from a working directory which
contains a lower case single-character named file.

Resolution
==========

All PHP Toolkit users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/php-toolkit-1.0.1"
