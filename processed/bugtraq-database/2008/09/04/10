Subject: Atheros Vendor Specific Information Element Overflow

Title:
------
* Atheros Vendor Specific Information Element Overflow

Summary:
--------
* The wireless drivers in some Wi-Fi access points (such as the
ATHEROS-based Linksys WRT350N) do not correctly parse the Atheros vendor
specific information element included in association requests. This
information element is used by wireless devices to advertise Atheros
specific capabilities.

Assigned CVE:
-------------
* CVE-2007-5474

Details:
--------
* The bug can be triggered by a malicious association request sent to
the wireless access point where one of the information elements must be
an Atheros information element with an inappropriate length (typically
too long). This can be achieved only after a successful 802.11
authentication (in "Open" or "Shared" mode according to the
configuration of the wireless access point).

Attack Impact:
--------------
* Denial-of-service (reboot or hang-up) and possibly remote arbitrary
code execution

Attack Vector:
--------------
* Unauthenticated wireless device

Timeline:
---------
* 2007-10-22 - Vulnerability reported to Linksys
* 2007-10-23 - Full details sent to Linksys
* 2008-09-04 - Public disclosure

Affected Products:
------------------
* Linksys WRT350N (firmware v2.00.17) with Atheros AR5416-AC1E chipset

Vulnerable Devices:
-------------------
* As it is a wireless driver specific issue, the wireless vendor should
use the latest chipset wireless driver for their access point firmwares.
This security vulnerability was reported to Linksys, updated firmwares
should be available on their web site. Any other wireless device relying
on this vulnerable wireless driver is likely to be vulnerable.
