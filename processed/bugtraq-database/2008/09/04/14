Description

A fuzzing test showed weakness in the chm parser of clamav, which can possibly 
be exploited.
The clamav team has disabled the chm module in older versions though freshclam 
updates and has released 0.94 with a fixed parser.

The clamav team has not mentioned this issue in the release notes of 0.94, 
which is very bad security behaviour.
