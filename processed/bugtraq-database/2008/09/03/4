4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Novell iPrint 
Client, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the
"IppCreateServerRef()" function in nipplib.dll. This can be exploited 
to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by passing an overly long, 
specially crafted string as argument to either "GetPrinterURLList()",
"GetPrinterURLList2()", or "GetFileList2()" as provided by the
Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx).

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Update to version 4.38 or 5.08.
