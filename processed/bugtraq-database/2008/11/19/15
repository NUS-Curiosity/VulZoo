 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2008:232
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : dovecot
 Date    : November 19, 2008
 Affected: 2009.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 The ACL plugin in dovecot prior to version 1.1.4 treated negative
 access rights as though they were positive access rights, which allowed
 attackers to bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2008-4577).
 
 The ACL plugin in dovecot prior to version 1.1.6 allowed attackers to
 bypass intended access restrictions by using the 'k' right to create
 unauthorized 'parent/child/child' mailboxes (CVE-2008-4578).
 
 In addition, two bugs were discovered in the dovecot package shipped
 with Mandriva Linux 2009.0. The default permissions on the dovecot.conf
 configuration file were too restrictive, which prevents the use of
 dovecot's 'deliver' command as a non-root user. Secondly, dovecot
 should not start until after ntpd, if ntpd is active, because if ntpd
 corrects the time backwards while dovecot is running, dovecot will
 quit automatically, with the log message 'Time just moved backwards
 by X seconds. This might cause a lot of problems, so I'll just kill
 myself now.' The update resolves both these problems. The default
 permissions on dovecot.conf now allow the 'deliver' command to read the
 file. Note that if you edited dovecot.conf at all prior to installing
 the update, the new permissions may not be applied. If you find the
 'deliver' command still does not work following the update, please
 run these commands as root:
 
  # chmod 0640 /etc/dovecot.conf
  # chown root:mail /etc/dovecot.conf
 
 Dovecot's initialization script now configures it to start after the
 ntpd service, to ensure ntpd resetting the clock does not interfere
 with Dovecot operation.
 
 This package corrects the above-noted bugs and security issues by
 upgrading to the latest dovecot 1.1.6, which also provides additional
 bug fixes.
