4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Streamripper,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.

1) A boundary error exists within http_parse_sc_header() in lib/http.c
when parsing an overly long HTTP header starting with "Zwitterion v".

2) A boundary error exists within http_get_pls() in lib/http.c when 
parsing a specially crafted pls playlist containing an overly long 
entry.

3) A boundary error exists within http_get_m3u() in lib/http.c when 
parsing a specially crafted m3u playlist containing an overly long 
"File" entry.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but 
requires that a user is tricked into connecting to a malicious server.

Patches should be available shortly.
