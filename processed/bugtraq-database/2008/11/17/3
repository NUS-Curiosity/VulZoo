Synopsis
========

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including buffer and integer
overflows which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/php     < 5.2.6-r6                           >= 5.2.6-r6

Description
===========

Several vulnerabilitites were found in PHP:

* PHP ships a vulnerable version of the PCRE library which allows for
  the circumvention of security restrictions or even for remote code
  execution in case of an application which accepts user-supplied
  regular expressions (CVE-2008-0674).

* Multiple crash issues in several PHP functions have been
  discovered.

* Ryan Permeh reported that the init_request_info() function in
  sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c does not properly consider operator precedence
  when calculating the length of PATH_TRANSLATED (CVE-2008-0599).

* An off-by-one error in the metaphone() function may lead to memory
  corruption.

* Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason Research reported an
  integer overflow, which is triggerable using printf() and related
  functions (CVE-2008-1384).

* Andrei Nigmatulin reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
  FastCGI SAPI, which has unknown attack vectors (CVE-2008-2050).

* Stefan Esser reported that PHP does not correctly handle multibyte
  characters inside the escapeshellcmd() function, which is used to
  sanitize user input before its usage in shell commands
  (CVE-2008-2051).

* Stefan Esser reported that a short-coming in PHP's algorithm of
  seeding the random number generator might allow for predictible
  random numbers (CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108).

* The IMAP extension in PHP uses obsolete c-client API calls making
  it vulnerable to buffer overflows as no bounds checking can be done
  (CVE-2008-2829).

* Tavis Ormandy reported a heap-based buffer overflow in
  pcre_compile.c in the PCRE version shipped by PHP when processing
  user-supplied regular expressions (CVE-2008-2371).

* CzechSec reported that specially crafted font files can lead to an
  overflow in the imageloadfont() function in ext/gd/gd.c, which is
  part of the GD extension (CVE-2008-3658).

* Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason Research reported that a
  design error in PHP's stream wrappers allows to circumvent safe_mode
  checks in several filesystem-related PHP functions (CVE-2008-2665,
  CVE-2008-2666).

* Laurent Gaffie discovered a buffer overflow in the internal
  memnstr() function, which is used by the PHP function explode()
  (CVE-2008-3659).

* An error in the FastCGI SAPI when processing a request with
  multiple dots preceding the extension (CVE-2008-3660).

Impact
======

These vulnerabilities might allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code, to cause a Denial of Service, to circumvent security
restrictions, to disclose information, and to manipulate files.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.6-r6"
