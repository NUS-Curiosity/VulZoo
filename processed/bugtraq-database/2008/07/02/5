4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in VLC Media Player, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow error within 
the "Open()" function in modules/demux/wav.c. This can be exploited to
cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted WAV file 
having an overly large "fmt" chunk.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 0.8.6i, which should be available soon.

Do not open untrusted WAV files.
