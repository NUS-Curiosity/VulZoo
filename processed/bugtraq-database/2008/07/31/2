Subject: [oCERT-2008-009] libxslt heap overflow


2008/07/31 #2008-009 libxslt heap overflow

Description:

The libexslt library bundled with libxslt is affected by a heap-based buffer
overflow which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is present in the rc4 encryption/decryption functions. An
arbitrary length string, passed as an argument in the XSL input, is
incorrectly copied over a padding variable which is previously allocated with
a fixed size of 128bit (RC4_KEY_LENGTH).

Aside from the heap overflow other bugs affect the code, the length of the
plaintext string argument is used for computing the key length rather than
the actual key and the zero-padding of the key is incorrectly computed.

A simple XML file with excessively long input can be crafted for triggering
the heap overflow.

The following patch fixes the issue:

Affected version:

libxslt >= 1.1.8, <= 1.1.24

Fixed version:

libxslt, N/A
