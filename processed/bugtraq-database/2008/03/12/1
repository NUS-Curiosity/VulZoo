I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Excel is the spreadsheet application that is included with
Microsoft Corp's Office productivity software suite. More information
is available at the following website.

http://office.microsoft.com/excel/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Excel spreadsheet application allows attackers to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the user who started Excel.

The vulnerability exists in the handling of DVAL records in BIFF8 format
spreadsheet files. When certain fields are set to invalid values, heap
corruption occurs.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the user who started Excel. Exploitation requires that attackers
persuade users to open a maliciously crafted file in Excel.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Microsoft
Excel 2003 and Excel 2007. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling support for legacy binary file formats in the registry will
prevent exploitation of this issue. However, this workaround is not
available for all versions of Microsoft Excel.
