    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1270

Description:
    Previous versions of the lighttpd package are vulnerable to multiple
    Information Exposures, the most serious of which may allow a remote
    attacker to read arbitrary files.
    
    lighttpd is not installed by default on rPath Linux systems, and no
    default configuration file is provided; only systems customized to
    include and configure lighttpd are vulnerable.
