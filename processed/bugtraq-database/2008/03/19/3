   | Description | Due to the way that manager IDs are calculated, this     |
   |             | 32-bit integer is likely to have a much larger than      |
   |             | average number of 1s, which greatly reduces the number   |
   |             | of guesses an attacker would have to make to             |
   |             | successfully predict the manager ID, which is used       |
   |             | across multiple HTTP queries to hold manager state.      |
   |             |                                                          |
   |             | "The issue is the generation of session ids in the       |

   |             | "The crux of the problem is that under Glibc, the        |

   |             | and random() is shared. rand() is just an alias to       |
   |             | random(). This means                                     |

   | Resolution | To mitigate this attack, the two values are now XORed     |
   |            | together. This will increase the entropy to approximately |
   |            | 2^21, which is far more difficult to predict, especially  |
   |            | given that the random number generator is used for other  |
   |            | purposes in Asterisk, not just manager HTTP session ID    |
   |            | generation.                                               |

   |            | Upgrade to SVN revision 104704 or greater, or upgrade to  |
   |            | one of the releases below. That the random number         |
   |            | generator is used for other things makes this attack      |
   |            | extremely difficult and unlikely, so we will not produce  |
   |            | a separate release for this security advisory.            |
