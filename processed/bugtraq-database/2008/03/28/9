Impact: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service or execute

control are vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition that can 
allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or execute

Unicenter Desktop Management Bundle, Unicenter Asset Management,

      directory.
   2. Right click on the file and select Properties.
   3. Select the Version tab.
   4. If the file version is earlier than indicated in the below

prevent the GUI from functioning correctly. Refer to Microsoft KB 
article 240797 <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797> for
