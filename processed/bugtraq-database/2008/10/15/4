-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows running the Message
Queuing service (mqsvc.exe).  User interaction is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of an RPC request to the Message
Queing Service (mqsvc.exe).  By sending a specially crafted RPC request
a heap calculation can be controlled and later overflowed during an
unchecked string copy operation.  By sending a similar request memory
can be disclosed to the attacker.  Exploitation of the heap overflow
leads to full access of the affected system under the SYSTEM context.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
