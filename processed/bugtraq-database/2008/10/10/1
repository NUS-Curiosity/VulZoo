Title: CA ARCserve Backup Multiple Vulnerabilities


CA Advisory Date: 2008-10-09


Reported By:

Impact: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service or 
possibly execute arbitrary code.


Summary: CA ARCserve Backup contains multiple vulnerabilities that 
can allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or 
possibly execute arbitrary code. CA has issued patches to address 
the vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability, CVE-2008-4397, 
occurs due to insufficient validation of certain RPC call 
parameters by the message engine service. An attacker can exploit 
a directory traversal vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands. 
The second vulnerability, CVE-2008-4398, occurs due to 
insufficient validation by the tape engine service. An attacker 
can make a request that will crash the service. The third 
vulnerability, CVE-2008-4399, occurs due to insufficient 
validation by the database engine service. An attacker can make a 
request that will crash the service. The fourth vulnerability, 
CVE-2008-4400, occurs due to insufficient validation of 
authentication credentials. An attacker can make a request that 
will crash multiple services. Note that these issues only affect 
the base product.
