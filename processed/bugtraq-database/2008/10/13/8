Subject: Marvell Driver Malformed Association Request Vulnerability

Title:
------
* Marvell Driver Malformed Association Request Vulnerability

Summary:
--------
* The wireless drivers in some Wi-Fi access points (such as the
MARVELL-based Linksys WAP4400N) do not correctly parse some malformed
802.11 frames.

Assigned CVE:
-------------
* CVE-2008-4441

Details:
--------
* The bug can be triggered thanks to a malformed association request
which is typically too short (truncated). Any association request sent
in the air by the attacker will be parsed by the access point wireless
driver and thus may trigger some implementation bugs. This bug is only
triggerable when the access point is in WEP mode and if the association
request contains the WEP flag.

Attack Impact:
--------------
* Denial-of-service (reboot or hang-up) and possibly remote arbitrary
code execution

Attack Vector:
--------------
* Unauthenticated wireless device

Timeline:
---------
* 2008-05-26 - Vulnerability reported to Linksys
* 2008-05-26 - Full details sent to Linksys
* 2008-10-13 - Public disclosure

Affected Products:
------------------
* Linksys WAP4400N (firmware v1.2.14) with MARVELL 88W8361P-BEM1 chipset

Vulnerable Devices:
-------------------
* As it is a wireless driver specific issue, the wireless vendor should
use the latest chipset wireless driver for their access point firmwares.
This security vulnerability was reported to Linksys, updated firmwares
(such as the 1.2.17 firmware) should be available on their web site. Any
other wireless device relying on this vulnerable wireless driver is
likely to be vulnerable.
