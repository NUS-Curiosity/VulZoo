3. Problem Description

 a. Updated ESX Service Console package libxml2

    A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 processes
    certain content. If an application that is linked against
    libxml2 processes malformed XML content, the XML content might
    cause the application to stop responding.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-3281 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

 b. Updated ESX Service Console package ucd-snmp

    A flaw was found in the way ucd-snmp checks an SNMPv3 packet's
    Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code. An attacker could use
    this flaw to spoof an authenticated SNMPv3 packet.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-0960 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch
    =============  ========  =======  =================

    * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 c. Updated third party library libtiff

    Multiple uses of uninitialized values were discovered in libtiff's
    Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm decoder. An attacker
    could create a carefully crafted LZW-encoded TIFF file that would
    cause an application linked with libtiff to crash or, possibly,
    execute arbitrary code.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-2327 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.
