4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Adobe 
PageMaker, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors when processing 
certain structures in a .PMD file. These can be exploited to cause 
stack-based and heap-based buffer overflows via e.g. a .PMD file with 
a specially crafted font structure.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

The vendor will be releasing a fix for the stack-based buffer overflow
shortly and is working on a fix for the heap-based buffer overflow.

Do not open untrusted .PMD files.
