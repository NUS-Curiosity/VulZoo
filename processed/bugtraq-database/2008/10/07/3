Subject: Firefox Privacy Broken If Used to Open Web Page File

Brief from my Twitter:

  The effect is exposing any location, incl your browsing 
history(about:cache etc)   04:54 AM October 05, 2008  from web
    
Workaround: Do not use Firefox to open HTM/HTML - not from RAR package, 
not from remote Windows share folder, not from local, etc. 04:36 AM 
October 05, 2008 from web

Some details from my blog:

* Also works on Firefox 3.0.3
* Also works on Firefox 3.0.2

line and only fixed in that perspective.
