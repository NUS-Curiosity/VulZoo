3. Problem Description

 I Security Issues

  a. Setting ActiveX killbit

      Starting from this release, VMware has set the killbit on its
      ActiveX controls. Setting the killbit ensures that ActiveX
      controls cannot run in Internet Explorer (IE), and avoids
      security issues involving ActiveX controls in IE. See the
      Microsoft KB article 240797 and the related references on this
      topic.

      Security vulnerabilities have been reported for ActiveX controls
      provided by VMware when run in IE. Under specific circumstances,
      exploitation of these ActiveX controls might result in denial-of-
      service or can allow running of arbitrary code when the user
      browses a malicious Web site or opens a malicious file in IE
      browser. An attempt to run unsafe ActiveX controls in IE might
      result in pop-up windows warning the user.

      Note: IE can be configured to run unsafe ActiveX controls without
            prompting.  VMware recommends that you retain the default
            settings in IE, which prompts when unsafe actions are
            requested.

      Earlier, VMware had issued knowledge base articles, KB 5965318 and
      KB 9078920 on security issues with ActiveX controls. To avoid
      malicious scripts that exploit ActiveX controls, do not enable
      unsafe ActiveX objects in your browser settings. As a best
      practice, do not browse untrusted Web sites as an administrator
      and do not click OK or Yes if prompted by IE to allow certain
      actions.

      VMware would like to thank Julien Bachmann, Shennan Wang, Shinnai,
      and Michal Bucko for reporting these issues to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the names CVE-2008-3691, CVE-2008-3692,
      CVE-2008-3693, CVE-2008-3694, CVE-2008-3695, CVE-2007-5438, and
      CVE-2008-3696 to the security issues with VMware ActiveX controls.

  b. VMware ISAPI Extension Denial of Service

      The Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) is
      an API that extends the functionality of Internet Information
      Server (IIS). VMware uses ISAPI extensions in its Server product.

      One of the ISAPI extensions provided by VMware is vulnerable to a
      remote denial of service. By sending a malformed request, IIS
      might shut down. IIS 6.0 restarts automatically. However, IIS 5.0
      does not restart automatically when its Startup Type is set to
      Manual.

      VMware would like to thank the Juniper Networks J-Security
      Security Research Team for reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2008-3697 to this issue.

  c. OpenProcess Local Privilege Escalation on Host System

      This release fixes a privilege escalation vulnerability in host
      systems.  Exploitation of this vulnerability allows users to run
      arbitrary code on the host system with elevated privileges.

      VMware would like to thank Sun Bing from McAfee, Inc. for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)

  d. Update to Freetype

      FreeType 2.3.6 resolves an integer overflow vulnerability and other
      vulnerabilities that can allow malicious users to run arbitrary code
      or might cause a denial-of-service after reading a maliciously
      crafted file. This release updates FreeType to 2.3.7.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.com)
      has assigned the names CVE-2008-1806, CVE-2008-1807, and

   f. VMware Consolidated Backup(VCB) command-line utilities may expose
      sensitive information

      VMware Consolidated Backup command-line utilities accept the user
      password through the -p command-line option. Users logged into the
      service console could gain access to the username and password used
      by VCB command-line utilities when such commands are running.

      This patch resolves this issue by providing an alternative way of
      passing the password used by VCB command-line utilities.

      The following options are recommended for passing the password:

      1. The password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf
      (PASSWORD=xxxxx), and -p is not used in the command line.
      /etc/backuptools.conf file permissions are read/write only
      for root.

      2. No password is specified in /etc/backuptools.conf and the
      -p option is not used in the command line. The user will be
       prompted to enter a password.

      ESX is not affected unless you use VCB.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2008-2101 to this issue.

   g. Third Party Library libpng Updated to 1.2.29

      Several flaws were discovered in the way third party library
      libpng handled various PNG image chunks. An attacker could
      create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way that
      it causes an application linked with libpng to crash when the
      file is manipulated.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue.

 II ESX Service Console rpm updates

   a. update to bind

      This update upgrades the service console rpms for bind-utils and
      bind-lib to version 9.2.4-22.el3.

      Version 9.2.4.-22.el3 addresses the recently discovered
      vulnerability in the BIND software used for Domain Name
      resolution (DNS). VMware doesn't install all the BIND packages
      on ESX Server and is not vulnerable by default to the reported
      vulnerability. Of the BIND packages, VMware only ships bind-util
      and bind-lib in the service console and these components by
      themselves cannot be used to setup a DNS server. Bind-lib and
      bind-util are used in client DNS applications like nsupdate,
      nslookup, etc.

      VMware explicitly discourages installing applications like BIND
      on the service console. In case the customer has installed BIND,
      and the DNS server is configured to support recursive queries,
      their ESX Server system is affected and they should replace BIND
      with a patched version.

      Note: ESX Server will use the DNS server on the network it is
      on, so it is important to patch that DNS server.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2008-1447 to this issue.
