Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.04.08: Solaris snoop SMB Decoding Multiple
 Format String Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 08.04.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 04, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

The snoop command line utility is installed by default on Solaris. It is
used to capture and display network traffic, similar to the widely used
tcpdump program. Server Message Block (SMB), is a network protocol used
for Microsoft Windows file sharing. More information can be found on the
vendor's website at the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple format string vulnerabilities in Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s snoop could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the nobody user.

Multiple format string vulnerabilities exist within the code that parses
and displays SMB traffic. All of the vulnerabilities are present due to
unsanitized user input being passed to printf-style formatting
function. This allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary addresses with
arbitrary data, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the nobody user. In addition, the
attacker has access to the raw socket used by the snoop program. This
allows them to capture any traffic visible to the network interface
used.

Often in client-side vulnerabilities, an attacker only has a single
chance to exploit the vulnerability. However, the snoop utility will
handle any segmentation violations and attempt to continue capturing
network traffic. This gives an attacker multiple opportunities to
exploit a vulnerability, which increases the likelihood of successful
exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in snoop
for Solaris 10 8/07. Other versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for these issues.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Sun Microsystems has addressed these vulnerabilities with the release of
patches for Solaris 8, 9, and 10, as well as OpenSolaris. For more
information, refer to Sun Alert 240101 at the following URL.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2008-0965 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
