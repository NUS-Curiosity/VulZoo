Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.12.08: Microsoft Excel FORMAT Record
 Invalid Array Index Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.12.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 12, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Excel is the spreadsheet application that is included with
Microsoft Corp.'s Office productivity software suite. More information
is available at the following website.

http://office.microsoft.com/excel/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an invalid array indexing vulnerability in
Microsoft Corp.'s Excel could allows attackers to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

This issue exists in the handling of "FORMAT" records within an Excel
spreadsheet (XLS). By crafting a spreadsheet with an out-of-bounds
array index, attackers are able to cause Excel to write a byte to
arbitrary locations in stack memory.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the currently logged-on user. To exploit this vulnerability, the
attacker must persuade a user to open a specially crafted Excel (XLS)
document.

Likely attack vectors include sending the file as an e-mail attachment
or linking to the file on a website. By default, systems with Office
2000 installed will open Office documents, including Excel spreadsheet
files, from websites without prompting the user. This allows attackers
to exploit this vulnerability without user interaction. Later versions
of Office do not open these documents automatically unless the user has
chosen this behavior.

Using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000 can
prevent Office files on web sites from opening automatically. Use of
this tool is highly recommended for users still using Office 2000.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability with Office
2000 SP-3 fully patched as of March 2008. Other versions may also be
affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.
