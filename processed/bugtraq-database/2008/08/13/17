    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3144

Description:
    Previous versions of the python package are vulnerable to multiple
    attacks, the most serious of which may allow an attacker to execute
    arbitrary code.
    
    Additionally, previous versions of the python package on rPath Linux 2
    and rPath Appliance Platform Linux Service 2 did not provide the bsddb
    module.  This has been corrected.
