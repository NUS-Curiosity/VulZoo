Synopsis
========

Adobe Reader is vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code via a crafted
PDF.

Background
==========

Adobe Reader (formerly Adobe Acrobat Reader) is a closed-source PDF
reader.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/acroread     < 8.1.2-r3                      >= 8.1.2-r3

Description
===========

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory reported that
input to an unspecified JavaScript method is not properly validated.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF
document, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-8.1.2-r3"
