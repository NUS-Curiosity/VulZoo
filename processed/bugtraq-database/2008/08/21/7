Description:
    Previous versions of the postfix package are vulnerable to a Privilege
    Escalation attack in which a local attacker may cause incoming mail to
    be appended to an arbitrary file owned by another user (or by root).
    
    In its default configuration, rPath Linux is not vulnerable to this
    attack.
