Synopsis
========

POV-Ray includes a version of libpng that might allow for the execution
of arbitrary code when reading a specially crafted PNG file

Background
==========

POV-Ray is a well known open-source ray tracer.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  media-gfx/povray     < 3.6.1-r4                       >= 3.6.1-r4

Description
===========

POV-Ray uses a statically linked copy of libpng to view and output PNG
files. The version shipped with POV-Ray is vulnerable to CVE-2008-3964,
CVE-2008-1382, CVE-2006-3334, CVE-2006-0481, CVE-2004-0768. A bug in
POV-Ray's build system caused it to load the old version when your
installed copy of libpng was >=media-libs/libpng-1.2.10.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted PNG file as
a texture, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All POV-Ray users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/povray-3.6.1-r4"
