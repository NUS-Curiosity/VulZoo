Synopsis

attacks.

Background

Mgetty is a set of fax and voice modem programs.

Affected packages

    1  net-dialup/mgetty      < 1.1.36-r2                   >= 1.1.36-r2

Description
===========

Dmitry E. Oboukhov reported that the "spooldir" directory in
fax/faxspool.in is created in an insecure manner.

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite
arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
