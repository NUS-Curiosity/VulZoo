Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability in libsamplerate might lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter for
audio.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libsamplerate       < 0.1.4                   >= 0.1.4

Description
===========

Russell O'Connor reported a buffer overflow in src/src_sinc.c related
to low conversion ratios.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to process a
specially crafted audio file possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libsamplerate users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=media-libs/libsamplerate-0.1.4"
