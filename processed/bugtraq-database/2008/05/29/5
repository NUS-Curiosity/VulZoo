Synopsis
========

A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Samba, allowing
for the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Samba is a suite of SMB and CIFS client/server programs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/samba     < 3.0.28a-r1                       >= 3.0.28a-r1

Description
===========

Alin Rad Pop (Secunia Research) reported a vulnerability in Samba
within the receive_smb_raw() function in the file lib/util_sock.c when
parsing SMB packets, possibly leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
via an overly large SMB packet.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could possibly exploit this vulnerability by enticing
a user to connect to a malicious server or by sending specially crafted
packets to an nmbd server configured as a local or domain master
browser, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.28a-r1"
