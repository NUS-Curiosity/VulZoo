Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenOffice.org,
possibly allowing for user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/openoffice           < 2.4.0                  >= 2.4.0
  2  app-office/openoffice-bin       < 2.4.0                  >= 2.4.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

iDefense Labs reported multiple vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org:

* multiple heap-based buffer overflows when parsing the "Attribute"
  and "Font" Description records of Quattro Pro (QPRO) files
  (CVE-2007-5745),

* an integer overflow when parsing the EMR_STRETCHBLT record of an
  EMF file, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-5746),

* an integer underflow when parsing Quattro Pro (QPRO) files,
  resulting in an excessive loop and a stack-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2007-5747),

* and a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing the
  "DocumentSummaryInformation" stream in an OLE file (CVE-2008-0320).

Furthermore, Will Drewry (Google Security) reported vulnerabilities in
the memory management of the International Components for Unicode
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771), which was resolved with GLSA 200803-20.
However, the binary version of OpenOffice.org uses an internal copy of
said library.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.4.0"

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.4.0"
