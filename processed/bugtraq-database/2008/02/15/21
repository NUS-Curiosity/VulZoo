Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Boost, each one possibly
resulting in a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Boost is a set of C++ libraries, including the Boost.Regex library to
process regular expressions.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/boost      < 1.34.1-r2                      >= 1.34.1-r2

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry from the Google Security Team reported a
failed assertion in file regex/v4/perl_matcher_non_recursive.hpp
(CVE-2008-0171) and a NULL pointer dereference in function
get_repeat_type() file basic_regex_creator.hpp (CVE-2008-0172) when
processing regular expressions.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could provide specially crafted regular expressions
to an application using Boost, resulting in a crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Boost users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/boost-1.34.1-r2"
