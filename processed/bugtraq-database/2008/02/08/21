Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package have several vulnerabilities
    resolved in this release.  The most severe could allow local users
    to read or write kernel memeory.
    
    In addition, a bug that caused the kernel Out of Memory handler to
    kill processes on systems with 4 or more GiB of RAM and 2 or more CPUs
    has been fixed.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve these issues.
