Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.04.08: Kaspersky Internet Security
 IOCTL Stack Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.04.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 04, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

aspersky Internet Security Suite is a combination of Kaspersky
anti-virus, anti-spam, and personal firewall in one product. For more
information see the vendor's website at the following URL.

http://www.kaspersky.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow in Kaspersky Lab's
Internet Security could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the kernel.

The kl1.sys kernel driver distributed with Internet Security contains a
stack-based buffer overflow in the handling of IOCTL 0x800520e8. This
issue is caused by a failure to properly perform bounds checks on
user-supplied data that is passed to the swprintf function as a source
buffer. The destination buffer in this case is a 2,000 element
wide-character array. If the source buffer exceeds 2,000 characters, a
buffer overflow will occur leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
within the kernel. An attacker would need local access to a vulnerable
computer to exploit this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

Kasperky Lab's Internet Security version 7.0.1.325 is confirmed to be
vulnerable to this issue. Previous versions are also suspected to be
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is unaware of any workaround for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
