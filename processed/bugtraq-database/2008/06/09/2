Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in Imlib 2 may allow for the execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

Imlib 2 is an advanced replacement library for libraries like libXpm.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/imlib2     < 1.4.0-r1                      >= 1.4.0-r1

Description
===========

Stefan Cornelius (Secunia Research) reported two boundary errors in
Imlib2:

* One of them within the load() function in the file
  src/modules/loaders/loader_pnm.c when processing the header of a PNM
  image file, possibly leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

* The second one within the load() function in the file
  src/modules/loader_xpm.c when processing an XPM image file, possibly
  leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PNM
or XPM image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running the application using Imlib 2.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Imlib 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/imlib2-1.4.0-r1"

==========
