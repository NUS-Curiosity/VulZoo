rPath Security Advisory: 2008-0185-1
Published: 2008-06-05
Products:
    rPath Linux 2

Rating: Minor
Exposure Level Classification:
    Remote Non-deterministic Denial of Service
Updated Versions:
    vsftpd=conary.rpath.com@rpl:2/2.0.6-2-0.1

rPath Issue Tracking System:
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-2562

References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5962

Description:
    Previous versions of the vsftpd package are vulnerable to a Denial
    of Service attack in which remote attackers may be able to trigger
    excessive memory consumption by issuing a large number of commands.
    
    vsftpd is not installed by default on rPath Linux 2 systems, and the
    default vsftpd.conf file provided with vsftpd does not establish a
    vulnerable configuration; therefore only systems customized to include
    and reconfigure vsftpd may be vulnerable.
