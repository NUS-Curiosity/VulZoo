Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in libvorbis might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libvorbis is the reference implementation of the Xiph.org Ogg Vorbis
audio file format. It is used by many applications for playback of Ogg
Vorbis files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libvorbis      < 1.2.1_rc1                >= 1.2.1_rc1

Description
===========

Will Drewry of the Google Security Team reported multiple
vulnerabilities in libvorbis:

* A zero value for "codebook.dim" is not properly handled, leading to
  a crash, infinite loop or triggering an integer overflow
  (CVE-2008-1419).

* An integer overflow in "residue partition value" evaluation might
  lead to a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1420).

* An integer overflow in a certain "quantvals" and "quantlist"
  calculation might lead to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-1423).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a
user to open a specially crafted Ogg Vorbis file or network stream with
an application using libvorbis. This might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user playing the file or a
Denial of Service by a crash or CPU consumption.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libvorbis users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=media-libs/libvorbis-1.2.1_rc1"
