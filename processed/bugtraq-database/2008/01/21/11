Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X.Org X server and
Xfont library, allowing for a local privilege escalation and arbitrary
code execution.

Background
==========

The X Window System is a graphical windowing system based on a
client/server model.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-base/xorg-server     < 1.3.0.0-r4               >= 1.3.0.0-r4
  2  x11-libs/libxfont         < 1.3.1-r1                  >= 1.3.1-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

regenrecht reported multiple vulnerabilities in various X server
extension via iDefense:

* The XFree86-Misc extension does not properly sanitize a parameter
  within a PassMessage request, allowing the modification of a function
  pointer (CVE-2007-5760).

* Multiple functions in the XInput extension do not properly sanitize
  client requests for swapping bytes, leading to corruption of heap
  memory (CVE-2007-6427).

* Integer overflow vulnerabilities in the EVI extension and in the
  MIT-SHM extension can lead to buffer overflows (CVE-2007-6429).

* The TOG-CUP extension does not sanitize an index value in the
  ProcGetReservedColormapEntries() function, leading to arbitrary
  memory access (CVE-2007-6428).

* A buffer overflow was discovered in the Xfont library when
  processing PCF font files (CVE-2008-0006).

* The X server does not enforce restrictions when a user specifies a
  security policy file and attempts to open it (CVE-2007-5958).

Impact
======

Remote attackers could exploit the vulnerability in the Xfont library
by enticing a user to load a specially crafted PCF font file resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the X server, typically root. Local attackers could exploit
this and the vulnerabilities in the X.org extensions to gain elevated
privileges. If the X server allows connections from the network, these
vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. A local attacker could
determine the existence of arbitrary files by exploiting the last
vulnerability or possibly cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

Workarounds for some of the vulnerabilities can be found in the X.Org
security advisory as listed under References.

Resolution
==========

All X.Org X server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.3.0.0-r4"

All X.Org Xfont library users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/libXfont-1.3.1-r1"
