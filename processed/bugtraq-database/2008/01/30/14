Synopsis
========

A Denial of Service vulnerability has been reported in libxml2.

Background
==========

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libxml2      < 2.6.30-r1                    >= 2.6.30-r1

Description
===========

Brad Fitzpatrick reported that the xmlCurrentChar() function does not
properly handle some UTF-8 multibyte encodings.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted XML
document with an application using libxml2, possibly resulting in a
high CPU consumption. Note that this vulnerability could also be
triggered without user interaction by an automated system processing
XML content.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.30-r1"
