Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Xfce might allow user-assisted attackers to
execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Xfce is a GTK+ 2 based desktop environment that allows to run a modern
desktop environment on modest hardware.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  xfce-base/xfce4-panel       < 4.4.2                      >= 4.4.2
  2  xfce-base/libxfcegui4       < 4.4.2                      >= 4.4.2
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Gregory Andersen reported that the Xfce4 panel does not correctly
calculate memory boundaries, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow
in the launcher_update_panel_entry() function (CVE-2007-6531). Daichi
Kawahata reported libxfcegui4 did not copy provided values when
creating "SessionClient" structs, possibly leading to access of freed
memory areas (CVE-2007-6532).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to install a specially crafted
"rc" file to execute arbitrary code via long strings in the "Name" and
"Comment" fields or via unspecified vectors involving the second
vulnerability.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xfce4 panel users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=xfce-base/xfce4-panel-4.4.2"

All libxfcegui4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=xfce-base/libxfcegui4-4.4.2"

Please refer to the Upgrading section of the Xfce Configuration Guide
in case you are upgrading from Xfce 4.2.
