No, CVE-2007-6598 is correct.  Sometimes a CVE number is publicly used
before it has been updated on the public CVE web server, especially
with Linux distros (a couple Debian advisories today currently have
the same issue).  This "race condition" is an artifact of our CVE
reservation and web site processes.  This particular item will be on
the CVE site shortly.

The announcement from Timo Sirainen, the upstream developer, does not
mention nss_ldap :

  http://dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2007-December/000057.html
  http://dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2007-December/000058.html

... so perhaps some clarification is in order.
