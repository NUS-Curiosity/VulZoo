======== &#9790; 0. Overview &#9789; ===============================================

  Release Date:

    02 August 2017

  Revision:

    1.0

  Impact:

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a code injection attack that allows
    an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in a victim's
    browser, leading to steal sensitive information's and/or user
    credentials.

  Severity:

    Medium

  CVSS Score:

    5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

  CVE-ID:

    CVE-2017-1500

  Vendor:

    IBM

  Affected Products:

    IBM Worklight Enterprise Edition
    IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation

  Affected Versions:

    6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.0, 7.1, 8.0

  Product Description:

    Worklight/MobileFirst is IBM's premier mobile application platform.
    On the device client app side, WorkLight/MobileFirst provide a
    framework to wrap around HTML5 web pages and make them into native
    applications.

    This approach is popularized by PhoneGap, and is widely used by
    developers (such as the GMail team at Google) to create cross
    platform mobile applications.

    With this approach, most of the user interface is presented in HTML5
    web pages, and the native framework provides access to device native
    functionalities (e.g., camera and GPS) in the form of JavaScript
    functions that can be called within the HTML5 web pages. 

    On the server side, WorkLight/MobileFirst provides device management
    capabilities including a dashboard to view versions of the
    application installed on different devices.
    It can also manage sending PUSH notification to the devices.

    WorkLight/MobileFirst provides developer tools to create
    applications using their frameworks.

======== &#9790; 1. Detailed Description &#9789; ===================================

  During a Penetration Test to a mobile application it was found a
  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

  The mobile application was written by using an IBM security framework,
  called WorkLight (or better known MobileFirst).

  This vulnerability happens because the framework does not properly
  validate the untrusted input in a GET parameter, present in an
  authorization function exposed by RESTful Web Api.

  In detail the logout functionality return a HTTP 403 Forbidden
  if the value of the "scope" parameter is not defined in the
  "authenticationConfig.xml" and reflect it without a proper
  validation in the response body.

  To exploit the vulnerability simply append the payload to the
  original value present in the GET parameter "scope".
