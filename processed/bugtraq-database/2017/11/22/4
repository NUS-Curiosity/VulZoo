Potential Security Impact: Local: Denial of Service (DoS), Execution of
Arbitrary Code

Source: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Product Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A vulnerability in HPE certain Gen10 Servers, DL20 Gen9, ML30 Gen9 and
certain Apollo servers with Intel Server Platform Service (SPS) v4.0 are
vulnerable to local Denial of Service and execution of arbitrary code.

**Note:** Intel has identified security vulnerabilities which could
potentially place impacted platforms at risk. An issue impacts Intel Server
Platform Service (SPS) v4.0 used in certain HPE servers. The SPS/ME firmware
used in Intels architecture can be compromised with physical access such
that non-authenticated code may be executed in the SPS environment outside of
the visibility of the user and operating system administrator. Intel has
released new revisions of the Intel Server Platform Service (SPS) firmware to
address this vulnerability.
