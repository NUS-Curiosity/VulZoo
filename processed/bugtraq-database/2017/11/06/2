Debian Bug     : 867598 879521

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Irssi, a terminal based
IRC client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2017-10965

    Brian 'geeknik' Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi does
    not properly handle receiving messages with invalid time stamps. A
    malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi
    to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-10966

    Brian 'geeknik' Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi is
    susceptible to a use-after-free flaw triggered while updating the
    internal nick list. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-15227

    Joseph Bisch discovered that while waiting for the channel
    synchronisation, Irssi may incorrectly fail to remove destroyed
    channels from the query list, resulting in use after free conditions
    when updating the state later on. A malicious IRC server can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2017-15228

    Hanno Boeck reported that Irssi does not properly handle installing
    themes with unterminated colour formatting sequences, leading to a
    denial of service if a user is tricked into installing a specially
    crafted theme.

CVE-2017-15721

    Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly handle
    incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages. A malicious IRC server can
    take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2017-15722

    Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly verify Safe
    channel IDs. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2017-15723

    Joseph Bisch reported that Irssi does not properly handle overlong
    nicks or targets resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when
    splitting the message and leading to a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.17-1+deb8u5.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+deb9u3. CVE-2017-10965 and CVE-2017-10966 were already
fixed in an earlier point release.

We recommend that you upgrade your irssi packages.
