CVE-2017-5652 Apache Impala (incubating) Information Disclosure

Severity: High

Versions Affected:
Apache Impala (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0

Description:
During a routine security analysis, it was found that one of the ports
sent data in plaintext even when the cluster was configured to use
TLS. The port in question was used by the StatestoreSubscriber class
which did not use the appropriate secure Thrift transport when TLS was
turned on. It was therefore possible for an adversary, with access to
the network, to eavesdrop on the packets going to and coming from that
port and view the data in plaintext.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply the following mitigation:
 - Upgrade to Apache Impala (incubating) 2.9.0

Credit:
This issue was identified and reported responsibly by the Cloudera
security team.
