Package        : tomcat7
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-5647 CVE-2017-5648

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in tomcat7, a servlet and JSP
engine.

CVE-2017-5647

  Pipelined requests were processed incorrectly, which could result in
  some responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request.

CVE-2017-5648

  Some application listeners calls were issued against the wrong
  objects, allowing untrusted applications running under a
  SecurityManager to bypass that protection mechanism and access or
  modify information associated with other web applications.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.56-3+deb8u10.

For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 7.0.72-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.
