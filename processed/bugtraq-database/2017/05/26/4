**Notes:**  

 * **Temporary Mitigation**: These attacks require network access to execute.
As a general best practice it is recommended that all administrative access
be restricted to trusted user networks exclusively. This applies to the
Policy Manager Admin Web Interface and SSH consoles. This is best
accomplished through a comprehensive network security policy that restricts
administrative access to ClearPass administration interfaces.  
 * Restricting access to the Policy Manager Admin Web Interface can be
accomplished by navigating to `Administration >> Server Manager >> Server
Configuration >> <Server-Name> >> Network >> Restrict Access`and only
allowing non-public or network management networks.  
 
 **Note:** Please contact HPE Aruba Technical Support if any assistance is
needed.
