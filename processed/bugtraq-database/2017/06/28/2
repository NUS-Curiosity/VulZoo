Package        : openvpn
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7479 CVE-2017-7508 CVE-2017-7520 CVE-2017-7521
Debian Bug     : 865480

Several issues were discovered in openvpn, a virtual private network
application.

CVE-2017-7479

    It was discovered that openvpn did not properly handle the
    rollover of packet identifiers. This would allow an authenticated
    remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application
    crash.

CVE-2017-7508

    Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    specific malformed IPv6 packets. This would allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application crash.

CVE-2017-7520

    Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    clients connecting to an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2
    authentication. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a
    denial-of-service via application crash, or potentially leak
    sensitive information like the user's proxy password.

CVE-2017-7521

    Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    some x509 extensions. This would allow a remote attacker to cause
    a denial-of-service via application crash.
