Package        : request-tracker4
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-6127 CVE-2017-5361 CVE-2017-5943 CVE-2017-5944

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an
extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2016-6127

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to a cross-site
    scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker uploads a malicious file with
    a certain content type. Installations which use the
    AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting are unaffected by this
    flaw. The applied fix addresses all existant and future uploaded
    attachments.

CVE-2017-5361

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to timing
    side-channel attacks for user passwords.

CVE-2017-5943

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to an information
    leak of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) verification tokens if a
    user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted URL by an
    attacker.


CVE-2017-5944

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to a remote code
    execution vulnerability in the dashboard subscription interface. A
    privileged attacker can take advantage of this flaw through
    carefully-crafted saved search names to cause unexpected code to be
    executed. The applied fix addresses all existant and future saved
    searches.

Additionally to the above mentioned CVEs, this update workarounds
CVE-2015-7686 in Email::Address which could induce a denial of service
of Request Tracker itself.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3+deb8u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.4.1-3+deb9u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.
