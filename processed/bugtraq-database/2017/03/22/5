Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20170322-iox

Revision: 1.0

For Public Release: 2017 March 22 16:00 GMT

Last Updated: 2017 March 22 16:00 GMT

CVE ID(s): CVE-2017-3853

Summary
=======
A vulnerability in the Data-in-Motion (DMo) process installed with the Cisco IOx application environment could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a stack overflow that could allow remote code execution with root privileges in the virtual instance running on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking in the DMo process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets that are forwarded to the DMo process for evaluation. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
