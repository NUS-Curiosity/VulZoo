Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Cluster Management Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20170317-cmp

Revision: 1.0

For Public Release: 2017 March 17 16:00 GMT

Last Updated: 2017 March 17 16:00 GMT

CVE ID(s): CVE-2017-3881

CVSS Score v(3): 9.8 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======
A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges.

The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors:

 The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and
The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.

Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
