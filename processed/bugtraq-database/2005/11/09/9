AFFECTED APPLICATION OR SERVICE
  Antville
  http://www.antville.org/


AFFECTED VERSION
  Version 1.1
  Possibly versions 1.0 and lower (untested)


BACKGROUND
  Everybody knows XSS.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS
  http://www.cgisecurity.net/articles/xss-faq.shtml


ISSUE
  A XSS vulnerability has been detected in Antville. The
  problem is caused by insufficient input sanitation.

  By making a victim visit a specially crafted URL, it is
  possible to inject client side scripting (such as
  Javascript) and HTML which will be executed/rendered in
  her browser.

  The following URL demonstrates this issue:
    [antville_basepath]/project/<script>alert('XSS');</script>

  This may not be easily exploitable for cookie/session
  stealing attacks due to the IP address lock on the session.


WORKAROUND
  Client: Disable Javascript.
  Server: Prevent access to the Antville installation.


SOLUTIONS
  There does not seem to be a patch available. Our attempts
  to contact the developers were unsuccessful.
