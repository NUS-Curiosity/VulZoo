Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no

Debian Bug     : 328501 335306 335513

Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
phpmyadmin, a set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL over the WWW.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CAN-2005-2869

    Andreas Kerber and Michal Cihar discovered several cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities in the error page and in the cookie
    login.

CVE-2005-3300

    Stefan Esser discovered missing safety checks in grab_globals.php
    that could allow an attacker to induce phpmyadmin to include an
    arbitrary local file.

CVE-2005-3301

    Tobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to inject arbitrary
    HTML or client-side scripting.

The version in the old stable distribution (woody) has probably its
own flaws and is not easily fixable without a full audit and patch
session.  The easier way is to upgrade it from woody to sarge.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.4-pl1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.


Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
