Synopsis
========

Two format string vulnerabilities in libgda may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libgda is the library handling the data abstraction layer in the Gnome
data access architecture (GNOME-DB). It can also be used by non-GNOME
applications to manage data stored in databases or XML files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnome-extra/libgda     < 1.2.2-r1                     >= 1.2.2-r1

Description
===========

Steve Kemp discovered two format string vulnerabilities in the
gda_log_error and gda_log_message functions. Some applications may pass
untrusted input to those functions and be vulnerable.

Impact
======

An attacker could pass malicious input to an application making use of
the vulnerable libgda functions, potentially resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code with the rights of that application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libgda users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/libgda-1.2.2-r1"

References
==========
