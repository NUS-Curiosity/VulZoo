Synopsis
========

chmlib and KchmViewer contain a buffer overflow vulnerability which may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

chmlib is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS and CHM format
files. KchmViewer is a CHM viewer that includes its own copy of the
chmlib library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected

Description
===========

Sven Tantau reported about a buffer overflow vulnerability in chmlib.
The function "_chm_decompress_block()" does not properly perform
boundary checking, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

By convincing a user to open a specially crafted ITSS or CHM file,
using KchmViewer or a program makes use of chmlib, a remote attacker
could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the software.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All chmlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-doc/chmlib-0.37.4"

All KchmViewer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-doc/kchmviewer-1.1"
