Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been identified in GNUMP3d allowing for
limited directory traversal and insecure temporary file creation.

Background
==========

GNUMP3d is a streaming server for MP3s, OGG vorbis files, movies and
other media formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/gnump3d     < 2.9.7-r1                    >= 2.9.7-r1

Description
===========

Ludwig Nussel from SUSE Linux has identified two vulnerabilities in
GNUMP3d. GNUMP3d fails to properly check for the existence of
/tmp/index.lok before writing to the file, allowing for local
unauthorized access to files owned by the user running GNUMP3d. GNUMP3d
also fails to properly validate the "theme" GET variable from CGI
input, allowing for unauthorized file inclusion.

Impact
======

An attacker could overwrite files owned by the user running GNUMP3d by
symlinking /tmp/index.lok to the file targeted for overwrite. An
attacker could also include arbitrary files by traversing up the
directory tree (at most two times, i.e. "../..") with the "theme" GET
variable.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNUMP3d users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/gnump3d-2.9.7-r1"
