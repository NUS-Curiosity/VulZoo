               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated rp-pppoe package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152794
Issue date:        2005-11-14
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2004-0564
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated rp-pppoe package that fixes a security vulnerability is now
available.

The rp-pppoe package is a PPP over Ethernet client (for xDSL support).

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Max Vozeler discovered a vulnerability in pppoe, the PPP over Ethernet
driver from Roaring Penguin. When the program is running setuid root
(which is not the case in a default Red Hat Linux or Fedora Core
installation), an attacker could overwrite any file on the file system.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2004-0564 to this issue.

All users of rp-pppoe should upgrade to this updated package, which
resolves this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
