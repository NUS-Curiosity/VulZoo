Synopsis
========

Two buffer overflows have been discovered in libUil, part of the
OpenMotif toolkit, that can potentially lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenMotif provides a free version of the Motif toolkit for open source
applications. The OpenMotif libraries are included in the AMD64 x86
emulation X libraries, which emulate the x86 (32-bit) architecture on
the AMD64 (64-bit) architecture.

Description
===========

xfocus discovered two potential buffer overflows in the libUil library,
in the diag_issue_diagnostic and open_source_file functions.

Impact
======

Remotely-accessible or SUID applications making use of the affected
functions might be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenMotif users should upgrade to an unaffected version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose x11-libs/openmotif

All AMD64 x86 emulation X libraries users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-xlibs
