 Program Neighborhood Name Heap Corruption Vulnerability


Citrix Program Neighborhood Name Heap Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.16.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=357&type=vulnerabilities
December 16, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Citrix Program Neighborhood is the client used to connect to
applications published on Citrix Metaframe servers.

More information is available from the vendor website:

   http://www.citrix.com

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Citrix, Inc.'s
Program Neighborhood allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to insufficient handling of
corrupt Application Set responses. A heap-based buffer overflow will
occur when the Citrix Program Neighborhood client receives an
Application Set response containing a name value over 286 bytes. The
overflow will trigger an access violation in RtlFreeHeap() with
register control sufficient to write 4 bytes to an arbitrary location
as shown below:

77F52A7B  8B4E 0C     MOV ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+C]
77F52A7E  898D 60FFFFFF  MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-A0],ECX
77F52A84  8901       MOV DWORD PTR DS:[ECX],EAX

Registers:
EAX 41414141
ECX 00004141
ESI 008D5E30 ASCII "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
EIP 77F52A84 ntdll.77F52A84

Crash:
77F52A84  8901       MOV DWORD PTR DS:[ECX],EAX

Remote attackers can send an specially crafted name value to overflow
the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code with user privileges. The overflow is a
trivial heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking
on the 'name' value in Application Set responses. A typical
exploitation scenario would require an attacker to setup a fake Citrix
Server and wait for a Citrix Program Neighborhood client to connect.
Upon receiving the first connecting packets from the client, the server
would send a corrupt UDP packet to the client.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Citrix
Presentation Server Client 9.0. All prior versions are suspected
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is unaware of any effective workarounds at this time.
