1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion

   This kernel update for SUSE Linux 10.0 contains fixes for XEN, various
   security fixes and bug fixes.

   CVE-200n-nnnn numbers refer to Mitre CVE IDs (http://cve.mitre.org/).

   This update includes a more recent snapshot of the upcoming XEN 3.0.
   Many bugs have been fixed. Stability for x86_64 has been improved.
   Stability has been improved for SMP, and now both i586 and x86_64
   kernels are built with SMP support.

   This update contains the following security fixes:

   - CVE-2005-3783: A check in ptrace(2) handling that finds out if
     a process is attaching to itself was incorrect and could be used
     by a local attacker to crash the machine.

   - CVE-2005-3784: A check in reaping of terminating child processes did
     not consider ptrace(2) attached processes and would leave a ptrace
     reference dangling. This could lead to a local user being able to
     crash the machine.

   - CVE-2005-3271: A task leak problem when releasing POSIX timers was
     fixed. This could lead to local users causing a local denial of
     service by exhausting system memory.

   - CVE-2005-3805: A locking problem in POSIX timer handling could
     be used by a local attacker on a SMP system to deadlock the machine.

   - CVE-2005-3181: A problem in the Linux auditing code could lead
     to a memory leak which finally could exhaust system memory of
     a machine.

   - CVE-2005-2973: An infinite loop in the IPv6 UDP loopback handling
     can be easily triggered by a local user and lead to a denial
     of service.

   - CVE-2005-3806: A bug in IPv6 flow label handling code could be used
     by a local attacker to free non-allocated memory and in turn corrupt
     kernel memory and likely crash the machine.

   - CVE-2005-3807: A memory kernel leak in VFS lease handling can
     exhaust the machine memory and so cause a local denial of
     service. This is seen in regular Samba use and could also be
     triggered by local attackers.

   - CVE-2005-3055: Unplugging an user space controlled USB device with
     an URB pending in user space could crash the kernel. This can be
     easily triggered by local attacker.

   - CVE-2005-3180: Fixed incorrect padding in Orinoco wireless driver,
     which could expose kernel data to the air.

   - CVE-2005-3044: Missing sockfd_put() calls in routing_ioctl() leaked
     file handles which in turn could exhaust system memory.

   - CVE-2005-3527: A race condition in do_coredump in signal.c allows
     local users to cause a denial of service (machine hang) by triggering
     a core dump in one thread while another thread has a pending SIGSTOP.

   Additionally the following non security bugs were fixed:
   - Fix NFS cache consistency races which could lead to data corruption and
     crashes.
   - A kernel panic when loading the r8169 module without powermanagment
     was fixed.
   - i386: A race condition in the power management module powernow-k8
     was fixed.
   - Special ELF binaries without DATA and BSS segments could not be loaded
     due to too strict kernel checks.
   - Various bugs in the ALSA sound system were fixed.
   - A problem in IPv6 initialization with IPv6 disabled by policy that could
     leave dangling kernel pointers around was fixed.
   - Added sis 965l support to the sis5513 ide driver.
   - Disabled C2/C3 power management states on all IBM R40e BIOSes.
   - Fixed machine crash when switching the io-scheduler away from CFQ.
   - Call reboot notifiers of power off to switch off certain machines.
   - AMD64: Don't use TSC for time keeping on AMD single socket dual core
     systems.
   - Fixed the "treason uncloaked" kernel messages that were caused by
     a stale pred_flags variable when the TCP snd_wnd changes.
   - USB floppy drive SAMSUNG SFD-321U/EP was detected 8 times.
   - CONFIG_ACPI_HOTKEY is not supportable yet according to Intel, so we
     disabled it.
   - Disable ACPI on machines from before 2001 on all kernels again.
   - USB: always export interface information for modalias.
   - Various iSCSI fixes.
   - Avoid a potential fs corruption on SMP systems.
   - i386: Increased number of CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS to 8.
   - Fixed a data corruption in the MD device driver when the delayed
     recovery is interrupted.
   - ahci: Don't set SActive for non-NCQ commands. This could have left
     the LED burning even for inactivity.
   - ppc: Handle GCC 4 generated relocations for 32bit memory access
     in the module loader.
   - ppc: Removed a special case for ppc to use MAC from prom if CSR is
     corrupt
   - CIFS: Made cifsd (kernel daemon for the CIFS filesystem) suspend
     aware.
   - Fixed ACPI issues on an ASUS L5D.
   - IDE: Worked around power management problems.
   - Disable AMD TLB flush filter on i386/x86-64 (might help 3d drivers)
   - Quiet down capacity reading from IDE CD when no media inserted.
   - ACPI: Worked around undefined ZOO* objects on certain Acer Aspire
     notebooks.
   - ACPI: Fixed Oops on pcc_acpi unloading.
   - ACPI: Fix hang in ACPI device scan on certain HP nx Laptops.
   - Fixed a bug in ACL handling of tmpfs.
   - Fix time going twice as fast problem on ATI Xpress chip sets.

2) Solution or Work-Around

   None, please install the fixed packages.

3) Special Instructions and Notes

     SPECIAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
     =================================
     The following paragraphs guide you through the installation
     process in a step-by-step fashion. The character sequence "****"
     marks the beginning of a new paragraph. In some cases, the steps
     outlined in a particular paragraph may or may not be applicable
     to your situation. Therefore, make sure that you read through
     all of the steps below before attempting any of these
     procedures. All of the commands that need to be executed must be
     run as the superuser 'root'. Each step relies on the steps
     before it to complete successfully.


   **** Step 1: Determine the needed kernel type.

     Use the following command to determine which kind of kernel is
     installed on your system:

       rpm -qf --qf '%{name}\n' /boot/vmlinuz


   **** Step 2: Download the packages for your system.

     Download the kernel RPM package for your distribution with the
     name indicated by Step 1. Starting from SUSE LINUX 9.2, kernel
     modules that are not free were moved to a separate package with
     the suffix '-nongpl' in its name. Download that package as well
     if you rely on hardware that requires non-free drivers, such as
     some ISDN adapters. The list of all kernel RPM packages is
     appended below.

     The kernel-source package does not contain a binary kernel in
     bootable form. Instead, it contains the sources that correspond
     with the binary kernel RPM packages. This package is required to
     build third party add-on modules.


   **** Step 3: Verify authenticity of the packages.

     Verify the authenticity of the kernel RPM package using the
     methods as listed in Section 6 of this SUSE Security
     Announcement.


   **** Step 4: Installing your kernel rpm package.

     Install the rpm package that you have downloaded in Step 2 with
     the command

         rpm -Uhv <FILE>

     replacing <FILE> with the filename of the RPM package
     downloaded.

     Warning: After performing this step, your system may not boot
              unless the following steps have been followed
              completely.


   **** Step 5: Configuring and creating the initrd.

     The initrd is a RAM disk that is loaded into the memory of your
     system together with the kernel boot image by the boot loader.
     The kernel uses the content of this RAM disk to execute commands
     that must be run before the kernel can mount its root file
     system. The initrd is typically used to load hard disk
     controller drivers and file system modules. The variable
     INITRD_MODULES in /etc/sysconfig/kernel determines which kernel
     modules are loaded in the initrd.

     After a new kernel rpm has been installed, the initrd must be
     recreated to include the updated kernel modules. Usually this
     happens automatically when installing the kernel rpm. If
     creating the initrd fails for some reason, manually run the
     command

       /sbin/mkinitrd


   **** Step 6: Update the boot loader, if necessary.

     Depending on your software configuration, you either have the
     LILO or GRUB boot loader installed and initialized on your
     system. Use the command

       grep LOADER_TYPE /etc/sysconfig/bootloader

     to find out which boot loader is configured.

     The GRUB boot loader does not require any further action after a
     new kernel has been installed. You may proceed to the next step
     if you are using GRUB.

     If you use the LILO boot loader, lilo must be run to
     reinitialize the boot sector of the hard disk. Usually this
     happens automatically when installing the kernel RPM. In case
     this step fails, run the command

       /sbin/lilo


     Warning: An improperly installed boot loader will render your
              system unbootable.


   **** Step 7: Reboot.

     If all of the steps above have been successfully completed on
     your system, the new kernel including the kernel modules and the
     initrd are ready to boot. The system needs to be rebooted for
     the changes to be active. Make sure that all steps have been
     completed then reboot using the command

       /sbin/shutdown -r now

     Your system will now shut down and restart with the new kernel.

4) Package Location and Checksums

   The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
   Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
   automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
   Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
   and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
   announcement. Then install the packages using the command

     rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>

   to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
   downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information

  - Announcement authenticity verification:

    SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
    sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
    guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
    security announcements are published with a valid signature.

    To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
    and run the command

      gpg --verify <file>

    replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
    announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:

      gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
      gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@...e.de>"

    where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.

    If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
    import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
    command

      gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
    world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
    and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
    a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
    with.

    There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
    each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:

    1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
    2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement

    1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
       authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command

        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>

       to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
       filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
       contains a valid signature from build@...e.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.

       This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
       RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
       installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
       the end of this announcement.

    2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
       command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command

         md5sum <filename.rpm>

       after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
       Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
       checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@...e.de), the
       checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
       signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
       published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
       respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
       verified.

  - SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
    subscribe:

    suse-security@...e.com
        -   General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
