Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 12.14.05: Trend Micro
 PC-Cillin Internet Security Insecure File Permission Vulnerability



Trend Micro PC-Cillin Internet Security Insecure File Permission 
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.14.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=351&type=vulnerabilities
December 14, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Trend Micro PC-Cillin Internet Security is antivirus protection software
for home and business use. It provides complete protection, detection
and elimination of thousands of computer viruses, worms, and Trojan
Horse programs.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an insecure permission vulnerability in multiple
Trend Micro Inc. products allows attackers to escalate privileges or
disable protection.

The vulnerabilities specifically exist in the default Access Control
List (ACL) settings that are applied during installation. When an
administrator installs an affected Trend Micro product, the default ACL
allows any user to modify the installed files. Due to the fact that some
of the programs run as system services, a user could replace an
installed Trend Micro product file with their own malicious code, and
the code would be executed with system privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows local attackers to escalate privileges to
the system level. It is also possible to use this vulnerability to
simply disable protection by moving all of the executable files so that
they cannot start upon a reboot. Once disabled, the products are no
longer able to provide threat mitigation, thus opening the machine up to
attack.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Trend
Micro PC-Cillin Internet Security 2005 version 12.00 build 1244. It is
suspected that previous versions are also vulnerable. It has been
reported that InterScan VirusWall, InterScan eManager and Office Scan
are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Apply proper Access Control List settings to the directory that the
affected Trend Micro product is installed in. The ACL rules be set so
that no regular users can modify files in the directory.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
