Synopsis
========

CenterICQ is vulnerable to a Denial of Service issue, and also
potentially to the execution of arbitrary code through an included
vulnerable ktools library.

Background
==========

CenterICQ is a text-based instant messaging interface that supports
multiple protocols. It includes the ktools library, which provides
text-mode user interface controls.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/centericq      < 4.21.0-r2                    >= 4.21.0-r2

Description
===========

Gentoo developer Wernfried Haas discovered that when the "Enable
peer-to-peer communications" option is enabled, CenterICQ opens a port
that insufficiently validates whatever is sent to it. Furthermore,
Zone-H Research reported a buffer overflow in the ktools library.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could cause a crash of CenterICQ by sending packets
to the peer-to-peer communications port, and potentially cause the
execution of arbitrary code by enticing a CenterICQ user to edit overly
long contact details.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CenterICQ users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/centericq-4.21.0-r2"
